to the wire, and a game that went back and forth along the way. I, too,
join Senator Pate and the members of this Senate to thank our
Chancellor, our Coach, the entire athletic staff, and also these
players. The players that go in, and not only put their heart out on the

Senator Stein has the floor to debate the motion.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The House only changed two districts and all they did was
move one school board member from one district and another school board
member to the other district. They also changed the election from the
primary to the general. Neither of those changes are problematic. What
remains problematic is this bill. Wake was the only school board
district in the state that hired an outside political consultant to draw
it's maps after the 2010 redistricting. The only one. Drawn to favor
Republicans and yet the Republicans lost. This bill is nothing more than
a political effort to ?? the districts to favor republican candidates
for the school board. You all saw the map and you saw how ridiculously
gerrymandered those districts were. Goes all the way from Bryer Creek
all the way around the county to Garner. We're moving away from compact
districts to something that has no relationship to schools and how
school kids track from elementary to middle school to high school.
Please, if you respect our children's education vote down this motion to
concur.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?

up on the, on the dashboard. It's up. Senator Nesbit you have the floor
to speak to the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President. The amendment it looks technical, but it's
fairly simple. It does two things, one thing is if you recall when we
did the original UI bill we all were sitting here thinking that we would
get it paid off by November 1st of 2015. That we would extinguish the
debt so that our business people would not have to pay an extra year of
penalty. And that was the magic date as I understood it, that's what
staff tells me. I remember we were talking about a date, but I couldn’t
remember what it was. And apparently the November 1st date is when the
feds recalculate as whether you had debt for a period of time that kicks
in the penalty. But we didn't say that in the bill. All we did was go
ahead and do all the changes and hope that, that would happen. Well as a
practical matter when I asked staff whether it happened the answer is
they don't know. It may be extinguished 6 months before that, it may be
extinguished 6 months after that because it all depends on the economy.
And it depends on how, what the employment rate is so that you pay in
more or less based on how many people you got employed. What I'm doing
is putting a provision in that says it's the intent of the general
assembly to extinguish that debt before November the 1st of 2005. That
can be done on or two ways that I know of, and you, I'm sure y'all can
come up with more. It's my understanding and the, and the ?? heartsful
yanking’s at all bill, they actually use the $50,000 tax deduction that,
that we're giving to business and converted that to pay this debt off,
which would get them out earlier. At</p>

&lt;h3&gt;the bill was being passed, the treasurer was out of town, but
I talked with him, I know she had said she did not want to bond the
entire amount ?? it was over 2 billion dollars. But I said if there's an
amount remaining that's less than a half a billion or something like
that do you have a problem bonding that? Some of her staff said no and
she got back down and I talked to her she said I got to see the details
of it but probably that would be ok. You might be able to do it with tax
anticipation notes, they've done that before, where they're anticipating
revenue. So, by putting this intent language in here it would force us,
as a general assembly to look at this in the session before that and
determine what we're going to do with it, because it makes no sense for
our employers to pay this penalty over into another year. That money
just goes to the federal government and once you're locked in , as I
understand it, you pay it for the full 12 months and you can't get loose
from it. By moving it to us, even if you increase the ?? tax or
something to  pay it off it would stay in the state fun and would
benefit our employers. So that's one part of the bill. 2nd part of the
bill moves the effective date for the reduction in payments until
January 1st. And, as you know, come July the 1st, if we don't do that,
75,000 people are going to lose their benefits.  We anticipate 780
million dollars will not come to this state that otherwise would. 780
million dollars and the disproportionately it will go to these rural
areas where the unemployment rate is the highest. They're the ones most
likely to have this extended unemployment. You're going to lose 70,000
July the 1st you can lose 170,000 total people coming on that get into
extended benefits. The benefits of federal level end on January 1st so
we would be ending when they end it. It's my understanding that we are
the only state in the nation rejecting this benefit. Every other state
in the nation accepted this benefit except us. Once again, it's 100%
federal money and by putting the provision in that says that we will
terminate this debt prior to this date it gives our business people
certainty and it puts us on motives to look and to listen how we want to
do that. And it will be a very minor fix whatever it is and moving this
date then isn't as problematic because they're not going to have to pay
the penalty past that time. It fixes that problem. We've talked down
here about jobs and the economy, etc. We sat here and said no to
Medicaid expansion, 2 billion dollars a year in the economy. We said no
to this. 780 million dollars into these rural areas right now, and they
need it the worst. 500,000 people without health insurance. This will
mean 70,000 people without a job and without unemployment insurance to
help them. I cannot understand what the plan is. If we're not going to
do these kinds of things, how are we ever going to have an economy? If
nobody can buy anything you can't have an economy. And I promise you
this money gets spent when it hits the ground. These people are
desperate, they got nothing else, and it'll be spent in the economy and
it will help us. So I would encourage you, simple, straight forward,
easy to understand, this is a chance to get out of a box that we put
ourselves in and to give business certainty. And it's my understanding
that the business community is beginning to understand the Medicaid
expansion and the fact that if we don't take the Medicaid expansion,
they're going to end up having to pay higher premium space for these
people. And it's just a matter of time until people realize that when
you keep cutting off money that will flow to this state and create jobs,
we're not going to have any jobs. So, I would encourage you to support
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any discussion or debate? Senator Rabin, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I would ask if the minority leader would yield for
questioning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you yield?(/h3&gt;</p>

[Speaker changes.] sir, I'll yield.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Senator Nesbitt. I understood you to say
that this is 100% federal money.  Does that mean the state doesn't hafta
pay it back?
[Speaker changes.] That is correct. This is 100% federal money that is
not charged against us to be paid back.
[Speaker changes.] And the taxpayers of North Carolina don't pay one
cent of this money in any way?
[Speaker changes.] Well, they pay federal taxes so it goes to federal
government but if that money doesn't come back to this state, then our
tax money goes to somebody else.  We're the only state that rejected
this money.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rabin??, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, thank you, Mister President.  I just..I don't
see any way that I can support this amendment and I'll yield to Senator
Rucho.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, sir. To debate this amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rucho has the floor to speak to the
amendment.
[Speaker changes.] I am so thrilled to see Senator Nesbitt is so happy
to help out small businesses but the bottom line is this...this bill has
already been discussed and studied and we have made a decision to move
forward for the economic viability of the unemployment insurance fund.
And, as he eluded to, to 2015, we still expect that to be the deadline,
primarily because of the fact  that we had a very conservative model to
make sure, taking into consideration the rates that we would've paid,
which actually went down this time, based on the federal
calculation...and also the unemployment rate has improved.  So with all
of those and the moving in the right direction, we will be on schedule
to our knowledge.  Secondly, we talked about the issue of doing bonds
and everyone in this Senate knows that those bonds would be at the
expense of the taxpayers, which is something we totally felt was not
fair and not right, and under the circumstances, the businesses who are
obligated to pay for it will pay for it. And so, in that sense,
everything is as we planned.  The viability of the program will be there
and available for any future group that needs unemployment insurance
and, very simply, doing so we should defeat this amendment and just pass
this technical corrections bill.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Mister President, House Bill 743, amendment 2...I
move we do lay upon the table.
[Speaker changes.] Mr. President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Brunstetter, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Second the motion.

upon the table, the bill as amended is back before the body.  Is there

variety of military related plates?? And I had raised some concerns
about fiscal impact. What we've decided to do is focus on particular

official shield.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Hartsell is recognized to
explain the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. President, members of the
Senate, House 597 authorizes a bail bondsman to display an official
shield in the course of his duties.  That is done currently by private
investigators, and otherwise they also have an ID card.  All of this has
been approved by the Department of Insurance.  It's actually a safety
issue for them.  I would commend it to you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator
Bryant, for what purpose do you rise?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  To speak on
the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Bryant has the floor to speak on
the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. President and members of the Senate, I
just wanted to bring to your attention a concern I have about this bill,
and that is the idea of the bail agents having the badges or shields.
We would be the fifth state to allow the bail agents to have badges or
shields.  The majority of states prohibit bail agents from wearing any
badge or shield or uniform, or anything that might imply that they are
related to our state or local law enforcement.  While I definitely
support them being as safe as they can, I also support the role that
they do in terms of other law enforcement agents, knowing who they are.
The major difference between them and a private investigator is that a
bail agent can arrest a criminal defendant or a fugitive, if you will.
They can also enter the residence of the said fugitive, the residence on
their bond, they can forcibly enter the residence of the fugitive.  With
that kind of power, I'm concerned about the folks in our community
confusing them or thinking they are law enforcement, and then either
complying or following instructions or letting them do things that they
really are not authorized to do, because they think they're law
enforcement agents.  I also think, of course, it sets up the opportunity
for impersonation, which I don't know that they would necessarily do,
but it creates that opportunity which doesn't now exist.  And so for
that reason, I would ask that you would vote no on this bill.  I'm very
concerned about the level of discord it may cause.  While it may create
some safety, with law enforcement I think it may create more opportunity
for discord with people in the community if they think they're law
enforcement agents and then find out that they're not, and then they try
to get them to do something that they don't have the authority to do.
So for that reason I ask that you vote no.  Thank you.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  To send forth a rule 29.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  You can send
forward your rule 29, Senator.  We have it.  Is there any further

who's going to handle this on the floor today?  Do we have anybody
handling House Bill 611?  Senator Daniel is recognized.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. President.  This bill deals with the automatic
suspension that students get when they fail a, or when their grade-point
average drops below 2.0 in high school, they have an administrative
suspension to their license.  This just changes the procedures so that
when they restore their grades above 2.0, the license is automatically
restored and the revocation automatically comes off their record and is

House Bill 614 NC agriculture and forestry act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.   Pretty much this bill is basically what it
says. If a farm has been in operation for more than a year and was not a
nuisance at the time of operation again, and someone moves next to the
farm or nearby than the farm cannot be considered a nuisance.
Unfortunately though, if farmers make any changes to their operation
such as crops or technology or ?? or reusability. Any change, they gotta
wait another year before that farm is allocated as a bonafide farm under
our current rules.  This bill will clarify that change and make it that
an operation without starting can make some changes to their operation
and ?? in the bill without starting the one year exemption over again.
It also does not, it also protects a homeowner or landowner that is
living nearby as well. If they’ve been there all their life a new farm
can’t come in and become a nuisance.  So it protects all of rural North
Carolina. And the second part of the bill deals with the attorney fees
being awarded to prevailing defendants.  And Indiana, Texas, Louisiana
and other strong agricultural states have passed this bill very similar
to this one, and I ask that you support it because it will protect all
of North Carolina. Folks living in rural North Carolina. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Allran is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Justice Reinvestment Act requires the court
to place offenders in the Conditional Discharge Program.  Probation. If
all the criteria are met, and that’s basically low-level controlled
substance violations and no prior felony convictions or drug offense
convictions.  This act allows the judge some discretion in agreement
with the DA to find that the person seeking conditional discharge is not
appropriate for the program.  The court can only use factors related to
the offense, and the judge must make a written finding in agreement with
the DA for this determination.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any discussion or debate? Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I would like to speak on the bill.

Senator Goolsby has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate Senator Allran taking the time to speak with me about this
and also Senator McKissick. I did have some significant concerns on this
because I do deal with folks all the time that qualify for conditional
discharge of expungements under 9096 which allows primarily young people
who’ve never had a drug crime before all the way up through felonies to
qualify.  We did a significant modification two years ago that took a
lot, well took most of the discretion away from the prosecutor that went
on probation and allowed folks the ability to gives these that sometimes
I feel like were unfairly denied.  The concern I had about this one and
they did deal with it in Committee, was that only the factors that I
really wanted say this on the floor to make it floor as to make it clear
why I</p>

insurance technical changes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise is
recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
President and members of the Senate. This bill is designed, we’ve had a
lot of changes in health care law and policy over the last few years and
they’ve kind of put our small employer group health insurance plans kind
of, right now kind of out of that compliance, and so this bill is
seeking to adjust those for our small employers so that they can still
be relevant, as well as some changes to nine of the stop-loss plans that
some choose to use for self-insurance. And with that being said Mr.
President, I would move to send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can send forward your amendment, Senator. Clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Hise moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Hise is recognized to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President and members of the Senate, one of the changes under the
Affordable Care Act that I looked at, there’s two that this amendment
deals with, but the first one is that individuals who smoke can be
allowed to be charged premiums up to 50% higher, a 1.5 to 1 ratio, of
those who do not. When looking at that, I spent a lot of time trying to
determine through studies and others what was the actual health care
cost. Not an arbitrary number. You’d be surprised how many studies I
found that actually showed over a lifetime you have lower health
insurance costs, mainly because you die earlier, in that process. But I
did the major study that was done on this was those policies under
eHealthInsurance. It’s about 275,000 policies it looked at. Those chosen
insurers in general charged 14% higher for smokers than for non-smokers.
With that being the market rate, I saw no reason to expand it up to 50%,
so this amendment changes it to a 15% cap on the additional premium
charge to smokers. And also for the stop-loss, it changes the definition
we had at 50 employees. This moves it down to it’s an option for
businesses that would go down to 26 employees. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is

House Bill 937, Amend Various Firearms Laws.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Newton is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. President. I apologize, Dr. Warren trying to distract me
over there.
Colleagues, this is an excellent bill that comes to us. It's an
opportunity for us to further enhance our gun laws here in this state.
This bill does a couple of simple things, and let me be really clear
about this.
The first thing this bill does is it closes loopholes in our background
check system. The second thing it does is it toughens criminal penalties
for felonies that are committed with a gun. The third thing it does is
it improves the reporting on our background system, strengthen it under
the national background system called NICS. In other words, mental
health, and so forth, has to be reported much more quickly by our
system. The third thing it does is it clarifies that Sheriffs must
revoke Concealed Carry Permits when the holder violates, or is convicted
of a crime that would prevent them from having it. That was not clear
before. It also tightens the penalties for violating Concealed Carry
Permit conditions. And most important of all, it enhances the 2nd
Amendment rights of law abiding citizens in this state, and for
Concealed Carry Permit holders by allowing them to carry in places like
most of the other states in this country.
Now, I'll be happy to get into the details of this bill, but it has been
well vetted in the House. It has been well vetted in the J-1 Committee.
And at this time I would like to send forth a technical amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator, you can send forward your amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Newton moves to amend the bill.

Senator Newton is recognized to explain the amendment.

Thank you, Mr. President. This amendment just clarifies, one of the
provisions in the bill was that Clerks of Court and so forth, are, that
have Concealed Carry Permits, like DA's, are allowed to carry their
weapons into the Courthouse and be secured safely in the Courthouse. And
this amendment just clarifies that they don't have to be elected,
because they could be appointed. And that was an oversight on our part.
So I ?? to you.

Blue's. You had said it would allow appointed Clerks of Court, but as I

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  I’m not going to present more statistics
today except one. As you have heard them from me in past debates and
they do not seem to be persuasive no matter how bad they are.  The only
statistic I want to report is that of the 31,904 gun deaths in 2011
38,285 are suicides.  Instead, I’m going to read from a few short
pieces.  The first is from the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court Case, District of
Columbia v. Heller.  You know, the one that everybody loves to put on
their second amendment rights  Quoting Justice Scallia,  Like most
rights, the rights secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.
From ?? to the 19th century cases, commentators and courts routinely
explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon
whatsoever, in any matter whatsoever and for whatever purpose.  Nothing
in our opinion should be taken to cast out a long standing prohibitions
on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill. Or laws
forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools
and government buildings, or laws imposing the, and I left off that ,
some playgrounds, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the
commercial sale of arms. The next quote is from Speaker Tillis. Warning
his GOP troops about overreaching and getting out of step with the
citizens of North Carolina. He says and I quote, a lack of discipline
will lay the groundwork for the Democratic  descendency. And if they
succeed we will only have ourselves to blame. This bill is overreaching
and distinctly out of touch with the citizens from North Carolina, as
the polls show. I want to finish with quotation from ads from the
manufacturer of Bushmaster Firearms, the most popular firearm the United
States.  I wish I could show you these, or show, the ad shows cards
like, membership cards you get when you’re a member of something. And
here’s what they say, written on this description of a mock membership
card. Man card.  This certifies you are a man card holder.  Rights and
privileges.  The bearer  of this card has averted complete humiliation.
Today he is a man. Fully entitled to all the rights and privileges duly
afforded the way ?? before you.  A second picture of a card says, Adam
now is just unmanly.  He avoids contact with tough looking fifth
graders. Man card revoked.  This ad was taken down after the Newtown
Sandy Hook Massacre.  Mr. President I would like to send forth an
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you can send forth your amendment.

The clerk will read.

Senator Kinnaird moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, let’s wait for it to come up here on the dash.
Senator Kinnaird is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Since this bill allows handguns or guns to be carried into
places that serve alcohol. What this amendment would require is that
establishments where firearms are allowed would be required to post a
conspicuous notice to let customers know whether or not firearms are
allowed on this site. I think the public has a right to know whether
guns are allowed where alcohol is served. And this would give the
customer an option to avoid a potentially dangerous situation.  I urge
your support.

Thank you, Mister President. And thank you, Senator Kinnaird, for
pointing out again some of the reasons why we need this legislation.
This amendment that you're offering, as it relates to restaurants, is
opposed by the Restaurant Association. And it actually defeats the
purpose of what this bill does, and so therefore I would urge my
colleagues to oppose it. Already, private property owners have the right
to restrict firearms if they so choose and they can do that and they can
post that firearms are not welcome. So the market can take care of
itself if you don't want to go to a restaurant where there may be guns
present. Senator Kinnarid, I would respectfully suggest that you search
for those restaurants that post that they don't allow firearms on there.
So I would encourage my colleagues to defeat the amendment.

[Speaker Changes] Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Tillman has the floor to speak to the
amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Kinnaird, I do this out of difference to
Senator [??East], who's no longer with us, because I know this is what
he would say. He would say when you tell criminals they cannot do harm,
where the guns are, and where they're not, they'll go shoot somebody
where they're not. And that's what your sign would do. Let 'em guess
where the guns are.
[Speaker Changes] Is there any further discussion or debate?
[Speaker Changes] Mister President.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak a second time on the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Kinnaird has the floor to speak on the
amendment a second time.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mister President. I did speak with the
Restaurant Association, and it's not that they're opposed, it's that
their membership is divided and therefore they could not support it. And
I also want to say that we all know that alcohol and guns don't mix, and
I'm hoping that you will support this so that the public can know that
there is or isn't an allowed use. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak a second time on the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Newton has the floor to speak a second time to
the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mister President. Senator Kinnaird, I felt
like it's important for the listening audience as well as the members of
this body, to remember that the current law in the State of North
Carolina already is that it's against the law to consume alcohol and
possess a firearm. And nothing in this bill changes that, in fact, this
bill strengthens the penalty if you are a concealed carry holder and
you're caught consuming alcohol or with any alcohol in your system. So,
I appreciate your concern. I think everybody in this body would agree
that you shouldn't be drinking and carrying, and the fact of the matter
is that concealed carry permit holders by definition, which is who we
would allow to go in these establishments with concealed weapons,
they've already been through training. And they know that that's the law
and they're not going to expose themself to a criminal penalty and a
revocation of their permit just to imbibe while they're carrying. So, I
encourage my colleagues to defeat the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Any further discussion or debate? Hearing not, the
question before the Senate is the passage of the Senate Committee
Substitute to House Bill 937. I'm sorry, the question before the Senate
is the passage of Amendment 2. All in favor, will vote aye. Opposed will
vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for voting and the Clerk will open
the vote. Eighteen having voted in the affirmative and Senator Tucker,
no; Hartsell, no; Tillman, no...Senator Tucker, back in the chamber
again. Thank you, Senator. Sixteen having voted in the affirmative and
thirty-two in the negative, Amendment 2 fails. The bill as amended is
back before the body. Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] I have an amendment, Mister President.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Cassidy, you can send forward your amendment.
The Clerk will read.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Goolsby moves to amend the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mister President.
[Speaker Changes] So let's wait for that to refresh one second, Senator.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Goolsby is recognized to explain the
amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Members, this amendment provides that a person
convicted of a second felony involving the display or use of a firearm
can be indited as an armed habitual felon and sentenced to a minimum of
ten years...</p>

<p id="095:00">
In jail. It is careful to not take away the DA's ability to use an
enhancement for a fire alarm if that will actually give the criminal
more of a sentence, a longer time in jail. I believe this was originally
written by Senator Daniel and I appreciate his work on that. I would
appreciate your support of it. I will tell you having been a criminal
defense attorney for about 20 years now I've represented people who have
been accused of a number of things. Armed career felons are people who
deserve a special place in jail, but as we talk here about concealed
weapon carriers, in all my time, and this is anecdotal, but I've never
had a concealed weapon carrier charged with any violent crime.
As you all know, to get a concealed weapon you have to submit yourself
to a background check, an intensive background check, training, knowing
the law, learning how to shoot. They are the safest people that we have
in this society. This bill deals with the people who we need to be
worried about. This amendment deals rather with the people we need to be
worried about and that is the people who are out there committing crimes
with guns. We should not fear the armed citizen who's out there
protecting himself, his family and others, they don't commit crime.This
amendment lets us go after the people who brazenly break our laws and
hurt people, and I ask for your support of this amendment. I'll be happy
to try and take any questions you might have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton has the floor to speak to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Colleagues, Senator Goolsby
and I had a conversation about this the other day and this is a great
amendment. This amendment fits with exactly what the purpose of this
bill is, which is to help close loopholes, help strengthen penalties
against criminals with guns, and it certainly fits with enhancing law
abiding citizens second amendment right. It was a good bill and it's a
great amendment and so I commend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Mckissick for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator Goolsby a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have an incarceration note to know what the
impact will be of this amendment. Normally if this was going through
committee there would be an incarceration note where we look at the cost
of this particular provision were it enacted so that we know what its
implications would be. So I was wondering if we had that information
available to us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter what purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I might be of help on that Senator Goolsby if you'd
like me to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know Senator that it went through your J2 committee
so I would hope you could know that it had an incarceration note but
Senator Brunstetter please...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I mean referring to this specific amendment we have
that's coming up now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, it's a bill that cleared your committee, it
was.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]There was an incarceration note and like many of these
increase criminal penalty things that we've seen this year it says yes
on fiscal impact and indeterminate amount, and that's an issue we're
going to be dealing with in the interim because we're not really getting
much helpful information on these incarceration notes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Brunstetter that was my concern. I
just think it's important that we know what impact it will truly have in
terms of our incarceration levels and how long we're going to have to
keep people in jail and what it's gonna cost us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the senate is the passage of amendment three, all in
favor vote aye, opposed vote no, five seconds will be allowed for the
voting, the clerk will record the vote. 48 having voted in the
affirmative and zero in the negative, amendment three is adopted, the
bill as amended is back before the body. Is there any further discussion
or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll yield to Senator Blue and then I can follow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. President, to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue you have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I thank Senator Bryant. I was sitting here
thinking one of y favorite movies is Tombstone and it stars Kurt Russel
and Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, and the lesson that -
anytime it comes on I watch it, I bought it and I just like the movie.
But the one lesson that it learned is that Wyatt Earp got in trouble
with the guys because he had sense enough to know that when you're
packing weapons and you're around alcohol there has to be some control.
So he made people check their firearms at the door before they went into
the saloon. Now maybe that means that 130 years ago or so they were a
lot smarter than we are.</p>

<p id="100:00">
[Speaker changes.]...and the twenty-first century, they were smarter and
the early part...later part of the nineteenth century. When I see...and
I've been at these venues...when I see that we're sayin' you can bring
firearms on college campuses, where hormones are raging with young folk
and they get mad about all kinds of things...when I see that you can
bring firearms to athletic contests...ya'know for a while they stopped
North Carolina State from playing East Carolina because they could
really &quot;get into it&quot; at these football games....several people
were hurt in Charlotte and here at NC State's campus but when I see that
you can bring firearms to Walnut Creek Amphitheatre, places we have here
in Raleigh, you can get 20-25,000 people out there on the lawn and stuff
and I've been there many times and beer flows pretty freely and people
get mad at each other.  It's not just the person who has the firearm
but, if it's around somebody else who might not be as level-headed,
they're gonna grab the first thing that they can to try to even the
fighting field with whoever they're wrestling or fighting with.  When I
see that you can carry firearms in parades and funeral processions...had
a cousin that died in Baltimore several years ago and we were takin' him
to the Veterans' Cemetery to bury him and we met another funeral
procession and my cousin said, &quot;well, you know you can tell that
those are Bloods and Crips&quot; by the way they're actin'...they have
the party buses and all that stuff...these stretched-out cars and he
said &quot;you better to the best you can to turn or get out the way
when you meet them cause everyone of 'em is pretty highly armed&quot;
and I think about this under this bill.  They could have their firearms
and all their weapons in this funeral procession. When I think that
someway or other, that the basic lessons that I learned from Tombstone,
just certainly aren't registering with us and I'm not gonna change
anybody's mind 'bout how they vote on this but I just want you to
reflect a little bit on...on...
[Speaker changes.] Mister President...Mister President...
[Speaker changes.] what we're doing by repeating the same mistakes that
our society has already taken steps to prevent and (Santayana????) said
&quot;he who does not learn the lessons of history is doomed to repeat
its mistakes.&quot;
[Speaker changes.] Senator Brock, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Would Senator Blue yield for a question?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Blue, do you yield?
[Speaker changes.] I yield.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Blue, can you tell the Senate what happened
in/to Morgan ????? younger brother.
[Speaker changes.] He got shot.
[Speaker changes.] Can you tell me what happened to Virgil ???????, the
older brother?
[Speaker changes.] He got shot as well.
[Speaker changes.] Speak to the bill, Mister President.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Brock has the floor to speak to the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Both of them were shot because they were unarmed and
the &quot;bad guys&quot;, the gang was armed. I think you...where your
point, especially with the gangs, the Bloods and the Crips that are
already in violation of the law with their activities.  &quot;Bad
guys&quot; don't pay attention to our statutes. Law-abiding people need
this legislation. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Mister President.
[Speaker changes.] Mister President.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Tillman, Senator Bryant is up next to speak
to the bill so Senator Bryant, you have the floor.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister President, I wanted to ask a
question to Senator Newton.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Newton, do you yield?
[Speaker changes.] Oh yes, I'll yield. (Lsughter.)
[Speaker changes.] Thank you so much, Senator Newton.
[Speaker changes.] To my good friend. Senator Bryant, I'll always yield.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you...thank you.  This is regard to the
confidentiality provisions because we had a separate bill in J2????
that...maybe the...somehow it got caught up in this bill...and
it...was....I have a concern that it appears that there is no way, even
with a judicial order for the public...the press...or, maybe researchers
to get information about concealed-carry permit holders and the
underlying criteria...you know, in order to determine the research
problems or to investigate what may seem to be some mistakes or patterns
or something like that.  I was just concerned...in the bill we had in
J2, you at least could get access to you for legitimate reasons with a
judicial order or something and I noticed that there's no such provision
in this bill...in the version that we had in our committee, there was at
least that opportunity.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Bryant, we can take a look at that
specifically.  The purpose of this bill and the provision of this bill
is to protect the confidential information about permit holders
themselves.  It's...here's not any intent to prevent there being any
kind of statistical data that could be...like how many were given out in
total...and I thought that we had adopted the language that came out of
that...</p>

but I may be mistaken about that
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
is there going to be any objection to third reading or anything else
done on this
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I hope not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
okay. I was concerned that it just seems to completely close out to the
extent that something somewhere may not be going correct. There may be
some crimes and people with these ?? conceal permits and we don't have a
way for either the press, the university health agency, safety agencies
to investigate how many are given out maybe the zip code. Whatever it
would be appropriate data without the persons name and address or zip
codes I don't know what other information they would have. We had
researched that in the committee at the time and I wasn't aware ?? it
all got into J1 its one of those J1 J2 kinda situations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr President this is the language I believe cam directly out of the
house version on the confidentiality part which I thought was the same
language that came out of that bill the purpose of the confidentiality
though is to prevent exactly what has occurred on a number of occasions
where by news organizations and potentially others who may have criminal
intent are trying to get specific information about who has a concealed
weapon permit either to embarrass them or intimidate them or publicize
it. Part of the purpose of having a concealed weapons permit is so that
you are anonymous about and if your publicized in the Charlotte Observer
that you are then that defeats that purpose. It also exposes the person
who has such a permit to perhaps harassment by the folks that don't
really like guns and don't think anybody should have a gun and think
we're all going to put flowers in our hair and and sing and drink
coca-cola. And so the other main reason why we want the confidentiality
is to make sure were not giving information to potential criminals who
may target those people when their not at home hoping to find a gun in
their home and things like that
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
follow up Mr President
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was wondering if you would be really out of shape if I object the
third. We had had an agreement, gotten information from the sheriff's
department what would be convenient for them to report if you could get
everything but the name and address and I would have to then pull up the
details of what they agree could be reported either with a judicial
order or in research. Legitimate research on investigative purposes by
the public so if there was some concern about these permits and who got
them and whether it was appropriate it would at least be some way of
looking at the statistics
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant I'm fine with the way the bill is and certainly you have
the right to object to a third reading and I'll be happy to talk with
you more about it offline or when were done with session but I would
prefer the bill to go forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is the end of the road for the bill correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
if I may. I assume so but with the house we never know
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr President
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook for what purpose do you rise
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
to debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook has the floor to speak to the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to make three points.  My favorite movie was the magnificent
seven and it was about good guys with guns defeating bad guys with guns.
My second point is life is not a movie. Third I don't think any of the
examples that Senator Blue gave us entailed people with concealed carry
permits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr President
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
speak on the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak to the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
the thing that concerns me about this bill is that it allows for the
continued proliferation of fire arms and certainly the concealed fire
arms in this case but you know we already have pretty generous
provisions already dealing with long arms and it deeply concerns me
because I;m not certain that we want to continue down this path. Its a
very slippery slope.  I hear about limiting access to information
relating to pistol permits and things of that sort because somebody
might find out where the guns are and they'll go steal them were I think
any logical thief would probably be very smart to stay away from
property</p>

<p id="110:00">
they thought it was an arsenal and full of firearms. In my mind, that'd
be counterintuitive. But more importantly, why do we want to make it
easier for people to carry these guns? In parades, and in funerals, and
into places that have alcohol. It's counterintuitive to me that we want
to encourage that type of activity. I'm probably one of the few people
in here who has actually stood eye-to-eye with somebody with a firearm
and was shot and survived it and lived to tell about it. And I could
have two reactions coming out of that crisis. I could have been one that
went out and loaded up my car and loaded up my home and got every gun
that I could imaginably come up with. Or I could sit there and rethink
that maybe part of the problem was the proliferation of firearms that
exists. And maybe we should take a more logical, common sense approach
in terms of how we regulate it. I think this bill--in some instance it
has provisions which are good, but on the whole it has language in there
which I find deeply troubling.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To address the last comment, if I may, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you can speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The one thing I'm glad about when I was faced with a person who had a
gun is that I had a gun when I needed one. All of this stuff that we're
talking about right now, I have to comment. I don't know what kind of a
law except banning all guns would make some of the folks who talked
against this bill happy. I will tell you right now that I am a proud
concealed-weapons carrier. Anybody who wants to know, write it down. I
will also tell you that the information in the, my adjudication as a
person qualified to do that is well known to every law enforcement
agency in the country. If I get caught up doing something and they press
that button, it's just like getting caught when I'm in the car speeding.
They know who I am, they know what I've got, and they know all about me,
the data are already there. All this other stuff is just rhetoric to
make people happy. I'm in favor of the bill and the amendment, and
expanding even further, if we could, the ability to carry for honest,
God-fearing people who have gotten their license to do so. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has floor to speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I might say I have a concealed-carry permit, but I don't need the right
to carry a gun into a parade, or to a funeral, or to a place that has
alcohol. There are certain things that we should, as a matter of good
judgment and common sense, not do, even if you do have that permit. And
the last thing we need to do is to put more guns on public university
campuses. I look last Friday, out in California, Santa Monica, and
another tragic shooting. Only we've become so desensitized to it, when
it was reported in the local newspaper here in Raleigh, it wasn't even
on the front page except for a little invitation that said go back to
page four. We get that desensitized to the use of guns and violence, we
need to do something about it in a more profound and significant way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?

Mr. President, would Senator Newton yield to a question?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. This thing has been amended two or three times. I wanted
to see if a couple of, if I understand it, some provisions of this. Are
you making private the issuance of permits to buy guns?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Senator Nesbitt. If you look on page 8, line 33 of the bill, it
states the section--I'm sorry, I just told you the wrong--page 8,
section 13, which, that's the area where it is. And if you look in there
it says that it's not a public record, and it shall make a list of
permit holders, permit information available on request to all state and
local law enforcement agencies. The state Bureau of Investigation shall
make a list of permit holders and information collected by the sheriff
to process an application for a permit and so forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak to the bill.

...the “Charlotte Observer,” wanting to know my opinion of a Bill, I
don’t think it was this one, but a Bill that specifically said that it
was going to make these records private. In the course of that
conversation, and I’m a gun owner and I get permits from time to time
and I told them that it didn’t bother me that that was public
information. I have to go through a check in order to get the permits,
so all that’s handled. In the course of the conversation…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Senator Nesbitt yield for a quick question that may get at what
he’s trying to address?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As I continue to read, Senator Nesbitt, as you go into Section 13, it’s
the, “Confidentiality of records. Provided that the dealer shall make
the records available upon request to all state and local law
enforcement agencies.” I’m reading from page eight starting at line 41
down. So far as the sales, that would be confidential as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right. Thank you, sir. The part I’m speaking to is the records of these
permits. Apparently the, “Charlotte Observer,” had done, or someone
there in Charlotte, had done an analysis. They went and got the gun
permits and apparently these things are good for five years. I knew they
were good for a long time because I’ve used them a couple of years
later. I didn’t realize they were good that long.
They cross-checked that against the list of felons convicted during that
period of time and found a significant number of people who were felons
who had valid gun permits. These things have unintended consequences.
I would say to the members in here, “Don’t always question your
opponent’s point of view. It’s not upon us to say why somebody’s
thinking about something.” There are legitimate concerns that we may be
going too far here and that people will get hurt. I kind of want those
records kept public.
When I did domestic law, I don’t do it anymore, but one of the first
things you do when you get in a threatening situation is tell them to
see if he’s got an outstanding gun permit. Does he have weapons? That’s
part of what you ask to figure out how to secure your client.
It would be handy to be able to get that information if you went to
court to ask a judge to revoke it during the pendency of an action if
there’s been any kind of hostility there. There are reasons these things
are on the books, and it’s not to punish someone or to embarrass
someone. I’m not embarrassed that I’m a gun owner.
A lady asked me, she said, “Well if they know that you’ve got guns,
aren’t they liable to break in and get them?” I said, “No ma’am, all my
guns work.” They’re not going to come where there’s guns. So, I’m not
sure this benefits gun owners, that’s what I’m trying to tell you.
I don’t want…In the area of mental illness, I can tell you I labored in
that field since 2004 up here, there is no good database and record.
Those things happen and people get off their meds and they’re out of
touch with reality and somebody ought to be able to check and find out
what they’re doing. So, that’s one of the provisions.
These members that are trying to tell you about taking weapons to
sporting events, putting weapons in the trunk of your car at school
facilities, that’s what we used to do back in the ‘60s, and if you
needed it you could go out there and get it. It’s not that hard to go
out to your car and get your gun out of the back of the car.
There’s a reason we said, “Don’t do that. Just don’t put them anywhere
within the reach of people who might do harm with them.” So there are
legitimate concerns about this Bill. That’s what I wanted to point out.
The one that I just brought up, I think privatizing these lists,
especially permit lists, where the permit’s good for five years and you
could have a very dangerous person with a gun permit go buy a gun. I
told her, “We’ve got to do something so that we find out what’s
happening before 10, 20 people are shot and we realize that person
should never have had a gun.”

McKissick:	To speak on the bill.
Speaker:	Senator McKissick has the floor to speak.
McKissick:	Of course this is the bill that many of you will recognize as
the repeal of the Racial Justice Act. And in my mind it’s really a sad,
shameful day for North Carolina when we’ve turned out backs on our
commitment to eliminate racial bias and prejudice from the courtroom in
death penalty cases. When the Racial Justice Act was originally approved
by the House and by the Senate, those that supported the death penalty
as well as those that were opposed to the death penalty all came
together. In fact I would say there are probably more who believed in
the death penalty than those that did not, all of whom said that in
these death penalty cases, we want to make sure that when the prosecutor
seeks the death penalty, or when the jury decides to impose it, or when
they are selecting juries in these cases, that it is done free of racial
biases and prejudices.
That was a strong commitment. That’s something we should stand behind.
It’s not something we should retreat from. Since then we’ve had studies
done, exhaustive studies that came back with evidence that clearly
showed that prosecutors in these cases were out there eliminating and
striking African Americans from serving on many of these juries,
particularly those cases where the defendant was black and the victim
was white.
We just need to make certain that our Bill of Rights is respected, that
we have juries of our peers. And the only way to do so is to know that
our prosecutors understand there’s a code of conduct. That can’t go in
there and randomly just strike-strike-strike people based upon their
race. We had judge Gregory Weeks down in Cumberland County preside over
a case for over four weeks. He ended up writing an opinion that was
close to 200 pages. That was really something that should have struck
all of our consciences in terms of the language that he stated.
One of the things he said was the conclusion that he had reached, based
on these four weeks of cases, was that the words and deeds of
prosecutors in these defendants’ cases, and the writings of prosecutors
long buried in case files and brought to light, for the first time the
hearing presented strong, powerful evidence of race-consciousness and
race-based decision making.
If you look at the lists that were produced, the lists that prosecutors
had, they’d write down that somebody was black along with their history
and indicated that they needed to strike them. That’s not getting a jury
of your peers. That’s wrong. That’s not something that we should
embrace. We need to tell our prosecutors. One thing the Racial Justice
Act did is send a strong, effective message to them that we’re not going
to tolerate that in our courtrooms in North Carolina. And the same study
is out there. I’m sure some of you are probably tired of hearing me talk
about this. But what we know is when an African-American is the
defendant in these cases, and the victim is white, that It’s
two-and-a-half to three times more likely that the prosecutor…</p>

<p id="135:00">
...seek the death penalty and juries will impose it. And why the
prosecutors want African-Americans off these juries, because they think
they're going to be light on crime. And somehow they're going to allow
these people to get off. Most African-Americans that I know many of them
have been victims of crimes. They're in neighborhoods frequently where
there's high incidences of crime. They're not going to go in there and
make decisions willy-nilly. They're going to be thoughtful jurors.
They're going to be doing their constitutionally charged
responsibilities and handling it effectively.
When we repeal that bill, we're repealing a bill that sends a message to
prosecutors that they can go back to conducting business as usual. They
no longer have to think about their conducts and the repercussions. We
know the district attorneys have already conducted seminars during the
time the Racial Justice Act was effective that basically indicated ways
and methods that you can get around it. To circumvent it. That's wrong.
That's unconscionable. That's not something we should tolerate.
Send a strong, effective message to them that we won't stand for this.
And I guarantee you that if race was in this country flip-flopped, and
African-Americans were in the majority and whites were in a distinct
minority, and there'd been the history of discrimination throughout the
decades, many of you might feel somewhat differently.
When I sit here today and I think about hearing something on the radio
yesterday about George Wallace. Fifty years ago, he stood in front of
the university doors to stop them from being integrated in Alabama. But
you know what, George Wallace repudiated those views and he moved on.
Strom Thurman held views that he repudiated and he moved on. Heard today
that 50 years ago Medgar Evers was shot. That person who shot him
eventually was held accountable and came to justice.
Why do I point out some of these things? Because I would like to hope
and think that a decade from today or two decades from today, those of
you that are going to vote, go ahead and repeal the Racial Justice Act,
will have to explain it to the next generation. When somebody goes back
and looks through our historical archives as to why we did what we have
done. And I'll hope that you will not want to be in a position where you
have to repudiate your views, or repudiate the position which has been
taken.
I don't expect to change a lot of votes in here today. Don't expect to
change a single one. But I would not be doing the right thing in my mind
if I did not speak these words and bring it to your attention. Since I
was the author of that Racial Justice Act. That was my bill. And to the
extent to which it made changes that were profound and significant and I
think that's something we should look at.
I heard people say, &quot;Well, almost everybody on death row filed a
petition.&quot; The only thing anybody ever had to do was to hear those
cases. Hear them. If the cases were not justified, they deserve to be
dismissed and they should have been dismissed. But if they were valid
and we know that four of those cases were determined to be valid. Let ??
get out of jail. They're serving the rest of their lives in prison
without the possibility of parole. And today, more than ever, we should
be thoughtful about when we impose the death penalty. Five people on
North Carolina's death row since 1999 have been exonerated. Juries got
it wrong.
Our criminal justice system does not always predict and provide the
correct result. The DNA advances and evidence being what it is, there's
hardly a day, a week, or month that passes that somewhere in the news we
don't hear about somebody who was wrongfully incarcerated being freed.
So we should be more careful and thoughtful and reflective in the
imposition of the death penalty. Those of us that came together, those
in favor of the death penalty, those opposed that supported the Racial
Justice Act to purge our courtrooms' bias, racism and prejudices should
be commended on what we did. I regret to the day we will reverse those
efforts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Parmon, for what purpose do you rise?

...began today say that the righteous justice act which we passed in
2009, is an act that will just guarantee that we have fairness in our
court system. I refuse to say justice, because when we refuse to
acknowledge that we have flaws in our court system, that impeach
justice. I can't continue to refer to it as the Criminal Justice System.
I was appalled when we talked about this bill. When we discussed this
bill the last time, before it went to the House, right here, in this
Senate, it was important enough for one of the members of this body to
remind you that the cases had been heard by a minority judge. Such as to
infer that because a minority judge, an African American Judge, heard
those cases, that it wasn't valid.  To me, that is a form of
discrimination. Some [??]letters ask the DA's that exempt jurors when
they have sheets that they put certain comments by, in order to exempt
them from the jury.
I just want to say that like [??] Bo preacher, you may not hear me, you
may not listen to me but I am going to tell you anyway.  Racism in our
criminal justice system is a fact, it has been proven over and over
again.  And today, as we vote, and I know it is going to pass, to allow
injustice in the court system, I just wan't you to know that if you ever
hear of a case where we made a mistake, the blood is on your hands
because you have heard it. And once we do something that we can't undo,
we have to give an account for it.  I would ask you not to concur, but I
know that this is what I wan't you to think of the Baptist preacher who
told you so. Thank you.

[??] Any further discussion. Senator Goolsby...
Mr. President?...
Senator Goolsby for what purpose you rise?
Speaking on the motion.
Senator Goolsby has the floor to speak to the motion.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I have heard two of my fellow Senators, once again confuse the issue in
this matter. The RJA has only been able to be used in cases where we
know that we have a cold-blooded, first degree murderer who attempts to
call the District Attorney, a racist, and him or herself a victim.
The problem that we all have, who have voted the majority on this, and
about who we have voted before, is the way the bill was written.  It
deals with frequency. Not dis-proportionality. Not bias. That is why
Senator Harrington's District Attorney, [??] Mark Fell, has three cases
from the three people he put on death row, Senator McKissick.  All three
white. [??] Block Bell is white. And, because of the way he wrote that
bill, Senator, they actually do have an argument.  Their argument is
that the frequency of the death penalty given to one class, is greater
than that to another.
In fact, [??]Block Bell has only put white men on death row.  That is
why they appealed under your bill that it does not deal with the word
discrimination. Does not deal with racial bias. It deals with frequency.
 That is why virtually everyone on death row has appealed under it.  And
that is why it is has caused a defacto moratorium on the death penalty
in our state.
You mentioned the innocence project, finding [??] a UD2, Senator
McKissick. Finding out when improper evidence has been used. DNA is
wrong.  Those types of things, That actually was started by Republican,
Chief Supreme Court Justice, [??] High Beverly Lake. It has been very
helpful in weeding out cases where they are mistakes.
But to appeal into RJA and to make this frequency argument that holds no
water, you have to be a cold-bloodied, convicted killer. That isn't
claiming at all that I am mistakenly on death row, is that the DA is a
racist. That I am only here because I am a victim. And, you know who I
look to are the families of those victims.  Roy Turner, black [??]
police officer, murdered by a black man, who has been put now, life in
prison, instead of being on death row. I have seen his family [??] in
these pews. I have met them. They are real people. They are African
Americans, and they hurt. Because their killer is not getting the
justice the jury gave him.  Additionally, I have met many times, Yvette
Howell's mother, who is actually a high school friend I know of
Senator...</p>

again. I’m talking about your friend from high school Senator who was
murdered. Murderer was a black man. The victim a black young lady. He’s
appealed under the Racial Justice Act and hopes to get off death row
using it. Folks it is a poorly written law. It does not deal with
racism. All of the things that Senator McKissick talked about we deal
with. I’ve represented over the years many, many people and a large
number of African Americans. And I use bats/g and motions every time I
can in a trial. If there’s any prejudice I feel like’s going on at all I
fight like a mad man to prove that. And to stop the D.A. from taking
people improperly off. Everything we’ve talked about can be argued on
motions for appropriate relief right now. In fact we restate all of
those things in the bill. Motions for appropriate relief. Writs of
Habeas Corpus. Appeals to the North Carolina Supreme Court.
Discretionary review by the North, by the United States Supreme Court.
We have multiple avenues of appeal that work in the innocence
commission. But to write a bill poorly that deals not with what is not
alleged to be dealing with but only with frequency does nothing but
thwart the will of the people of North Carolina. And to this day it is
to have a death penalty. And I ask you to please concur with the motion

Senator McKissick for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak
a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick you have the floor to
speak a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] First/g [UNKNOWN] I just want to
state for purposes of clarity that when it comes to heinous crimes,
those people charged with them, they committed them, they should stand
before the law, stand before the courts and get their judgment. What we
cannot stand for and tolerate it’s racism in our courtrooms. We can’t
stand for prosecutors perking/g African Americans from serving on
juries. We can’t stand for those prosecutors going in there and seeking
the death penalty because, perhaps the African American is the defendant
and the victim is white. Last year, what did we do? Senator Goolsby
brought you a bill. The bill was intended specifically at trying to
revise the Racial Justice Act to do what he thought was appropriate. To
fix it in ways that was supposed to make it effective. What changed
between the time that thous/g fixes and revisions occurred and today was
simply another case that came before Judge Whiggs/g where the outcome
was a decision being made that the person had a valid claim under the
Racial Justice Act. And those persons continue to serve in jail today
without the possibility of parole. As long as our courtrooms are free of
racial bias and prejudice, as long as our juries are making decisions
the right way, as long as jury selection is done the right way, nobody
has a valid claim under the Racial Justice Act. But the best way to
decide whether those so-called dubious claims in fact had merit or not
was to hear them. But our prosecutors didn’t want to hear ‘em. They
deferred hearing them until they could get back here and put enough
pressure to bear to get you to repeal it. And that’s what they did. They
circumvented it. Get the judges to hear them. If the claims were valid
then you got the relief that was requested. If they lack validity then,
you, those, those claims would have been denied under Racial Justice
Act. Very simple. Easy recipe for justice. Not to circumvent the will
and intent of the General Assembly in saying that we want to rid these
prejudices from our courtrooms and from our judicial system in capital
punishment cases. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

we did, was we spoke with doctors, medical doctors who feel the way that
we do about the death penalty, and we got them to go to their medical
board, which they did to say that killing people in the name of the
state, violates their oath to do no harm, to care for all people and to

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate. Senator Bryant for ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President and members of the of the Senate to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Bryant has the floor to speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Senate, I  wanted to just clarify a couple of points. One
is that it is unfortunate to me that we want to engage in a cover-up for
the District Attorneys in this situation who've been shown to have
engaged in explicit racially discriminatory conduct in trying these
death penalty cases, and there's also been evidence that they have
collectively worked together to develop strategies to purge
African-Americans from the jury in contravention of the very case, the
Batson case, that Senator Goolsby is saying he would often use to
protect his defendants, so they have clearly shown an intention to
circumvent the constitutional rights of the African-Americans in this
community and this state. And all citizens in this state. In addition,
it surely is important that these are convicted murderers who are, who
have been given the death penalty, that is ultimately important.
However, in the criminal justice system that we have constitutionally in
this country, as important is that those convictions are done, and the
ultimate penalty is rendered in a situation where the constitutional
rights of all the citizens are respected. And the people who are now
have their sentences commuted to life in prison without parole are not
there because of a poorly written law, and their families do not have
the justice you would want them to have because of that, it's because
they had a District Attorney who used explicitly racial discriminatory
practices in prosecuting the case. That's the only way that the judge
was able to make  findings and that those sentences have been commuted
under this law. And I want to reemphasize too
that it is short-sighted of you as whites, to not want to support racial
justice across the board because whites can also be hurt by racial
discrimination not just African-Americans, Asian, Latinos, and American
Indians; Whites can also be hurt too, and if it is the case that a
District Attorney is prosecuting whites for death who kill whites and
not whites who kill or anyone who kills African-Americans or others for
death, that is also harmful to whites, so racial discrimination hurts
all groups, not just any one group, and it is short-sighted of you not
to want to stand up for racial fairness in this case, and to support the
explicit racial discriminatory behavior of the prosecutors that have
been documented in these cases, and for that reason, I ask you to vote
no to concur.

[Speaker Changes] Senate bill 452, jurisdiction amounts arbitration,
small claims court.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Goolsby is recognized.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President, the changes that the House made is they
changed the district court jurisdictional amount from 20,000 that is
currently up to 25,000. They also limited the attorneys fees to $10,000
maximum in judgements, less than 25000, it was under the 20, it was 10,
so its going to be 10 under the 25. And then, they also gave a time
period of one years where you can file lawsuits in either district or
superior court when the jurisdictional amount ranges between 10,000 and
25000 for confused attorneys, I guess. but I would recommend that you
concur.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Goolsby asks that you concur. Is there any
discussions?
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] Will Senator Goolsby yield for a question?
[Speaker Changes] Senator Goolsby do you yield?
[Speaker Changes] Yes.
[Speaker Changes] I’m sorry, I was listening to your explanation, have
you created a new statute of limitation you say on claims under $25,000.
[Speaker Changes] No sir, the law correctly allows a maximum of
attorneys fees, where a judge awards it. I didn’t realize this until I
read what the House changed, because they had to go in and find this and
change it too. Currently, if you win a case and the judge gives you
attorneys few, they’re limited to $10,000 if you have a $20,000
judgement. They had to change that to $10,000 for a $25,000, thats what
I meant.
[Speaker Changes] Yeah, another question, Mr. President.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Goolsby, do you yield?</p>

<p id="160:00">
[Speaker changes.]...stand that but you said something about a year
within which to...
[Speaker changes.] Oh, yes sir.
[Speaker changes.] bring your clean?????
[Speaker changes.] It's not a statute of limitations action, it's
simply, since we're changing the jurisdictional amount in District
Court, this is Representative Stam's idea...(Laughter.)...that we would
allow...I don't wanna confuse you any more that I already have.  We're
going to allow District Court or Superior Court to be proper
jurisdictional for filings ranging between ten and twenty-five.  Over
twenty-five, it is Superior Court but, between ten and twenty-five, it's
now going to be District or Superior Court for a one year period until
June 30th, next year.
[Speaker changes.] One last question.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Goolsby to you.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you. As I understand it...and realize it's been
a while but it was my understanding that the amounts were allocational
rather than jurisdictional.
[Speaker changes.] Yes...
[Speaker changes.] that is, whatever court you ???? it in, as long as it
was in the general court of justice, if you brought $100,000 case in the
District Court
[Speaker changes.] And I've done that!
[Speaker changes.] And I have.  It was up to the opposing counsel to
try...because by consent, parties quite often will decide to do a case
in the District Court. And so, this one year experiment...does it do
anything at all to the question of allocation.
[Speaker changes.] No.
[Speaker changes.] That is, if you bring a million dollar case in the
District Court, it does nothing on jurisdiction, you just hafta move it
to Superior Court...at some point if the opposing party wants to.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir.  It leaves it the same way except nobody
apparently can force a removal to Superior Court if it's between ten and
twenty-five.  It can be in Superior or District Court for this one year
period. I didn't think it was necessary.  It was somethin' they wanted
to do. I just wanna get the bill passed.  I mean I know it doesn't make
a lot of sense.  I don't see it causing any problems. It just seems a
little bit superfluous. Yes, sir...
[Speaker changes.] Mister ???Anderson???
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] To Senator Goolsby, yield for question.
[Speaker changes.] Senator, do you yield?
[Speaker changes.] Yes.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Goolsby, I'm sure Senator Blue's questions
were valid...important and all that...but let's get to a basic question.
Did you say attorneys or lawyers are getting $20,000 for every case?
[Speaker changes.] Absolutely. We do everyday.  (Laughter.) I'm jokin'.
[Speaker changes.] Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Ask Senator Goolsby a question?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Goolsby, do you yield?
[Speaker changes.] My word, I shoulda just asked ya'll to concur. Yes
sir. (Laughter and applause.)
[Speaker changes.] Probably so.
[Speaker changes.] It seems that now that we are raising up the
jurisdictional limit in District Court...you know, all the way up to
25,000.  I'm not...that doesn't trouble me...I think that's fine.  The
problem is our District Court dockets are likely to be fuller than they
have been in the past because those cases otherwise would have been
going to the Superior Court. So has any thought been given to the
additional work load in terms of volumes of cases that our District
Court judges will now hear.  Cause we have the same number of District
Court judges but the volume/work load of cases has the potential to be
substantially increased so what thought was given to that potential
impact?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir.  We raised the jurisdictional, of course,
amount of small claims from five to ten, which will incur more cases
going down to the magistrates.  We added 39 magistrates in our JPS
budget and we also have this time period over the next year where people
can file either in District or Superior Court for those 10 to 25,000
dollar cases and I can assure you that Senator Newton and I...when we
start seeing an overabundance of cases in JPS oversight, will look to
try to adjust that and to help our District Court judges out but this
is...not much of an experiment...but I think it's...ya'know...all of
this was supported by all the different business groups because I think
it will give people...I mean, my main concern about all this was giving
people more access to courts without lawyers. That is, the $10,000
jurisdiction will now... in small claims...it did make...really we had
it at twenty, the House sent it up to twenty-five... I don't think it's
gonna cause any problems. If it does, we will work hard to address
those.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up, Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Goolsby, do you yield? (Laughter.)
[Speaker changes.] I yield.
[Speaker changes.] I guess my que..and I appreciate you guys looking out
at JPS.  My greatest concern is...it will have an impact and the thing
that gives me some concern about magistrates hearing some of these cases
is that they tend to use laws of equity rather than rules of law.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir.  And we do try to address that with...
[Speaker changes.]
[Speaker changes.]
