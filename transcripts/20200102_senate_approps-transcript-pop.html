Morning Call the Senate Appropriations Committee order please. 
That. 
Morning everyone will like to start by welcoming our pages. If you 
would just raise your hand. Chandler bird Thomas. Nick Breyer 
Cherie Carr via Robert banner. 
Paul Wood Dustin Moore ten. Caitlin 

neighbor will. Babs and Tyler Katz thank you for being here today. 
And thanks to our sergeant at arms are you Cheryl. Charles Marshall's 
Ed Kessler and camel as. 
It. 
Without objection. We're going to make Senator Ford's. 
Manager at the appropriate time. Can we get some staff help with placing these 
documents within the website. 

Yes. 
Or without objection to make three changes to the agenda today. We're still waiting for some of the staff 
presentations. So we're going to bring the two bills that are at the end to the 
beginning of the agenda. Also on the Medicaid differences report on fiscal 
research is still waiting for some information. So we're going to put that report over to tomorrow. 
Thank you. And well go ahead and call Senator Brown. 
And. 

Thank you Madam Chairman. I think your. 
Buddies look at this bill. Probably and insular and three day oh well 
you know we passed our version out of the Senate. All few weeks ago a couple weeks 
ago. This is the House version of the bill in Congress yesterday. One of the 
changes in the bill through the point. And I think I've talked to the 
secretary about the bill as well. That I think it's time we moved this bill all with the 
understanding will probably have to continue working on this bill in the long session. 

So Raul Friday answer any questions. But I just asked for your support to leave 
the bill as it is and I will idea and we'll continue to work it as it 
progresses to the manager. That's fair. And I'd like for the secretary of the 
stake if she is whale. 
And. 
It's a rabbit out of them German would make a motion favorable. 
Report of a discussion 

that's. 
All right. You know we're going to hold that motion for just a moment. allow Secretary doctor. 
To speak. Thank you. Thank you Madam Chair. And I appreciate the opportunity to speak and ask for your 
support as Senator Brown has. To move this bill forward as it has been 
presented. There is no perfect bill. I have discovered in my short tenure here but I 
think this is a strong bill that does what you and I had agreed. We wanted to do which was 
facilitate the movement forward in the creation of a partnership for North Carolina. That 

positions us for better competitiveness. And this is the first step in the process an 
important step and you've got the opportunity now. Right. to approve this so that it might move 
forward in we can make this into law very quickly. So I appreciate your support. I think it's a bill that 
facilitates this. And I'm very. 
Very positive way. Thank you man. Secretary Senator Aden. 
And thank you notes are doing the secretary. Nice to see you 
this morning. There are a number of really a lot in our area 

very much in favor of the soil on the food bill has been brought forward. And. 
The work has been done by from the House and vote for the Braille recall where 
your great great concern to see the New York film portion of the Senate had in 
theirs and been taken out. And oh 
I I can't emphasize that enough. Because that is an industry that if we do not 
support it. And if we don't come up with some money in this budget. 
process we are going to lose it and it's not like a normal 

normal. Bricks and mortar and bring them in on business. This is a 
business that will not survive without what we do. And so I just 
start I want to just make this border and to air that and to make sure that there are. 
As we go to go forward. Those of us that supporting that bill are also 
trying to support the film program in some fashion. 
Thank you. Thank you. Senator Evan. Senator Breaux Browner. 
Center-Right and this is the companion bill coming over from the House of the Senate bill 

that we passed is still over in the house with his the film piece in it. 
So it's still there can be negotiated. 
So laughs. I feel very confident that that will take place. 
Thank you. We had a motion on the floor for a favorable report. All in favor say aye.

Tucker. Also. 
I would like to announce that day. The alchemy documents are available on the committee's website. 

And. Thank you Madam Chairman. 
Of the sort of comments Secretary made. And I I want to let her know that she is now saying 
the perfect bill if it wanted to build seven twenty nine is 
the perfect bill. Several Joe Montana State Center. Richard. I'm 
trying to say something to the sector if you deliver a lot. Sit downs but. 
I was just telling the secretary. This is the perfect bill. She's been wanting to say. So I 
want to pay attention to this but calls. The appropriations 

part of this bill is what is masterful at a higher status in our size that we're going to 
hire twenty five people additional funds for Boehner. And for people for the call. 
Ash commission. And the beautiful thing is when are the energy's going to 
pay for. So I think this is the perfect appropriation. That is the only 
appropriations pork in this bill. I asked for your support. 
of Justin's her comments from committee. So her talent. 
But a lot of work has been done on this video. And I believe both 

sides may not like it just a little bit saw a group of I think therefore it probably is part of 
a move of a ripple. 
And I will hold that notion for just one minute or Robinson. Thank you Madam Chair. And just a 
kind of a question to send their vaca. I thank you 
for the months you've done. 
Better because I think you know a little bit better. And 
then take that kind of praise. 

But the bad guy. 
And I think said it was probably a indicate to we get a letter from North Carolina A and T. and 
got our radar so the work. It's been going for eleven years on coal ash and 
terms of how to you know use the residuals in Alabama. 
And I certainly hope you all as we move forward. That will include them in that 
process. 
Yes ma'am. That is a key part of this deal because you know as we said that's the plain 

reality is we don't have enough when they dispose of all this. We've got to come up with creative 
ways and it will be. Well sure. 
Thank you Sharon. Some further comments or questions from committee. We have a favorite motion for 
federal report on the floor all that they were say I've noticed the bill 
passes. Thank you. Center dot com.

It 

is you can. 
You tell us Karl. Would you please come to the podium.

You're. 
Well she's making her way. Some of those fundamental differences between the House and Senate budgets are related to the 
lottery. Alice Garland of the North Carolina. Education Lottery is here today to explain the 
differences in the lottery revenue estimates in the House and Senate budgets. Later this 

week. Fiscal research and L S E M will provide us with a revised consensus estimate 
of lottery revenues.

The education. Lotteries the sales and marketing organization as search

in this fiscal 
year that ends in a couple of weeks are testimony to the effectiveness of lottery advertising 

and fiscal fourteen. We changed our advertising strategy. And we put more of. 
Our thousand dollars in the current time we conducted our first Tuesday 
campaign and we advertised an entire group of tickets being in lines as opposed to 
focusing on just one second. These changes produced a sixteen percent increase 
in instant ticket sales and product. Which I think really shows what Africa has and 
can do. The House appropriations chairs with very short notice. asked the 
lottery to provide scenarios for increasing the return to education by various dollar 


levels. We provided multiple scenarios all of them based on today's 
advertising conditions. None of the scenarios that we provided. took into 
account additional advertising restrictions you have requested that 
we discuss. Three different scenarios advertising that one half percent 
at one percent and two percent. And the one percent is what we're allowed in our 
statute today. And what the impact on these scenarios would be 
of additional restrictions. on advertising as you review these 

scenarios as we were you did together. Please keep an eye on that. The lottery primarily 
sells gas and convenience stores and we are competing for 
our share of the players' disposable income and other retail products in those 
stores. So our say snacks and beverages. spend anywhere from four to ten percent of 
their sales on advertising. I'd like to turn to the handout 
athlete that you all have. It's a multicolored column. 
And these are the scenarios that we were asked to present. And I just want 
to quickly review the two columns on the right. These are 
both fiscal fifteen. This upcoming fiscal year. Our budgets. 
We provided the Far-Right column in March of thirteen for the bi Union 
budget. And in the second column we revised in April of this year. 
We had more fiscal fourteen sales on which to base a revised a budget. 
And you'll note if you look down at the dark 
green line at the bottom of the. Hour that between March 

thirteen and April are fourteen we increase their projection by about twenty million 
dollars. You have budgeted that twenty million dollars to twenty million dollars is in 
your budget for fiscal fifteen. So if we look at the middle of the 
green column is labeled June. Three twenty 
fourteen fiscal fifteen commission. This is the budget as adopted by the 
Education Lottery Commission. It says that we will 
have sales of one point eight billion. And we will return to education four hundred 

eighty eight million. This is based on having one percent for 
advertising and actually budgeted point nine four percent. We seldom budget the 
full one percent. It includes two new job games 
one in October of this year and one in March of next year. North 
China has a very low number of job games. We have bad games. Most states have eight or more. 
And this will start to bring us. More in line with other state lotteries. The last time that we 
introduced a new drug game was in January of two thousand and ten. So it's been quite a quite a 

while. And that was the mega millions game. And we have total confidence 
in meeting this number if you move to the west to the 
red column. This is what would happen if we only had one half of a 
percent to stand on advertising. All right. And 
looking at a study done by the University of Texas using any kind of metric 
model and I will tell you that some of the study was pretty good- 
it's. Not an every one dollar decrease in advertising leads to a 

twenty dollar and fifty cent decrease in sales. So this is the. 
model that we used it would reduce our sales one hundred eighty six million and 
reduce the return to education by forty five million bringing it to four hundred 
forty four million which really reverts us back to the map that we returned 
to education in the school of eleven. The impact on our efficacy 
in standard would be that we would because we would be spending 
essentially half of what we spend today and it would cut the agency fee 

trend advertising out of High Point as our. Advertising Agency

thought it would cut our production costs. We would not be able to produce as many ads. 
And it would seriously cut the dollars that we have available to make that media 
back. out we would be able to have no digital advertising on the Internet 
and no print advertising. Or media that I think when we're 
buying actual airtime of radio or T.V. would go from twelve point two million to. 
four point nine million for a state-wide 

twelve multi-year campaign that is a very small amount of money. 
It will seriously impact our ability to keep our product. In front of our players. And keep 
in keeping product in front of players is critical to any sales and marketing organization. 
And then the final call on the two percent advertising shows that we could do if 
we had doubled the money. And this is the 
column that we provided to the House 
appropriations chairs and this is the number that you haven't seen. 

The series see in their budget. And this would allow us 
to maintain a very strong consistent player base 
it would bring the total return for fiscal fifteen from the lottery. To fatten 
a ninety four million dollars on almost six hundred million dollars. With this 
additional one percent would allow us to do. First we could place immediate 
outfit to our task. The Powerball. And Mega Millions 
jackpot right now. We rely solely on our billboards and our jackpot. 

Sometimes we don't make any media buys for those jackpots. It will allow 
us to have a monthly media bath for our instant product. That's 
that first Tuesday campaign. We do that. about eight months. We did that about eight months this 
year would allow us to do it. All twelve months. It would allow us to be able to 
advertise. Our in-state draw games become a cash grab. Pick three pick for which we 
don't. Abbott has for the most part right now. It would 
allow us to advertise our core instant games. We have a Two course 

families that are always available. Much more regularly than we do now. 
It would give us sufficient dollars to advertise those two new drug names that I mentioned and that's 
really important. Again from the same University of Texas study and they 
noted that a lottery needs well directed. And well informed advertising efforts on 
new games. Or the games may not realize their full potential. And if we're going to 
energies to new games this year. We absolutely want to meet the full potential of those two new games. 
One other or other changes that we would make and 

our strategies in order to make that one hundred six million dollars. Target 
is we would move that march draw game March. A fifteen draw game that we're planning to 
September fourteenth. Given to six more months of sales in the fiscal year. 
That we didn't actually open a slot where we could add another trial game. In March of fifteen 
giving us four months of sales that we've not built into any budget. 
And it would allow us to at a higher price point game to our instant product. 
So all of this that I've mentioned in terms of what we could do if we had two percent. 

We'd be a much more aggressive approach to end the citizens and are have been 
accustomed to from the lottery. But we believe with this approach that we can hit that one 
one hundred six million increasing our return. The final 
thing that we were asked to talk about was the effect I've passed the one one 
fifty six. The provisions that the House added into the budget that 
wig. And lottery advertising restrictions. I would 
like to start to send to the lottery has operated very responsibly over the last eight years 

we keep our players we look at our players as our customers and we take great 
pride in keeping them informed. We want our players to understand lottery games. We 
want them to know what the odds are for winning and what the prizes are we share that information 
daily on multiple channels advertising marketing communications 
and we have a customer service hotline dedicated to our players. 
That answer questions every day from players about how to play our 
game. So we've worked really hard on that. And I will say that the Arthur of this language wants to 

see the lottery fail and wants to put the lottery. out of business. And that is why are 
those restrictions were put into the house budget. These restrictions would waste lottery 
dollars for making our advertising stance less efficient. No This 
will result in getting a small return for that investment in advertising as a sales 
and marketing organization. We need to use our.

<p id="20:00">

Advertising dollars. Absolutely. As well 
as to it's their best advantage. And that needs to be making efficient 
buys. And the other thing is that when our sales drop. And these and our retail commission 

structure. So our retail partners. We also see a drop in their income. 
So what's the impact of these new restrictions that are in the House budget bill. 
The first is that there's a language in the bill that says any 
time that we advertise. Again there is an annuity. We must 
also provide the cash value. And we do that every place it is. 
It is feasible to do that. That took place is that we don't are on our sixty. 
Billboards an R three fails. And Jackpot sounds better at retail. 

This would require that all that signage have both be an annuity jackpot 
and the cash value that no other state. Does this we would be the only 
state providing this kind of. Information on science. It would 
require that. The billboards have a second digit box. So if your column on the billboard as 
you're driving on the highway would have to have a second digit box and the 
jackpot sounds that you see retail would have to have a second a second line of numbers. 
It would require a satellite. Feed to send to the board that second number 

that feeds not currently available. No one is sending that feed that entire. process would have to be 
established. But there would be about an eighteen-month timeframe for replacing the 
billboards and her son's. 
All right. And and we would be placing boards and signs that still have a useful life. Absolutely 
not. Why. She's a wise investment of money. And we also 
believe and we have estimated this in the numbers. That we would lose Powerball 
and Mega million sales on billboards. You have a very short read 

and what we really want the player when they see the war to know is 
what's the age. What's the jackpot. That's what folks care about. So it's going to be a second number. It's 
going to be confusing. No other state's going to have this one of the lessons of advertising is 
you've got to keep it simple. And all we're doing is making it more confusing. We absolutely 
believe that we would be pushing sales to other states because other states wouldn't 
have this dual message. So the third thing that that these 
restrictions would do that would have. We think a serious impact. Is that we would have 

lost. Everett has an opportunity that not being allowed to purchase a 
top-tier programming during college athletic events at 
the for the football season. We have three of the top twenty five media 
markets. For basketball season. We have three of the top tier media markets in the country. 
This is prime T.V. time and were able to purchase that. Time now to try 
to get at the same number. I have as a number of viewers to see 
an ad we would have to purchase about three times the amount of time to 

make up for the loss of being able to ever times during college athletics. Again 
spending more money to receive the same value is completely inefficient 
way to spend your money. So if the lotteries operate like a business which 
we very much try to do. We're in very focused on our bottom line. The Ney's of these 
restrictions would seriously impact our ability to do so. And so if you want to look at the 
dollar impact. If you go to your chart to the bottom two rows mainly in red. 
Hot and right. 

Last one page. 
Or So if you look at our current budget the budget that not Commission has passed 
the budget under which we anticipate operating in fiscal fifteen. 
It would reduce our return to education by forty four million. By taking 
us to four hundred forty four million back to fiscal and in return 
amounts. Half a percent advertising. And that return would be reduced 
by forty three million. Taking a return to four hundred and one million. Which 

takes us back to what we are providing for education between fiscal year. Eight in fiscal 
year. Nine numbers a serious turn. That two percent advertising would 
reduce that return by forty seven million are taking us to five hundred forty 
eight million for that return. So still. Still an increase over what we are 
projecting a steady state. But obviously less than we 
could accomplish if we had two percent with no restrictions. 
One of the reasons that we have provided this information in kind of a family 

financial state form is that we thought it would be helpful for you to see exactly

how lottery dollars are being spent. So this is. Essentially a capsule of our 
budget showing revenues and expenses out. And that is 
that is what I wanted to bring to you and happy to answer any questions 
or. 
Thank you Ms Garland. Well this is some Committee. Senator Brown. 
Famous Mr Mr Mudd told us that 


this thought that there are. 
Obviously it in the budget that the House put together use visual having his one hundred six million 
dollars of lottery proceeds. So what you're saying is with the restrictions like but also in our 
budget that that's just not a feasible number in your opinion. 
Is correct. We will not be able to hit one hundred six million dollars with those restrictions. 
were followed up. 
And are you having a projection here that the restrictions would cost about forty 

six forty seven million dollars or. 
I don't. 
feel that you feel certain about. These are still point but it is still hard 
to be certain I guess because of the restrictions that are in the budget as 
well. These are the best guest estimates. I guess you could you could come up with in a 
short period of time. 
Yes and really similar to how we get budget projections we're 

looking we're looking at sales figures in the past we're extrapolating from those figures. 
For an impact on sales and the direction we're doing the same thing. So it 
is it's a it's our best projection that we believe it's pretty close to accurate. 
Because it's the center of America. 
Thank you Madam Chairman. I like that as my first question to 
Senator Brown infamously deals. And I'm sure. 
He had some grounds just thinking you know this girl isn't a. 

talker to you if you're going to have a big sale that your car 
business next month would you go in any cut your advertising 
budget and happy and expect to sell a substantial amount of 
cars more than you did this month. 
No absolutely not. I do have big sales. I'd like you to come back. 
You are better off we have a problem that if your real 
friends want. But I have. 

Absolutely not. And I think the restrictions as well. Only advertising is important 
because you know where you place those bars and how you can place them is definitely important. As far as 
returns again. 
Follow-Up. I think you said about like thank you so determined. 
Thank you Madam Chairman. Thank you. It's not on. 
You know either your Senate budget over like this. Putting 
something as important as teacher raise. On lottery 

receipts and then cutting your arm off or how to raise this money. You either 
want to defeat the lottery and you get rid of it or make it ineffective or you've got serious 
about teacher raises. You can not. reduce your revenue from 
lotteries with this is only advertisement restrictions. We say how you can 
raise the money. And I think these figures are pretty good the lotteries track record on 
projections have been very good. And you've done an excellent job in that whether you're for the 
lottery or not that's not the question. The question is now. Let's make it 

work. So we need a seller wish directions all. And we don't 
need to put pictures. All right in the lottery money unless we are pretty darn sure we 
don't raise a hundred six million or whatever. We happened to come up with on your show a lot more 
than usual no more than that with or with your unrestricted two percent. 
So I'm just saying if you're serious about is your rising rising you won't try your hands on the way to raise 
the money. 
Thank you for your comments tonight from insurgents. 

And thank you for that mention in Scotland. 
I find it interesting all the times that someone from the lottery were to come 
here the first time they've ever admitted the fact that they're out competing with the disposable 
income of the working families in our state. 
I am going to come from this from a different perspective as far as saying I'm. 
Using this as a source of money for ongoing government expenses is really 
not a good business decision. But what's worse is and if you look at your scenarios of 

between two point seven five five and the one eight. Billion 
dollars That money that you're competing with the private sector is pretty much 
it's a dead end and doesn't do the same thing. So in essence you're actually hurting the economy by the 
more you expand this by using disposable income for lotteries rather than 
for purchasing Senator Brown's car. 
Or Senate at the doctor's private for up. 
Products that he's selling so well. The last thing I would want to do is expand this because we're working so

hard to make this work. Go on economy a lot stronger and it would be an absolute disaster to 
base. Teacher salaries on something that is actually detrimental to this economy. 
Thank you sir. And so you can search or would you'd like to respond to that. 
I would I would like to say that actually there are a number of ways that the lottery puts money back into the economy. 
First. And for most of the prices that we pay those those dollars. We're back into the 
economy and the big winners who come in at the first thing we say is what you can do with this money 
and they say our cars and. Bad houses send our kids to 

college and renovate my house and I take a vacation. That's money 
going right back into the economy. The second thing is that we pay retail commissions and that's income 
going to our retailers. So that's money back into the economy. And the third 
is that we spend money with vendors in North Carolina. You know we have a 
significant out there. Ad Agency. We have a number of other contracts where 
we're spending money with contractors. So we're actually putting a pretty decent out of 
money back into the economy. 

So yes ma'am. Thank you. I do understand what you're 
describing. But the real question was how much of an economic impact would you 
get. And I would probably not ask everybody in this audience how many of them have been winning the 
lottery to buy enough to win enough to buy a car from Senator Brown. So 
I think that's a false premise. But thank you. Thank. 
You Sarah I'm going to take issue with my dear friend from Charlotte. 
And. As well as to Charlotte I said before if you 

move will be five but. 
If. 
They do OK in Mecklenburg County. But anyway we have regressed. 
As I look the week. We never bought lottery tickets until 
these big mega things and my wife and if it is over two hundred 
million. She goes out and buy lottery tickets. Now we don't spend a massive amount. 
But I do feel like those of monies. That you know were able to manage 

and I don't think we've hurt the budget. Now I think it puts money into the economy. I 
disagree with that. I do think it ends up back in the economy in some fashion. Among them 
in a bit the way we want it to but it still comes back. And so I just 
disagree with them. And heaven and hell of a doesn't happen often but. 
The engine is a good idea. And should send it up in Dhaka. Actually one. 
One time the one that sounds are not idiots and. 
I do miss is that a darker one. twenty dollars one time. 

And as a licensed Center chairman. 
One German. 
thing we're talking about. We got the lottery. We're not done. Well well well I have it. 
There is no other is good for the economy a bad economy foes will play the lottery. 
And now if we can attract more fools play the lottery and the cheers that I've not taken a gun to their 
head. We're talking about. Well if you do sort of revenue you need to put something like age your age 
is what I'm looking at. In Laura receipt or whether they're 

dependable another Souter. And so I don't know but I know their figures have been good. 
Ever since I've been looking at all. Our mail is let's generate the money if we're going to go 
this route. List our right enough money to do a widow. Madeleine rather than having a hundred 
million dollars all in the budget which we will we will be looking at under the scenario of 
reducing the amount and and restrict any advertising. That's what we're building we're building a 
deficit if we do this. 
Crazy play. Thank you for your comments. Senator Graham. 

Thank manager. 
It's gone. I know I've tried to look through the history of the lottery. Nothing every year but war and the 
projections of what they would generate has been more than. 
That And I think we fault except for that one particular year. Nothing. The economy 
dictates a lot of that as well. And. 
Would you say. And I think I would say I'm just one in your pain. You know this 
is the way the system is set up. Now we do the best we can project revenues and if it 

generates a little more than we've been able to use that it is in different ways in our education budget. 
To me that's the prudent way to run this instead of. 
I guess pre- spending those dollars or what we think may happen. And 
I because you never know what the economy could do or how if we go in recession. Three months from now out. 
I think your projections. All these numbers will be a lot there for probably an hour or 
so. You know again if you spend those dollars on the front. And instead of the 
back-and forth of which what we've been doing. I think that's the safe way 

to predict these. I know in business. That surely the way I do it. Because you never know what could happen in the economy. 
Would you say that's accurate. I mean you know if we if we're going to recession. These numbers aren't accurate anymore.

And there's Garland there right there. Are there any number of factors that can impact 
sales. And we we have. 
Typically conservatively estimated for our budget. I have I've said 
several times. That we would much rather have a good case 
and give you more money than you budgeted then under produced. And had you scrambling to try to figure 


out how to make up for. Not getting lottery dollars. We're not we don't want to put you in that situation. We don't 
want to be in that situation. And fortunately it's and that's 
proven to work for us. I will tell you that. The numbers that we provided 
under the two percent scenario are they're not conservative numbers. 
They are aggressive numbers have an amazingly dedicated 
staff. that likes challenges. We were the fastest lottery 
startup in the country when we when we began. And I think we just had a nice 

record strong steady growth. We can believe we can hit that target. 
zone around four o'clock or. 
Well it's like my own chairman of girl here only can perform think 
that don't gamble on own teacher raises off again. When an 
entity is not good for us. But the solution. But this 
may be here. Where. We assess the original intent of the lottery was sold off. There 
have been changes in the allocation of those dollars on the purchase of 

the General Assembly's money. Or you know I remember when I was countermeasure forty 
percent. The lottery used to go to retire capital and capital Bedford County is now so. 
Twenty five. So it's changed its own part. Can you clarify our number for 
me. Essential are restored. Roughly thirty seven percent of the proceeds went 
back to the state and that number has consistently. reduced down 
to around twenty six percent. Can you tell me if that is correct. And what the 
reason for that is coming from a law like this. Garland. 

Thank you. Yes that listen to talk of it. That is correct page. I two thousand and 
seven legislature. I changed our statutes to. 
It removes the percentages as mandates and instead make and 
guidelines and instead directed us to maximize sales in order to maximize 
revenues. And that's that's really what we're about. So that percentage doesn't tell the 
story. It's really the dollars and that's what we focus on completely is how can we raise more 
dollars. Are states that have a mandated 

return a thirty five percent are very low performing states 
annex. And then several others. Look at forming States. The mandate has been removed. 
And their sales skyrocket. So there is a ton of 
hard solid data in the latter industry. To show what happens if the 
mandate a percentage return gets half. Instead of focusing on 
the dollar return. And you really really do want to focus on the dollar return 
because that's that's how you can fund programs that you want to find her profile up. 

Not just a fault. So you drop a percentage with the dollars that are 
going to education and the home of the show was filming. 
Correct. The stars have have gone up. But typically forty fat percent every 
year. 
So you know you just move all of them. Cherry now. 
And go home. So you. But reducing the 
percentage. 

You decrease of dollars. But if you maintain the same percentage as 
original. And you know we wouldn't be even getting more dollars for the lower 
you get education and to help me with them are. 
You ready. If you're taking significantly less. 
And it's right there. In fact there's a very recent audit on 
the Georgia Lottery about the state auditor that looked at this very question 
and I spoke to dollars versus percentages. And there's. 

I've got data out of Texas. And I've got data out of California 
v the product that we produce we are still some organization a product. We 
produce the product we sell is process. 
And to. 
So just just formal clarification of mum and my six grown men 
future would be metaphor and incentives. So if we're you know if 
you're going for it. In the old or a thirty seven percent of one hundred five million 

in the New World. You're contributing twenty six percent of one hundred five million. How is that 
more money for education. 
Or necessarily. We would not produce that. One hundred and 
fast. If we were returning thirty five percent education.

Players that are our games. Players are tickets because they want to win money. 
If they have a lesser chance of winning because we are 
reducing what we put into prices. They will not buy our tickets. 

And so we want we want that the sales figure will 
drop considerably. As he and I get very fat percent or lower 
sales figures. So the question is you want a thirty five percent of the lower 
figure. You want twenty six percent have a significantly higher figure. Senator 
Tucker. 
Well OK. Dark and that's fine. I just want share with you that it took off from Wembley. 
They got a better chance of being struck by lightning than there is up about a one in a lot of them. 

Thank you sir for being with. Thank you. And share. I'd 
like to get the opinion of the fiscal staff. On the presentation from the of the ocean or not 
we are. That is actually. Next up our writers are. They don't 
give us their opinion based upon the presentation that we're rearing. Now 
Evan Wright. Well I still thank you Madam Chairman. Evan about all of this 
research. And the finance team at Fisk. 
Research is working with state budget. to 

investigate the lottery revenues they're going to be presenting a 
consensus revenue forecast later this week. I 
thought so. Thank you very much for that clarification. But if the 
jury's still out as relates to. A second opinion even on the numbers that we're hearing 
here this morning. It's on verb are interested in hearing from our own staff about what those looks 
like and less common chair are very are the comments. 
It's very difficult and. In my opinion to gamble on gambling to pay teachers 

to me. It's fiscally irresponsible. And I don't know how you get the consistency out of it unless you 
ma'am. Can share with me with some certainty that based on your financial model that you will 
be able to predict these kind of returns on a consistent basis. 
Because they're Sports Center Robinson. 
Yes and I hit my hand. Thank you Madam Chair I had my hand up so long ago that I had really again I 
did it and I had no money. And when the cute percentage of Rachel was 
pulling that tension away talking about self-doubt. And that is why I was 

playing a lot and. That is part of it. 
But the the question and I mean that sense of force. I was kind 
of looking at what we're investing in the operating expenses as opposed 
to. 
The revenues which you know gives us that men and. I and the other 
end of it. We're investing more if they can. You know in terms of the returns. 
It's not a real great return. And I see what you're saying which 

supports the fact that we are not to be gambling with teacher salaries is my 
point. But I saw an article in the paper in terms of who plays the 
lottery most. And do you have statistics on that in terms 
of food. You know what segment of the population of one area 
that I know is that's an apple data. But can you tell us who plays a lot 
of. 
Reads. We have our own ads. I don't have statistics what I would like to share is. 

How did your co-ed that's I guess. weigh every winner who wins one hundred 
thousand or more must come into our headquarters to receive their winnings 
and we interviewed every one of those folks and that's that's anywhere 
from you know three to five people a week. And they are a 
true cross-section of North Carolina. And. 
They are doctors lawyers accountants bank executives 
engineers and they are Blue-Collar workers. They are housewives. I mean 

it is a real cross-section. They are in our one hundred 
counties they cover the gamut. And they they they are North 
Carolina. 
I thank you. Mr Owen for their bright. 
But. 
I was trying to get a handle on the restrictions. And I presume 
they are and maybe this is a question for you. Ms garner the staff. Are they all covered 

in. The pages of Christianity level or soul of the special 
provisions. Or are they scattered throughout and could somebody 
saw how light the key components of these restrictions. And then I was going ask 
you something about the impact. And I just want to know we can 
all talk about any is one fifty six just a sort of kitsch 
name.

For the same items that are in the budget or is it a staffer to pay 
us. We'll ask a Follow-Up question on those 

aren't all right. Thank you add my trainers. Brian ass. And to give you the details of your first question. 
Thank you Madam Chair. Over here straight Fridays Center-Right mourning 
the the items you're looking for in the House Budget begin. On page nine. And 
Section five point three you'll see below the area in which the lottery funds are 
portrayed in the House budget there are series of. Additional 
provisions that would would govern and make changes to you how the lottery 
may advertise under the the House budget. So you know Mr Owen 

had reviewed those with you in some detail. But you'll find them all in block and that area. 
And it's not identical. I believe to the House bill that was referred to but I believe 
the bulk of that House bill is reflected in the the House budget 
with respect to advertising and changes their. 
Thank you so. Right. As you have a follow up with a gift for Ireland. I heard you 
discuss that talk about something about Africa as a in this. So if 
you could just review it to me. I hope it's not a limp. One more. Tam. What are these restrictions. 

And so what of the impact score a one off. For example athletes something about 
the kind of games you can do with something. I don't really understand what that really 
means. 
Right. And are a part has never had that language in front of me but I think that we might have it printed 
in their heads that they had a language on the games that really just 
captures what we're doing today. We can provide instant. 
Games which are the tickets that you scratch off and draw games which are drug 

games or ones with their numbers are drawn. And that's called a draw game. So that 
doesn't restrict what we're doing today. In the three 
main concerns that we have in terms of those restrictions. 
Now the first is the language that speaks to it. 
If the wind is an annuity jackpot yet also 
provides a cash value. We do that everywhere feasible where 
we don't do it is on the billboards and on the jackpot stands as the only place two places we don't do 

it. It would be a tremendous experience and create great confusion 
to the players if we made that change. The second 
is the cut not being 
allowed to purchase advertising. During college athletics. 
And I'm sure everybody in here realizes that college athletics. I think and worked on 
are really far more important than professional athletics in terms of T.V.. And to 
deny us the opportunity to purchase advertising during our current T.V. 

town would absolutely have an impact and be very expensive to try to replace that with some 
other purchase. And then the third is just 
we get the confusion created with 
having two sets as are the numbers on billboards and jackpot signs it would actually 
push people away from Powerball and Mega Millions. And. 
Thank you Mr Allen follow-ups here to run it sold in the case of the new. 
It has the payments over a period of time. Your concern is not that 

he of the buyer would know the value they were not buying it is just 
that space. It takes the score. I was told it's the. 
Confusion of having two two numbers. So they're used to a billboard that has one number 
and if they're traveling from state to state. They see that same number. And in South Carolina 
and Virginia as they see in North Carolina in all of a sudden there's a billboard with a second box and a second 
number and wonder does that mean. And what's that tell me is more time to change the game. Somehow 
I think I'll just go to South Carolina Virginia. 

OK. Fine lesson about. Follow-Up attacks. And in terms of your odds 
as I'm looking at the provisions. And you have to state the probability of 
winning the lowest priors and the largest 
prize of so and how does that differ for what you do now. When you say what odds are the scarlet. 
In the air. Our current statute requires that we 
put on everything that we do to the overall estimated odds of winning that 




What this provision would ask us to do is to include the 
odds of winning the top prize. And what that what's the dollar value of the 
lowest price that you can wind up after past the one 
fifty six outweighs introduced. You know we started 
looking at how we what we could go ahead and do and that was an

easy one. 
We were glad to do that. Had we been asked we would have done it voluntarily. We were just 
doing what our statute told us to do. But we already now have. 

On all of our tickets. And our point of sale that's in stores on our 
how to place the the odds of winning. That top 
prize. We have left the overall estimate at odds because that's still in our 
statute. 
of thanking is going well and this is to stay out of an intersection about 
advertising in sports if that is in connection with any 
sport or sporting event is all those different. 

From something. It's just curious in 
terms of the dressing. 
So Madam Chair Senator Bryan that I had not a position to have an opinion on that. 
And looking across at my colleague which we have to talk to an 
attorney and get back to you on that. What will be that. 
Thank you. Thank you. Surprise. Sarah Dhaka. 
Or. 

Senator have a doctor they can then Janet mum. was gone. 
I was wondering about. Do these mega millions thing. Hasn't that been a 
real boon to the lottery and all of the large jackpots of the last couple years 
when this is that the doctor really gets involved in the lottery. Is that not what kind of 
money. Has that brought in this Garland. 
Well first I would like to say that this is that the doctor is like a huge 
number of other North Carolinians that waits for the jackpot to be two hundred million dollars because a measly 

forty million dollars isn't enough. 
Yes. But not. Yes and. 
And quite frankly. You said your brand. One reason that we had surpluses is 
we didn't we don't project for the next year. Those large 
runs. You can't count on and we can't predict. And you know we can have a year where 
we have three or four of those large runs. And we have a great year. We can have a year where we have one 
large run. But typically 

I wish I had a sales chart to show you what happens when that jackpot 
gets really big. I mean it's not unusual for us to. 
So I actually can't tell you at this minute by minute. What would you like a normal day that minute 
literally minute minute by minute when a jackpot is half. We are selling twenty 
thousand dollars tickets a minute. And that jackpots have a nest 
egg and they have thirty eight percent of that the drug gains have a higher 
return than the instance he gets thirty eight percent of that is what it is 

saying is this incident. Great for us. 
Thinking as Roland mentioned have two more questions from committee. We're. 
Counting on them to a quick follow up call up state employees. All right. Well look 
I don't want us to spend a whole lot of time worried about House bill. 
One fifty six. No matter where it is or where it was put. That's just foolishness. 
And so I don't want Jamie going into Labor to have a heart attack. 
And finishing up I think lightning hitting Senator 

Tucker is probably far greater than anything I can think of on why it's 
happening. You know probably happen almost any moment that you can. Thank you for a comment. 
Senator brought. I thank you Madam Chair if you were 
looking ever tossing you're looking at. When jackpots to get that 
high. You have your earned media wear. That is splitting off a new story every night. So we're looking at 
actually sales. Advertising is that the media's doing more of it for you 
than what you're putting into your numbers or are I think in this interview number for all. But 

you know the question I have on this one. And regardless was the center of the 
talks at about the Bell looking at our information that we that worked to 
make the decision on on the law very you know we created you in the middle of the night. 
They have mentioned we got a one House bill what fifty six. There will be no impact. Did you taught or 
another. Coming up next the digital Water Commission top your research staff 
give us this information that. Said we know in net impact. You said the number. 
Now this is this year but last year. You said you didn't have the numbers. Now you're doing. 

You can you can you walk and walk me through the dollar that with him. 
We were not consulted when this when it was put together in fiscal thirteen when asked 
they can pass Judiciary Committee and laid out what I thought the fiscal impact would 
be that an act. This map listed 
liaison and at net with a rational standard. We told him that without the physical impact 
would be a holiday or not for a lack of our expressing

what we thought would happen. 

For a lot more you know a person. 
Similar to what you see him Matt. And I don't have 
them with me. But we they haven't changed very much. 
He will be provided without documentation. As you say we get to work on a stamp. 
And we we talked to him for a lead and not hand him a document. 
Thanking us Crown. We very much. Appreciate you sharing your time with the committee and answering our 
questions. Thank you. And. 

Next up we have Brian that son from the fiscal research division. He's 
going to discussing the differences in Bart lottery appropriations between the House and Senate 
budgets. 
Welcome. Thank you. 
Thank you Madam Chair. Members Committee guests. Good morning. They'll be a head table 
handed out to you shortly. So I'll get into that once you receive it in 
just a few points to make before we get into those numbers. The first point again 

I guess it bears reiterating Center Harrington. Let us off with this. But 
Barry and his counterparts Everett O S B M are working with the lottery commission to come 
up with a revised consensus estimate that wall. So take into account that will take into account 
both the baseline that is that there's no policy change. And lottery continues operating as 
it is. And considering a few different policy shifts in areas 
and they hope to be able to produce a formal estimate by the end of the week that you will 
receive. So I don't anticipate my brief presentation here will get into you. 

Any of the estimates side of things but rather I've been asked to look at. How funds were 
distributed in the respective House and Senate budgets. How they compared to the inactive 
budget and to one another. One other point to raise. You 
have to sell. You have a handout. And the rest. You're getting it for the first time this past year. Two 
significant changes happen with respect to how you budget your lottery funds. First is 
that your budget is on a two year basis. The lottery lottery funds whereas in 
the past. The net revenues a lottery for education programs had been budgeted annually. So 

even the short session you'd come back. Take a fresh look and make specific allocations 
that they could be significantly different than what had been done at the beginning during a long session 
and say this fantasy that we have a two year budget put in place that that is new. 
Secondly And and I believe Senator Tucker had raised the point earlier that. Last year 
he had made a significant change and removed the statutory required allocations of 
lottery funds for specific programs. So what you see here right now. 
You know on a going forward basis reflects the general assembly's best list of every year about where to 

allocate funds that you receive or the projected from Jersey. From the lottery. So. 
seeing that all of you have to hand out. Let's get into some of the detail of why two thousand and 
thirteen fourteen. I see the enacted budget of four hundred eighty one point eight million 
because you're now operating on a two-Year budget showing you here. What what was 
served budgeted this year. The Senate did propose to make a modification. 
The baseline. Consensus Riyadh summit in April that Alice had discussed with the 
earlier miss Garland. Excuse me. I had anticipated. Approximately thirty seven 

million and over. Just from current year operations. That is that the lottery would produce net 
revenues is thirty seven thirty eight million dollars higher than than had 
been budgeted the proposed Senate budget would take nine hundred million of 
those projected ever edges in the current fiscal year and put them into 
completing the U.N.C. financial aid for funding. That had been out for us in the budget. 
But you see without. Item thirty two point five million was enacted and the Kurds acted for F 
Y two thousand. Fourteen fifteen. With the Senate budget did you. With the 

additional availability in the current year is to take about half of that availability and finish out the 
work are on the move in. U.N.C. financially completely to afford funding model. 
The House budget did not make any changes to the enacted budget in two thousand and thirteen fourteen. That's a 
really the only the only item of interest. There is just the Senate shift to fully 
fund the forward funding item and fly two thousand four hundred fifteen. As you know is a 
considerably different story. Both the Senate and House had modifications there. 
What the Senate did was to put fifty six million into thirty six 

million additional in the classroom teachers see actually there's an area on here. With respect to you 
for funding. And as you're learning just the wind moved up on me. So what you should see is 
that for funding as a zero for the Senate in the two thousand and fourteen fifteen budget worries the 
Digital Learning money stayed flat century on a comparative basis. The only change

<p id="60:00">

 Here are the 
only two changes are. fifty six million additional for classroom teachers and the 
elimination of nine hundred million for for funding in the Senate budget as there had already been taken care of in 
thirteen fourteen. The House budget in two thousand four hundred fifty and made several 

modifications. The most significant of which was an additional one hundred sixty point nine 
million in the classroom teachers that amount. As you see considerably 
higher than the the Senate's allocation about one hundred four million also put forty nine 
million into N.C. pre-K.. And all cases here. These were not additions. 
So didn't provide more teachers or more. Pre-K. slots. They changed the distribution of 
proceeds supporting those programs the mix between general fund and state receipts as you 
see between those two are two items that additional two hundred nine hundred million or two. Twenty really 

from the House into teachers and the pre-K.. Also provided nearly eleven 
million for an increase to textbooks. Textbooks Program already receives about twenty three million 
dollar general fund appropriation through the D P R budget. So this would be about a fifty 
percent increase in textbooks. Then lastly the hows policy and the 
fourth funding was not to complete it. As they would also did not provide the nine hundred million. 
And then lastly did not fund digital learning. Is it just to summarize you see 
the Box at the at the bottom of the page. Additional budgeted net lottery revenues. 

So you see the divisional budgeting over both years since the Senate had allocated 
some of the funds in two thousand thirteen fourteen Senate was counting out about another fifty six point 
three million over the enacted level where as the House budget counts on approximately. 
one hundred ninety million over the inactive level with the policy changes that you heard about 
earlier. 
That includes presentation to your. 
Question. Thank you. Bryan center at Dhaka. 

Thank you Madam Chair. Bryant do you go in a little deeper force on the 
U.N.C. financial aid for funding. And what that involves and 
why we're why we're looking at that. 
So I'll take start this now. Whatever my colleague who handles this. And if I get off track 
of the furtive Denise and threats are. You know 
I served philosophically. 
There had been certain timing constraints that you all face each year with 

making financial aid awards. Wherein you've been making appropriations decisions 
that in some ways impact. Existing policies that is. I 
have award letters have been sent out to students. Anticipating the scholarship award. receiving 
those letters and in the spring of the year in which are considering the budget for the next year any 
modifications you made to that budget specifically in the case of make any reduction say 
would would result potentially in families and students expecting one level of 
funding through for financial aid receiving another. The general assembly's movie or through 

three lottery fund some other general. Some fund proceeds and and whatnot. The whole 
array of funds that support financial aid. The General Assembly has moved over the last several years to 
get the program out of fully for funded basis so that you can make adjustments 
without impacting those award letters and and have a better sense of timing 
on that that that would negatively impact students that had already been notified of work. 
Paula. So in simple terms we would be giving money 
that we had already appropriated we would have the money and then send it out 

to the students correct. 
Yes a manger. Yes. So it's that's very sort of you per printed up front. You know it's there and you could 
send up the award. 
For the questions or comments from committee. Thank you. 
Appreciate it. 
But. 
Next we have compensation differences. 

Let me recurring David Van der Leiter here to cover another major area of budgetary 
differences salaries and benefits. 
Higher. And let me recreate from the fiscal research division. The sergeant at arms. They're passing 
out a handout. That shows the various proposals and budgets. 
Passed for the compensation plans to hand out right to the governor's proposal in the 
Senate but it is an active and the House's budget that they passed out. 
There is also a handout. The second page provides that there is to be a teacher 

salary status of this. It's a bachelor's laying out the Teacher Salary schedules in the various 
proposals and to quickly go through. The 
various employer groups on this page. Starting with educator raises. 
First all three proposals increase starting pay for educators to thirty three thousand 
dollars a year going to focus on the differences between the Senate the House. 
And the Senate budget if you recall you create a professional status teacher salary 
schedule their last twenty one

steps starts at thirty three thousand dollars is flat at 

that. At that rate for the first few years. And then for five thousand dollars salary 
increases. Up until step twenty when it catches out. At fifty thousand dollars 
in order to move to that professional status teacher salary schedule. You have to relinquish longevity 
rights career status rights and also a technical issue related to the way that 
supplements for degrees which are vacations are calculated. On 
average that for professional status. Our schedule provides over an eleven percent 
raise. Or I'm a teacher. It's not eleven percent for every teacher. That's on average across all. 

aspects of the schedule. 
Teachers at the top of the salary schedule who choose to move to the professional status 
schedule. 
Don't actually get a salary increase. If you look at the current SEC edge over teachers 
someone on set. Thirty six makes fifty three thousand dollars when they if they choose to 
move to the. professional status schedule they don't drop the fifty thousand dollars they were they're 
held harmless and they keep their current rate of pay they actually get one percent on a card balance 

the. House did not choose to go with this professional status. salary schedule 
instead they increase starting pay to thirty three thousand dollars a year and then it increased all the steps 
on the schedule by varying amounts in an effort to sort of move back towards 
the schedule as it was before the freeze. On average the House provides a five percent 
increase to all our teachers on the schedule and about a two percent bonus to 
anyone who's on staff. Thirty six that would go to year thirty seven. There is currently a thirty 
seven you'll get a thirty eight because we don't have steps for those they really are two percent not a 

recurring bonus for those individuals. I just want to look at this page of the 
reins for educators quickly and explain how you would figure out what a teacher way down. 
Salary increase would be. Because each educator gains a year of 
experience. Zero. Let's use a ten. 
A person on set. Ten and currently makes. Thirty five thousand eight hundred dollars 
does not move to forty thousand dollars. Under the Senate proposal they would actually move to forty 
one because they also gaining your experience of the new firms that tend to step a lot in. 

So if you have a person who calls you and asks how this will affect them. 
They should they understand. You don't just moved. Across but you also need down the steps to gain your 
experience. In the second group of employees on my list as the 
school-based administrator says these are your assistant principals and principals 
their Senate budget enacted. I propose doing the exact same thing at the 
governor's budget dead. And this. provides a step increase to these 
individuals as well as non occurring. Bonuses for anyone who doesn't get a step 

the AM House budget also tried to step in and change the schedule to 
match the school as a minister schedule is. tied to the educator schedule. 
And it changed the schedule to match the proposed salary schedule for 
the teachers you can see the cost difference there. These numbers are in millions. 
So the governor's proposal for a school based administrator is cost just under six million dollars The. 
Houses cost over ten I'm sorry didn't state the cost the 
educator raises this and it was just under four hundred sixty nine million 

dollars while the House's proposal costs about one hundred seventy eight point three. 
The third. or non certified in central office staff at the public schools are not 
certified. 
personnel or bus drivers or cafeteria workers people who are not. 
Certified education fields and your central office staff are the superintendent the school business 
officers and those people who work in the public school central offices. 
The Senate proposal has a five. Hundred dollar flat salary increase of six hundred and some 

dollars. When you include in benefits. And in the house. Right. A thousand dollar 
salary increase which is closer to twelve thirty six when you include in benefits. You can 
see the cost difference for those here as well. For Thursday employees in the north 
kind of community college system employees. The Senate provides an 
eight hundred nine dollars salary increase and excludes the university E.P.A. 
and their estimate of the cost the cost for the Senate proposal is seventy. Five seventy 
five point five million dollars in the house. There's a thousand dollar salary increase through these 

employees and it specifies. The state agency in science and math 
teachers would be compensated on the teacher salary schedule. This cost about one hundred eighty 
nine. I turning over to the second page these. 
Are the non- educator and school-based initiator staff employees. So these are your 
majesty. Your assistant and deputy clerks your magistrates and your state highway patrolmen. 
Or all of the proposals pretty much provide a stat for these individuals. 
And anyone who's not eligible for a staff will get

either eight hundred nine in the Senate or a 
thousand dollars in the House however. For the magistrates 
the House budget provides a general increase in the rate of pay 
for the magistrate's. You can see her in the box for 
magistrates may be an increase of over two thousand dollars for him for the entryway 
for magistrates and this is to help address the recruitment issues for magistrates. So 
everyone in these cases will get that same a flat or the step increase which is 
more than the flat. increase about the same place. Lastly the State 

Highway Patrol. The House provided more than a step for sort of how 
common or how a patrol one step is five percent and the House about a six 
percent from a trauma. Zoran since two thousand and twelve. Five and a half percent for the traumas form 
between two thousand and eight and two thousand. And eleven and five percent for those who are from two thousand and 
five to two thousand and seven. You can see the total cost. For these plans 
here. The main difference is the market increase for magistrates 
to make that. Cost one point two. More than half of in the Senate and then the additional 

pay for the new new viewers troopers or not makes the 
House which will cost slightly higher than what's in the Senate. In 
total the House budget costs. The proposal for 
compensation costs about three hundred eighty one million dollars while the Senate proposal costs five hundred 
about five hundred ninety one million dollars. Line nine shows the retiree 
cola the. Senate budget includes zero 
point eight percent cost of living adjustment for retirees. While the House provides a one point four 

four percent increase for retirees. And annuity. Total spending including the 
retire. He component is six hundred twenty million six hundred twenty one 
million dollars in the Senate. And four hundred thirty four million in the house and 
I'm happy to answer any questions related to these. 
Thank you Mr Crane questions or comments from me. 
All right thank you very much Senator. Hacker. 
as well. 

So talk of these turn your microphone. I think you. 
wrote you're glad to be home almost to be increased for persons through 
school administration. Paul Gu certain house. A lot of voters are 
different and how much of. 
An injured. Senator Tucker the thing. It gives the governor's 
proposal which. Has a planet that matched the governor's teacher's salary 
schedule so that school is an initiator salary scandal in the Senate but it 

no longer is linked to the teacher salary scandal. It's. It's the same goes for president out of the 
pencil and the House updates the school based on the listener's schedule 
to match their proposal for teachers and that costs. four million 
dollars more than what was proposed in the Senate. 
Well it's an attractive omen. I'm talking with us. Thank you. Thank you Mr Crane was 
sorry center right. All of 
this to the grave. Can you get. 

A review with us because I don't think it's all in here. Two things. One is what 
happened with the five hundred dollars one thousand dollar time 
when. The four year contract. How was that handled differently. And I'm trying to 
remember in the Senate budget. We're glad you're assuming everybody will 
move to the career status. And I don't know what amount of. Flip 
look soft legs would be a net. Depending on how that happened if I don't know if there's a simple 
answer but if you could tell. Bryan. 

I'll answer your second question and I thought to my colleague Chris remark from on the first. 
One On your second question the cost of the Senate proposal to four hundred sixty one is 
for a sixty nine million dollars that does the same all teachers choose to move 
to a new salary schedule teachers who do not choose to move to the national side a scout 
said he'll remain on what will be known as the career status. salary schedule and that is for 
isn't it said that the fourteen fifteen salary matches exactly the thirteen fourteen 
salary. 

And good friend. Follow-Up file. Do we know how much was the possible Abdalla 
money that could be involved in that for those folks that we have some estimate of what amount we're 
looking at you when we're not. 
Yes ma'am. In there. Right. Media access. And I mean that's the 
first question. 
For us. All right. Thank you. 
Chris Nordstrom physical research. I'll just follow up the center right with your question regarding the 

performance-based contracts the House and Senate did have different policies there. 
The House essentially got rid of the program. They said for those teachers who 
have signed contracts prior to June thirtieth

 two thousand. Fourteen they can choose to keep that 
contract or waive it and the Senate allows teachers who 
sign contracts by June thirtieth to keep that contract or a way that. Slightly amends 
it a little bit for on additional contracts to be 
offered. Due to that. I think due to some of the. More 

cases surrounding this policy. Some additional time is added in that a school 
district would have until September thirtieth to offer contracts. 
clarifies that these contracts that these contracts offered following the 
passage of the budget until September thirtieth. Instead of pay raises of five five hundred 
dollars increase in each of the four years. These would be bonuses of five hundred one thousand one 
thousand five hundred and two thousand dollars. And then there are 
provisions in there. You think. To allow for additional offering of 

contracts that would start in the fifteen sixteen school year. such that the 
total number of performance-based contracts offered by the school 
district could only total thirty five percent of the eligible teacher 
population the eligible teacher population those that have been determined 
effective and have certain number of years of experience. 
In that school district. Thank you. Did you have a further. Follow-Up 
for the questions or Conason committee. All right. Thank you Mr King. 

Next we're going to have Mark ponder present capital offenses 
over the differences in the House and Senate Capitol. budgets are not major. The capital budget does not have a 
subcommittee. So Martin I know is going to quickly review for the Appropriations Committee. The budget 
differences in the area of capital. 
is on its mark bottom with the research and I believe you're getting the handouts for what 
the differences are in the capital budget while those are being passed 
out in the interest of time. I will go ahead and start. The first on the 

Senate funded which the House did not was a department of agricultural product 
project. It was funding the McHugh arena roof repairs at the western North Carolina 
agriculture center a few million dollars The House did not fund this project. And 
the House and the Senate both chose to fund planning for the expansion and 
renovation of the Museum of History here in Raleigh. But they both chose to fund it in different ways. 
That house a perforated one point eight million dollars directly to Department of Cultural 
Resources. And if you look on the the 

next page on page two. The Senate chose to do a one million dollars 
challenge grant that the Department of Cultural Resources would receive upon raising one 
million dollars in non state funds. Both the House and 
the Senate funded the North Carolina. Battleship but in different ways. The North turned a 
battleship needs its hold repaired. The Senate perforated three million dollars directly to the part 
of cultural resources and authorized them to raise an additional ten million dollars in non 
state funds to repair the battleship. The House on page two. And 

item six chose to appropriate three million dollars to the Judea 
after state budget management the holding of reserve as a challenge grant for the Department of 
Cultural Resources in the Friends group of the U.S.S. North Carolina raising in additional 
ten million dollars. item for 
a house in the center ring an agreement on water resources projects for five point eight one million 
dollars. It's getting down on items 
seven. The Senate chose to fund a three million dollar Outer Banks land management reserve in 

the interest of buying land that the new organ. And what the House did not follow 
this policy so that three million dollars was not a perforated. Item 
eight within the east House budget for capital. There is four million dollars not our 
current have to fully plan. The Appalachian State University Health Sciences building 
with the authorization that Appalachian state can raise an additional one point two million dollars 
to be the full planning cost needs. This is actually funded in the Senate budget but in the 
education section. There was a sixty two million dollar not her current 

appropriation to Appalachian State to further planning for this project. And. 
For two-thirds spawns there's no money here. Just the authorization which then it also appears. And 
a special provision. The House funded the rubric renovation of the 
outer moral building which is the building across the street. This via for innovation using 
two-thirds plans. And it was forty two point two three million dollars Just look at history. 
Balmoral buildings. about forty four years old. It was finished in one nine hundred seventy and about one 
hundred thirty five thousand square feet. And this would be a fall or addition of 

that building. Both House and Senate agreed to the

There were no major Senate where the major special provisions to be discussed. 
Thank you Mr condo questions or comments from many of. 
You all right. Thank you. Right. 

Now except Kristen Walker from the school research. She's going to review the final 
budget differences in the areas of general fund availability and the reserve section of the budget. 
Thank you. Welcome Kristen. 
Thank you Mr Chairman. Brian what we have is a hand out for you which 
details the general fund availability differences of this kind of wraps up all of the different pieces. 
You've heard about today. I will go through this quickly. I know we're almost out of 
time on line two. You can see there's a difference in under collections between 

the Senate and the House. The consensus forecast has not changed. But 
what. has happened is there was return of about sixteen million from that High-Risk insurance pool. 
And so that is reflected in the House budget as an under collection changing that. That 
number is. They provide protection. For emergency is different between 
the Senate and House is well on line three. The difference there is how Medicaid and 
H.H.S. carry forward plans were handled. There will be a later meeting to talk 
more about Medicaid and those carry forward plans. In 

lines. Five and six. The savings reserve and are now receive different amounts between the Senate and the 
House. And then if you look at lines. Eight nine. Those are the same. Those 
are the revenues. And the consensus forecast was. Yes for both of those lines and 
lines eight nine lines ten through twenty six. 
And show you various differences. They're mostly minor in cash transfers 
and other availability adjustments as. We go into the details. If there's questions or if time 
permits. Now if you look at line twenty seven. We've broken out the 

subcommittee budgets for you. For each Subcommittee. We start with the enacted budget. And 
then from there. We've pointed out a few major differences just a few of them and 
subtracted those out with. Compensation differences in each subcommittee being one of the 
biggest areas of difference when you get to the shaded line for each Subcommittee. So 
that's fine. thirty nine for education. You can see the total spend difference for that subcommittee 
between the Senate and the. House as you look at line 
forty. You'll see Health and Human Services. The big differences there on lines. Forty three and forty 

four. Those are related to Medicaid. And again the chairs have expressed an intent 
to have a meeting at a later date. That covers in depth and Medicaid differences. 
Turning the page. You can see justice and public safety. And you know our general government. Those totals for those 
subcommittees and the major differences. There are looking at certain lines sixty 
nine. These are the adjustments to the reserves. You can see that many of 
these are the same. There are. Just a few minor differences as you look down at 
lines eighty one through eighty four. You can also see on line 

eighty. That's the Medicaid risk Reserve which is how that. House chose to handle the Medicaid funding 
in line eighty four I should note this is the steps the Senate can has twenty 
million in there that was actually not passed in the Senate budget. This is the film grant money. It was 
passed in Senate Bill seven forty three which this committee heard a week or two ago. 
And so there was twenty million spent. And if you flip back the page back over. Lines 
five and six the savings. Reserving the repairs and renovations ten million came from each 
of those to fund the twenty million grant program. So those numbers on lines. Five and six will 

not match. If you open up your Senate budget because that bill that passed subsequently has 
changed. But that will be in play in conference. The 
difference there between the Senate and the House and then the last section just you just read the 
Capitol which differences and you just heard this remark by now. And finally you can see the 
total spend on my ninety four in the. 
Senate twenty one point one eight and the House is at twenty one point one. 
And both chambers left no money on the bottom line. Thank you. 

Thank you. No. 
Thank you Ms Walker questions or comments from many. And I am told that this room is reserved for 
another meeting at ten o'clock. All right. Saying on. Thank 
you. To Major.
