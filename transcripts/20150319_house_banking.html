  [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could get everybody&#39;s attention. We are going
to try to start the Banking Committee on time so we can get out of here,
as we are a lunch meeting. I would like to first off thank the wonderful
and talented chairman, Julia Howard. Listen, this is my first time ever
chairing a committee, so if I make a mistake I&#39;m sure it&#39;s my
fault. We-I&#39;d like to thank the Sergeant-at-Arms we have here today,
which are, wherever my notes went, ?? Adams, Martha Gadsden and Joe
Austin. Thank them for their service today and then we have one page who
is sponsored by Craig Horn ?? in the back, she&#39;s in Union County,
she&#39;s here for one year on loan from Germany. So she&#39;s seeing
how the American system works. We welcome you and we appreciate your
interest in us. With that being said, without-Chairman Howard do you
have anything to add? Chairman Howard does not have anything to add so
we will go ahead and go straight into the agenda. We are taking 106
first. All three bills will be run by Representatives Bell and Jordan.
106 is a PCS. Do I have a motion for the PCS in front of us? Chairman
Howard moves. All in favor say aye. The ayes have it. The PCS is in
front of us, so Representative Bell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, wow
that&#39;s a really good echo. We&#39;re going to start with House Bill
106, each one of these bills were a part of the House Legislative
Research Committee, which a number of you at the table were a part of
during the interim. We had a number meeting through the interim, and
this was made recommendations to represent to the full legislative
research committee and they were approved. Today you had them in front
of you in bill form. All of these did pass the committees and passed the
overall committees to get here. The first one we&#39;ll talk about will
be House Bill 106, expanding the Banking Commission membership. The
original bill, before you actually expanded the Banking Committee by two
members during the last couple weeks, we got together with the Banking
Commission, the Bankers&#39; Association, Treasurers&#39; Office,
Mortgage Brokers, everyone came to the agreement that we really did not
want to expand the commission, but we did have  a situation where we had
the non-depository mortgage industry, which represented about 26% of the
income that came into the Banking Commission. It did not have a seat at
the table. They were actually combined with a finance, financing ??, and
so if one of them were left off you did not have proper representation
at the table. So the parties got together, agreed with the PCS before
you to have, to actually make one of the members on the Banking
Committee that does hold a mortgage seat, which is a public member.
Turned that into an industry seat. That gives seven public members,
seven industries, and then the treasurer who serves would be in a place
to break any ties if there were ever any, and to to my knowledge there
have not. I don&#39;t know who&#39;s ever been one, on the commission
one years ago. But, so we do have folks here from, who will answer any
questions if you have. But that&#39;s this bill before you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there anybody from the audience who&#39;d like to
speak on this? Seeing none. At the appropriate time Representative
Bishop, I&#39;d be happy to ask that. Are there any questions from the
committee members? Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. Chair. This is your first time
chairing a committee, this is my first time ever in the Banking
Committee, so forgive me for some of my questions coming out of
ignorance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not my bill, so ask as many as you want.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So as I understand this, it looked like you&#39;re
taking one of the public members and transferring that to represent the
non-depository, interests? Can someone explain to me what role a public
member on the Banking Commission is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to redirect that to staff if possible.
That way we&#39;ll get you an appropriate answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The definition under Chapter 33C, is, for a public
member, is a member of the commission who is not a practical banker, a
consumer finance licensee, or a part person, licensed under Article 19B,
the one that&#39;s being added. And who is not at the time of the
appointment to the commission, nor was within the five years preceding
the appointment an employee of an

  Line a financial one. ?? Representative Martin I know you have a follow
up. I will yield that to you in a second. I will remind you that the
circular items in front of you are read right before you ask your
question or respond. Please turn that degree and turn it off so we can
make sure that people at home who want to listen can listen. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Martin do you have a followup? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I don&#39;t know if anybody at home cares to listen
to me but I pushed the button anyway. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate
that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So it sounds, a statement and then a question,
it sounds to me as if the public members were put in place in order to
surprisingly represent the interests of the public. As distinct from
that, various portions of the industry. So my question then is why would
we take one of those seats away from the public, and give it to someone
in industry when it seems to me a better option might have been to
expand the size, keep the number of seats that we have there
representing everyone in the public, and then also do what I think I
hope we all would agree we need to do, and have representation on there
for the non-depository. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bellman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Currently the way the banking commission is made up,
if you look down at the bill under a gentleman by the name of Don ?? who
actually serves as a public member on that committee. Don Thader
actually worked for the non-depository mortgage industry. So what you
had is if one of the finances, ?? you have a combined seat, that would
either a member of the finance company or non-depository mortgage
company. If one or the other did not get that seat, then they would
fight for a public member seat to be sure they&#39;re getting the
representative at the table. So when we got together with the
stakeholders we really didn&#39;t want to go back in the direction where
if you were a member a couple years ago, we lowered the banking
commission I believe it was from 22 to 17 if I&#39;m not mistaken, to
15, if we went back up to 17, then we start creeping back up in that
direction. But the non-depository mortgage represents such a large
portion of the income, if you&#39;re a stockholder in any other company
and you represent 25% of the stock, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re
going to have a voice at the table. And listening to the list that seat
was filled by that entity, they did not have a seat at the table unless
they acquired a public member seat. That was an agreement that was made,
if you look at the first, before the PCS, it was done the way that you
said that. But when we talked among the stakeholders involved, our goal
in the committee was to make sure there was appropriate voices and
appropriate representation heard on the board. And everyone felt that
this would be a way to solve that without expanding industry but also
being able to have the public members have a larger enough voice to
compete against the industry seats if necessary. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ll shut up after this. This concerns
me that we are taking a seat away potentially from public members.
I&#39;m inclined not to support the bill now but I want to make it clear
to the bill sponsors that that comes just from inexperience as a newbie
on this committee, based on what little I know on the small amount of
experience in these arenas right now, I can&#39;t support the bill. But
I look forward to learning more and happy to sit down with you and
asking you some further questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions
or comments from committee members. Seeing none, Representative Bishop,
you are recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move to approve the
committee, the sub-committee substitute. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Unfavorable
to the original? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It does not
have a serial referral so that motion is in order. All in favor say aye.
All opposed say no. Ayes have it. House Bill 106 is passed. House Bill
105 is before us. Representative Bell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
members, and I will go through this as quick as possible. I know this is
very entertaining information. House Bill 105 amends the safe mortgage
licensing act to reduce the amount of the surety bond requirement for
licensed mortgage brokers, mortgage lenders and mortgage services. It
would also allow the commission to waive the requirement of a bond if
the licensee has a net worth of at least the required bond amount. Once
again this is a recommendation upon the legislative research committee.
The bond amounts are in front of you. If you have any questions, I would
be more than happy to answer them. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does anybody from
the audience have anything they&#39;d like to add? Don&#39;t get too
excited, don&#39;t rush the stage at one time. Seeing none, any comments
or questions from the committee members? Representative Blust. Please
push the button in front of you, Representative Blust. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Has there been a problem or have we found that the lower bond will
protect everyone the bond&#39;s supposed to protect? Has there been any
problem in the past that might indicate we need to keep it at that
level? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It is a
current situation. If you look

  The surrounding states, were actually higher than all the surrounding
states, and even with this we&#39;ll still be a little higher than our
states. On the issue came forward by the industry, and you wouldn&#39;t
have these but, in the committee it was brought up that from 2005 to
2012, the claims against these bonds were about $500,000. The premiums
were 11.6 million, collected. So, so what we wanna do is kind of bring
that down, put ourselves on the line, and make us as competitive within
our region of the country.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions? Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don&#39;t have a microphone. ?? If you press that one, I&#39;ll be in
stereo. Question about the, the reason we have these bonds. Now, it
appears that if we lower this amount of coverage, we&#39;re gonna end up
with the companies themselves taking riskier actions. Is that something
that has been determined, whether or not this results in greater
problems that we have as a result of it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bell. Representative&#39;s up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Representative Bell asked me to help him with
some of these things because I&#39;m a licensed mortgage loan officer.
I&#39;ve been involved in mortgage brokering and mortgage loaning for
the last 16 years. In answer to your question, the lending landscape has
changed dramatically over the past several years, and specifically in
the last ten or fifteen since these limits were put in place. There is a
plethora of federal legislation that really a lot of our state
legislation mirrors now. You might recall last session that there was a,
several bill that I sponsored that had state lending standards no more
strict than federal lending standards. There is a level of scrutiny on
the mortgage industry be it lenders or brokers that is, I&#39;m not sure
what it&#39;s comparable to. Maybe to coal ash or, no, maybe that&#39;s
a bad one. But there are federal inspectors, state inspectors. The
bottom line here is that the committee listened to substantive
discussion on this, and determined that there is really sufficient
oversight that this level is a little bit too much, and to, it does
provide still sufficient consumer protection. Does that answer your
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, and that does answer my question. ?? the rate we raise these
standards has resulted in mortgages loan prices. Is that correct? Can
someone?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would have to direct that to staff for the last time they were raised.
I don&#39;t remember.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, these standards were placed in the law in 2009, but
that was pursuant to the federal law that changed it, required that all
states licensed mortgage loan officers. I don&#39;t believe ??. Sorry.
I, we have had standards, we&#39;ve had ?? standards in our law prior to
that when we had just the mortgaging licensing act since 2002. I&#39;m
not sure whether they were raised in 2009 or whether they stayed the
same. Someone from the commissioner&#39;s office may be able to tell you
whether or not they&#39;ve gone up or whether they&#39;ve stayed the
same since 2002.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Anyone from the commissioner&#39;s office here and care to comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? In 2009 the loan was increased. I am not aware of the amount that
they were prior to that. I believe there was an increase in 2008 or 2009
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ma&#39;am. Representative Hall, does that answer your question
or do you have a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That answered the question. I want to make a comment then at this point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Hall for a comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My concern then is we&#39;re trying to protect the folks who are
ultimately receiving these loans, and this as far as the process has
provided that protection. We raised it for a reason. We don&#39;t want
to go back to that situation again. I don&#39;t know that this puts us
above or below any federal guideline amounts, but certainly, we
don&#39;t want to get back to where we were, and there was a reason we
did this. And I would hate to see us take away protections that we
currently have. If we&#39;re currently functioning well under the law,
we&#39;re providing the protection that was intended to be put there. I
don&#39;t know why we would take the protections away and possibly send
us back down that road. I&#39;d like to not go back down

  <p id="15:00">
  Representative Szoka your response..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that&#39;s a very good point, Representative Hall. And let me tell
you a little bit, what&#39;s different in the lending landscape that
prompted the increases and some of these other laws.. to where we are
today. The lending crisis was brought about, in large part, because
people who, otherwise, shouldn&#39;t have been purchasing houses -
because of their credit scores or their qualifications were allowed to
in the sub-prime mortgage industries, is what it was. And, currently,
that industry is gone. There are only four types of loans that you can
get today. Three of them are backed by the government. One&#39;s a VA
loan, there&#39;s an FHA loan, there&#39;s the USDA rural development
loan, and then there&#39;s the conventional conforming loan, which,
it&#39;s called conventional conforming loan cause it&#39;s normally
offered by banks and lenders, you can put down as much as twenty percent
and avoid PMI, that&#39;s for mortgage insurance, or you can put down as
little as five percent. However, in the conforming world, to put down
only five percent, your credit score has to be above 740. Credit score,
as you may know, is an indication of the probability that a consumer is
going to re-pay a loan, not just a general loan, within the next 90
days. The higher the score, the greater the probability that the loan
will be repaid. So, the system itself, has this error-trapping if you
will, that you, in a 740 the probability of not making a payment in the
next 90 days is like one in 535. So, the loans that were there, that
were a problem, sub-prime loans are, they simply don&#39;t exist
anymore. And for the ones where people have options, to put money down,
that&#39;s not government-backed, the system in essence protects against
somebody not being qualified. So, in my humble opinion, I think that the
protections are there, it&#39;s not legal protections if you.. well it
is, protections because a lot of that&#39;s determined by the federal
government as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir, Representative Martin next, I would remind you, after
your question, please put your button back to red. Representative
Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks mister chair, I pushed my button so as a legislator all I&#39;m
qualified to do is to either push a red or green button. So I&#39;m well
qualified, for this task.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? out of South Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for Representative Szoka. What I think I heard you say, was
that, right now, in addition to some of the federal protections, the
current situation in the market is also, either providing protection or
at least.. rendering these protections unnecessary based on the way
things ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I wish I would have..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Szoka.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wish I would have stated it like that, it would have taken three less
minutes. But you are correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, for Representative Martin?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, mister chair, I&#39;ve had fewer bad parachute landings than
you, I think. So my concern is, markets rise and fall, and they shift
different ways, I want to make sure that we&#39;re not, eliminating
protections that, although they may or may not be necessary in the
current markets, might become necessary in a future market. And, rather
than having to come back, and go through the process having to change it
again, why would we not just keep them in place?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Representative Szoka?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Fair question, my belief is that with pending federal legislation, the
way it&#39;s going, with Dodd-Frank in particular, that we&#39;re not
gonna see a return. But that is my opinion only.. a return to sub-prime
lending. Could that change? It could, and that&#39;s.. that&#39;s why
we&#39;re here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin, if you&#39;ll hold on, we&#39;ve now got
excitement from the back of the room, this young man over here, has
raised his hand. Please identify your self, and state your name and
where you come from, and go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Mortgage choice cares, I don&#39;t have a button to push, I&#39;ll
help out.. ?? I hope this helps you. We&#39;re talking about a period of
time about where we were, when there was a change ?? of a second change,
and where we are today. I think that we can all agree that, we had a
problem in the mortgage industry, and I think we will all agree that,
that problem seemed largest, and manifested itself the most, outwardly,
in 2000 and maybe early 2006 but 6, 7, 8, 9, maybe 10, maybe 11 and
we&#39;re starting to get back under control. So, in, before the ?? were
made, 2006 we had 4 claims, 2007 we had 9 claims and that was 7 broker 2
lender. 2008, the worst year, right? Probably that was the year of the..

  One, 2009 one then by this point we had those we had those volume
adjustments. Remember the volume adjustment doesn&#39;t stop because of
a ?? it&#39;s just a bigger bond in case there is something. 2010 one
claim three thousand eight hundred seventy five dollars and that was on
volume of I want to say 2010 was seventeen million dollars and about
seventy eighty transactions. In other words 2011 there was five claims.
For what was 2012 there was five claims. Not trying to say any claim on
a ?? is okay just want to make sure we see that I don&#39;t believe we
had a knee jerk reaction. I think we may have had a knee jerk reaction
that caused us to raise the bond ?? higher than every other state in our
US region except Arkansas. So we went way above everyone else now
we&#39;re seeing that those bond claims have come down substantially but
I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s a function of the bond claim the bond
premiums being raised because we weren&#39;t losing money there were
claims there the bonds that were already there were likely in place
there ?? cover them. I think what I&#39;m getting at is I don&#39;t
think we should have made the decision in 2014, 2015 based on what we
saw happen in 2008, 9, and 10 because lots of that has already changed
the market is entirely different now we have Dodd Frank we now have ??
hope that helps a little bit ?? but maybe give some color about what
happened in 2006 to 2012 which incorporates before and then the first
change and then the second change and then where we are today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir I still lose fights with my wife from things that happened
in 2008 and nine, and ten. Representative Hardister is next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I think the changes in this bill are well thought
out and reasonable and therefore I&#39;d like to be recognized for
favorable motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When appropriate Representative Hardister, Representative John Bradford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman just a question. It seems as though the spirit of
this bill is to help alleviate the premium pain that the industry is
feeling in relationship to actual premiums being paid out on claim. So
my question is has there been any analysis in not so much reducing the
level of coverage but maybe studying the premium because if very few
premiums are being paid then it seems to me maybe the insurance rates
could come down without adjusting coverage levels for consumers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll take it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s not the purpose of this committee to study that. And
that&#39;s a good question that needs to be studied because bond
premiums have been escalating not only for mortgage industry but other
industries. So I think we need to find somebody on the insurance
committee to take a look at that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairmain. I to some degree agree with what Mr. Tindall
said which seemed to say that the system we have in place now is
working. It seems this is a vetting process that ensures the people who
are actually bringing these loans then have some responsibility and who
you would take loans from is determined by that as well. So it seems
this function to debts some of the folks in the industry and as a result
we&#39;ve had less claims. I again am concerned that if we make these
changes there will be less or removal of the degree of debting that we
currently have which may be the reason we have these lower claims.
Finally as we compare ourselves to surrounding states I&#39;m wondering
as we talk about the rates that&#39;s around these states what&#39;s
their level of claims have been and was there a comparison done to say
here&#39;s the ideal amount based on the number of claims or some other
metrics or measurement done so that we could say other than the fact our
rate is higher that there&#39;s a reason or some causality something.
Does anyone have any information like that?

  <p id="25:00">
  Representative ?? for the first part.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the first part of that the difference in vetting and having been
through this myself I owned a I was a mortgage broker I worked for a
mortgage lender. When I was a mortgage broker the vetting that the bond
company did on me personally was essentially a little different if I had
applied for a twenty five thousand dollar bond or if I applied for a
seventy five thousand dollar bond. The difference was I had to pay more
for a higher bond. Because they get into your personal financials they
get into the financials of the company and I&#39;m not sure I don&#39;t
run a bonding company so I don&#39;t know where that level is. But by my
personal experience I don&#39;t see these moves are really that big. At
one time I had a bond for two hundred fifty thousand dollars and asked
me the same questions the same forms I had to fill out for two hundred
fifty thousand as I did for twenty five thousand so I don&#39;t know
there&#39;s a higher level of vetting for a higher bond. But that&#39;s
just based on my personal experience.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your question I don&#39;t have the statistics on the
claims for the state. Someone in the audience may have those but at this

Thank you. On all three of the bills ?? one and five but ?? has

If commissioner Banks is here I&#39;d like for him to answer that
himself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question Mr. Grace if commissioner Banks or yourself
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He&#39;ll have to answer that himself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question Mr. Grace does commissioner Banks or yourself have a comment or
endorsement or lack of endorsement for this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the risk of sounding old fashion but I have a great respect for the
constitutional government. And my understanding is the legislature makes
the laws ?? enforce the laws so I take no position on this bill. If your
asking me about the impact of ?? really we have to assess what that ??
might be and how we compensate for it in the legislation. So ?? I&#39;m
not sure exactly we have heard from the bond company ?? could be a
higher level of due diligence for higher bonds I don&#39;t know what the
rate point are there if it&#39;s twenty five, seventy five, a hundred ??
really no information about that. And so if we don&#39;t ?? out of the
bill ?? the legislature pass the laws and ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chairman Howard for follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I see in the bill that you would totally eliminate the bond. And that
would the law also allows us the commissioner to delay the bond ?? the
circumstances ?? that&#39;s current law that your able to do that. I
hear you say you don&#39;t have a comfort level one way or the other.
I&#39;d like you to be a little more assertive ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Grace we&#39;d appreciate your assertiveness on the issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? I&#39;m not trying to be evasive ?? we do indeed have discretionary
authority ?? the statue with our agency ?? bonding partner ?? as far as
comfort level I think it&#39;s clear that there is a threshold of net
worth that is a tipping point for ?? but beyond that we look at the
reputation of the company and the size of the company and the overall
financial strength of that company and so it will be done on a case by
case basis. So I&#39;m not sure how many companies will be graded ?? she
can probably answer that question.

  Virginia, Tennessee, South Carolina, Kentucky and Georgia – all states
that presently have bond levels lower than ours. There is no movement
afoot in any of those states to raise their bond levels, so they are
lower than us now, and they will still be lower than us if these new
levels go through. ?? Those states feel that their bonding levels are
adequate at levels lower than where we are now and even where we were
before. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Tendell. Representative Bell,
he has an answer. We will vote on this bill, Borrowing and Displacement
Bonds to Sponsors, in three minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess this will
partly answer Mr. Hall’s, or Representative Hall’s question. I do have a
security bond comparison of other states that the staff just received.
If you’d like to take a look at that, it may ask, or it may answer, or
not answer or partly answer your question, but this was part of the
information presented before the research committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions, further comments? Seeing none, Representative
Hardister is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chair. I move for a favorable report on House Bill 105. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All in favor of the motion, say “aye”. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 105 has passed; House Bill 104 is before us. Representative
Bell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is the last one of the day for this
committee. House Bill 104; Eliminate all Financial Statement
Requirements. House Bill 104 amends the Safe Mortgage License Act to
eliminate the requirement that the license or mortgage lender’s net
worth and funding capacity be demonstrated by an unqualified audit
statement of financial condition. This bill substitutes a requirement
that a license or mortgage lender need only attain the certified public
accountants’ confirmation of financial condition. Once again, this bill
is recommended by the Legislative Study Research Committee on Banking
Laws, and as mentioned before, Representative Blust was exactly right –
these two kind of mirror, and if the last bill passed, if for some
reason this does not – and I do hope this bill does pass, but if it does
not, I would work to get it amended before it hits the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Are there any comments from the gallery, other than from Mr.
Tendell? Seeing none, Representative Pendleton. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m
going to tell ya’ll about the dark side of my life. I hope - [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Pendleton, we only have 10 minutes left. I hope
?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] In 1985, I went on the State Banking Commission.
Great Grace was there and I enjoyed working with him, but in 1986, I was
approached by the American Civil Liberties Union, and you know I’m about
180 degrees the other way, and the young lady came over and she said
“We’ve got a problem with this bank, and I’ve heard you’re fair,” and I
said “Okay. What have you got?” She said “I want you to go in with me
and get all these banking companies regulated in North Carolina.” At
that time, at least ??, but if it was a national bank or a state charter
bank, you weren’t regulated. People could just come in there and rape
the folks and go back wherever they came from. So I did. I went in for
the front page story. There were a few Republicans in the general
assembly and I knew all of them, and one of them called me up and he
said “Gary, I’m coming ??”, and so he still thinks he can do that ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not my bill. I prefer not to comment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Anyway, I am totally opposed to this. I don’t want to loosen it
up for mortgage bankers. I worked hard to get that bill passed 30 years
ago; I don’t think we ought to loosen the standard up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Pendleton. If that’s the dark days of your
life, you’ve lived a cherished life. Representative Bell. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Jeter, if you would like to put forth an
amendment to Representative Pendleton, transfer him to the digs, I’d be
more than happy to accept that friendly amendment today. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is out of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just
to let you know, your larger mortgage companies, this would not actually
apply, so you’re talking about a handful of small mortgage companies
across the state, around 100 or less, so this would actually apply to
those small businesses here in our state. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Here’s my concern with this
bill: You’re taking an unqualified audited statement requirement, which
is the gold standard

  And you’re replacing it with something that has absolutely no real
credibility as to accuracy because the audit, when you do an audit
someone has to, an independent, someone unrelated to the management of
the company, independent trained CPA comes in and does certain tests and
runs mathematical analysis to know what kinds of tests, how many, how
many things to examine, to get a certain confidence level that the
numbers in those statements are accurate and even the unqualified is
still there is a possibility that you won’t detect a problem, but the
unqualified means that the independent auditor renders an opinion that
based upon these tests in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles these financial statements are accurate, but it’s within a
range. A compellation is just you have, you take all the documents and
you put the in financial statement form. There’s no, absolutely no
confidence that what they handed you is accurate, what the managers
handed you is accurate, so I’m just wondering from the Commissioners
here how are you gonna know that their net worth is at least $100,000
and that they have liquidity of $1 million? How will you replace this
confidence that you can have to some degree with the unqualified audit?
How would you replace that confidence with just a compellation? That’s
what I’m wondering. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Grace before you answer that
question Representative Szoka would like to comment and then we will
allow you the opportunity if you feel so inclined. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, allow me to respond to this, and you’re right, it
is the grand standard. At today’s rates it’s about six gold ?? the ten
to pay for an audit and that’s exactly part of the point. It costs
between $5-10 thousand for audits for very small companies. Once again
things have changed in the last several years and lenders, to qualify
for a million dollar warehouse line, I mean, the way it goes is if a
person comes to ?? to a lender to get a loan, they lend money on this
warehouse line. Now, to qualify for a warehouse line is not easy. I have
never done that. I’ve seen the prices, I’ve seen the paperwork, but
there’s no bank out there that’s gonna tell anyone that they have
authority to lend on that line for a million dollars without doing an
incredibly thorough analysis of their financials and everything else and
surprisingly many lenders do not require audited financials to do that.
Some do, some don’t. So what we’re saying here is that what is similar
in my mind at least to the bonding issue, that we’re overqualifying
people in order to let them do their job. You already have to get a
million dollars, like I say you go through an incredible amount of work
to get that and then to pay somebody $5-10 thousand, a CPA to do an
audited financial, it just seems like it’s too much and that’s why, the
committee heard a lot of these same points come up, some of the other
ones and worked through this and that’s why the recommendation came out
like it did. Hopefully that helps a little bit. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Grace would you like to add. You don’t have to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
Chairman ?? but I don’t ?? so. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s always wise to
heed her advice. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Again with respect to the audit I can
say that Representative Blust is correct that a compilation really gives
us no assurance of the accuracy of the numbers. Really more to the point
does an unqualified opinion or a ?? that gives an opinion, an opinion of
the competitor that this is a ?? description and we want to ?? and ??
for perfecting that for the public ?? product. That’s something you’ll
be hearing tomorrow and next week ?? on the presidential ?? . So it
would give us a greater, a higher level or assurance so speaking to our
leaders we would have to respond. We would respond

  ?? I think it&#39;s fair to say ?? have to look at ?? a more closer look
at ?? the state ?? to get a better ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I&#39;m not in this
industry, I only deal with lenders as far as being a closing attorney.
But what struck me from our committee&#39;s investigation here is
you&#39;re talking about licensees that have to have a net worth of
$100,000 at least. Five to ten thousand dollars every single year is
five to ten percent of your entire net worth being used on these audits.
And the only other two words I have to add are Arthur Anderson. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Representative Jordan. Representative Blust do you
have a follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I understand it would be a
relatively big expense for a smaller firm than it would be for a bigger
firm to eat the cost, because I don&#39;t think these would be that
expensive audits because you don&#39;t have any inventory, the
receivables would all be from people you had screened in the lending
process, so it seems like the lending audit would be a pretty simple
one. There&#39;s no depreciation and you&#39;ve got one main creditor
who one confirmation letter could take care of that. But I do think
you&#39;re going to end up shifting the costs, and I know that&#39;s a
good argument for your bill, but you&#39;re going to shift the cost from
the firm I think on to the public in that they&#39;re going to need more
people to go out and look at these small lenders and try to make sure
that everything&#39;s copacetic at all these little firms, so I think
the cost is going to come somewhere and the bill comes down to will it
come from the tax payer or will it come from the company? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Representative Blust. We are going to vote this bill
at ten &#39;till. Representative Hall, Representative Baumgartner will
have questions, they will make them short, they will answer and we will
vote at ten &#39;till. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Your larger mortgage companies,
they still maintain their ?? they still have to comply with all the
financial statements. It&#39;s your smaller ones that this will actually
benefit. During the committee process, as we were going through this, we
did actually have some of these business owners come in. Some of them
are here today at the chairman&#39;s discretion, instead of imaging the
cost or projecting the cost, we can let you know exactly what they cost.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. I will just make a brief statement. I have registered my
concern earlier about removing the safeguards we have in the system that
have allowed us to recover to this point and now once again we seem to
be removing another safeguard. I certainly can&#39;t support this
happening, especially in light of what we just did. And I would have to
oppose this at this time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Baumgartner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I thought Representative Blust
made a good point here about how the people that are really paying for
this are the mortgagees, because the people that are originating them
have to pass the cost on like every other cost and the people that are
getting the loans are the ones paying for all of this. And having done,
audited and certified and every other kind of financial statement you
can do, I can tell you that the difference in them is about five or ten
thousand dollars. Other than that, it may or may not be much different.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Baumgartner. Representative
Martin, and then if the will of the committee is if they have more
questions, I&#39;m happy to have the will of the committee and we will
be happy to finish this next week if you want. Otherwise, is there
anyone, Representative Earl. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Somebody ?? All in favor, sit down please. [LAUGHTER] Please. The motion
still has to be voted on. It does not? It was seconded. All in favor of
the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Meeting is
adjourned.
