Speaker: The sergeant in arms will close the doors. The prayer will be
offered by Representative Susan Fisher. Members and visitors of the
gallery please stand and remain standing for the pledge of allegiance.
Representative: Good afternoon. As a parting gift, before Representative
Roth left this body, she handed over the book of prayers that were put
together by Mary Lou Finlayer. I have borrowed from that book today. The
Lord be with you, let us pray. Oh God of children and clowns, martyrs
and bishops, saints and sinners, and all of us other folk who do not
quite fit any of the above, thank you for this day, for this chance to
love, hope and laugh. Thank you for friends who make a claim upon our
hearts, for teachers who open our minds to new and wondrous thoughts, to
musicians who help us sing along the way, to people who take stands
rather than polls, for leaders who do something rather than talk about
everything, for those who disturb our consciousness and nudge us from
our comfortable positions, for those who attempt beauty rather than
curse ugliness, and thank you for all those brave soldiers of peace
everywhere so that others may have food and a safe resting place. Amen.

County, the Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to

County Commissioners Buck Golden and Larry Phillips. Representative
Stevens are they at the chamber? We can have you rise. Let's welcome

the House be at ease. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, for the most

the appropriate time we will take up House Resolution 50, which is

to move to the other House Resolution on the calendar for adoption

[Speaker Changes] House Resolution 861, a House Resolution honoring the
2012 Great Places in North Carolina, the House resolves.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] Speak on the resolution.
[Speaker Changes] The lady is recognized to debate the resolution.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And the people the Speaker
just recognized in the gallery are part of a group that has been
honoring the great places to live in North Carolina. And the reason I
filed the resolution is, one of the first places recognized, was my
hometown of Mt. Airy, North Carolina. We received an award last year for
one of the great places to live, and I can tell you that Mt. Airy is a
wonderful place to live. I was born and raised in Mt. Airy, but I had my
period of time living away, and so it was by choice that I went back and
found it as a wonderful community of people and places and things to do.
It's a place where you come, you feel at home. And I think that's part
of the qualities of what they're looking at as they honor additional
great places. This year––and it's terrible that I can't remember exactly
who was honored this year, and so maybe some of the other members want
to stand up and speak about their hometown being honored.</p>

Senate committee substitute number three for House Bill 817. The bill
has been entitled An Act to Strengthen the Economy Through Strategic
Transportation Investments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is the bill that we passed with 102 and sent to the Senate and I
would concede they took the blocks out and played with them, but when
they were through they put them back where they belonged. We do have
this as a two day bill for some material change, but the material change
related to technical corrections from Department of Transportation. The
most significant of which was on the public/private partnerships where
817 original said the maximum length of a contract was 50 years from the
date the contract was signed and it’s been changed so that it’s 50 years
from the date that the project actually opens for toll operation so that
would be slightly longer. It adds the construction time on the front
end. Mr. Speaker, for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker I move that the house do now concur with the third committee
substitute from the Senate for House Bill 817.

817, the bill remains on the calendar.
House Bill 219. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate committee substitute for House Bill 219, the bill’s been entitled
An Act to Modernize the Ways Children Born Out of Wedlock are Referenced
in the General Statutes by Removing References to Illegitimate When Used
in Connection With an Individual and to Bastardy to Allow to Allow a
Child Born Out of Wedlock to Inherit from a person Who Died Prior to or
Within One year After the Birth of that Child If Paternity Can Be
Established by DNA Testing and to Make Other Technical Corrections to

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House. This is a
hybrid bill that we are looking at in the fact that this House
originally passed House Bill 219 that was sponsored by Representatives
Glazier, Stam, Faircloth, and Michaux which dealt with changing the
language concerning illegitimate in these statutes and using the
reference to children born out of wedlock. In a separate bill introduced
by Representative Stam and myself, House Bill 652, we passed the
reference to children who were born out of wedlock being able to take...</p>

from their father. Their father died within one year after their birth
if paternity could be established by DNA testing. But each one of these
bills got the appropriate Senate judiciary, the decision was made to
take the language in 652 and put it in with 219. What you have before
you no is a combination of those two bills and I make a motion that we
concur with the Senate.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion and to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, you might
remember this back in April we passed this 114 to nothing. It went over
to the Senate and they made one small change. They took the department
of insurance out of this on the front end. When these bail bondsmen buy
their shields, they’re going to buy it themselves instead of going to
the department. It still has to be uniform, it still has to be legal. At
the end, if there is any problems, the department of insurance can still
revoke the license. Everything is still good. Other than that,
everything is the same.

[speaker changes]  The gentleman is recognized for a motion and to
debate the motion.
[speaker changes] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will make a motion that we
concur with the senate.  This bill after it passed the house did go to
the senate judiciary when I presented it there was a modification which
was technical in nature of substituting the words a conditional
discharge in place of deferred prosecution.  This was a suggestion made
by staff and is the right thing to do.  That is the only change that was
made. It was done with my concurrence.  It passed over there as well as
out of the senate and I ask that you please support the motion to
concur.

[speaker changes] The gentleman is recognized to make a motion and
debate the motion.
[speaker changes]  I'm going to make a motion not to concur on the
senate version of house bill 649. I started the morning today thinking
we had a small technical problem.  I found out it's actually more than
that.  There's one issue here, it's on page 3 lines 34 and 35. Under the
3 provisions, or 4 provisions rather, for which small employer plans can
be rated.  Letter d is the one in question.  This passed out of the
house saying tobacco use except at the rates should not be more than 1
and a half times. This bill now says 1 and 1 fifteenth, but that's a
technical mistake by the person who drafted this.  It actually is
supposed to read, according to what the senate wanted to pass back to
us, 1.15 times, in other words a 15% rate of.  I'm told by the actuarial
people in the health insurance business for that number to be
actuarially sound that that number needs to be a lot closer to 1.3 than
1.15.  So I'm suggesting that we not cancer and send this to conference
and hopefully we will have a very short conference and straighten out
this one issue.  This was done by the way as I understand on the senate
floor as an amendment without discussion.  There was no rhyme or reason
or soundness to the reason that this 1.15 got stuck in. It just got
stuck in because a senator wanted that number stuck in.  So I suggest
that we not concur. Thank You.

This bill really wasn’t necessary or advisable. We have some places
where there is a rebuttal for presumption and that’s because the person
might flee. In some proposed legislation--we have one involving
immigrants--because they might flee but, of all the people who wouldn’t
flee, I guess it’d be the people who own the house that you’re going to
abate. It seems to me the rebuttable presumption here is counterfactual;
that is, it really is not a case where we should say that there’s
presumed to be no reasonable grounds for granting bail other than
Section 7, so I urge the adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate, on the amendment. If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by
Representative Stam for the Senate Committee substitute of Senate Bill
264. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will let the machine record the vote, 115 having voted
affirmative, none in the negative. The amendment passes. We’re now back
on the bill as amended. Ladies and gentlemen, the amendment offered by
Representative Stam changes the title; therefore, we cannot take third
reading today. We can either, if there’s anyone wishing to debate it
today, let’s just go ahead and do it since we need to burn up a little
bit of time. Otherwise, let’s have a nice quiet vote tomorrow. This
brings us to the end of the calendar. We understand that House
Resolution 50 is currently being taken up in the Senate. We would expect
to receive that shortly by special message. We do expect family of
Senator East to be in the chambers. If the House will be at ease for a
moment, we’ll try to give you an update.</p>

Members, just as an update, the Chair understands that the Senate is
currently taking up the resolution on Senator East as we speak, so we
would expect to be able to take that up momentarily. The Chair would
expect some discussion and debate. We’re going to take care of some

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Series of re-referrals. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. Senate bill 336,
Collaboration among State Entities, is presently in the Committee on
Appropriations. I move that it be removed from the Committee on
Appropriations and calendared pursuant to rule 36b for tomorrow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection so ordered. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s
see… House Bill 329 is… Mr. Speaker, House Bill 329, which is the 2013
Budget Act… Strike that. Mr. Speaker, House bill 60, Transfer of Indian
Cultural Center, was removed from yesterday’s calendar for next Monday.
After consultation with the Appropriations chairs, I believe that bill
is ready to go and we could actually take that bill up today. It’s a
concurrence vote on the Senate changes as to House Bill 60 if the
Speaker wishes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members again, if you’ll listen to
Representative Moore and the Chair. Just to make use of our time, unless
there’s objection, Representative Moore is moving that we took a bill
that was for concurrence – we were re-calendaring it – to go ahead and
take it on the calendar for immediate consideration. It’s got the Indian
Cultural Center. Is there objection? If not, so ordered. [SPEAKER

bill needs to be removed from Government and then referred to… just sent
on over to Appropriations. It also has a serial referral to Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection so ordered. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Senator East was a memorable person. Once you
met him, I can assure you, you’d never forget him. He was just an
all-around good guy. And he was a good guy who wore many, many hats. And
I want to go over just a few of the hats that he wore. First, he was a
husband. And he was a husband to his dear wife Connie who had passed a
few years before he did. He was a father to his lovely daughter Gina,
and he was so proud of her and he loved her so much. He was a
grandfather to his grandsons, Matthew and Jacob. And oh, how proud of
those two grandsons was he. He was a father-in-law to his, I’m sure he
thought of him as a son, Mickey Southern. And all he, so many times he
would reference him and if you had a law-enforcement question, he would
send you to Mickey. He wore the hat of public servant and in that one it
was in three different capacities. He began his career as a Winston
Salem Police Officer and he retired from Winston Salem. And he worked
with my father-in-law and mother-in-law there who knew him quite well.
He was a country commissioner in Surry County. And he was a state
senator, the capacity which most of us know him. But the hat that he
wore that was most important to me, was he was my friend. Senator East
just loved life. Never have I ever seen a human being who loved life
more than he. He loved his motor home – which he may have been banned
from coming into my neighborhood with it for knocking over several
mailboxes but uh, we’ll let that story slide on. But he loved the motor
home and he had a big picture of Pilot Mountain painted on the back and
he was so proud of where he was from. He loved his motorcycles. Oh, how
did he love them. And I remember when he bought his first motorcycle and
he was getting back into riding. And I don’t know much about them but. .

you had a little platform where you put both of your feet on the front,
and I gave him such a hard time about that bike and told him it was a
scooter, and that wasn't a motorcycle, and a few weeks later I heard the
all so familiar sound of a Harley-Davidson out in my driveway, and it
was Sen. East on his new Harley-Davidson and man, did he love his
motorcycles. He loved spending time at the beach, he loved his family.
Again, he was just an all around good person to be around. He was so fun
to talk to, he had so many stories I couldn't even begin to recount and
to tell you all the stories that the man had told me. He always had a
funny joke, he always had an encouraging word to say to you. In short,
I'll just say Sen. East, we miss you. And over this past weekend, my
father and I were taking just a moment and recollecting some of our
memories about Sen. East, and I think it sums it up best with what my
dad said. He said, &quot;Son, they just don't make 'em like that
anymore.&quot; I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House. I can't second enough
what Rep. Holloway just said in very good style. I had the pleasure and
the good fortune to get to serve with Don East in the Senate, and it's
as Rep. Holloway said, it was a- even what we do down here is serious,
it was a rip-roaring good time to get to serve with Sen. East. And he
didn't change to the very end, he was the same when he came back to his
second stint. And in the Senate, one of the big differences is because
of fewer numbers, you don't have to be at your station to vote. The
people hanging out in the back when the Lt. Governor calls the vote and
starts raising their hand, they'll say &quot;So and so, yes, Sen. So and
so yes,  Sen. So and so no,&quot; so Sen. East hung out in the back  a
lot. Back in the 90s you could still smoke in the chambers and there'd
be a little smoking group back there, so if you got too tired, you could
wander back in the back with Sen. East and some of the others and have a
pretty good time while we were legislating. He did have a little bit of
trouble with names, because to the end, would always call me Sen. Blush.
But he had a little pet name, he had a way, he was always kind of
picking at you good natured, but it was always a pleasure to see him.
One thing  I've missed this session a lot, is sometimes in a mad rush to
get over to the LOB, you go through and a lot of times there'd be Sen.
East out there smoking a cigarette, a lot of times with Linda Johnson,
and I'd always have to stop and be a little bit later to committee to
hear the latest stories and discuss things. The last time I saw him was,
he did have a heart for the  less fortunate, the last time I saw him was
at a fundraiser for Rep. Holloway. So even to the end, he was lending a
helpful hand. Just a great guy, great sense of humor, probably as good
as anybody other than maybe Rep. Roger West, and it was a great treat in
the last couple years because Roger West started hanging out with Sen.
East, and those are some of the best dinners I've gone to, and it was- I
can't even tell you all the jokes. But it was always a good time, he
made it fun to serve in the General Assembly, and I think we all know
that if you don't keep a good sense of humor and laughing, this place
might get to you and he was one of the great people for keeping morale
high. So he was a great friend, great Senator, and I am glad I got to
serve with him, and I commend the resolution to you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House, and friends in the gallery, what I want to tell
you is my first experience with Sen. East was when I came down as a
Representative. And one of the first tasks I was asked to do by the
county and various issues was to equalize the occupancy tax throughout
the entire county. For those of you who know Sen. East, he would never
vote yes for a tax of any kind. So imagine my delight at getting him to
present a bill over in the Senate, and over in Senate committees, that
he was going to vote no on! But he did it for me and said, &quot;I'm
going to vote no, but Rep. Stevens has brought this over here, so here
it is.&quot; And he was very helpful in that way. But the one big  thing
about Sen. East was he did not consider himself a politician. It was not
about him to be here, his greatest joy came</p>

We were very excited in Wilts when our senatorial district changed from
the 45th to the 30th because we would get to have the honor to be served
by Senator East. And I got to know Senator East through the campaign
trail as he was going around campaigning in this new county for him. But
he fit in to Wilkes perfectly. Because as Sarah just said, he always
opened up and said I’m just a simple farmer from Pilot Mountain, and I
need your help to get elected. And that fits in really well to our area.
And I was in Republican headquarters speaking and all of a sudden I see
this pick-up truck fly into the parking lot, and back up as quick as it
can. And it came about 2 feet from the door of the Republican
headquarters there at the big windows. And it was Don. And he jumps out
of his truck and he's in blue jeans, and a flannel shirt. And he bust
into Republican headquarters. And just then I'd finished speaking and
sat down. He said boys I've got about 350 signs I need you to put up, we
need to get started. And that was typical Don East. He was just a
pleasure to get to know him in the time that I got to know him, and he
served his area wonderfully in his time down here. And I commend the
resolution to you.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. I came into the House of Representatives in 2005.
I called that the good old days of lobbying. I got here at a time when
lobbyists could do certain things that they, they cannot do now. One of
the things that they always did was to somehow promote charitable
causes. And one of the lobbyist asked me to be on his company's team in
the NC Beautiful golf tournament, at the Southern Pines. Well I was
excited to accept and they were four man teams, and Don East was one of
my team. Now a couple of years later you know that we revamped all of
that ?? stuff, and we did it rightfully. But I know that Don East and I
would never have gotten the opportunity to be as close as we were, had
it not been for that one little 2 day golf tournament. And I'm a tell
you he was a pretty good golfer, he was immensely strong but he was also
immensely human, immensely fun, and I miss him, and I commend the
resolution.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion for pertaining to today's calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker, House resolution 50, which is on the
calendar, move that that Bill be removed from the calendar and referred
to the committee of rules. We just adopted the Senate joint resolution
therefore that bill as a House resolution to simply go back to the
rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection? So ordered. Representative Howard
please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To make a motion, Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister Speaker, just a few minutes ago...a bill
was...a motion was made to pull a bill out of the finance committee and
that bill be sent back to rules. I would like to move that the bill be
returned to the finance committee where the committee has already taken
action with respect to a public hearing that is scheduled for 4pm on
Monday afternoon. I would ask that the body vote to return that bill to
the finance committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection? Objection having been raised. The
motion, Ladies and Gentlemen, by ? of the House that with or without
objection, the motion would have just carried but because the motion has
been objected to this will require a vote to cause the re-referral to
occur. Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker, Members, this bill was removed from
the committee on finance and sent back to the committee on rules for it
to sit there for a while. I would remind the Lady that the finance
committee has not taken action on this bill.  The finance chair told me
told me, after we had already referred it, that she is scheduling a
public hearing for next Monday. There's been no notice sent out. This is
the normal course of re-referrals on bills and I moved that the bill be
sent back to the rules committee. It was done and now there's an action
to bring it back to the finance committee.  Members were asked that
while the process to work is for the bill to remain in the rules
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate that motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker, this issue is dealing with the city of
Durham and this isn't the first time that this issue has been before
this house. The issue was defeated last session.  It's back again. If
you've ever heard of upside down annexation, this is the poster child.
This is a development or developer that is wanting to force the town of
Durham to provide utilities. I have spoken with the bill's sponsor...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker I ask to point an order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman may state his point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker, it appears that the Lady is wanting to
debate the bill, which would not proper. The motion today is simply
whether the bill should go through a committee and I would point out
that the rules committee would not be taking any final action on this
bill anyway. The bill's going to sit there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman's point is well taken. If the General
Lady will confine her comments to the motion before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I certainly will try.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is the third time that the Rules chairman has
taken the bill out of finance and sent it back to rules. The finance
committee chairs met this morning after receiving a letter requesting a
public hearing from a member of that committee asking for a public
hearing. We did take action. Those notices will go out. That public

? afternoon. I just ask you go through the proper process. I didn't move
the bill back to Rules when three people on the floor. But the Rules
chairman did. I can't tell you what's wrong with this bill, but if it
smells funny, it's funny. So I ask you to vote with the process staying
in place and that the bill go back to the Finance committee. I have
spoken to the bill's sponsor, and that is his wishes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I'm gonna vote no on the motion. Rep.
Blackwell and I had a bill that had really no Finance implications to it
all. It's shared by research staff, and yet it was sent to Finance about
two months ago and has not yet been calendared. You may remember that on
the floor. I'm voting no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, and this is a matter, as Rep. Howard
indicated, that affects Durham, and it's been in here, and it's been
here for any number of times. It's been held up in Rules because there
are some things that are happening that we -- but since you won't let me
talk about the bill -- This bill has been jockeyed back and forth
between the chairman of the Rules committee and others who are trying to
stop something or trying to do something in Durham that Durham really
doesn't want to do. Now the bill went back to Finance, and there was
request for a public hearing to allow the citizens of Durham to come in
and be heard on that bill, and that's what has happened. Now that was
done this morning, and now we get the bill sent back to Rules for what
reason? It just doesn't make any sense at all because the citizens of
Durham would like to have a public hearing on it and to try to do
something with this issue that's before them once and forever. And I
would hope that you would vote with the motion made by the chair of the
Finance committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Robert Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to concur with what the Rules Chairman
has said. I do stop by and check, I mean the chair of the Finance
committee, I do check with the chair of the Finance committee each
morning to see what's scheduled, and this morning when I stopped by, she
did tell me that there would be a public hearing on this. It had been
scheduled. We would have it next Monday, and around 11:00 today, I had
some citizens from the City of Durham to stop by to confirm they were
looking forward to being at the public hearing on Monday. So there has
been action taken, and we need to follow through with we have planned in
our group. And I urge you to send 315 back to the Finance committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Moore, please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate on the motion if I might.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, in all due respect to my seat mate, and
Rep. Howard pointed that there has not been any action taken by the
committee. If the chairs have decided to send out a public notice,
that's fine. But I don't believe, unless -- There's been no public
notice read in. There's no notice advised of that. There's been no
action, Members. And if this is a normal course, I don't understand the
objection of the Finance chair to the bill going back --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker --
[speaker changes] -- a lot of times when bills --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the gentleman yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ? note. The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Why do you insist on this bill not getting a fair
hearing where it's supposed to be, Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I don't take that position at all, Rep. Michaux,
and Rep. Hall's in the Chamber. He and I have had a lot of conversations
over the last couple weeks, and I think he would agree we've had very
good dialogue in discussing this bill. He's nodding affirmatively. And
this is Sen. McKissick's bill Sen. McKissick has spoken to me about it.
I've dealt with Rep. Hall on it. It's -- this bill is simply      the
only thing before us today -- If you want to defeat the bill or never
hear it, that's fine, Rep. Michaux. The only thing today is whether the
bill gets sent back to the Finance Committee or whether it's sent to the
Rules committee. And I --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, may I ask another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You've already said this is gonna sit in committee.
You've already made that statement, that it's just gonna sit there. If
you and I both want some action on the bill, why won't you let it go
through the process that has already been outlined?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, the way the process would work, of course, is to
try to see if the stakeholders can come to an agreement. It's my
understanding -- again, Rep. Hall and I've been a party to conversations
with a number of folks --that the stakeholders are [CUTS OFF]</p>

Discussing this are trying to find a resolution, those folks in your
city government and in others. I'm not involved in those conversations.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
May I ask another question?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
I yield to one final question.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The gentleman yields to a final question.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Do you know who chairs the Durham delegation?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
I don't
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
I do and you haven't spoken to me.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Well, I think we've spoken about it some but not as certainly as much
detail as I have with Representative Hall. But anyway, members I would
ask that you vote no on the motion. Just leave the bill where it is at
this point.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Mister Speaker
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
To debate the bill a final time and a motion.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The lady is recognized to debate the motion a second time.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Folks, if you look at your rule book you're going to see in your rule
book and I believe the rule is 39 pointed. And the sponsor of this bill
is a senator and I spoke to him less than an hour ago. There is
something in the bill that they would like to see happen and that's our
intent, to have the public hearing and let this issue be properly
discussed and allow the people to be heard. I ask
you to send it back to finance where we will have the bill heard with
the public hearing on Monday and action will be taken on Wednesday. I
just ask that you read your rules and let's play by the rules if we have
rules.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
To ask a question of Representative Moore.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Certainly
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The gentleman yields.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister Speaker. Representative Moore, I received a number of
emails with people who are not in favor of this bill and my concern is
we're sitting here on Tuesday to get out notice for a public hearing on
Monday at 4 o'clock, which may or may not work with a lot of people's
schedules and not familiar with that a lot. Is that sufficient time to
have both sides noticed enough to be able to get into the General
Assembly area to be able to speak on their position for or against?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
I don't know the answer to that, Representative Avila, I don't know.
Representative Howard first told me about a public notice after the bill
had already been removed from her committee. So I don't know but I can
tell you that I've had good conversations with Senator McKissick and
Representative Hall on this. If at some point folks want to have a
public hearing on it, fine. That's fine. But at this point I'm just
asking, I'd like a chance to talk with Senator McKissick and frankly to
find out what the objections are that the finance chair has to it. I
hadn't heard what those are.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Yes sir. Representative Moore, just a quick question.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Glad to
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The gentleman yields
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
If the bill goes to the rules, are we going to have a public hearing on
Monday in the Rules Committee?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
No. I wouldn't plan on taking a public hearing up on it. Rules Committee
a lot of times is a point of transit from one committee to another for
whatever. And so, the point of this is to simply put it there, let it
sit there and give the folks an opportunity to talk. Representative Hall
can tell you, they've been very good in frank conversations and I see us
as trying to facilitate folks reaching an agreement on this.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you. Thank you, that's all I needed.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The question before the House is the motion is to rerefer the House
committee substitute number 2 to Senate Bill 315 from rules to finance.
All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 75 having

Bill 246.
