Ladies and gentlemen of the House.  If the House will come to order. We
have a very special guest in the House today. You’ll hear more about it
after the certificate is read and after comments from Representative
Sozka. At this time, if the House will come to order, the clerk will
read the certificate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
North Carolina House of Representatives. Certificate of Recognition at
Acknowledgement whereas the Special Operations Forces canine serves as a
force multiplier and saves soldiers’ lives every night on the battle
fields of foreign lands and whereas special operation canines are
specifically selected based on their drive, intelligency, capability to
make decisions similar to the traits of their human counterpart. The
special operations forces soldier.  Therefore only the best of the best
are selected and even fewer are completely trained.  Whereas recognizing
that these canine actions in combat are heroic, facing imminent danger
with courage that sets a standard for all others.  These special
operation canines have paid the ultimate price for not only their
handlers and mates but for this great nation.  In whereas a Special
Operations Forces Canine Memorial Foundation is a small group of
military and civilian canine professionals who recognize the value of
the special operations forces canine service to our country during war,
and whereas current there are no Special Operations Forces Canine
Memorials in the United States or anywhere in the world and the memorial
placed at the Airborne and special operation museum in Fayetteville,
North Carolina is the first recognition for these heroic animals.  And
whereas a memorial will be dedicated the 27th day of July in the year
2013 at 10:00 a.m. at the Airborne and Special Operations Museum in
Fayetteville, North Carolina in recognition of the 58 special operations
forces canine for their ultimate sacrifice to our country and for  the
lives saved because of their service throughout the war on terror.  Now
therefore, I , Thom Tillis speaker of the North Carolina House of
Representatives, do hereby extend gratitude and recognition to the 58
special forces canines that died in combat.  And urge all members of the
North Carolina General Assembly to support this historic recognition and
acknowledgement of the Special Operations Forces Canine Memorial to be
dedicated at the Airborne and Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville,
North Carolina. Speaker Thom Tillis, attested by Denise Weeks, principal
clerk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Sozka is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This coming Saturday marks the culmination of a
project to honor special operations canines who have died in the service
of our country. The role that military working dogs have filled has been
absolutely vital in our most recent wars.  The true significance of
these canine’s contributions is that they have saved the lives of
countless American special operations soldiers and operations ranging
throughout Iraq and Afghanistan.  A memorial to these fallen heroes is
something which is absolutely appropriate. It has been sought for years
by the special operations forces canine memorial foundation. You now,
many times dreams don’t get acted upon unless there’s someone with a
vision to make the dream a reality.  And we have with us today in the
gallery a person who’s made this memorial a reality.  And His name is
Harrison Burkhardt. He’s 17 years old, he’s homeschooled and he’s
currently a Life Scout with Troop 745 in  Eastover North Carolina in
Cumberland County. Harrison was seeking an Eagle Scout project that
would make a difference in people’s lives. So when he heard about this
idea it was exactly the kid of thing he’d been looking for. Harrison
raised over 5,00 dollars, thanks to the generosity of the community and
those who recognize the value of special operations forces canines and
the lives that they have saved. He was responsible for the landscaping,
the sidewalks, and the stems to mark the area for the memorial markers.
You know a lot of times one person</p>

Representative: …with a vision and with a sense of purpose, can
accomplish a lot of things. I thought it was very appropriate to
recognize this young in making his dream become a reality in helping his
community. There is one more thing I would like to mention, and you may
have seen him in the back of the house floor. With us on the house floor
today is retired military working dog, brick k 049, patrol narcotics
detection dog. In a few minutes the speaker will recognize brick. Let me
tell you why he is here. For all of us who have served in the armed
forces, and it doesn’t matter whether you are marine, army, coast guard
– and within the army you have all the different branches, you’re a
combined arms team. Brick is not a special operations dog. I have met
him on several occasions. He is a retired military working force dog and
is here supporting the dogs that have fallen in combat, for us to
remember and take a look at what these awesome dogs’ lives are like. On
this Saturday at 10 o’clock, at the deerborn special operations museum
in Fayetteville, you are all invited as my personal guests to come down
and see the dedication of this memorial for special operations working
dogs. There is one more thing, on your desk you will see a little flyer
that talks about military working dogs. The army, and all the armed
forces, for some reason, still consider these brave heros as equipment.
I look at equipment is a computer, pencil – something like that. So when
these dogs get through their useful services, the armed forces do not
really have a plan on what they do with them. They hope that someone
adopts them. In that brochure you will see a foundation that helps place
these American heros into their final home. So if you are interested you
can apply to adopt a military retired working dog, or you can certainly
donate to the foundation which helps with the airfare to fly the dogs to
their final home, wherever it is in the U.S. I thank you for your
attention. Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak.
Speaker: Ladies and gentleman, Brick was a MP. I met brick back at the
coca cola 600. He was a MP when he served. He served for, in dog years,
56 years, in human years, 8 years. Retired on June 12th. He also won an
award from the military dog association. You think about the services
they provide to the country, and the safety to our members in armed
services: I think it is extraordinary. Today, also, we are declaring
brick as an honorary member sergeant in arms. Brick, why don’t you
approach the chamber so everybody can see him.

Speaker: I now know we have at least one fast sergeant in arms.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mister Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I'd ask
that you please support this amendment. North Carolina was very
fortunate this year to have three of it's towns and cities recognized
and the good folks from Thomasville could not be here today. And at the
request of the Davidson County delegation, what this amendment would do
is remove them from this resolution with the intent to recognize them in
the Spring. So, I would ask for your support of this amendment.

Whereas the All-American City Award program was founded in 1949 to
recognize cities for their civic achievements. And whereas to be named
an All-American City, a community must demonstrate innovation,
inclusiveness, civic engagement and cross sector collaboration by
describing successful efforts to address pressing local challenges and
must briefly tell its community's story listing two of their most
pressing challenges and three outstanding community projects.
And whereas on June 16, 2013 the towns of Dunn and Garner were named two
of the ten communities across the country to win the All-American City
Award, which is often called the Nobel Prize of civic accomplishment.
Whereas the town of Dunn, located in Harnett County, was incorporated by
the General Assembly in 1887 and named for Bennett R. Dunn, construction
engineer for the Atlantic Coastline Railroad.
And whereas Dunn's outstanding community projects for the All-American
City Award included the involvement of the town's civic leaders in the
planning, negotiation and financial investment in the development of a
new fifty bed Central Harnett Hospital; revitalization of the town's
city center, which includes the burial of power lines and
telecommunication cables; renovation of the aged water and sewer system;
replacement of the pavement; incorporation of attractive brick and
cement features and grants to downtown businesses to update their
facades and the</p>

annually offers various programs from athletics to SAT/ACT test
preparation to up to 300 young people ages six to 18, and offers teams
the opportunity to join PAL Youth Leadership Council which promotes
volunteerism, public service, and an understanding of civics and

reincorporated by the General Assembly 1905, and named for H.C. Garner,
the town's founder. And whereas Garner's three best projects for the
All-American City Award included the new 500,000 Garner Veteran's

Garner area veterans who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our
country, and the artwork of world famous Raleigh-based sculptor Thomas

resolution as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, ladies and
gentlemen of the House to stand on the floor today to pay tribute to my
hometown. I am very proud that of the 18.762  identified municipalities
in the US, that the city of Dunn was one of ten selected this year as an
All-American City. I would point out that this is not the first time
this has occurred. Dunn, in fact, is one of only only 42 towns to have
actually won this high distinction twice. While we could all stand on
the floor and talk for great lengths about our hometown, I will do this
as briefly as I can, and I appreciate the indulgence of the Speaker and
the members for the chance to be here.  I would like to take this time
and just personally invite you, as you travel down 95, or you travel
down 421. or wherever you make your way in this state, I would love for
you to come and to experience the new Dunn, to see the renovations that
have been done, the total rework of downtown where once again,
businesses are coming back and it is such an amazing place to stand. You
know, it was just a few weeks ago that we actually did the re-dedication
of our downtown, and it's such an amazing thing for a kid that grew up
there, that has watched the town -- as all small towns in our state have
-- struggle to have come back, and to have truly become a center of
commerce, of agriculture, of manufacturing, of distribution, and even of
tourism. It would not be fitting to speak about the town of Dunn without
referring to probably our greatest n[RECORDING ENDS]</p>

best known hometown hero, and that is General William C. Lee. General
Lee, as many of the members in this chamber, I’m sure recognizes his
name, is the father of the modern airborne soldier. He was the man who
said, let’s put a parachute on soldiers and get them where they need to
be to win the fight. It is well known lore in Dunn that we’re only about
25 miles from Ft. Bragg and this well known lore that towards the end of
General Lee’s career, and in fact his life, he began to experience
health problems and had to return from the front to his home in Dunn
which is now maintained by the General William C. Lee commission. It’s a
great place to go and see true World War II artifact. It is well known
that there were times that the commanding generals were flying to Ft.
Bragg and wanting to confer with General Lee and the road would actually
be closed down so they could get to down and back and do what they need
to do. I could go on all day. I know that’s not the intent or the
understanding I have with the speaker. I am very, very proud of my town.
I’m very, very appreciative of the large delegation that’s here from my
town today, many of whom actually traveled out for the All-American City
award presentation. An award I am very, very proud of my hometown and I
commend this resolution.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too, would like to commend the resolution to
you. Dunn has a long track record of historical events and outstanding
persons. I had the privilege of attending college with a gentleman whose
hometown is Dunn who went on to become chancellor of Fayetteville State
University and is now chancellor emeritus of Fayetteville State
University and still remains a good friend of mine, that’s Willis
McLeod. Many of you may know him. I also had the privilege of having an
aunt who taught Willis McLeod in Dunn at the old haunted high school in
Dunn. They have a track record for education there. I also have a great
friend Mrs. Oscar Harris. Many of you may remember Senator Oscar Harris
who served here in the General Assembly and served us well here so it is
with pride that I commend this resolution to you.

Garner’s not my home town but thanks to the folk that drew the lines
this year, last year, they made Garner a part of my district. I would
take a little credit for all of the things that happened to
Garner since they became a part of my district, but I won’t do that. I
will start off by saying, I started my teaching career at Garner Senior
High in Garner, North Carolina. I have been a fan of the town of Garner
ever since then, even though I stay in Raleigh. Let me talk a little bit
about Garner. The town of Garner has received quite a number of honors
and accolades in the last couple of years. That is why there are quite a
few people who are now looking to move to Garner, North Carolina. It’s a
growing community of about 27,000 residents. It’s the home of 2011
American Idol and how many of you know who was the American Idol in
2011? You heard enough about Scotty McCreery. Let me tell you, he put
Garner on the map. Garner was good, it was a great town even before he
became the American Idol. This last year, 2012, it was the hometown of
Miss North Carolina, Arlie Honeycutt. This year, we’re proud to say we

One of the three all-American cities in North Carolina. Garner is
approximately eight miles south, or north of Raleigh. And I stay halfway
between Garner and Raleigh. So I feel honored to be a part of Garner and
a part Raleigh. Garner residents know that some of them live closer to
downtown Raleigh than the actual residents of Raleigh, North Carolina.
Because if you look at Raleigh, those residents in Raleigh who stay in
North Raleigh live more than 12 miles. But Garner is about eight miles.
But, note, not so close, ??,  Garner residents know that they're close
to downtown Raleigh, than Raleigh residents who live on the outskirts of
the city limits. But not so close so as to intrude on the small town
atmosphere that makes Garner special. So special that after the, after
Scotty won the American Idol, he wanted to return to his hometown of
Garner to continue playing on his high school baseball team, to graduate
from the Garner Magnet High School, and to attend North Carolina State
University. So you know Garner had to be special to him like it is to
most of the residents of Garner. With over 350 acres of park land. A
thriving business economy, safe and beautiful neighborhoods, quality
schools great community events, and a variety of shopping and local
entertainment venues, Garner has something for everyone. So come and
visit the city of Garner, or the town of Garner. Let us all congratulate
the Mayor Ronnie Williams and other members of the Town Council, Chamber
of Commerce, and the residents of Garner on being chosen, one of Wake
County's, ??, the only Wake county, and one of North Carolina's
all-American citizens by voting yes for this resolution. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Make a motion and debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion and to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to move that we do concur with the Senate
Committee Substitute for House Bill 359. It looks like the Senate has
made four changes, four primary changes, in the piece of legislation,
first of all in section 1. Our House bill allowed for state employees to
transfer their 403(B) funds into the retirement plan; this just broadens
that to all possible supplemental plans they might be a part of, and it
also forbids charging the state employees fees in order to affect that
transfer. Section 5 has been added. It addresses a very unusual
situation in which someone who retires and returns to work and then goes
on long-term disability, it allows them to count their time on long-term
disability towards the three years of service required to make the type
of transfer we just were talking about in section 1. Section 6 has been
added. It states that if an employee is reinstated with back pay by a
settlement agreement with one of our state agencies, that the employee
and the agency must pay the full liability to the retirement system for
the additional benefit that this creates so that… In the past I think
maybe some agencies had been pawning their responsibility off on the
state as a whole, which is not a good thing, so if they’ve agreed to a
settlement and the employee gets extra pay as a result of that, both the
agency and the employee must pay their fair share of the additional
retirement benefit that that will provide for that employee. And then
the fourth change was the effective date was moved up to this year
instead of next year – 2013 instead of 2014. I would ask you to vote to
concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not,
the question before the House is the motion to concur in the Senate
Committee Substitute for House Bill 359. All in favor vote aye. All
opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will lock the

conference report. I would ask that they be recognized in the turn
indicated on there, and that at the conclusion of those subcommittee
reports that I be further recognized to speak on the motion.
Representative McGrady is recognized to debate the motion.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, colleagues. My role here is to provide a bit of
an overview on the education portion of the budget. I'll be splitting
responsibilities with colleague, Representative Horn, who will cover
public education specifically, and Representative Blackwell who will
cover any colleges and UNC system piece. Assuming the Joint Conference
Committee's report is adopted, I suspect there's gonna be much debate
over whether we are cutting education, and if so by what amount, or
whether we're not. If one compares the Conference Committee budget to
the continuation budget, there are cuts of 1.5% to public education,
1.6% to community colleges and 4.7% to the UNC system. For an overall
cut of 2.2%. But you know what they say about statistics, if you compare
the conference budget to the actual spending if fiscal year 12 and 13,
these numbers are largely reversed. A 2.1% increase for public
education, a 2.9% increase for community colleges, only a 3% cut to the
UNC system, for an overall increase of just under 1%. So I would tell
you as you look to the budget, you look to all the numbers that the
devil here is in the details. You just, it's hard to compare, and
depending on what it is you compare you're going to get a different
perspective on this budget. And I guess depending on which side you turn
out to be on on the budget, there are certainly statistics here to
support your view. I wanna bring to your attention, specifically on the
bill, on pages 17-18, 16-18 actually, those portions of the budget that
deal with the lottery fund. On page 17, there has been in the past a
formula for the distribution of the lottery funds, the so-called
50/40/10 formula, and that provision in the law is being repealed by
this budget. And as most folks</p>

<p id="055:00">
already know, I suspect, that provision, the law each year has been
waived in recent years. And so the budget is really reflecting the
reality. Now, be assured the money in the lottery is still all going for
educational purposes. And if you'll turn to page 18 of the Senate Bill,
you will see what the lottery funds are being used for. It's all laid
out right there. But that is a piece of the budget that isn't oft times
recognized.
The Special Provisions related to the Education Budget begin on page 54.
Most of those provisions are going to relate specifically to some of the
programs that Representative Warren and Representative Blackwell are now
going to introduce and discuss. And if I can, Mr. Speaker, now turn to
Representative Horn to cover the Public Education piece.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Horn, you're recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this has been a difficult,
complex, and challenging process. It is every budget cycle. There is no
magic, there are lots of numbers, lots of students, lots of teachers,
and lots of schools. And it affects every part and parcel of this state.
A few weeks ago we debated, here on the floor, the House version of the
budget. We all remember that didn't exactly match up with the Senate
version of the budget, and we know what happens. We go to conference,
the Sub-committee Chairs get together and work out as many of the
differences as they can, the big Chairs work out as many differences as
they can, and if there are any remaining differences we keep kicking it,
moving it to higher authority. So that we get to a budget to the best of
our ability that meets the needs of North Carolina, North Carolina
students, teachers, parents, and schools.
So let me present a few of the things that were, that is, are in the
Public School Budget that I think are particularly important for you to
recognize. This budget provides 23.6 million in continuing to fund a
program that we implemented two years ago, the Excellence in Public
Schools Act. That will strengthen student literacy, a very heavy focus
on student literacy. Improve graduation rates, and increase
accountability.
This budget, for the first time, brings the teachers in North Carolina
in line with us, right here in the House, and actually, most working
people across North Carolina. The tenor system is replaced with an
employee, teacher contract that's renewed based on job performance. Not
unlike our contract with our constituents. Renewed based on job
performance. Some of us have been renewed for quite some time, and some
of us will not be renewed, but it's based on job performance.
We will continue our commitment to paying for excellence, and encourage
it by putting 10.2 million dollars in the second year of this budget to
fund pay raises for those effective teachers. That's what we all want.
Effective, quality teachers across this state. We're going to begin in
the second year of this budget to implement the Opportunity Scholarships
Program. Which will give those young students in the poorest and most
rural parts of our county, of our state, an opportunity to attend a
school that works for them. This budget provides for a critical school
safety measures. There's not one person in this House, nay in this state
that wasn't impacted, affected, thought about, concerned, and moved by
the recent incidents in schools in other states in this nation. And we
all feel impelled to improve the safety</p>

<p id="060:00">
Ensure the safety of the students in our schools. This budget finally
accomplishes a goal that this legislature has worked toward for several
years and that's finally the elimination of what's called discretionary
cuts, the old I give you ten, you give me back two. We're now going to
fund the schools and they're going to decide what they're going to do
with the money, not us. It's straight up. No shell game. No I give you
ten, you give me back two. This budget continues to phase out of the
teaching fellows but in fact supports the highly successful Teach for
America.
This budget initiates some programs that are critical to the future of
this state and innovation and bringing out private sector together with
our public sector for new ideas. We're looking for new ideas, better
ways. How do we deliver education more effectively to the students
across this state? How do we pull up the best of our students with the
use of IB and AP programs? How do we meet the needs of our employers
across this state with CTE programs? We've begun that process.
We based a lot of this budget on actual numbers, not budget numbers, not
guesswork, but actual spends from last year. When we had discretionary
cuts we've learned from the LEAs where they feel are the important areas
for  them and we've used those numbers to develop this budget.
Is it a perfect budget for it? There is no such thing but it is a good
budget. It's hard work. Both sides of the aisle know how hard and
painful these decisions are. Not easy but its a step in the right
direction for accountability, for responsiveness, and to move our K-12
education into the 22nd century. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield to
Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative John Bell, state your purpose. Representative Blackwell,
you're recognized to debate the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to comment as briefly as I can on aspects
first of the community college budget. One of the things that's going on
in this budget is, and many of you may appreciate this, that over the
last few years during the great recession, we had a tremendous growth in
the enrollment in our community colleges back a few years ago when
people were even to greater numbers out of work and looking for other
opportunities. That enrollment has fallen off rather substantially. So,
one change that the budget makes which was in both the Senate and the
House budgets and is preserved in the conference report is that we are
changing the enrollment funding model to look at the most recent two
years rather than the most recent three years.
The effect of that is to save us somewhere in the order of almost $20
million. That accounts in large measure for the what would otherwise be
a decrease if you were looking at the continuation budget rather than
the actual budget that Representative McGrady referred to earlier. The
decrease from the continuation budget based on the old three year model
would have been about $16 million but we're saving about $20, actually
$19.9, by moving to this two year enrollment.
Recognizing that that could cause some difficulty for some of our
community colleges that would be faced with a larger adjustment that
they would need to make in their operating budget for the current year,
there's $4 million in non-recurring money that's allowed to help with
them transitioning or phasing in that reduction.
In addition, there is a relative small increase improved of 250 per
credit hour for courses at the community colleges. Based on our
discussions, it</p>

<p id="065:00">
My understanding that that still leaves us very competitive when
compared with the courses and the charges at community colleges in other
states. Another thing which the budget does, which I think we should be
pleased with, is it moves us in the direction of more performance
funding for our community college systems, by putting some increased
funding behind that process. First, it gives them an additional 9
million dollars by restoring a portion of the management flexibility
reduction that they had in the previous year but directs that they use
that to help fund performance funding model. The idea is that there are
goals that are set for the community colleges and those that meet those
goals let us say in terms of the percentage of students taking a nursing
course, who actually end up not just passing the course but actually
passing the state licensing test. There’s funding provided. In addition,
we direct that another 9 million in the first year of the biennium, of
their current funding, would be redirected to support that performance
funding model. The amount in the second year of the biennium are
increased so that the total from all sources is about 36 million.
Recognizing that our community colleges are on the cutting edge of
trying to prepare people for jobs, one of our concerns is that community
colleges need to have adequate funding to purchase the equipment that is
current enough that it can be used to train people for jobs in business
and industry that are currently available in the economy. So it provides
an additional 10 million dollars in non-recurring funds for equipment
purchases during this first year of the biennium. Finally, with respect
to the funding items in the budget, there’s 4.8 million dollars in
non-recurring funds for the North Carolina Back-To-Work program. If you
look in your special provisions section of the budget on page 133, you
can see that those funds are designed to go to programs at community
colleges that fall into certain categories. The first one listed, for
example, is employers who have committed to assist colleges with the
design and implementation of training plans and to interview program
completers for available jobs. The other categories that are listed are
designed by this new program to try to lead to real jobs rather than to
training for jobs that may or may not actually exist in the economy. A
final thing I’ll mention on the community college in terms of funding
requirements or appropriations is that there also is a special provision
in the budget that asks the community colleges to create a fourth tier
of funding which would provide the highest level of funding to the
community college per student because the courses that were associated
with that fourth tier or highest level of funding again fell into that
category of preparing them for jobs that were readily available, that
the individual once completing the course for, could go into that job.
Switching to the UNC system, the budget has an additional 65.8 million

reduction for the university system. It increases tuition for
non-resident undergraduate students in the second year of the biennium,
that’s to allow for students who were admitted for this coming school
year before the university was on notice that this increase might take
place. In addition, because the state education assistance authority

scholarships and the like, because it would be involved with the
handling of the opportunity scholarship program, that program is also
funded under the UNC system heading because of the location of the</p>

<p id="070:00">
At education systems authority, under the UNC portion of the budget.
There is a reduction in the overall funding to the university based upon
savings and operational efficiencies, which the UNC system board of
governors and the various campuses have identified and have implemented.
This budget would authorize the board of governors to use up to 15
million dollars to implement other provisions of the report on those
operational efficiencies. The budget eliminates a subsidy of 15 million
dollars that was provided in last years budget of the UNC school of
medicine. The budget continues a 4.5 million dollar nonrecurring
funding, for instance North Carolina needs-based scholarships, which are
used to help students who rather than attending (this is for North
Carolina residents) a state supported institution may be attending a
private college. An important budgeting move that the conference report
agreed upon is a move towards what is referred to as forward funding for
the UNC needs-based grant program. We've had the problem for a number of
years, that the university let us say this past spring with sending out
acceptances to students to be admitted this fall. And with those,
generally they like to tell them whether they're going to be approved
for a scholarship, or grant, or something of that sort. Because we
typically were not doing the budget until after those letters went out
there was always some uncertainty on the part of the university as to
how much money they would have for the purpose of funding those
scholarships. So what we are doing is setting up in effect, a reserve
that would have money in it a year early, so that the university, when
they send out the letters this coming spring, theoretically would know
that they've already got the money on hand and how much it is and they
could plan accordingly. This forward funding would actually not be
completed, however, until the second year of the biennium. The final
thing that is related the money report on the UNC system is that
heretofore, there was funding of 7 million dollars for the institute of
regenerative medicine at Wake Forest University that was appropriated
through the department of commerce. Those funds are transferred and are
now going to be transferred through the UNC budget, but for the same
purpose. Finally, I wanna comment quickly on a couple of special
provisions that I think may be of some significance. First of all,
there's a provision in the community college budget; special provision
section, that will encourage community colleges working with community
college state board to approve programming that would allow freshmen and
sophomore high school students to have opportunities to participate in
course work that would lead them into essentially career and tech type
programs. If you recall, we've had legislation early in the session that
you now get a diploma with either a career ready or a college ready
endorsement, and this program would be designed, I think, to align
principally with that career ready endorsement. In the case of the UNC
system, some of you may appreciate the fact that there's a provision in
the budget requiring our various institutions in the university's system
to consolidate the process by which they determine who is and who is not
a resident for purposes of in-state or out-state tuition. Heretofore, we
found that some institutions may be determining that question
differently and that the same student applying to several schools might
be told he's a resident at one place, but not at the other. So that's
intended to try to clarify that. There is a provision with respect to
several campuses that would allow the board of governors without going
through the council's state and governor to get authority to dispose of
an ??</p>

Or will property that falls within certain categories in terms of the
length of time involved with the acquisition of the property or the
disposition ?? Final thing I’ll mention is that we have in this budget
an effort to encourage students to complete university and higher
education in a timely fashion. So there is a requirement that in order
to be eligible for need-based scholarships and other grant programs that
if you are not on a five year program, a degree program that is
typically a five year program, that you would have a ten semester limit
on how long you could receive scholarships and grants. If you are on a
five year program then the limit would be twelve semesters and if you’re
involved at a community college it will be the accrued limit of six four
time semesters. Thank you Mr Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hollo, you’re recognized to debate the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Speaker. I was speaking on the Health and Human Services
section of the budget. The proposed conference budget appropriates 5
billion dollars, an increase of 377 million or 8.2% in the, in the first
year. In the second year an increase of 507 million or 11% without the
additional funds for Medicaid, the conference budget compared to the
continuation budget for the first year’s reduction of 3.5% and reduction
in the second year of 5.2%. This part of the budget includes a fifty two
million dollar, fifty two million dollars in hospital assessment
increased the nominal co-payee for eligible Medicaid services to
currently three dollars and ninety cents, which is the maximum, reduces
hospital out-patient payments from 80% to 70% of costs, implements a
shared savings payment plan, establishes a 3% provider payment withhold
in the first year and implements the shared savings payments to
providers in the second year. This is savings through drug cost
adjustment. This part of the budget expands a Medicaid rebase of a 434
million in the first year, 557 million dollars in the second year. This
49.7 million dollars in the first year earned 14 million dollars in the
second year for 69,683 new recipients in 2004 from the affordable ??
would affect Medicaid. Budget provides 9.8 million in the, in state
funds and 3.8 million in federal funds for non-profits requires the
department of Health and Human Services to establish a non-profit block
grant process by the second year. Establishes a supplement of short term
assistance for group homes for recipients who lost Medicaid personal
care service funds. Now this is up to a maximum of 4.6 million dollars.
And now, now Mr Speaker if you will recognize Representative Avila for
the remainder.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, you’re recognized to debate the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, as many of you know, one of
the hard impacts on our budget that we literally have no control over is
Medicaid and this budget has fully funded our Medicaid budget. And we’ve
also asked the Governor in the HSS to put together a plan for reform of
Medicaid to help us get a handle on our programs and entitlement that we
have to pay regardless of what other expenses may be on the calendar for
us to take care of like education and transportation. That plan will be
presented to the General Assembly though for our final approval. Some of
the other things that we’ve done particularly in the area of middle
health, we’ve established a state-wide tell a psychiatry program which
will enable some of the more rural areas which lack the services to be
able to take advantage of top-notch care in their local facility and
areas. We’ve also expanded available psychiatric beds, we’ve added
nineteen modern hospitals and we’ve added a number of three-way beds
which is kind of hard to put a number on it at the moment because what
we’re introducing there is a two-tier payment system where we will
determine the payment based on the activity of the patients. Not
everybody comes in needing the same service. Some are more critical than
others and we need to adjust that.</p>

payment to what the patients need. We’ve also taken a lot of cuts. Not
just from state funds that were short this year, but also federal funds.
It’s a case where we have a lack of funding, but we have no lack of
citizens to take care of. For that reason, a lot of our programs and
issues like the ADATs, ADAP, Oral health and CDSAs. And for those of you
who don’t live in an acronym world, the ADATs are our Adult and Drug
Abuse Treatment centers. ADAP is our Aids Drugs Assistance Program. The
CDSAs are our Children’s Development Service Agencies. Rather than take
care of the problem by just cutting, what we’ve asked in a lot of these
cases is for these facilities to take a look for efficiencies as we’ve
asked throughout state government in order to be able save money and
still be able to take care of the needs of the citizens of the state.
We’ve also added 2500 pre-K slots. That not brings our total number of
children served to 27,500. One of the things that I’ve been very pleased
with in the budget is everybody knows my addiction to evidence based
programs. We’ve introduced a number of evidence based programs in
different areas of the HHS budget. Programs such as the Nurse/Family
partnership in dealing with unwed mothers. The North Carolina child
treatment program which deals with children’s traumatic injuries. In the
area of foster care and adoption, using proven programs like Family
Finding and setting up a North Carolina model on the Wendy’s Wonderful
Kids model to be able to offer services of permanency and appropriate
homes to children in foster care and also children who are up for
adoption. Those are just some of the things that have made up our HHO’s
budget and I feel like we have accomplished a tremendous amount with
limited funding and I would encourage you to vote yes on the conference
report. Thank you.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. Just as in Public Safety part of the budget,
begins on 1 through 13, I13, and the special provisions, it’s 295 to
339. I’m going to go over some of the highlights. It is $2.37 billion
and that’s about 11% of our total budget. It provides for $3.7 million
for inflationary increases for fuel for the state highway patrol that
has not been funded and with the gas prices going up, we wanted to fund
that fully. $25 million to upgrade the Viper system to allow additional
first responders onto the network. Many have had the equipment, but have
been unable to get on and this will enable to come on the system. It
includes $27.5 million in savings from the closure of 5 prisons, 2
juvenile detention facilities and one youth development center. It was
very difficult to do and difficult to decide what to do. We listened to
the agency on this. $5.8 million in this second year to fund additional
probation and parole positions needed to meet the requirements of the
Justice Reinvestment Act. That’s $5.8 million in the first and $12.1
million in the second. $1.8 million to expand electronic monitoring for
probationers, they say this is very helpful. In the Justice Department,
we have $1.5 million to fund 19 additional toxicology positions in the
state crime lab. $1 million in additional funding with the support of
both of the training standards commissions. The IDS, the proposed budget
includes $3.8 million recurring funding in the first year for the
private assigned counsel fund and re-calibrating allowable punishments
for class 3 misdemeanors to limit the need for indigent defense services
for these low level offenses. Three provisions are associated with this
policy change. One reclassifies some class 1 and 2 misdemeanors as class
3 misdemeanors, one changes several boating misdemeanors to infractions,
and one changes the punishment for class 3 misdemeanors to a fine only
for the first three offenses. These changes reduce the potential...</p>

need for indigent defense services. Savings are currently estimated to
be around $2 million. And in NAOC, the administrative office of the
courts, $1 million, we put to, $1 million to restore 22 of the
magistrate positions, so that those that need four will hopefully come
up to four. And then we had a $4 million reduction to the
administration. We did keep the Special Judges and we kept the court
reporters. If you have any questions, Representative Daughtry would be

Representative McElraft, you are recognized to debate the conference
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, the conference report for
MER appropriates 371.2 million, which is an increase of 25.3 million. In
the Department of Agriculture, the budget is 115.1 million, which is an
increase of 6.2 million. Some of the highlights there are we created a
new program in the Department of Ag focused on growing the bioenergy
sector in North Carolina, and it provides 2.4 million in the biennium
for that. We also modernized farming equipment at the research stations.
And at the Department of Labor, we appropriated 16.7 million, which is
an increase of 500,000. At the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources, DENR, the conference committee budget appropriates 154
million to DENR. And that's an increase of 44.9 million, and the
increase largely due to several actions. One of them was it merged the
National Heritage Trust Fund under the Clean Water Management Trust Fund
and provided recurring appropriations in that, 24 million in the
biennium. It transfers the Energy office from Commerce to DENR,
including 56 positions, so that accounted for some of the increase. We
also have the Non Leaking Underground Storage Fund. We appropriated 3.5
million for that to assist homeowners with the cleanup of these home
heating oil tanks. The clean water--we created a new water
infrastructure authority, and this consolidates available funding for
local governments for critical-needs water and waste-water
infrastructure programs. And also under DENR, we provided 5 million for
each to match federal capitalization grants for the Clean Water State
Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. In wildlife
resources, we decreased their budget by 6 million in the first year and
2 million--4 million in the second year. And of course you all remember
the bill that we allowed them to raise their fees. They're trying to
become self-sufficient. The Department of Commerce, we provided--the
spending for the Department of Commerce appropriates 51.2 million for
Commerce this year, and that's an increase of 17.7 million. We provided
1 million in nonrecurring funds so the state can prepare for the
Department of Defense ?? activities, which very important to keep our
bases open. We also provided funds for the Industrial Commission to
establish a workman's compensation compliance program, which was
recommended by the governor. We established a new rural economic
development division within the Department of Commerce, and that will
consolidate and streamline economic development funds available for
rural communities; 24.3 million was appropriated in the biennium for
that new rural economic development division. We provided Commerce with
the flexibility to establish public/private partnerships, and that
continues. That's all of Commerce. Thank you very much, and I recommend
the budget.

to the Highway Fund and 1.11 billion to the Highway Trust Fund and FY 13
and 14 which is a combined increase of 339.1 million and that's relative
to the continuation budget and 62.5 million increase relative to the
certified budget for FY 12 and 13. In comparison, a proposed FY 14 and
15 represents an increase of 177.4 million relative to the continuation
budget and reduction of 69.6 million relative to the certified budget
for FY 12 and 13. Also in this conference report, it eliminates 400
vacant positions in FY 14 and 15. Other significant actions included

what we also did in transportation is provide 286.1 million of
additional funding for road resurfacing and dedicates 332.6 million in
system preservation funds to deficient bridges over the biennium. We
reinvested 23 million derived from the dividend payments from the North
Carolina Railroad Company for freight rail and railroad roadway crossing
improvements. We provide 22.6 million to advance the replacement of
mainframe applications critical to Division of Motor Vehicles' customer
service and process improvements. Expands the Highway Use Tax base to
include both the retail value of a vehicle and dealer administrative
fees. Establishes a local, key word being this, a local elective process
for the initiation of tolling on ferry routes which are currently
un-tolled and expands the departments authority to generate other
sources of revenue on the system. Toll and other earned revenues will
now be deposited into a reserve account to assist with the passenger
ferry vessel replacement. Increases outsourcing targets to a range of
60-65% over the biennium for pre-construction work and 5% annually for
right of way project development and analysis and roadway design
activities. It directs the department to evaluate potential improvements
to global transport and connection transportation infrastructure to
promote economic development and improve access including the Wallace to
Castle Hayne Track Restoration Project for access to Wilmington Port and
potential rail access improvements to allow to get the the port of
Morehead City. I would also mention that on that one when you hear about
the different departments working together in the taking down or the
tearing down of silos, both transportation and commerce and agriculture
are all cohesively working on that project. It also increases the
optional locally assessed fee for driver education from $45 to $55 and
establishes a supplemental annual registration fee for plugin electric

Thank you Mr. Speaker. I’ll speak to the IT portion of the budget. The
proposed budget appropriates funding to three IT funds. The IT fund
expends $9 million in a fiscal year 2013-14 and $10.5 million in fiscal
2014-15. Including funding for a government data analytics center, also
known as GDAC. The IT reserve expense, $28 million in fiscal year
2013-14 and $31.6 million in fiscal year 2014-15. The internal service
fund expends $190 million in both fiscal years. Some of the significant
changes and actions in IT include 3 funds includes statewide information
technology IT funding. Of those, the IT fund includes funding for the
operation of the office of the state chief information officer, and
funds statewide IT projects including funding for criminal justice
information network and the geographic information system services and
$1 million to consolidate agency infrastructure and applications. The IT
reserves $30.3 million to replace obsolete computers and applications.
$1.7 million to conduct an assessment to ensure that state agencies are
meeting IT security requirements and $4.8 million to upgrade, simplify,
and modernize the state’s internal IT infrastructure. The IT internal
service fund receipts are limited to $190 million. The three IT funds do
not include agency spending for IT which brings the state’s total for IT
in excess of $1 billion each year. Part of what the state chief
information officer wanted to see and the governor is an investment in
the security and safety improvements and efficiencies. We’ve delivered
that. The focus for information technology this biennium is fixing what
is broken using $59.6 million over two years and an information
technology reserve fund to one, improve security to avoid incidents like
the data breach of the Department of Revenue in South Carolina, two,
improve planning to include developing a strategic plan and statewide
architecture, and three, fund our mediation of state infrastructure by
upgrading and simplifying the state network to increase efficiency and
improve security, eliminating server closets to ensure there are no more
incidents like the fire in the department of administration. Replacing
outdated software and upgrade of over 40,000 state computers that are
too old to run current software. We are also establishing standards and
processes for protecting citizen data held by state agencies. We’re
improving IT operations, identify state assets and locations in order
consolidate servers and state data centers and ensure back-up systems
are in place, the budget requires state CIO approval of any IT contract
sole sourcing and direct CIO review of projects to prevent duplication.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar you are recognized to wrap up
the roll out of the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, our
appropriation team is pleased to bring before you the conference report
on senate bill 402, the appropriations act of 2013. The state's budget
reflects the aspirations of its people. The citizens of North Carolina
called for sweeping change in 2010 and reaffirmed their call for reform
in 2012, this conference report heeds the call of our citizens and that
is for a budget that is realistic, that is reasonable and that is
responsible. We begin this budget by building back our reserves, placing
over 269 million dollars back into our savings reserve. 162 million
dollars to repairs and renovations. We have funded our state health plan
and our retirement obligation. at the end of the first year we leave 250
million dollars unspent, and in the second year we leave 355 million
dollars unreserved as a hedge against either further surprises in
Medicaid or unforeseen national disasters. Of that unappropriated
balance in the second year, our plan is to use a substantial portion of
those funds to provide a much needed pay raise for teachers, state
employees and a cost of living adjustment for retirees.
In the Medicaid program we have kept our commitment to the health of our
at-risk children, the poor and disabled, by committing over a billion
dollars of new money in the biennium to ensure the financial stability
of this program. North Carolina will continue to offer medical, dental
and mental health optional services through Medicaid, more than almost
any state in the nation. This budget also affirms our commitment,
continuing to mental health reform. In early childhood development we
have added 12.4 million to secure 2500 additional pre-K slots so more
at-risk Nichiren can get the right to a good start and success in school
and life. we have done our best to minimize reductions in the courts and
the justice system while taking advantage of the savings generated by
the implementation of the justice reinvestment act.
We have taken strides to modernize and retool the Department of
Environment and Natural Resource to better serve our local communities.
In the Department of Commerce we're implementing bold new approaches to
job recruitment, business expansion, industrial development and
marketing. Changes geared to make a real impact in our state's economy.
For transportation the budget reflects the important strategic reforms

[Speaker changes.] ...rails and bridges, airports and seaports...how
they play in the health of our economy, short term and long term.  Now
this budget also does well by the arts/music/history, preserving the
rich cultural heritage of our state.  Clearly, no area of the budget is
more important than education, where approximately 60% of our spending
is focused.  We have worked hard to continue the state's strong
commitment to our nationally recognized community college system. We
will continue to have the nation's largest commitment to public
universities with the commitment that we have made in this budget to the
UNC system. In K-12, we are taking measured steps toward education
reform, teacher development, student safety, and expanded choices for
our parents.  As with any budget and certainly any budget conference
report, no one is pleased with all of the choices that have been
made...or often have to be made because of a variety of continued
pressures on our public finances.  The budget seeks to achieve the
state's goal of a well-educated, healthy, safe citizenry with the
opportunity to work in a rewarding career and the freedom to enjoy the
natural, cultural and historic treasures of this bountiful state. While
this goal of our budget is lofty and well-deserving of our best efforts
as a general assembly, the report before you today contains what is
truly rare for any budget...a moment of profound historic significance.
In another budget cycle or two, the appropriations and provisions of
this document will be long forgotten but what will remain is that this
General Assembly righted a great moral wrong in this state.  You know
the powers of government are enormous. For a half century, that power
was used to sanction and carry out a systematic program called eugenics.
The state of North Carolina taking, from certain citizens, the ability
to reproduce because in the government's opinion, they were not worthy
of this natural and God-given right. It was socialism...social
Darwinism...taken to it's extreme, enforced and carried out with the
full sanction of the state of North Carolina.  Never, in the last
century of our state, has the power of government been so misused.
Citizens mutilated, maimed and scarred for life. After decades of abuse
and thousands of victims, the evil of eugenics was finally ended in our
state in the 1970's. More recently, the state has issued apologies to
the victims and placed as sign, just two blocks down here...to remind us
of what we should never allow to happen in this state again.  All of
that is good, all steps toward atonement for a great evil but, until
today, there was no compensation for the victims. And remember folks, we
compensate people everyday with torte claims against the state, where
the state has injured them or their property. We compensate prisoners
when we find they were wrongly convicted and imprisoned.  Never have the
victims of eugenics had the opportunity to present a claim and be
compensated by the state's...from the state's systematic torture of
their body, which was never restored and for which you can never fully
compensate.  But today is the day when history will mark this General
Assembly did what was morally right in the eyes of God. Questions I have
for my colleagues and especially for those on the Democratic side of the
aisle, are you going to join hands across the partisan divide and bring
some measured ????? to these victims?  Last week, Representative Goodman
and the Democrats stood ready...said that the Democrats stood ready to
work with Republicans.  Was he speaking for your party?  When he was
speaking, was he speaking the truth or was he speaking empty rhetoric?
Are you gonna take responsibility to right a great wrong? Will you allow
this profound moment to pass, giving greater value to the temporal
politics of voting against the budget?  Or will they say in the future
that you really did put principal above politics?  My friends on the
Democratic side, are you willing to shoulder your share....</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on a report Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized to debate the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the
House. I have listened to the report given by the members there and the
eloquent words of Representative Dollar who is seeming to be trying to
lay a blame game if we happen to do what he knows we’re going to do. I
want to congratulate you on doing the job that you did on euthenics. You
ought to be congratulated and you ought to rightfully take your place
for that. It was a thing that was long coming it was many roads to
follow on that. Believe me when I tell you that there are many people
out there who appreciate what you have done in the area of euthenics.
But let’s to talk about the area of the people who are living here now
and what they are going to have to suffer as a result of the budget that
you have here. In 1993 we began a program in this state and I’m speaking
basically on the education budget particularly the public education
budget. In 1973 we were 26th in teacher pay in the country and there was
a commitment made at that time to try to at  least reach the normal, the
average, the state, the country norm on teacher pay and progress was
made up until the point where recession started to hit but we at least
tried to keep that promise going. I look at the budget now and wonder
how you have tackled the fact that our teacher pay is now 46th in the
country rating just above Mississippi and West Virginia and I look at
this budget and wonder how you can think about us being 48th, 48th I’m
sorry in per pupil spending just barely above Mississippi. That’s where
we are in national statistics. I look at this budget and I see 394 pages
basically of special provisions in there something that should have been
vetted in committees that were put in this budget. Now admit it there
was some happenings when I had particularly charged I tried to stop as
much of that as I could in fact my own members Mr. Dollar sort of ate me
out about the fact that I would not allow special provisions in the
budget. I look at this budget and I see things in there that have just
not been vetted on this floor and should have been. For instance you’ve
got about $250,000,000.00 in carry over funds right now over into the
next session. A little bit of that could have been used to try to put
our teachers back on the track that reach the national norm but no it’s
going to be carried over. Even at the end of the bi-annum you still got
about $355,000,000.00 more left over that you really could have put to
use for the benefit of the citizens of this state. I will tell you now
Mr. Dollar here again, I appreciate what you’ve done in terms of
euthenics and I abhor what you’ve done to the people of this state in
terms of our education program and how low progress has been made on
those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the budget Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized to debate the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. When this budget left
the house I disagreed with the fact of it but less with the choices made
in revenue limits it imposed. But today my diagreement</p>

<p id="115:00">
The budget and its choices is far more profound. Let me categorize what
I see in the education budget. $110 million of cuts to teacher
assistants and no money to make it up. Those funds that are put back in,
and it is a good choice in this case by the majority for the
discretionary fund, will have to be used to make up the teacher cuts and
the instructional personnel cuts and the instructional supply cuts and
the transportation cuts and all the other cuts which the majority acts
as if don't exist in the continuation budget but do.
The elimination of masters pay for teachers, one of the few incentives
remaining for professional development of a faculty member. The
elimination of the Teaching Fellows program and why that has happened no
one will ever be able to fully answer on this floor. And so we [unclear
00:00:59] those to stay in the profession and now we even
[unclear/disincent? 00:01:04] them to enter it.
We eliminate, in this budget, even though the House passed 113-1, as a
major policy matter an alternate approach to rid systems of poor
performing teachers but keep particularly good ones in the system and
protected. And even with Representative Dollar's second year suggestion
and my response there is promises don't feed families. No pay increase
this year for educators, leaving as I fully suspect we will be by the
end of this session, us 49th in the nation or last in teacher pay.
Defend the budget all you will on this floor, there is no defense for
that. Then, yes, it contains two-thirds of the security package we
unanimously passed on this house but it takes out our additional funds
for school psychologists, social workers, and guidance counselors when
we know from every piece of data we have that the biggest threat to
schools comes from inside and not from outside in most occasions.
With the teach assistant cuts and the new allocation formula, of course,
we effectively increase class size in early elementary grades and there
is no way to avoid that either.
And then... And then...  Although we can fund these basic positions and
programs that are designed to really reflect what we all know which is
that kids will learn if they have a competent, caring, dedicated,
professional teacher in their classroom, but won't if they don't we
somehow find the funds to start a second private school system through
vouchers. This is not educational reform. It is public education
abdication.
At the universities, lest they be left off this list, $65-70 million in
increased discretionary cuts on top of the almost $500 million that
exists from four years of prior budgets, elimination of funding to the
UNC hospital effectively for indigent care reimbursement as that
skyrockets, and 10,000 students who will be effectively eliminated from
financial aid packages with many more having their benefits cut.
Part of this budget, and I know and we all know it did not start in the
House, that's in the budget is called the Senate Excellent Schools Act.
Well, hardly. This budget is better called No Teacher Left Standing.
The budget represents nothing short of a scorched earth policy, ripping
away at key components of public education. You want to improve public
education? How about if we fund teacher salaries and pay what we say is
the most important profession in the country and what every other state
apparently understands on a greater level than we do? How about if we
increase preschool opportunities? And I admire this majority for adding
2,500 slots but that doesn't make up for eliminating 30,000 in
eligibility.
And how about if we professionally develop teachers and give them time
and vertical and horizontal professional development time and prestige
and praise instead of taking away any opportunity they have to progress
or to enter the field. But, of course, we do none of that because those
represent the hard work. Those represent the hard choices and they
actually cost. So instead, we result to calling something the education
excellent school</p>

<p id="120:00">
As if by title it will make it happen. My greatest sadness today is that
there were so many other choices and none were taken. While
Representative Dollar is correct, that we end one historic wrong today,
we sadly start another. The abdication of our responsibility to provide
the resources necessary to constitutionally and soundly educate the
students of this state. As a state we will only succeed, in my opinion
at least, if education becomes everyone's business and all else dims in
comparison. There is a solemn obligation passed to us by previous
generations and by living in North Carolina we agree to accept it and
that is to improve the system of education and communities in which we
live year in and year out. And there is a trust placed in us by future
generations not yet born to fulfill our maintenance obligation to fight
poverty and disease and ignorance and prejudice and apathy and distrust
and the only way I know to do that is to educate. And today we break our
promise with those future generations. There is as I conclude my
comments at least one story that comes to mind. All of us have heard it
our different religions in different ways. And it's about the man who
walks along the road. And he sees a second man, or woman, planting a
carob tree. The walker asks the planter how long will it take for this
tree to bear fruit. And the planter replies 70 years. And the walker
asks do you expect to live another 70 years to see its fruit? And the
planter replies I did not find the world without trees when I entered
it. As my fore bearers planted for me so I am planting for those that
come after me. If there were ever planters in our society it is the
teachers in our schools. They plant the tree of knowledge in each child,
sustain the tree of love in our communities and by their daily devotion
nurture the tree of love for everyone particularly for lots of children
who in too great of numbers desperately need to find in school what they
no longer find at home. In short, they give the best of the human spirit
and their soul to those who need it the most, our children, and sadly in
my opinion today, we have not come close to giving our best on the floor
of The House or The Senate. The fiscal harm we do today is bad enough,
but the symbolic and psychological harm done here is far greater. And
the staggering cost will be generational. We pass today a budget, in
either stunning disregard, or shocking ignorance of the fallout that it
will occasion. And the harm it will inflict on teachers, students,
families and communities. And I will be voting no on this budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Holloway, please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized to speak on the conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, being one of the budget
writers has probably been one of the most challenging things that I've
ever experienced while being here in the state legislature. I can tell
you that no budget is perfect. And it's in part because there's as 120
of us in this room with 120 different opinions. And it's hard to satisfy
us all. There's things in this budget that I don't like. And I will talk
about those in just a moment. But when you put it on a piece of paper
and you list the pros and cons, the pros greatly outweighs the cons. The
main reason I'm going to support this budget is because it keeps our
fiscal house in order which I think is the key thing when writing any
budget. It achieves and accomplishes many things and gets us through
some challenges that have been facing us for a long time. I will name a
few. We were finally able to take care of the viper program. We got
through the challenges of MediCaid this year, though we know that
greater ones are to come, we made it through. We funded the additional
pre-case spots. Another was said that there was no progress made on
programs. There actually was many new programs put in our education
budget. Programs that passed this House, and a lot of them passed near
unanimously. No, we didn't get all the school safety money, but at one
time the newspapers were saying they didn't think we'd get any of it.
And we did get the most important parts. And sure I would have loved to
have had the money for the psychologists as well. But we did get the
SROs and we know that that's the most important part.</p>

<p id="125:00">
To keeping the schools safe. We've got the volunteer SRO program
through, as well. We've got money for panic buttons, so that law
enforcement can immediately be contacted. We've got a significant amount
of money in the budget for digital learning. We've got programs like
Advanced Placement so students don't have to pay for Advanced Placement
tests. Career tech, there's a focus on that. So certainly that there are
very very many good program in this budget. And as Representative Horn
said earlier, the shell game was eliminated with the local discretionary
cut. Representative Johnson and I were very quick to point out, yes,
this was the right thing to do, but we also pointed out that it would
cause some confusion because it does give the appearance in the budget
that there are significant cuts to teachers and TAs, but I encourage you
to go talk to staff. And they will tell you that it's a wash, and that
the teachers and TAs are not cut. The shell game is over. We're not
going to give them 100 bucks and then say, send us back 20. That's over
with. It's the right thing to do. It's tough to explain, but it was the
right move to make. As far as salaries go, a comment was made that the
Democrats tried to keep their promise going with teacher pay to get them
up the ladder a little higher. I've said this many times on the House
floor, last time I recall when you were in charge and the budget
difficulties were just beginning, you gave them nothing. I've said it
over and over, how did that help you climb? This budget doesn't do
anything in year 1, but it does have the money in there to do it in year
2. The budget we passed in last session gave a 1.2% raise. Not much, but
it's better than nothing. This budget will give a raise in year 2. We
all want to give more, but where's the money gonna come from? We hear
all these wishlists of all the things you don't want or don't want this.
Again, I always pose the question and never get an answer. What do you
want to cut from the budget to fund it or what tax do you want to raise
to pay for it? It's that simple. The budget does have something in it
that I don't care for and Representative Glazier talked about it, but I
understand that's politics, it happens from time to time. The portion
that deals with tenure and excellence in public schools. I think that's
absolutely the wrong program. I think it absolutely solve no problem or
none of the problems. I think we'll be right back here dealing with this
probably two years from now. I don't think policy like this really
belongs in a budget. I've always been an advocate that policy pieces
like this should always run on their own two legs. They shouldn't be
included in budgets. I didn't agree with this bit in here, but this is
one that I lost. And I remember Representative Bill Culpepper, when I
got here, he said one of the first lessons he learned when he was the
Democrat rules chair, is that you don't win them all in the State
Legislature. This is one I didn't win, and if I had the opportunity to
vote on this, on its own two legs, I would absolutely vote no because it
solves nothing. But it is a part of this budget and I think the
responsible person has to look at the budget as a whole, our counties
are waiting, they want to know what we're gonna do. Fiscally, this is as
sound a budget as I've probably ever seen and I think it's going to move
the state in the direction that we need to move. I'm sure we'll hear
many more comments. We'll probably all say the same things until
everybody says it, but on the financial side of this budget, I find it
very difficult to make arguments against it. I find it very difficult to
even take seriously any comments about how this does nothing for pay
raises, when clearly it's in there year 2. Yes, I know, we want it
sooner, but you know, show us the money and how to do it or tell us what
tax you want to raise. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll conclude my
comments, but I ask the members to please vote for this budget. Let's go
home, the work's done, please vote yes.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative

Mr. Speaker and the ladies and gentlemen of the house well I have heard
it said on the other side of the isle that the devil is in the details
and it certainly is I want to talk just for a few minutes though about
how this effects real people in North Carolina and to do that I wanted
to use a example or two of a few emails that come from the west side of
the state which is where I am from. One of them was highlighted in an
article the in News and Observer and it comes from a teacher who loves
the profession but leaving the profession may be a mater of survival for
she and her family. This particular person has been a teacher since
2007, but her income is so low that her daughters ages 1 and 3 qualify
for medicaid. She says we never wanted to live in luxury, but we did
however hope to be able to take our little girls out for ice cream but
we did however want to know where we could find the gas money to visit
their grand parents find us the money and give us a pay raise in the
future I think I can find the money that was given to out of state
corporations and wealthiest individuals in our state. I think the money
is there the very. Another example another example of an email I got and
again this is from someone in the west I do not have a big problem with
no tenure I too would like to get rid of ineffective teachers I would In
this plan 75 percent of the teachers will be labeled ineffective when we
label the 25 percent of the best ones to get the 500 dollar bonus in
their pay. What if 60 percent of the staff are highley effective all
earning high scoors isn't that what you want the best for the best
teacher what is motivating the teacher 500 dollar bonus in their pay
what if 60 percent are effective isn't that what you want for the kids
in north Carolinawhat is motivating the teacher setting up a feeding
frenzy like seagulls after scraps and when it come to setting up a
feeding frenzy one of the places where we have spent some money and
continued our process of abandoning public education in north carolina
is with voucherw aboandoning public educationn how do we recruit quality
teachers in north Carolina how do we recruit quality teachers when they
have spent money and now they have spent moeny for their quality
educatrion and now they have to pay back college loans I believe that
there are six places in article 9 in the constitution where there is a
reference to free public school section 6 and 7 are pretty explicit when
they say state and public funding is for public school we are abandoning
public schools and the teachers in this school with this vote</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll hold up the weekend paper, up in our area, North Carolina sheds
11,000 jobs.  The month before that, we shed 4,000, the month before
that, 4,000.  There's a reason North Carolina's employment is the fifth
highest in the nation, consistently running around a point and a half
higher than the national average.  In my district, well over two percent
higher than the national average in some of my counties, and all across
rural North Carolina its two percent or higher.  Over the national
average.  Is the choices, the choices and the priorities that we've been
making at this general assembly.  We have chosen to give tax breaks to
those that are doing the best, the wealthiest, the top one percent of
North Carolinians, nearly $300,000,000 tax breaks for the millionaires,
the 8,500 millionaires in North Carolina get 300,000,000.  Thus
300,000,000 off of education, that's 300,000,000 off of economic
development, that's 300,000,000 that's not going to support our rural
hospitals and all.  Those are the engines of job creation in North
Carolina, and we're not supporting them.  And we are reaping the
consequences.  There's no way to a strong, prosperous, competitive,
job-rich North Carolina that's not through education.  Nobody can give
you a strategy that doesn't include education as its primary vehicle.
North Carolina has led, with our great university systems, but this
budget continues the devastating cuts to the greatest university system
in the nation, the university system that created an innovative,
productive North Carolina.  Over $500,000,000 of continuation cuts and
add another 100,000,000 cuts in this budget to a university system that
has been driving the future of North Carolina.  Visit the Centennial
campus down here at NC State.  Open your eyes and look around that's

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen, what was the number, how many hundreds of millions
of dollars or tens of millions of dollars were cut to the university
system and public education in 2009, when your party was in full control
of the general assembly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ballard, I don't know that I think call that number
exactly.  I do know that we entered the great recession in 2009, and I
do know when I came back in the senate, as a member, all revenues were
off 40%.  We were to close every university, every public school, every
community college in May, that year, if we had not had incredible
revenue sharing from the Federal government, and we were in an unusual,
an absolutely historic situation.  We used a metric, a program where the
universities were asked to determine their cuts.  And indeed, we did cut
them at that point.  But we didn't intend to sustain them.  We've added
to those cuts and doubled them, and doubled them again.  And that's the
dilemma</p>

America's history and indeed revenues and employment plummeted and
since. When you got back here i think in June of 2009 till now both
revenues and employment have inched up they've inched up slowly and
they've inched up slower in North Carolina relative to any of the other
states which is why were behind and its the policies that we pursued
versus the policies that our competitors in across the nation have
pursued.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One final question if the gentleman would yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
does he yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
he does
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you representative, well i guess were still waiting for the Obama
recovery but let me ask this. It was a statement made on this floor
about two years ago that said that the budget that we had then was gonna
cut twenty thousand teachers are you not aware that was completely false
that never happened that never materialized you aware of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
in my county of Haywood we cut 79 teachers and if you follow that out to
a hundred counties its seven or eight thousand teachers were cut and I
think that's a reasonably accurate figure. My point is that if you do
not invest and you do not keep your revenue streams to invest you will
not create the economy and the jobs and the growth that we need in North
Carolina
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
to ask the friendly representative a question
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
representative Queen do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
let me just end here I want to just
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
he does not yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you. My point is that we have made choices to give tax breaks to
those who are doing the best there are seventy thousand corporations in
North Carolina.  The tax breaks that we put into this budget 60 percent
of it goes to the top 200 . The top 200 out of seventy thousand.  These
are multinational out of state corporations for the most part.  So I
just point out if we want to make jobs we've gotta invest in small
business, we've gotta invest in rural economic development in North
Carolina again, half of our state is rural still.  We have cut our
regional partnerships out of this we have brought all the power to
Raleigh and expect its going to get my district in Western North
Carolina, I don't think so.  So I am voting no on this budget and I
suggest you might do also

thank you Mr Speaker. Members when we pass a budget and a revenue
package that funds that budget were announcing to the state and to the
world our values and our priorities.  Unfortunately this year for the
state of North Carolina the values of that package that we have protects
wealthy donors at the expense of virtually everyone else.  The budget is
irresponsible, it's fiscally irresponsible and morally irresponsible.
You've already heard some of the cuts in the budget, cuts to disabled
children to our rural centers to our hospitals our medicaid patients
more cuts to</p>

...people with mental illness. But when it came to filling the hole
created by the tax package, you turned to dismantling our public
education system. All of that destruction just so some wealthy donors,
some wealthy members of the state, could get a windfall they didn't
need. That's what we did we gave an unnecessary windfall to the
wealthiest in the state. We gutted our education system, the most
important pro-job, anti-poverty program we have. When we talk about
eating our seed corn, it usually means the cupboard is empty, we have
nothing else. But our cupboard wasn't empty, we made a tax-cut, we took
resources away from our package, purposefully. We're competing in a 21st
century global knowledge-based economy by stripping funding from our
education system, our research centers, our innovation labs. This budget
undermines our future, it's irresponsible, vote no.

Thank you. Mrs. Speaker. One hundred percent of federal poverty level
for a family of four is 23,550 dollars. 133% of the federal poverty
level for a family of four is 31,322 dollars. Now if a teacher comes to
work here in the state of North Carolina, and they have worked here for
five years, they can earn a whopping 30,800 dollars. Now the majority
party exposed the virtues of incentives. We need incentives to attract
the best and brightest business men to our state. We need incentives to
be able to attract businesses to our state. But no raises for teachers?
No incentives for our educators? I mean I can understand the reasoning
and logic behind incentives. But wouldn't that logic and reasoning apply
to our educators as well? The very folks that have daily interactions
with the future of our state. We need to send the right message to the
business community and give them these incentives and these tax breaks.
Let them know we are open for business. What kind of message are we
sending our educators, what kind of message are we sending to them. I'll
tell you, some of my colleauges have already said it. We are sending the
message, the majority party is sending the message, that we don't
prioritize our educators, that we don't want to reward them for
commensurate work. That they are way on the bottom of the totem pole.
And we've heard some things about there being some money for raises in
year two, which just so happens to be an election year. Now we talk
about a shell game earlier. These educators are not stupid. They
understand what's going on here, and they're not falling for it. This is
a terrible education budget, I think that it will set our state back.
Now even if we do attract businesses here, don't we need educated and
qualified workers to work these businesses? And if they are not getting
a quality education, if they are not being instructed by teachers that
are then rewarded appropriately, how are we going to put workers in
these businesses that we are shoveling money to so they relocate in our
state? These things don't work in isolation, one impacts the other. So
i'll be voting no.

<p id="150:00">
of late.  But I am sort of passionate when it comes to education and
you've heard me talk before about how long I've been in it. I think
Representative Langdon and I probably hold a record in here about
education. We both started sometimes around around 1945 in this system.
And I just want the teachers and the educators to know that I believe
that we have one of the best education systems in the United States of
America. Because I have followed this since the first grade all the way
up until now. And I've seen the changes that have taken place. And most
of the changes have been very positive. We've changed, as Doctor Flood
says, from the exclusive type education, where we excluded people, where
we didn't care whether they went to school or not. We didn't work with
the students who had disabilities and all of that. We just left them out
there. But then we included them. We went through all of the times where
we had to integrate the schools. All that. I was there and participated
in all these things. We had a lot of work to do and these teachers that
you're talking about helped make this possible. Many of those who were
along with me probably already have passed on or their retired. But we
taught some  of those students who are there right now working. They're
the ones who send me the emails and the letters saying what in the world
are you all doing to us out there in Raleigh? I got a bunch of them
today that I read from Clinton North Carolina asking me those questions.
I say well you know it's going to work out. Hopefully these things are
going to work out. You see, some of you probably don't know when we
start talking about tenure. I was glad to hear Representative Holloway
say he was against that portion of it because I am too. I've worked
through that era. When we had the year to year contracts. When the
principals, the so-called principals, would be sitting up there and they
would, if you didn't raise enough money that year to put into the budget
general fund, you might not have a job the next year. Some of them even
had teacher ??? where they would put, hire teachers that would come and
stay there and before the could reach the five, fifth year or fourth
year they would put them out and get a new set of teachers. Have
absolutely nothing to do with the competency of that teacher. I've been
through that. I've seen it all happen. And then I worked with Doctor
Dudley Flood, Gene Causby and Dawson Lauders, when we tried to get
things changed, so we could have tenure. So people would have some kind
of assurances that they could work from one year to another. And have,
set up housing and everything for their families. This happened. I'm not
talking about suppositions and all that. I'm talking about reality. And
I can tell you a whole lot of stories about that kind of stuff. And so
we don't want to see ourselves go back to that time where we have to
have principals making those decisions ??? somebody is going to work
from one year to another, especially when many of them didn't know what
they were doing. They couldn't evaluate. ??? Didn't know how children
learn. Many of them had not taught that long. Some of them were
unsuccessful teachers. So they said I don't think I want to teach. I'm
going to become a principal. So they could boss. Because they couldn't
teach. Check it out. I know what I'm talking about. And many of them
would do that. And they would go on and get their degrees,
administrative degrees and come in and if you asked them to go in and
teach a class they could not do it. You ??? You say these are the people
who could determine the top twenty five percent of their faculty. And
many of them do not know how children learn because if they did they
would know some of the teachers down the hall where, they would say that
they may not be effective, they may not be effective with everybody, but
people have teaching styles and their students have learning styles and
you have to match the two, to make things work properly. And sometimes</p>

... you think that teacher down there may be ineffective. It might be
the most effective person for that child that's in that class. Certain
ones.  So don't just come up and say we're going to pass a bill that's
going to go all the way through and be effective for everybody because
it might not happen that way. So it's a little bit more in depth than
that.
You know, we have attorneys in here, we have doctors in here, and all
that. Now let's suppose we had to go through that same scrutiny. Now
you've heard the thing where it says doctors bury their mistakes?
Lawyers send theirs to prison. And teachers have to live with theirs.
And so we have to live with ours from day to day, so therefore, we're
going to be a little bit more concerned about those people who are going
to be on our boards of education. Because they run for office, so they
win, they become county commissioners and all these kind of things.
These are our students. So yes, I was very concerned about those
students who would leave the classrooms. Those are the ones who voted
for me basically to come here. Students that I've taught over the years
that I've been administrator over the years. So you have concerns about
the whole child, the whole everything, the community.
And so I don't want us go down that road of saying that we have done
everything that we can on a budget like this. And maybe this is not
necessarily tied to the financial part, but like Representative Holloway
said, I hate to see policy go into a budget like this. And we have set
some bad policies in here when it comes to the tenure law. So I cannot
vote for this budget because of that, and some other things. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I did something
really dangerous recently and I'm not talking about jumping out of
airplanes like Representative Pierce or Representative Blust. And I'm
talking about zip lining through the rain forests of Costa Rica. I did
something even more dangerous. I Googled myself on the internet. And I
didn't know it was legal to put some of that stuff on there. But I found
on there a speech I made two years ago on the budget. And I'm going to
repeat myself because two years ago, I had third graders who would write
me and say with this budget we're going to close the schools down. Why
are you firing our teachers.
The Governor Purdue was up there saying we're going to devastate
education. We're going to decimate it, we're going devour it, we're
going to destroy education. And it turned out that what we were actually
appropriated was 99.8% of what she asked for. But yet, all the
prophecies from Representative Glazier and all the others who speak on
this thing, is that we're going to have to close the schools down
because they were just devastated.
And we hear from Representative Queen that we've had devastating cuts to
UNC. If I'm not mistaken, we still are number one in the nation in State
support for pupil for higher education. There should be devastating cuts
like that all over the nation and maybe we would have a great education
system.
The reality is that at K-12, we have about a 2% increase in spending. On
a per pupil basis, about a 1% increase in spending. And if you factor in
inflation it's probably zero flat. So let's cut out all of the
nonsensical rhetoric about devastating cuts to education.
Now I agree on some of the policy issues that the process used by the
other body could have stood some improvement. But let's at least talk
about the bill before us and not exercise ourselves too much with this
over heated rhetoric.

As the lady cried out in the balcony  I did. I saw her. I saw what
happened when she walked outside of that door. She’s on a walker. She’s
elderly. I heard frustration, pain, fear from someone I don’t know her.
I don’t know her. But she came here today to listen to us in the Peoples
House.  And somehow, I feel like, and yes I’m on the budget before
someone stands up and says stay on the subject. Because this budget is
about education.  The biggest portion of our budget is education.
Medicaid, Health and Human Services. The People’s House.  Representative
Stam just said the policy that was in this, that is in this budget, he
had some concerns with. You’ve heard that mentioned before. We have in
this budget the Excellent Public Schools Act.  We have never debated the
Excellent School, Public Schools Act on this floor. We didn’t last year,
we didn’t this year and it’s in our budget. And it’s a huge reform and a
huge change. And the educators in the state and I feel that that, as a
former educator, up there who still  feels just as passionate today
about those children that are just coming into the system. And it hasn’t
been debated.  We just passed, you all just passed tax reform. Not
revenue neutral.  A  2.5 billion dollars we’ve got to make up for in
four years. And yeah, we are turning and saying to teachers this year,
it’s in the budget next year a little bit of a salary increase.A little
bit  next year . Not this year. How much longer can you expect the
people like the lady in our gallery to sit back and not start crying
out? We’re frustrated. We’re afraid.  There are people living on far
less than all of us are up here are making.  We go home to comfortable
homes, thank God for that. But look beyond your front door, your front
seat, your seat up here. We came here because people back home voted for
us and said, go up there and take care of our, of us. There has been an
outcry, are we listening? I have a feeling when we all go back home,
forget emails, those aren’t people’s faces in our faces . When you go to
the church and go to the grocery store. Once this gets out you’re gonna
hear, we’re all gonna hear more and more and more. Education is the
foundation for good solid jobs in this state. The future. Everybody
knows that. Democratic, Republican. Public. Excellent Public Schools
Act. Not debated. Where are we going with it? Who’s going to benefit?
There’s a lot in this budget that a lot of people not in public schools
are going to benefit from.  I’m frustrated. I know that some of my good
friends on the opposite side are frustrated with what’s in here. If we
don’t like, many years I’ve sat in here and heard let the Senate fix it.
Well they blew it up. And we’re now going to fix it? Where have we got
to go? Why aren’t we taking the time to fix it? We can. Where’s the
will? I ask you vote no

<p id="165:00">
We created an environment for private sector job creation through making
wise, yet in some cases difficult decisions. It's about prioritizing,
creating a priority of what we need to fund and funding it correctly. We
don't have the luxury of past times, where you had all the money in the
world and you could just throw money at everything. We're not in those
times any more in this state. We're not in those times in this country.
We've got to make difficult decisions and we've got to fund those things
that need to be funded and we've got to make sure that we do it right.
I heard mentioned earlier, this mindset, this idea that we're cutting
Medicaid. It should be pointed out, if you open your budget and look at
page G12 and G13, there's over a billion additional dollars going to
Medicaid state dollars, going to Medicaid in North Carolina over the
biennium. That's just state dollars. That doesn't include the federal
dollars that will come along with it. There's a substantial amount of
additional money going for Medicaid in the state of North Carolina.
We're funding, as Representative Avila mentioned, a statewide
telepsychiatry program that we haven't had in this state to, again, help
address mental health needs. We're funding additional psychiatric beds
in this state, something that I can tell you even in the good times when
the democrats were in charge, they were cutting the number of mental
health beds in this state.
Even in the difficult times that we've had over the last three years,
Representative Dollar, Representative Avila, Representative Hollo and
many others of us in this chamber have worked to strengthen mental
health in this state and to fund those priorities. And we are doing
that, funding those beds, by helping to put money in for the expansion
as we see the new hospitals coming around.
We have funded an additional 2,500 Pre-K slots, making sure that more
children are able to receive that opportunity as we work to improve
early childhood education in this state and make sure that it's focusing
on children that are truly at risk.
I've heard mentioned rural funding and people concerned with what they
see in terms of how we're funding rural North Carolina in
infrastructure. I can tell you that I feel very good with the plan that
we've laid out in the Conf Report for funding the Rural Authority and
the Water Infrastructure Authority.
We're going to see more money put into rural North Carolina and through
the new Rural Authority that is in place, we will have members from
across the state that are going to come from rural counties, that are
going to represent those areas and we're going to have...We have the
assurance to the ______ who sits in there that every positive thing that
you could've seen, the quick response that you may have gotten out of
the Rural Center, you're going to see that same quick response out of
the new Rural authority. We will continue to monitor and make sure that
that is the case over the next year and if there are issues, we will
address them. But I'm confident that there won't be issues with that and
that we will get those quick responses as we move forward.
In terms of the Water Infrastructure Authority, that is targeted towards
tier 1 and tier 2 counties. We're going to make sure that rural counties
have the infrastructure in place that they need so that they can recruit
jobs to the rural areas of North Carolina.
We have added an additional facility in this state that will focus on
training law enforcement officers, something that's been an issue for a
number of years. We've not had a centralized location to train
correction officers and others, and we have put that in place in this
budget and are building up a facility at the old _______ Youth Camp to
make sure that we've got a place...to make sure when those correction
officers are going into those facilities that they're trained and
they’re ready to go to work on Day 1 versus going in there and sitting
on their hands for months at a time. And we're going to make sure that
they're trained.
We're tripling the size of the Tarheel Challenge Academy through this
budget, making sure that more kids who potentially are at risk and are
dropping out of high school have an opportunity to go back and to
succeed and to be productive citizens in the state of North Carolina.
I think there's a lot of things that we can be proud of in this budget,
including funding additional magistrates for rural counties, making sure
that those counties that are down to three could be bumped back up to at
least four magistrates to meet capacity and to make sure that law
enforcement has a magistrate there to help them, and also probation
officers to meet needs across the state to their capacity.
We’re doing those things that are needed to make this state run well but
make sure that it runs efficiently. Again, it's about prioritizing and
making sure that we're focusing on those things we truly need to do. At
this time, I believe, this is a good budget, a good Conf Report that
meets those needs and I would encourage your support

On a conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized to debate
the conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I won’t
be long because the hour is waning and many of us will have the
opportunity to go enjoy the fruits of the labors of those who came
before us. We’ll drive over those highways and enjoy the infrastructure
that North Carolinians made years before us, made sacrifices to make
sure it was in place. And we’ll go walk under the trees and enjoy the
shade, for those who planted those trees in anticipation of us. But you
know, it’s going to be pretty hard when you go to the beach, and your
children are following, your grandchildren. Because you see, you’re not
going to leave any footsteps in the sand. You’re not going to leave
anything for them to enjoy. You’re not going to leave a tradition of
sacrifice and provision for your fellow man. You’re not going to do that
because you have this philosophy in this budget that says let’s just pay
cash for this quarter. Let’s not invest for the future. Now I would dare
say virtually everyone in here has benefitted from the state of North
Carolina. Not just from private businesses that have enjoyed once again
those infrastructure items I talked about. Not from private businesses
that enjoyed the intellectual capital, that provided the researchers and
the technicians that attract those businesses in North Carolina. The tax
base that it generates. I would say that everyone in here in some way,
form or fashion, has benefitted from that. And then for us to say we’re
so conservative, we have a conservative budget. I heard someone say
that. Well, let’s talk about quickly what we’ve done. We’ve cut the
classroom teachers, the teachers’ assistants, increased funding for
vouchers, reduced the instructional support personnel. I don’t think
you’re going to be able to go into any community of this state and find
people who are going to say it was our aspiration, and someone said this
budget reflects the aspirations of the state’s citizens. You’re not
going to go into any community in this state and find people who say
yes, I want my schools to have less ability to produce good citizens for
our community. Yes, I want my children, the neighborhood children, the
children that live in my neighborhood no matter how fancy it may be,
that go to public school, I want them to have less opportunity, less
support in school, less ability to achieve. I don’t think you’re going
to find those neighborhoods in North Carolina and I don’t think this
budget is the aspiration of citizens of North Carolina and I certainly
want to dispel that myth. If the goal of this budget is to have a
well-educated, safe and healthy citizenry, which is another statement I
heard, we failed on all three accounts. We start out saying the goal of
this budget is to have a well-educated citizenry, and then we
demonstrate our priorities by having the cuts we have. It may not be
laughable, because it’s so sad. But it certainly shouldn’t be our effort
to put that forward to the citizens of North Carolina. They’re not going
to buy that. Your money goes where your priorities are, whether you like
it or not. You want to have a market-driven economy? You invest in the
market where you get the best returns. That’s in the citizens and the
future of North Carolina. That’s in our education system. It’s not in
some wild-eyed scheme that says we’re going to give you extra money
after you’ve come to North Carolina, and become fat, dumb and happy off
of the benefits we’ve provided, by giving you a workforce, by providing
an environment where you can thrive as a business, and you’re going to
take your profits and send them offshore, wherever. That’s not providing
for the future. If we’re going to have a future, we have to have a
future workforce. We have to have future innovators. We have to invest
in North Carolinians. Unless we’re just going to be a stop along the way
for four national corporations and big businesses to just stop by to get
tax cuts. The issue of telling teachers that you know, we’ve got a
reserve and so maybe in the second year, yeah, yeah, that sounds good.
I’ll say that. Maybe in the second year we’ll get you a pay raise. And
what I want you to do is take that maybe and go pay your mortgage or

you can take it and invest it and get a return on it. Or, maybe not.
Most likely not. You won't buy any groceries with it, that's for sure.
You won't buy any gas with it, that's for sure. You won't get out the
door of any store with a maybe. We're talking about supporting education
now. Today.
I had a friend tell me today, he said, you know, life is short. He said
life is short, you'd better enjoy it. You'd better make a difference
while you have the chance. So, what we've said now, and I've said this
when the budget that passed out of the House came, I said I only ask one
thing for the citizens of my district, District 29, and I get elected by
the same number of registered, voting aged population that you do, they
deserve the same respect. I engaged in a process, 2-1 margins on every
committee. You all earned that right to pass that budget. But I ask just
one thing on behalf of the people in my district in North Carolina, I
ask that you not go sell out. I ask that you stand by the budget that
you said you were faithfully creating. I asked that, that’s the only
thing I asked. I said look, you won the election. You won the right to
make the budget. You have the responsibility now to carry it out. I
asked one thing, I said don't go in there and roll over on the citizens
of North Carolina, who trusted in this process. Don't go in there and
sell us out. Because we trusted in a process and worked through it, and
now we've got a bill we can't even recognize. Looks nothing like what
you sent over there, and now someone is saying we'll fix it later. This
is later. This might be as late as it gets for some of you. This is
later. Well, let's put it off till the last three days of session, and
then say well we'll come back later, we've got a reserve, we'll fix it.
Well, first of all, you don't have a big enough reserve, and second of
all, you're going to be the same people, sitting in the same seats,
pushing off the same decision, avoiding the same responsibility, and
making a false promise to yourself.
You made a budget. You didn't fight for it. This is not it. It's back in
front of you. Fix it. Don’t come back in two years and fix it, don't
come back in six months and fix it. You're getting paid now. You went
through the process, you said this was what was best. How about
upholding the honor of this house. How about upholding the honor of the
oath you took to represent your citizens. If you believe in what you
did, in developing your budget, why can't we prevail upon you to stand
by yourself now? Why can't we prevail upon you to stand on your own
principles?
I heard a lot made about eugenics being in this budget. Should have been
in the budget long ago, yes. Now, eugenics was about the physical
destruction of people's bodies. This budget, by the stranglehold it puts
on education, effects the same principle on the minds of our citizens
going forward in the future. And we won't be able to pay restitution for
that. There won't be any reparations. There won't be any survival. There
won't be an opportunity, because no one will even think enough to say
something wrong was done. Because we won't have the intellectual
ability, the intellectual capital sufficient to do that. So I appreciate
that someone said that eugenics is in this budget. Remember all of you
came through North Carolina's education system at a time where you were
taught to think about your fellow human being. Taught to think about
righting the wrongs of the past. And that's the only reason it got here
this time. But you're setting us on a course where we won't have
children who can think. We won't have educators who care, and we won't
have a North Carolina that we'll want to live in.
Now, I know that I said that I'd be short, but maybe I, like you, have
changed my mind.
Finally, I want to talk about this environment for the private sector.
That we're supposedly creating an environment for the private sector,
and the private sector is going to save us from ourselves. The private
sector wants well trained employees. They want well trained technicians.
They want people who can think, and imagine, and create. And that’s not
the budget we have for education. We've let our children down. We've let
our grandchildren down. We let the institutions of this state that we
drew on, and</p>

<p id="180:00">
To achieve our success on, we have let them down. We have given nothing
back in this Budget. And every morning when you get up hopefully and you
look in the mirror and ask that question &quot;What have i given back to
North Carolina&quot;.
We know what you have taken, we know you are successful, we know you
have benefited from those sacrifices. And I hope no one in here thinks
they made in on their own, I hope no one is that delusional and they
went to the university of North Carolina and they build the whole ??. I
hope they don't believe that they were the ones responsible for the
instructors and for those suppliers and so forth been there. I hope that
you realize that you are a part of a greater North Carolina and you do
your part to keep it going. I ask you to show some courage again, I
asked before and we see the results. but I ask again because I know we
believe in redemption and we believe in second chances and second chance
is here now. Do the right thing on this budget, Vote No and take it back
and be true to yourself. I am not asking you to adopt my principles. Be
true to yourself at least that would be a step in the right direction.
Don't worry about me, worry about you now. And of course you just set
North Carolina on. Again I'd ask that you vote against the adaption of
this conference's rule.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representer of Durham, Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You recognize to debate the conference report a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker reminds the house of Courage, Principles, Really?!
What I have been hearing from those speakers is more of a desire to re
write history rather than to make any history. And how much more money
do you want? Remember when you left this house, we had a five billion
dollar gap. About two and a half in unemployment insurance and two and
half to the general fund. We had higher unemployment then we have today.
And after all those decades of being incharge with your education
policy, with your Governors, with your house and senate. We did the
national test show we were for fourth graders on reading and
comprehension. 66% were not reading and comprehending at grade level. So
how can you can lecture us as &quot;No, you are doing it wrong
Republicans&quot;. What were your results?!
And how much more do you want to spend? That's what gets me every time.
We are investing more than 20.6 billion dollars in the state of North
Carolina from the general fund. If you add up all the money including
the federal money coming in, it tops out at 50 billion dollars. So you
want to add a couple of more 100 million here and there? That would be
nice. But then you want to get back into ?? ??. Do you realize in this
state there are savings reserve account, prior to engagement of this
budget is 1.1 billion below where it is supposed to be. Do you realize
that six year repair and renovation fund is behind 4.7 billion dollars?
Do you realize that the medical retirement obligation of this state is
in the whole over 26 billion dollars. Let's get real. The only answer i
ever hear is, raise more money, raise more taxes, don't cut the tax
rates, Keep them high, raise them more. That's not the answer. The
answer is reform. The answer is being responsible with the budget. The
answer is making responsible investments. Responsible investments in
education. Working to improve the policy of this state. Making sure our
universities continue to be strong and our communicologists continue to
be strong and this budget does that.</p>

...spoke very eloquently on Medicaid. You can't invest more than what
we're investing the healthcare of this State. And what we provide in
this State. Somebody needs to appreciate that. We're doing the best we
can and just as in public safety, we were reforming transportation.
Reforming the effectiveness of how our commerce is done in this State.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this is a good budget. A strong
budget. A responsible budget. A reasonable budget. A budget that deals
with the realities and not the rhetoric. And I commend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall. Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the conference report a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized to debate the conference report a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I'll say it again. I'll be short this time. Now,
we're going to talk about education and I keep hearing, I haven't heard
anybody object to the continued refrain about someone wants to raise
taxes. And of course that hasn't been said by anyone on this side of the
aisle, so I'm not sure where that flight of fancy is coming from. But
when we ask for responsible budgeting to be done, we certainly have the
revenue right now without making cuts to provide an adequate education
to our children. Now some of you, again, folks who are historians and
Representative Stam and many others in the Chamber who are
constitutional scholars and historians, etc., would know about a little
something called the Constitution of the State of North Carolina. And of
course it says the General Assembly shall provide by taxation and
otherwise for a general and uniform system of free public schools which
shall be maintained at least nine months in every year and wherein equal
opportunities shall be provided for all students.
And so it's a pretty lofty goal and one reason North Carolina achieved
this status. And when you read through the constitution you're going to
see a lot of things about our duty for education. You're not going to
see something that says let's have a comprehensive branding strategy and
provide funding for the Department of Commerce to develop a
comprehensive branding strategy to support North Carolina. And spend
$800,000 from somewhere in this budget.
Now if it's tax neutral, it's revenue neutral, it didn't increase taxes
to support the budget. But $800,000 magically appears for a
comprehensive branding strategy. And then $1.5 million a year after
that. Now I don't know who's getting the sweetheart deal. I don't know
who's the comprehensive branding strategy expert in here or in this
State. I don't know who it is that made whatever move was necessary to
get that. That's something we've never had before. It's never been shown
to be studied. Hadn't had a committee report on that. Recurring $1.5
million. I don't know who's getting the hook up. Somebody's getting the
hook up. Somebody in here knows who's getting the hook up. $1.5 million,
I'm going to change my profession and I'm going to be a branding
strategist from now on. I need to get part of that action.
That is the kind of budgeting that we're talking about that does not
serve North Carolina. And what's that? Thirty or forty teachers. First
year. Seventy or so teachers the next year. And then recurring, that
we're taking out of our classrooms. And we say we need to do this. We
have to make this cut. We have to have these 70 teachers go on
unemployment or be unemployed and take that opportunity away from our
children because we need to have this branding strategy, $800,000 worth
the first year and we got to maintained this thing at $1.5 million as
far as the eye can see. We got to have this, we don't need education. We
can make that trade off. Doesn't require us to raise any taxes. But this
is the kind of decision we're making.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think you should do better. I think you did
better initially. And once again, I'm going to prevail on you. Look at
what you've done here. Look at what you've accepted. Look what's been
shoved down your throat. Stand up for your people. Stand up for the
people who elected you. I hope, once again...</p>

Representative McElraft, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wonder if Representative Hall would yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall does the gentlemen yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d be glad to yield when I complete my statement to the gentle lady.
So now, you have the opportunity to quantify it.  If you ever wanted to
know, how do you fix this in your mind? You think about the teachers
that you’re going to lose in your districts and then you think of this
branding strategy that’ll be like, as they say, pornography, you’ll know
it when you see it.  You don’t,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen’s time is expired. Does the gentlemen yield to
Representative McElraft?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll yield to Representative McElraft.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McElraft, does the lady  wish to state her question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Speaker.  I just wanted to ask Representative Hall if he
understands that the branding was asked for by Commerce so that they
could market the state of North Carolina for jobs.  It’s all about jobs
and do you understand that those jobs than do bring in taxes which will
then hire teachers. If we don’t have our jobs in North Carolina do you
understand that we won’t have enough money to pay teachers and that’s
what the branding strategy’s about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, if I can respond Mr. Speaker?  Well, I certainly appreciate the
fact that the Department of Commerce asked for a honeypot to dip out of
and again I don’t know who’s getting the hook up for it. But I do
challenge the idea that the Constitution anticipated that we would
create in some other entity of state government the responsibility to
fund and pay for public education.  I do oppose the idea that we will
say we’ll create some other jobs and then that will create some other
revenue later on that then we’ll start to spend on our public education.
 I think the constitution anticipated that we would pay for our public
education as we go. That we would make the sacrifices because it was so
important they put it in this Constitution.  Every state doesn’t have
that responsibility, North Carolina has it in our Constitution and it’s
been our saving grace to this point.  But I think, and I appreciate your
question, because you have shown the creativity that people now have in
order to get around their Constitutional responsibility to support
education.

Motion pertaining to today’s calendar.

There was another conference report that was read in earlier today. I
believe it was for Senate Bill 337, but also ask that that be added
today calendar.

Would the gentleman state the subject matter?

I believe its the NC charter school advisory board. Conference report on
that. It was calendared for tomorrow, but I think the thought was to try
to dispose of as many of these bills today as we can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, the 337 is on the calendar. That’s correct, there
was one withdrawn and I guess procedurally, without objection will be
added to today’s calendar.
Members, we do intend to dispose of other bills on the calendar and
three conference reports or two that were added and one that was
reintroduced, but the Chair is kind of looking at the will of the body
to maybe take a brief recess. The clerk tells me don’t do that just yet
so the clerk will be at ease.
The clerk’s never at ease, but the House will be at ease.
Ladies and gentlemen, apparently there was a technical problem with the
server on the budget conference report. We’re just trying to confirm
that we did record it electronically, that’s what we’re holding off on,
then we’ll take a brief recess.
We have confirmed that the vote was recorded. Ladies and gentlemen, we
will take an almost 30 minute recess. We will come back at 5:45.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you’ll wait a moment. The rules Chair will be
announcing a rules meeting in the recess so we will do a 45 minute
recess, we’ll reconvene at 6:00.
