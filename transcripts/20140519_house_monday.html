The House will come to order. Members will take their seats, visitors
will retire from the chamber, the sergeant at arms will close the doors,
members and visitors will please silence all electronic devices and the
prayer will be offered by Representative Murray. Members and visitors in
the gallery will please stand and remain standing for the pledge of
allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please bow with me in meditation over Psalm 100. Make a joyful noise
unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the lord with gladness: come before
his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he
that hath made us and not we ourselves. We are his people and the sheep
of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his
courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. For the
Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all
generations, amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to
the republic, for which it stands. One Nation, under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all. Representative Burr is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, the journal for Thursday, May the 15th has been examined
and found to be correct. I move that it be approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr moves that the journal for May 15th be approved as
written. Those in favor will say &quot;I,&quot; those opposed
&quot;no.&quot; The &quot;I's&quot; have it, the journal is approved as
written. Are there any petitions, memorials, or papers addressed to the
General Assembly or the House? There are not. Without objection we will
introduce the bills and resolutions after adjournment. It's quite a long
list but we'll get to it shortly if you're waiting to see where your
bills go. Ordinarily we would welcome the pages tonight but the audience
is a little thin so we'll welcome you tomorrow. Thank you for being with
us this week. Notices and announcements: The nurse of the day is sitting
in the back row. Her name is Julie Alexander of Apex.
[APPLAUSE]
I would have been in big trouble if I'd forgotten her. She can probably
tell you that Apex means the peak of good living and that it's
recognized as the best place to live in the United States by all the
publications that matter. We also would like to extend the privileges of
the floor to Debbie Deller, the clerk of the Ontario legislature. Is she
here? If you would welcome her.
[APPLAUSE]
Representative Burr is recognized for a motion.
