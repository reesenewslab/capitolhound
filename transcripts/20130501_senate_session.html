environmental rule or more stringent in Federal or State rules, there
are exemptions to do such as for same threats the public health safety
and welfare and several other exemptions as well. Part 3 of the bill
allows a bill that is inert to be big in place. It also clarifies
compliance boundary interpretations and conditions that trigger
regulatory response and extend certain permits from eight to 10 years
and makes technical amendments to the APA. Part 4 of the bill would add
a new provision to allow governing the requirements for fiscal notes,
the administrative rule making process and exempt agencies from a
requirement that a fiscal note will be prepared over the proposed rule
change if it’s the repeal of a rule. Section 5 of the bill which tell
with the tar reverend ___[02:02] there was an amendment the Senator ____

The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What the amendment does is clarifies the definition of a billed upon
area includes only impervious surfaces on certain environmental permits,
it will also has a few technical changes that really doesn’t do much to
the bill. With that I will take questions but I do think Senator Hunt
has an amendment that we should take up first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
for the Senate…Senator Hunt did you wanna be recognized? Senator Hunt is
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, thank you Mr. President I do have an amendment it’s on the

there is no further discussion or debate…

Mr. President…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein for what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just come at dashboard to work and figure it out what does this
amendment does actually, I read what the amendment does but I don’t
understand what it does. So, question for the amendment sponsors…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown do you yell for the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will try to answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, what we are doing in this amendment is changing the definition that
built upon the area to go from impervious or personally impervious to
only impervious and…

hunting those points to the property insurance rates actually go down.
so we passed as written, we're going to raise insurance rates on home
owners and now
with water supplies. Fayetteville has also protections around the
drinking water supply. they negotiated with car washes in error in times
of water shortage, which then feel like it's happening right now as much
right as we gotten, but all introduced project for years when I will go
through another drought is nothing in state law that gives the direct
cities to negotiable car washes to limit the amount of water they
produced during a drought. those ordinances. their goal Raleigh
experiences sewage backups from fast-growing grace and his amendment and

down those which fights because of our unique conditions ask what
happens that the mountains are different from the Piedmont is different
from the Cubs to all manner of model ordinances. the deer puts out there
would've been similar to those in the community. so what were now saying
is, whenever that model ordinances. that's what the local community is
stuck with for time immemorial. this is another example of us get into
what is not how business estate should not be dictating to local
communities how to protect their people. and yet,we have a provision
here that absolutely hamstrings. local people from set of rules that
work for this reason  I  opposing this legislation, and I'm sorry that
this is a common set of bad enough to talk for sets and I couldn't find
them on Bill and I now found it an object of the reading of the
appropriate time, but in the last regulatory reform bill is much less
bad bipartisan support of the building went through in the last session
now is because the members, the majority parties out of members minority
party and we negotiated a deal and one item in that field as to move the
water permits from five years eight years to one year later you are
moving from eight years to ten years. I was at a negotiated item. how is
it something you actually may need one of our clients may not feel like
it today.but when we negotiate things I think that we should honour our
negotiations and said I could have just pointed out, Senator Brown and I
will talk to him after session about am hoping we can adjust that minor
point, just so we can honor the commitments we make to each other. Thank
you

I can

an issue centre signs in her brown reservoirs because blizzard/ go from
eight to ten years is probably good language talk about that more than I
think that I think you'll like that. we talk about having a big night,
but talk about the city County rules out nothing more straight in the
state of our rules. the provision I mentioned earlier, and in its
individual and it says
that there is extensions of those exemptions are a serious, and for
unforeseen threat to the public health, safety or welfare of the general
assembly or U.S. Congress expressly requires an agency to adopt rules
provision, federal or state budgetary policy of federal regulation
required by the U.S. Congress to be a him by the state were exactly the
type of actions in the bill to address those issues as number has
concerns about. I think Google is not indefatigable and I has really
resonated with by the Centre to understand over zero is diagnosed on
this very topic centres on those pigs learned them. I appreciated their
exceptions in here, however, absolutely none of them apply to any of the
circumstances. by this point in a serious and unforeseen threat by
definition means you can't force it. well you know the Camden County.
they now misled on how mobile we know we have problems with that in our

Senator Kinnaird what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. I have heard loudly and clearly from my local
governments who are very concerned over the very issues that Senator
Stein spoke to and I wanna to start at the top of what happens when
there are local ordinances and state ordinance that maybe more stringent
than the Federal. 17 industries in North Carolina are not regulated by
the ___[00:58] but I wanna bring it down to the local level. We have
water requirements in our areas that are distinct and we have dealt with
them on a local basis, on a local level dealing with what we have here.
And we have put all of those in jeopardy. We must think locally and
somehow we have been going that wrong direction locally, we take away
people’s water systems in airports and then we also tell them that they
can’t do what they know is best for their area. So, I’m going to vote
against this bill, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This issue that has been discussed by Senator Stein and as well as
Senator Kinnaird was when this bill came before the commerce committee
and it is this preemption of the ability of local communities whether
it’s a city, county or town to adopt regulations that might be different
from what the State Government for Federal Government might establish.
Historically we have always view regulations mistake as setting
basically a floor and that a sealing, you couldn’t fall below that
standard if that was the only standard user could subscribe to, I know
for eight years ___[02:25] City Council in Durham, our city county
planning commission and there was case we pull together stakeholders
from the business community, the environmental community and other
stakeholders and interest group to formulate the first environmental
regulations we had in Durham County which everyone embrace, which would
be different from what the state would have required. It’s just not a
one size fits all the solution, it’s has to be solutions that are
individually tailored based upon the needs of individual communities and
that’s what we should be about protecting, we should not attempt to do
what…We should not from Reilly trying to identify what that standard
should be for the mountains in North Carolina, of what should be in our
coastlines and for that reason I think we can stay away from this type
of legislation, we really need to allow that ___[03:18] that can fold at
the local level that’s why people have a voice, that’s where they
uniquely understand the concerns of their communities and that’s where
they can best tailor it and solutions that are appropriate not a one
size fits all solution that comes from Reilly or from Washington.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To inquire the gentleman from Onslow would yell to a question Mr.
President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown do you yell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown I believe that in 2011 before the long session started
that year you and group of other Senators went around the state holding
public hearings on regulatory reform. The question is did you have a
group of people come forward and say that they needed more rules and
more regulations or where they pleading for less rules and less
regulations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate we did we had a group that traveled across the state in six
locations across the state. We had hundreds of people show up in some
cases and just about all of those cases anybody that had a business
interest at all farmers, you name it, they are all compliant about the
rules and regulations that we had in the state. To be honest, there are
some environmental groups over there that complaint we didn’t have
enough. So, we heard at both sides but on the business community they
all compliant about too many rules and regulations and I think the goal
of reg-reform…

[Speaker Changes] Senator Rabon of Brunswick county will explain the
bill
[Speaker Changes]  Thank you Mr President This bill does two things in
effect and effects two parts of the state, one has to do with the
reservoir in the central part of the state, and the other part is the
coastal area. Senator Nesbitt likes to give a little history, so I give
a little history, a quick history lesson about North Carolina. On the
coast people settled in the communities, grew up on the edges of rivers
or near the mouths of rivers. As they moved inland the Piedmont to the
mountains they settled the bay, headwaters and along ridge lines. So we
get our water from two different places the people  in the mountains and
the  Piedmont their water supply from reseviors or dams, they trap it
from the aquifer. When we get to the coast we don't have that luxury. We
don't have the defined watersheds we don't have the places to build
reseviors so we get our water from  either ground or surface water, and
the surface water is of course rivers.
What this bill does is it allows the coastal counties to remove the
water from the rivers or the surface water there, and not have to return
it directly to that water or to that main stream  river. The reason
being they may have to pipe that water 35 miles inland if its utilized
it'll be piped right back to the same river to go offshore with the next
tide. This bill allows that not to happen and we can put it from one
basin to another  because its going offshore when we take the last
drink, we're not starving anyone  upstream or downstream of a water
supply.
The other thing that this bill does in its ??  abbreviate the
modification process. This process of has historically taken three to
five years and cost the counties three to five million dollars, A
million dollars a year if you  want to do that math. This bill will
allow a modified process  it is still stringent it has to go through the
public review it has to go through scrutiny and approval process but it
will take about one year and will cost the counties and locals about
150,000 dollars. Its a time saving  measure its a measure that helps all
the coastal counties and all the coastal areas. There is a provision in
the bill, many people in this body are quite concerned over a lawsuit
that occurred I believe in Supreme Court and we were very careful and
worked with all parties to assure everyone in the state that the proper
notification would be made, and this can only effect  those specific
areas that are mentioned . So I would appreciate your support its needed
and thank you very much.

[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr President I want to share with you that
apex, cary and morrisville all municipalities in my constituency
welcomes this opportunity this common sense approach to increased
efficiency in the regulatory process. Senate Bill 341 is a science based
approach striking a good balance between protecting our environment and
efficiency in government. This will help us when we are in a position to
need to modify our current IBT plan because right now we are 15 years
and over 10 million dollars in trying to get online the western water
treatment plant that  hopefully will be open soon and at some point in
the future we may need some modifications and its very welcome and its
reassuring to know that perhaps it will not  15 years and all of that
taxpayer money to make it happen. Thank you for your efforts I know this
was a group effort for many many stakeholders

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. This bill comes to us from the Estate Planning
and Fiduciary Laws Section Legislative Committee of the North Carolina
Bar Association, also the Business Law Section, and the North Carolina
Secretary of State's office weighed in on this. In addition, the Clerks
of Court of North Carolina Association has also reviewed these changes.
There are a number of changes that are not technical corrections, but
they're very technical in nature, so I will not belabor those points but
would be happy to address questions. There are two policy changes I
would like to call to your attention: One is the elective Shared
provisions will be based on this bill on the number of years a person is
married; and the second policy change is that this bill will expand the
power of a guardian over an incompetent still under the jurisdiction
oversight of the Clerk of Court in the court system to not only take
advantage of the Federal Annual Tax Exclusion, but also make qualified
transfers for tuition and medical purposes. I encourage your support of
this act, this bill.

Senate Bill 368 ?? description, pistol permits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bingham will be recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate. I had some
rather unusual callers on this bill when they saw the title. It doesn't
mean if you take drugs you get a free pistol, but it does mean that you
will pay ten dollars for a copayment - currently there's a twenty dollar
copayment for non-emergency medical care fee. ?? fees went from five
dollars to ten dollars in 2011, and with the rising cost of prescription
drugs this will help the Sheriffs offset some of their cost. On the
pistol permits, more work goes into denying a permit than issuance of
one, so</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, I wanted to bring
something to your attention. I’ve seen it occur twice. I’m not on all
the committees, so I don’t know how much it’s occurring but, in essence,
the call for division is being ignored by the committee chairman. We’re
in a situation here where that’s got to work to the detriment of the
majority because you don’t have to mess around to beat us. You outnumber
us two-to-one. It’s very easy to defeat us and, I’m going to tell you,
if we start running this place ignoring the rules, we’re going to get in
trouble. Rules and say you’re not going to have it and then we won’t ask
for it and you all won’t ask for it. I’m not so sure that both sides of
the aisle weren’t asking for it today. I would ask that the leadership
here speak with the committee chairs. Either change your rules or ask
them to abide by the rules. It looks very bad to the public when we
ignore them and it clearly appears to the public that the vote was
called the wrong way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further notices or announcements? Any further business to come
before the Senate? If not, the Chair recognizes Senator Berger for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate do now adjourn, in

resolutions, and the receipt of messages from the House and the
governor, to reconvene on Thursday, May 2nd, 2013 at 11:00 a.m.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion is the Senate do now adjourn, subject to the stipulations
stated by Senator Berger, to reconvene Thursday, May 2nd at 11:00 a.m.,
seconded by Senator Tucker. All in favor say aye, opposed no. The ayes
have it. The Senate stands adjourned.</p>
