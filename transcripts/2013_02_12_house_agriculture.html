?? to economic recovery and acknowledging the critical role  farmers
play and maintain our national security. This issue should be a high
priority. In the words of Supreme Allied Commander of NATO Wesley Clark,
“If we cannot feed, fuel, and clothes ourselves, then we cannot defend
ourselves.” The American urban sprawl is destroying our nation’s
farmland at a rate that puts the future of our food security at risk. A
shocking 78% of vegetables and 67% of our dairy products are produced in
areas threatened by development. What happens when we pave over our last
farm? What happens when food goes the way of oil, and Americans on
reliant of another set of foreign imports? What happens when the thin,
green line becomes thinner? There are no alternatives to food. We either
have it or we don’t. America has been blessed with rich, fertile land
that can produce enough food for our population and millions of our
foreign neighbors. Many countries have problems with drought, flooding,
and lack of fertile soil. We’re very fortunate to have favorable weather
conditions, fertile soil, and technology that help prevent the crops
from drowning. We should not take our resources for granted. In this
country, we have more goods and resources than we need. If we’re out of
bread in the pantry, we can go to the grocery store. With the help of
modern technology, our farmers produce enough food for the global
population of 7 billion. Modern agriculture is so efficient that just
one American farmer feeds 155 people. Because of rapid population
growth, this same farmer will need to feed 250 people by the year 2050.
Even though the population keeps increasing, it also shifts. In the
Industrial Revolution, we saw more people moving from farms into big
cities. But now we see people moving into suburbs and developments built
on top of prime farmland that creates a disconnection between the crops
farmers grow and the food we eat. In other words, most Americans do not
see beyond the grocery store shelves. They do not realize the work and
the time that it takes someone to grow the crops in order for the food
to be in the grocery store. We need to be appreciative of our farmers
and support what they do to keep this country running. In the last three
years, the production of agriculture has been one of the economy’s few
bright spots while the rest of the economy has been struggling. In the
past 30 years, Congress has been taking steps to ensure that America’s
farmers are never in the position of seeing farms disappear while
population grows. Recently, however, farmers and ranchers have lost $15
billion in farming in the name of deficit reduction. We cannot let our
farms disappear due to political pressure and budget cuts. Our farmers
support our country and we need to support them. As stated in the FFA
Creed by EM Tiffany, “I believe that American agriculture can and will
hold true to the best traditions of our national life.” We must stand up
and protect the thin, green line of the American farmers who will meet
the needs of today’s and tomorrow’s citizens. Farming was and still is
the backbone of our country. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Waddell will make the presentation,
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think she did an outstanding job. And we all talk
about uniforms in high school? This is the kind of uniform I like to
see. I was going to ask Representative Horn if he had anything that he’d
like to say [AUDIO FADES OUT]

certificate, I did not have a chance to give it at the FFA gathering
