  Senate will come to order. Sergeant at arms, close the doors. Members go
to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery, please silence all
electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is the Reverend Peter
Milner, Senate Chaplain, all members and guests in the gallery, please
stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please pray with me. Lord, you are moving here, even tonight, in our
hearts and in our minds and in our souls and we pray that you would move
and direct us by the power of your holy spirit, empower us to do work
that is pleasing to you and your sight and we pray for this week, that
it would be a fun week, a challenging week, and that we would work
together for the great state of North Carolina. And Jesus, it&#39;s in
your name we pray. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, the journal of Thursday, February 5, 2015 has been
examined and is found to be correct. I move that the Senate dispense
with the reading of that journal and it stand approved as written.
Without objection, the journal for February 5th stands approved as
written. Do we have any notices or announcements? Is there any further
business to come before the Senate? If not, the chair recognizes Senator
Pate for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate do now adjourn subject
to the standard stipulations set forth in Senate Rule 24.1 and
announcement of select committees to reconvene on Tuesday, February
10th, 2015 at 11:00 AM, which will be a skeleton session, to recess and
reconvene at 2:00 PM. Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator. The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn, subject
to the standard stipulations and the announcement of select committees
to reconvene Tuesday, February 10th at 11:00 AM for a skeleton session,
seconded by Senator Barefoot. All in favor will say aye. Oppose no. The
aye&#39;s have it. The Senate stands adjourned.
