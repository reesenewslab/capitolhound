Madam Chair and other members of the committee for being provided this
opportunity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, Madam Chair. What is Senator
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He's making comments and then we will have
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm just, the reference to a committee substitute, I'm not sure which
one are we.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There's a PCS that will be adopted in just a minute. We're just allowing
the two bill's sponsors to make brief comments before we start.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will simply keep my comments extremely abbreviated. When this bill was
originally filed, it was simply to allow the city of Durham an
opportunity to use a designed Bill of to pursue a police headquarters
project for the city. When it came over from the Senate, that's
basically what it was about. It was initially put on an agenda in
Finance. The night before that meeting I did see a proposed committee
substitute that was dealing with its standing water and sewer to a
project known as 751. When I noticed that that had been added to the
bill, I approached Representative Moore - Tim Moore that is - and we
decided that it would be pulled from the agenda and we proceeded to work
together to come up with what would seem to be a good approach for the
proposed committee substitute that was present at that time to move
forward. We've worked on that probably for the last two weeks now, and
it's my understanding that there will be a proposed committee substitute
that deals with that. I know there was discussion about another
potential proposed committee substitute, so I'm not quite sure which one
is coming forward at this time, but I stand behind the type of approach
that I and Representative Moore were able to come up with. It basically
codified an agreement that was renegotiated between the mayor of the
city of Durham and a developer while it is done within the scope of a
statewide bill it is likely that there's probably only one project that
would meet the requirements. That's what I would have to say. If there
are any comments at appropriate time, once the committee substitute goes
forward, I'd certainly welcome the opportunity to address them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Woodward
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. Ladies and Gentlemen of the Committee, as
primary sponsor of the bill and the senator whose project this district
resides in, I do not support the language that is before you, the
proposed draft that is before you. Madam Chair, after conferring with
the Durham delegation, I have two requests. I respectfully request
first, that you not hear this bill today, and secondly, I respectfully
request that you refer this bill back to the Senate.
She has the authority, yes. As chair of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it would certainly be helpful if the two primary sponsors were
singing off the same page. We have this bill before us because it does
require - has an annexation provision in it which requires it to come
into the Finance Committee and let me confer with our counsel over here
and see what we need to do. Just hold up a minute.
Senator Woodard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a minute. Come over here and let's talk.</p>

[Speaker changes.] Madame Chairwoman?
[Speaker changes.] The Sargent-of-Arms will insure that the PCS is
before the members....where the Senators can wrestle with it at that
point.
[Speaker changes.] Madame Chairwoman?
[Speaker changes.] May I ask the members to ... is this the PCS??  Do we
have the proper PCS out?
[Speaker changes.] The easiest way to identify the PCS is by Jerry
Cohen's??? drafting code?????????? Up here in the long list, you'll have
LB85 as the ending series on that long line...
[Speaker changes.] Does everybody LB85 on the line that says
&quot;proposed House Committee Substitute S315PC...S85248, LB85?  Is
that the version everybody has before them.  If not, raise your hands.
Please. I think all the members have the proper PCS before us. Senator
McKissick, do you wanna' present the bill or do you...would you...
[Speaker changes.] Sure.
[Speaker changes.] You want the staff to handle it for you?
[Speaker changes.] I'll just make some brief comments about it. And we
certainly welcome the opportunity for staff to explain it in detail and
clarity. This is a pretty narrowly drawn bill. It is a statewide bill...
[Speaker changes.] Senator, I'm gonna hafta stop you just a minute.
Representative Hager, you're recognized...to have the PCS before
us...you move to have the PCS before us for the purpose of discussion
without objection? Hearing none, you may proceed Senator.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Madame Chairman. This particular bill is
narrowly drawn...it is a statewide bill.  What it essentially would
allow for is a sixty day window of time after the passage of the bill
for a project that might have come before a municipality to submit a
request for basically a voluntary annexation at some point in the
future.  In this case, we would be amending the City of Durham's
charter...the City of Durham's charter basically allows three years for
annexation to this time. The bill would in fact allow for ???? ten year
window for that type of annexation to occur. There was some concern in
the City of Durham in looking at a particular project, the 751 project
which has been the focus of discussion, that that may not payback
sufficient revenues up for perhaps seven or eight years so it could
become a drain upon the city's resources.  The Mayor of the City of
Durham had worked with the developer...and of course, it was determined
that a ten year window of time for an effective date for annexation
would be appropriate. In addition, there was a water/sewer/utility
agreement that was presented to city council..which the city council in
fact rejected. And, I might add, this dilemma in Durham has been
somewhat dividing for our community. This project is located in Durham
county but not within the Durham city limits.  When this project came
before the Durham County Commissioners, they voted in favor of it and
there were zoning categories that were attached to their approval as
well as certain committed....

<p id="10:00">
...?? all of that information was incorporated into a water and sewer
utility agreement that went before city council, which city council
rejected recently on a 4-3 vote.  Assuming that developer goes within
that sixty-day window of time, all of those details that were contained
in the water-sewer agreement become applicable and binding.  They
included, basically, about nine million dollars of transportation
infrastructure improvements that would be made by the developer at no
cost to the city of Durham and no cost to the state of North Carolina.
In terms of other committed elements that were part of the original
zoning approval, they would also remain binding upon the developer.
That is essentially what you have here.  There also are the original
provisions within this bill that allowed for the city of Durham to use a
design bill approach for pursuing construction of police headquarters.
In addition, there was language added to allow the city...the county of
Durham to proceed work on a water treatment plant, a waste-water
treatment plant, also using design bill approach.  For purposes of being
concise, that is the essence of what you have before you.  The project,
which is being contemplated in Durham, that would potentially fall
underneath this state-wide bill, would have a potential cost and
build-out of about 450 million dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Woodward.  Sir, do you have any comments that you would like to
make?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick summarized the bill.  I would add that there were
actually two votes for water and sewer extension on this.  One about a
year and a half ago that was a 7-0 vote before you all considered, those
of you who were here last summer, considered a bill about this last
summer and it was under the proposal of this bill that the city council,
or specifically the mayor, began negotiating.  But again, there have
been two votes on the water and sewer extension.  A 7-0 vote and then
three weeks ago the 4-3 vote on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I might simply add that the 4-3 vote...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, do you wish the floor again, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Madame Chair.  Excuse me, I apologize.  The 4-3 vote occurred after
discussions between the mayor of the city of Durham and the developer
relating to many of these infrastructure improvements.  And as I recall
there was an additional two-million dollars of infrastructure
improvements, which the developer agreed to make.  But it was, as I say,
a 3-4 vote before city council.  So, that is what brings it here.
Whatever this body chooses to do, it will be respected.  And Durham as
been divided on the issue, I might say.  There's no simple answer for
this one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair.  Members, we had a good public hearing on this
on Monday of week.  It was about an hour and a half.  There's been a
good, healthy discussion of this bill, and I know that folks have heard
from both sides.  As I've said before, I view this as a property rights
issue.  The situation where the city denied access to water to private
land owners that had the effect of stifling the landowners right to use
that property.
It's worth noting the county commission had approved this plan.  This
property lies outside the city limits.  Durham already sells water to
other folks outside the city limits on two conditions:  one, provided
the landowner pays for all the infrastructure, and that the landowner
pays twice the city rate.  This is a case where the landowner agreed to
do that.  The bill that is before you today, members is the result of a
lot of discussions between the developer, the developer's
representatives, the folks from the city, I know the mayor's been
involved in the discussions, and also Senator McKissick and I have had
discussions on this.  I think this is a very fair compromise on the
issue of the two sides.  It has the utilities being provided to the
developer at the full cost to the developer.  It also gives the city the
right to do the annexation.  And this is a... this developer and the
family members that founded Cree Lighting, which is a good company in
this state, these are good stewards folks.  These are good folks;
they've lived in Durham for years; when you heard folks come testify at
the public hearing, they said they wanted jobs.  This project is going
to bring 3,000 jobs to North Carolina.  It's going to give our folks
jobs; it's going to increase the tax base in Durham county.  It's going
to do a lot of good things, frankly, that go beyond the confines of
Durham.  It's going to help North Carolina.  And the folks opposed to
it, I would submit, it's a growth versus anti-growth.  And this is good
for the state.  And I would add... [AUDIO ENDS].</p>

Members to support this bill and madame chair at the appropriate time
would move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]There was mention of 2 votes, 170 and 143 were both of
those votes against?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes both were against expending utilities to the solid
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Madame chair for a comment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]All up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]This is a situation that faces us on alot of occasions
and is a question of local control and local authority over regulating
growth and planning and carrying out those plans, and needless to say
that Durham as a municipality and county as well with their city county
planning department plan growth and plan extension of services based on
those projections. Now this is a matter where the city council has
already made there voice known on it and indicated there preference. I
think were overstepping our bounds if we are going to get involved in
taking that authority away from them. I understand the developers
intent, expressed intent to develop the area, of course he has no
responsibility to follow through with those intentions, and certainly he
is going to be a victim or beneficiary of whatever market forces there
are. I would ask that the members of the committee honor the  city
councils position in this matter, and that is to not support this bill
as written. Our delegation has taken action, this bill is not consistent
with the final position our delegation took, so i would ask the members
to respect the city of Durham and who has the ultimate responsibility
for this, and suffer through or benefit from whatever happens on it
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Starnes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you madame chair, this is a local issue and i
don't like to getg involved in local issues, but i am very much
interested in the annexation laws of our state, and have been for as
long as i have been in the general assembly, and i was very supportive
of the rewrite of the annexation laws in the last session, so my
question is for staff. Ive never seen a situation where usually the gist
of the annexation reform is because of involuntary annexation, but this
is a revers involuntary annexation where your forcing the city to annex
an area, and ill ask MR Cohen, Tell me how this is out of compliance or
how does this fit in with the current annexation laws, Im pretty sure
its set in prescient, and what would be the implications i just don't
want to start setting a bad prescient.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr Cohen
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Sorry thank you, under our state constitution
Legislature has the power to determine the boundaries of individual
cities, it does so from time to time even on a differed basis, as in
this bill,. So this is the same description of the area in the
annexation ordinance presented to the city council on June 3rd, but the
legislature has the ultimate power and it delegated the power to the
city, but it can annex what it chooses by local act in the past the
legislature has the next property with a well long deferred effect.For
instance there was an annexation in Charlotte, the university researched
park that was annexed with an effective date 7 years from the time
legislature annexed it
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up then. Well i wasn't as concerned about moving
the effective date from 3 years to 10 years but, Im not aware of any
legislation that has required a city to annex, is this the first time we
have done that
[SPEAKER CHANGES]There are many times when the legislature annexes
property, usually its at the request of the city because it might not
comply with all the annexations standards, or because there is a need to
expedite an annexation because of a public health concern, there have
been various reasons so ultimately the legislature has the right to make
one annex</p>

Where it says the municiplaity must provude some municipal services. It
is water and sewer that the developer is asking for. The municipal
services that Moore said he wants to run and is running now with senator

chose twice not to do. Along those lines let me say then madame chair

<p id="30:00">
Agreed yesterday as a delegation to do. Its consistent of my remarks of
a few moments ago, that the city should be able to make its own
decisions. I ask you not to think about whether you like the project,
whether you do not like the project, but to the respect the views of the
city of Durham and not to impose, not to meddle into the decisions of
the city. I would ask you to support the amendment for those reasons.
Thank you, members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Moore, you're recognized to speak on the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Madam Chair. Members of the committee, Madam Chair I
respectfully would ask you to vote down the amendment. The amendment
offered by the gentleman from Durham would gut the bill, in a sense all
of the things regarding the 751 project and respectfully ask you to vote
no on the gentleman's amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Ross, you are recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I have a question for Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
You're recognized. Representative Luebke, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Are there other entities or individuals to whom, who are located outside
Durham city limit who Durham provides water and sewer services?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Research Triangle Park is one area which requested in the 1980s, from
this General Assembly, the right not to be ?? to the city of Durham.
Under those circumstances they pay double water and sewer. If the city
could do it they would of annexed Research Triangle Park a long ago,
because it is contiguous to the city of Durham.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
All in favor of the amendment, other questions or comments on the
amendment? Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I do feel like its necessary to clarify one of the remarks made by
Representative Luebke. That was dealing with the unanimity of the
delegations support of this amendment that was presented. If you were
take the original proposed committee substitute and analyzed it
paragraph by paragraph, my position has never changed. The original
proposed committee substitute that was presented by Representative Moore
did not include all of the other things that were ultimately included in
the subcommittee substitute you see today. It was only about water and
sewer. Not about the road improvements, not about development plans, not
about zoning. That's all in there today, it wasn't in there previously.
When I confirmed with Representative Moore and we worked on this
together, and we agreed that all of that could go in, that I would be
supportive of it, I never relented in my statements as it relates to
that. If you would analyze the proposed committee substitute paragraph
by paragraph, then I think Representative Luebke is correct. These are
only the paragraphs that we could agree upon. That doesn't mean that we
only, that there was not decent among other provisions. Yeah, you can
take anything paragraph by paragraph, and maybe certain paragraphs
everybody can agree upon this particular amendment. I do want to correct
that, since perhaps it created a misperception. I do believe that
everything that was originally negotiated by the Mayor of the City of
Durham, plus some other things that are there now, that are part of the
original committee substitute. As we do, as members of this chamber when
members work with you on bills, and they put a lot in there that
otherwise wouldn't be there, you agree that you will support it as a
person of principle and somebody who learned years ago that your word is
your bond. I made that agreement with somebody I'm going to keep it and
that's why I stand before you today.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Hanes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes. A question for Senator McKissick about the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
On the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes. Senator McKissick I just need to make sure I'm understanding what
you're saying. Was there unanimity on this or not, in the darn
delegation?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Only to the extent to which if you reviewed the other committee
substitute paragraph by paragraph. You can say that these are the ones
that everybody agreed upon, that does not mean that I . . . I made it
very clear during that meeting, and I might say that I really expect and
really hope that when every delegation around here meets, that those
discussions that are held are kept in the strictest of confidence. But,
be that as it may, since that has not occurred, I can say that it was
never a point in time during</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  no ?? or conversations where I ever indicated that
this was the only part.  I always indicated even at the conclusion of
our meeting that the original proposed can be substitute you see before
you was one that I would stand behind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Dollar on the amendment, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Madam Chair.  Just a couple of quick
comments.  One, in terms of what Representative Luebke is arguing I
would just also point out in this that it’s not simply the delegation
it’s also the landowner, the parties involved that are to be taken into
consideration.  But more broadly cities are creatures of the state.
They’re supposed to be there to provide us public safety, fire, the
basic services.  One of those being included is water and sewer.  It
seems to me you’ve got a property owner who’s willing to invest 10’s of
millions of dollars, provide badly needed jobs for this state in an
ideal location for that development with respect to our transit and
transportation system,  everything you would want,, is fully willing to
comply with all the storm ?? rules and all the special conditions down
to of course paying for the infrastructure.  As well as double the
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Dollar you are on the amendment aren’t
you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Ok.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes ma’am.  Thank you, madam chair.  So it seems to
me that the essence of what the amendment is, is to gut those things
that I mentioned.  So, I would  respectfully add my voice to say vote no
on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Wells are you on the amendment sir?
On the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes madam chair, on the amendment.  The amendment is
like the bill in that it turns on the real key element in that.  The key
part of this is water and the amendment removes that water provision.
This land is zoned.  This land is planned.  We’re not debating land use.
 We’re not debating whether we get into zoning issues at the local
level.  I would point out because the amendment removes the water, I
would point out that this state has loaned Durham County some $15
million in clean water state revolving fund loans since in the last
three years.  We put $9 million in Durham County through the Rurals
Center and Golden Leaf which are nominally at least supposed to help
rural counties.  So we’ve poured some $24 million into a county for
development purposes.  No we’ve got a county, a city in that county, the
largest city in that county, saying we don’t want development, we don’t
want to sell the water, which the Mayor told us Monday night they had
excess capacity in water and sewer.  We’ve heard the City Manager had
analyzed this and this was a profitable venture for the city.  So we’re
telling a relatively small group of state, individuals in this state are
saying we don’t want to continue the very things you’ve been funding us
to do.  The issue on the water is this, this is just flat a taking.  The
city of Durham is saying you will not develop this property because we
will withhold the one thing that keeps you from developing this
property, we’re not going to buy it, we want it to sit their empty at
your expense.  That is a taking.  The Supreme Court addressed that on
Monday.  We weren’t paying much attention because they’ve done some
other things this week that we found more interesting.  In Koontz vs.
Saint Johns River they made a pretty broad statement
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Wells on the amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  On the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  One more minute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  that local governments, local entities could not take
property without compensation and that is exactly what this does.  So a
support of this amendment or opposition to this bill without the
amendment would be endorsing a taking of the City of Durham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Kelly Alexander on the amendment, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Madam Chairman.  On the amendment,
I find that the amendment seems to address the only thing that there’s
any agreement on.  And the agreement is that</p>

the city should proceed with a design bill authority vis-a-vis the
construction project.  I must admit that the arguments about taking and
what not kind of mystified me, in that what we seem to have is a duly
constituted local government that has decided that it does not want to
do a given thing with this enterprise.  And, that we have, ever since
eighteen sixty-something or another, allowed governments at that level
to do a number of things under the theory that they are best
representative of the people because they are closer to the people.  I
think it's a--it's a  dangerous precedent that we've begun to fall into;
to bypass that level of government and to run willy-nilly to Raleigh
about all kinds of things.  And because of that and because of the
compelling argument within this amendment, that there is agreement, I
would urge you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, again, on the amendment, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted--parliamentary request--I just wanted to request the ayes
and nos at to the--on the amendment and as to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are there other questions?  Sorry.  Are there other questions from the
committee with respect to the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair, just a comment on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair.  And again, the amendment, even by Senator
McKissick's admission, represents something that the whole delegation
agreed to.  So, setting other questions aside; once again, I'm making
the same request that we support the amendment and support what all the
delegation agrees on and stands before you today saying we agree on all
the items in the amendment.  And so, we would ask that you support the
amendment, and again, let the City of Durham do their local
planning--let them decide what their resources should be used for as
they develop their city under their responsibilities as members of the
city council duly elected by the citizens of their county and of their
city.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holley, on the amendment, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We [sic] not ever going to get to the bill, ya'll [laughter] Just keep
[??] a little while longer.  Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My issue with the amendment is on the design bill piece.  [laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those of you know that I have issues with design bill.  [laughter] The
City of Durham is large enough that they can handle these projects
without utilizing design bill, which is really good for small areas that
can't handle--that don't have [??] that can handle it.  My question
is--is that we voted on recently a bill for rules to design bill.  Would
this fall into the category of the new rules for design bill--has that
gone all the way through and been approved in the Senate side, or will
this just be under the old design bill rules?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jerry Cohen [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, the design billed in Section 2 of the bill was taken out of the
original language of Senate Bill 314, which passed the Senate and is in
the House.  If it is--a local act, it would prevail over any general
rewrite of the design bill statutes.  I don't know whether it's the same
as the proposed rewrite or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry of Mr. Cohens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, Mr. Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??] question to Mr.  Cohen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair.  Mr. Cohen, I believe that Representative
Holley is referring to House Bill 857,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
right--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
and wondering whether the design billed elements contained in that
broader public bill would actually supplant this local bill [end of

Speaker: And what is current state is senate I'll tell you that senate
does probably fond taking it up what year we are not sure yet i have an
examine to see how this language compares but it is a local act it will
control all over the general law whether it came before or after 857 ??
repel local acts,
Speaker Changes: Representative Jordan,
Speaker Changes: thank you madam chair,
Speaker Changes:i believe this amendment ?? as a weapon against
development i have a municipality ad I'm just using the same tactics ??
ad I'll be oppose to this gadding amendment ,
Speaker Changes: Representative ??
Speaker Changes: thank you madame chairman
Speaker Changes: I'm just a low county boy and we do construction works
and do lot of works with developers i will be interested in knowing the
commitments before this language bared we were worked in the
construction business for developer that didn't work out all these
details fro about their property and bought the property before all the
seating of the plans were made and now they are making the plans to do
this is not taking but the developers certainly taking this manual and
we are forcing the issue that something should be planned ahead of time
when you buy land you know that you are going to do with it and if you
change those plans you shouldn't expect to changes the rest of the world
with you,
Speaker Changes: ??,
Speaker Changes: All these answer if these were commitments were met yes
mam,
Speaker Changes: Are the other questions concern from the committee on
the amendment all in favor of this amendment will raise your hand and
the clerk will count all oppose to this amendment will raise you hand
please hold your hand up and keep it up so we can have this for the
record the amendment fails from voter 7 to 25 we are back on the bill
now are there question from the members of the committee Representative
stone wished to be recognized sir on the bill ?? any other questions
from the committee Representative warren,
Speaker Changes: madame chair i may have missed it somewhere and if have
apologized i really do with it i still i clarifies to why city doesn't
want the development i think several counties here express their
developments they take  they take i mess somewhere why this city doesn't
want this development sounds like a great deal is anybody that they can
explain it to me,
Speaker Changes: is there anyone that would like to answer that
question,
Speaker Changes: the explanations i have received is that some believe
that the development would be too dense i have heard some concern about
it's proximity to ?? but those of it's two reasons which i have heard,
Speaker Changes: Representative millers I'm sorry senator Millers i did
serve on the Durham city council during this project was proposed and i
actually participated in the part ago  Representative I'm sorry senator
?? some of the concerns secondly other services accentual i think
chairman's idea was upside down i think it would about ten and the
reason for the annexation please this would be about ten or eleven years
ago which will be positive cash flow for he city of Durham it would cost
the city money to have this project annex if it is annexed it would be a
money looser for the it that would be one of the major,</p>

<p id="50:00">
reasons for that is well, ?? City was an issue, the proximity not Jordan
Lake is one thing but the streams that flow into Jordan Lake was another
concern distance from transportation that was mentioned earlier this is
actually good ways off
I-40 highway 54 that's why road improvements was a very critical issue
here ?? cycles are a primary reason[SPEAKER CHANGES]follow-up[SPEAKER
CHANGES]follow-up from Senator Warren[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, I don't
remember the details but it seem like the Mayor had mentioned something
about a seven year or eight year exemption so that issue was addressed
and the road widening I think isn't that part of the deal that the
developer was going to pay for widening the road[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator
McKissick[SPEAKER CHANGES]that's correct it is a part of what you were
looking at right now it wasn't originally a part of what was in the
original amendment that Representative Martin brought forward it's
purely water and sewer but know the water, the sewer the transportation
improvements which total about nine million dollars all the linkages and
ties into the county zoning approval all the committed elements that
were a part of that all the rules and regulations that would have to be
addressed. It is anticipated to be a mixed youth development, so you're
talking about residential being low, medium, high density residential as
well as commercial and office space contained within about a hundred
seventy acre track. So that's a I hope that answers your questions in
terms of the Mayor's so the Mayor did in fact indicate that it was
projected that it would be a seven to eight year payback period before
the project will probably reach the critical mass where by it extending
public service when I say public service I mean the full range of public
service not just water and sewer but fire protection, police protection,
solid waste collection you know recreational facility before it reach
that point it will be seven or eight years out but if the annexation
becomes effective ten years out there is no burden or hardship upon the
city at that time and of course the city manager recommend for approval
of the agreements when they came before counsel the last time when they
got that three to four vote [SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Woodard[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Senator McKissick mentioned all committed elements there were
other committed elements during the life of this project that have been
discussed both county commissioner and city county members so to suggest
all committed elements that have been discussed and proposed to the
developer here is not correct. There's still some that have been
discussed that were not part of this bill and to speak to those other
services fire services, parks, schools were all a bit concern I think
Representative Dollar mention this is a part that's grown considerably
over the last ten to fifteen years so there were concerns about school
population Southwest Elementary for instance, has half of its students
in trailers now that was another concern so was the full range of
services that will be provided both city and county government[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Hall [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Madam Chair, I
guess my question is for Senator Woodard since he was on the Durham city
council at the time the matter was discussed Representative Woodard  we
heard a discussion that this project is suppose to generate somewhere
between three hundred and thirty thousand jobs I heard the number up to
thirty-thousand from people could you tell us if there is any written
agreement that you know of or any written documentation obligating the
creation of any jobs through this development[SPEAKER CHANGES]further
questions Representative Brawley[SPEAKER CHANGES]I might ask a question
of the developer[SPEAKER CHANGES]Is there a developer in the room Sir if
you will come to the microphone and give us your name for the

<p id="55:00">
To the city, Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Did you discuss the project with the city before you bought the land?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My attorneys probably have talked with the ?? apartment. We met all the
UDOs, met all the ordinances. I guess I was not even up to think that if
you follow all the rules, that things will work out, of all the rules
following was ?? by the county.
So, does that answer your question Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It does, I thank you for my comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, you may take a seat. Mr. Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am going to vote against this. I have got the same situation in the
Iredelll county, the developer bought the land and then decided what we
are gonna do with it. And they have been after the legislature to come
in and force the city to do what they want to do so they can develop the
property to their advantage. It's the same thing we have here, It's not
taking of the land, the land was bought and the idea developed and the
city didn't approve or do anything.  Whenever you go to buy a land, it
is a risky business. Making money is a risky business. Unless you got
the right political connections as what we are saying when we pass this
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam chair. The voting on the amendment suggests that people
are going to vote on the bill and I just wanna comment on the fact that
so many of us are playing the role of city counselors. Representative
Brawley is right that city council is the one that engages with the
developers on issues in terms of what happens in a project, what should
happen, and makes judgement is to whether a project is in the best
interest of the city. And twice the city has voted against and twice one
of our colleagues whose district is 150 mile away from us has intervened
and it just seems for example and I think Senator Woodard can confirm
this, that if we are going to play city counselors we should note that
the project is in the critical watershed of Jordan lake. It is, so this
is one of the issues. The issue of what senator Mckissick was saying
&quot;Well, you got 7-8 years. It'll payback, the city will make it's
money&quot;. Well that depends on the economy turning around so there
can be enough money in the community that people will be able to afford
the housing that's there. We don't know at all whether the project is
gonna build out as quickly as the developers are asserting. Some
documentation that I have seen says it will be a 15 year point before
the city of Durham breaks even on it's water and sewer investments. So I
just cite that as an example of how if we want to play city counselors
we can go back and forth on the data and there are plenty of people from
our city council who can come and explain why they voted as they did.
But that is not what's before us and I regret that we are really have
gone into playing city council. I don't think we should be doing this is
a body. I think we should particularly respect Durham's decision when
the ?? for this really came from our colleague who lives 150 miles away
from Durham. It is different think about as you wish about the
controversies in Buncombe county over the water But representative
Moffitt lives in Buncombe county. Representative Moffit does live in
Buncombe county. Senator Rucho has a plan for Charlotte airport, he
lives in the Mecklenburg county. The Mecklenburg delegation can talk
about</p>

<p id="60:00">
that and decide what it wishes. But I do not think we as a body should
be intervening in this, and in particular this is very very troubling
for those of us in Durham who have worked very hard through all the
different kinds of issues, twice voted no, and twice had intervention
from a House colleague. It's wrong to intervene, it's wrong to meddle,
and I know you voted one way as you did on the amendment, but I wish
you'd consider the facts that the city made a decision based  on all of
this information and it's not the information necessarily presented to
you today. The city really we could have brought forward city council
members to be witnesses here, to show you why they came to the decision
that they did. I didn't ask anyone to come from the council because this
is not a zoning hearing. It's not a planning and zoning issue. So I ask
you to respect the decision of our city council, and even though you
didn't like the amendment, recognize that this bill goes too far in
instructing the city what to do, and I urge you to vote no on the bill.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have no other names that haven't been recognized, the chairman of the
Durham delegation, Rep. Michaux for final comments, and then we're going
to vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair. Let me try to put this into a bit of perspective
so that everyone can understand it. Sen. McKissick is wrong, we wrote it
last night. You can parse it any way you want to to take out the 751
project and do, that's what we voted on last night Floyd, don't shake
your head on that. What has happened, let me tell you this. The 7-0 vote
that the city council did several years ago was because of the way the
project was presented, the verdict was going to cost the city under the
rules and regulations. So the city voted against running water and sewer
out there, because recovery at that time was not going to be what it
was. Last year, there was a problem and folks knew there was a problem,
so they came to the legislature. They  came to the legislature and got a
powerful Chairman of the Rules committee to try to get the legislature
to override what they had done on that 7-0 vote and run city water and
sewer out there. And he followed that. But fortunately, it failed by one
vote in the Senate. So it didn't get made. But then when the city
council came to us and asked us by pushing the ?? with this thing, we
told them that with a super-majority, they was now in this body that the
possibility of, I want to say City Councilman Moore getting what he
wanted, was upset because of the super-majority that you have here. So
that's why we told the mayor that they're going to do it anyway because
of that. There was a gun pointed to the mayor's head to start
negotiating with the developer. And that gun was the fact that it was-
so let's try to get out of this thing, as much as we can get out of it
even though we don't like it. At that point, there were things made and
then enters Sen. McKissick, who gets with Rep. Moore, without any
indication to the Durham delegation what was happening at all. So, where
we are today is the same place we were again. You've got the
super-majority and you can do what you want to do with it, you can force
this but the problem in Durham right now is not the project itself, it's
the way that that is being forced upon the city. If Rep. Moore, I would
dare say if Rep. Moore had kept his nose out of the business, it would
have been done. But he had to stick his nose in there and try to force
the city to do it. Now ladies and gentlemen, you're going to do this. I
know you're going to do this. But let- and it applies once somebody
wants to put a nuclear dump in your back yard,</p>
