[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. President, additional motion back to Senate Bill
105.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senate Bill 105.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senate will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Soucek, sit down.  Let's go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, the Senate is back in session, Senator at the
dock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President.  Senate Bill 105, previously
we put on tomorrow's calendar, I move to be taken off tomorrow's
calendar and placed on today's supplemental calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]So ordered.  Okay, we will now stand at ease for a
couple of minutes while we get those printed and handed out. The Senate
stands at ease.  The Senate will come back to order.  It is my
understanding the calendar has been passed out. Members, our nurse of
the day is Brian Lupo of Raleigh, North Carolina.  Nurse Lupo, thank you
for your service to the Senate today.  Ratification of bills, the clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Your old bill, the rolling clerk reports the following
bill duly ratified for presentation to the governor.  Senate Bill 794,
an act to disapprove certain rules adopted by the North Carolina
Industrial Commission to provide specific direction to the industrial
commission to replace the rules, to amend certain provisions of the
Worker's Compensation law, and to allow the conference of chief district
judges to prescribe uniform state-wide presumptive guidelines for the
computation of retroactive child support obligations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay members, we're about to go to the calendar, local
bill, 2nd reading roll call, House Bill 1212, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]House Bill 1212, Burlington Charter Revision and
Consolidation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Gunn's recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President.  This came over from the House
with a 111-0 vote.  It does exactly what it says.  Burlington, after 60
years, is doing the revisions and consolidations of their city charter.
I know of no opposition.  This was at the request of city council and it
just cleans up the charter so they can move forward.  I appreciate your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]There is none.  The question for the Senate is passage
of the 2nd reading of committee substitute to House Bill 1212, all in
favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no.  5 seconds will be
allowed for the voting, the clerk will record the vote.  47 having voted
in the affirmative, and none in the negative, House Bill 1212 passes its
2nd reading, and will remain on the calendar.  Senate Bill 788, the
clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senate Bill 788, Town of Duck, Immanent Domain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Cook's recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Apparently the law allows certain coastal counties and
municipalities immanent domain, power as needed to address beach erosion
control, or flood and hurricane protection.  These governmental entities
can acquire needed property through condemnation proceedings known as
'quick take'.  This local bill simply adds the Town of Duck to that long
list of counties an municipalities that use quick take condemnation to
protect their beach.  This bill has the support of the town council and
community.  I know of no opposition, I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion or debate.  Hearing none, the
question for the Senate is passage of the 2nd reading of Senate Bill
788, all in favor will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]All opposed, no.  The aye's have it, and Senate Bill
788 has passed its 2nd reading and will without objection be read a 3rd
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]North Carolina general assembly acts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Is there further discussion or debate?  Hearing none,
the question for the Senate is passage on the 3rd reading of Senate Bill
788, all in favor will say aye,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]All opposed no.  The aye's have it, and Senate Bill 788
has passed its 3rd reading and will be sent to the House. Members, we
actually have 2 more local bills that I would propose to block vote, and
voice vote.  Is there any objection to voting House Bill 1114, and House
Bill 1154 at the same time? Hearing none.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 644, Prevent Hazardous Drug Exposure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate. Actually, before I
begin I just got to take a second in this discussion to thank
Representative Fulghum for his work on this bill. This is something that
he has pushed for two years, trying to get through the floor, and it was
quite disheartening that he couldn't have been there this morning in
rules to be part of that and I hope I can do some justice to his
arguments as we move forward. But basically this bill deals with
individuals in the healthcare profession who are dealing with
angioplastic[??] agencies or chemotherapy agents which can be quite
dangerous if not handled and dealt with appropriately. This bill
requires a Commissioner of Labor under standards set forth in the bill
to establish how those should be dealt with and how clean up of those
agents should be dealt with and establish those regulations in the
healthcare workforce. So if you have any questions I'll do my best to
answer them but I would ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there further discussion or debate? Senator Tillman, for what purpose
do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, to ask Senator Hise a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, I'm not very familiar with this bill except that just
reading it. Tell me if the regulations that we're going to require of
our healthcare workers go beyond anything that's presently required such
as double gloves and a lot of other things of that nature? Are we going
out there, way beyond what's already required?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The regulations we currently have are federal regulations under the
workforce. They're also exist federal recommendations from the National
Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, that comes forward.
Currently we have no state level regulations on dealing with these.
These will allow the Commissioner of Labor to establish those based on
those recommendations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, I specifically want to know if this is beyond anything
that's now required. Are we going beyond what's on the federal
requirement list? Are we going beyond that with what we see here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
These would move beyond what is in the federal regul-, what is currently
on the regulations and would move us tot he recommendations that exist
for dealing with these chemicals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And just one final follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And who do these recommendations come from, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, this comes from, and I don't know how to pronounce the acronym,
NOISH, which is the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that's just a recommendation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the passage on second reading of the Senate Committee
Substitute to House Bill 644. All in favor will vote aye. All opposed
will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk
