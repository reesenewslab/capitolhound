[Speaker changes.]  (Gavel sounds.) Senate will come to order.
Sargent-at-arms close the doors.  Members go to their seats.  Members
and guests of the gallery please silence all electronic devices.
Leading the Senate in prayer is the Reverend Peter Millner???, Senate
Chaplain.  All members and guests in the gallery will please stand.
[Speaker changes.] Let's pray together.  Almighty God, thank you for
this place to come in a week of unrest, amidst the arguments about right
and wrong, sometimes it's easiest to abandon our calling. I know, Lord,
that I am tempted to run away like Jonah.  In fact, this is one of the
greatest differences between me and you, Lord.  We run away but you run
to embrace us with love and bless us.  So Lord, there's a great work to
be done here. Democracy is worth the nastiness. Truth is worth the
suffering.  Alleviate our fears, turn out attention to you, the God that
allows us to make mistakes and never gives up on us. We make this prayer
in the name of Christ, Amen.
