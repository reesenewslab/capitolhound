[SPEAKER CHANGE]
House Resolution 85, The House Resolves a Joint Resolution Honoring the
Memory of Those Who Have Contributed to the State's Agricultural
Education Program and the Future Farmers of America Organization While
Observing National FFA Week of the North Carolina Agricultural Education
and FFA Day. The House Resolves.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Waddell, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution. The House will

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I come here today as an
agricultural teacher, a former agriculture teacher and I understand the
importance of FFA and how much it has meant to the state of North
Carolina. I would like to thank Chairman Langdon for allowing me to
piggyback on this resolution because he came up with the resolution and
I've determined it was really a pertinent resolution for me since I had
taught ag for thirty something years and was certainly aware of all the
things that FFA has done for the state of North Carolina.
As we all know agriculture is the largest industry in North Carolina and
most of you in this chamber probably have had experience with
agriculture. Maybe some of you have had experience as an ag student in
high school. I know my ag experiences in high school certainly prepared
me in one way to become mayor and be a council member in my local home
town because it provided me the skills from parliamentary procedure to
be able to do that. And I think some of you in here have seen the effect
of parliamentary procedure as we carry out our every day business.
I do feel like that there have been an awful lot of ag educators and ??
ag leaders in the state of North Carolina that need to be recognized and
these are recognized posthumously. But certainly we have our share of ag
teachers that have affected us too. I have been blessed with a lot of ag
teachers that have gone on in my county. One of those ag teachers is
Mister Jim Rabin, who is the dad of Senator Bill Rabin. He was teaching
agriculture when I first got into high school and he ended up being
Superintendent of Columbus County Schools.
Also I have been privileged to have people like Fred Lay, who is the
granddad of Olivia Watson who spoke at the ag committee this morning
with her public speech that she presented to the national FFA which she
finished third with. And that's really good for the state of North
Carolina. The point that I am trying to make: Charles Keels and all
these other folks who have been important in ag</p>

<p id="15:00">
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Folks I think there's, there's a number of
reasons that you can understand by reading the resolution that's ??. I'd
like to call your attention to the retention of students. Various data
that proves that young people that have the opportunity to take
agricultural courses and other career and technical education courses
are retained and do not drop out of school. So that would be a good
reason just to have the, the program if it was the only thing. It is a
wonderful program. I started teaching in 1960 and spent 33 years
teaching ag. I understand how much it helps young people develop their
leadership skills and develop themselves personally. Another thing I'd
like to call your attention to is, that learning to do, one of the
things that I found in, in my teaching was when kids have the
opportunity to have hands on experiences, in learning, they retain, and
understood what you were teaching. Learning does not take place until
kids understand. Our programs develop to do that, and other career and
technical educations do a good job of that too. I am so proud that I was
a member of that organization as a student in high school. Had the
opportunity to teach all those years and see so many young people
develop themselves. It's an interesting kind of thing ??opens their
world. And I think the members of the ag committee could see that in the
young lady that gave her speech today in the ag committee. She was a
outstanding example of what they learned to do. I commend the resolution
to you. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Brandon please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGE] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGE] I'm
glad that we are having a resolution for Future Farmers of America, as a
former future farmer. And I know that's kind of weird for a lot of
people to see, but, I did join future farmers because I had a great
mentor. And I wanted to make sure that he got into the record and J.
Terrell. And he was ours at, at Southern ?? High School. He was our
future farmer and our ag teacher. And we won Representative Langdon, we
won the federation all four years that I was in high school. And that,
for those of you who don't know, that is like winning the state
championship in basketball for the ag folk. Although I did get to learn
what a good cow was, and a what bad cow was, and a great pig was, it did
teach me a lot of leadership skills. I was not interested in that as
much, but it did teach me great leadership skills. I know that this
organization is continuing to do that. I also know that I have one
farmer under the age of 50 in my district. And that is a problem. So we
need to be able to figure out how we're going to get these folks back on
to the farm and, and create situations where its sexy to do farming
again. But I commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative McManus please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak
to the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady is recognized to debate to
the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGE] I represent Chatham and Lee county and
in Chatham it is still sexy to be a farmer. And I'm very proud of that,
and I wanted to just say how proud I am of our FFA at Chatham Central,
who has set the standard for competition across this state and this
country in horticulture. They've also won first place many times in
floral culture at national competition. I was fortunate enough to join
them at the national competition and judge a few times. And it is
incredible how hard these children work, how many extra hours they put
in to be able to compete at that national level. I was so impressed, so
moved by these young people and their dedication to agriculture. Vote. I
commend the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion, further
debate? If not the question before The House is the adoption of House
Resolution 85. All those in favor will vote aye, all opposed vote no.
The Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will let the machine record the
vote. 118 having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative. The
adoption, The House Resolution has been adopted, will be ordered
printed. Ladies and gentleman just as a point of privilege just from The
Chair, The Chair would like to extend a thank you to the Future Farmers
of America, the, the future small and big business people in this state
that.</p>

Propose constitutional amendment. first, as I've already suggested, the
bill will mean that a public use does not include the taking of property
in order to convey an interest in that property for economic
development. The use of eminent domain as approved by Keylo [SP], will
not be possible in North Carolina. Second, it puts language in our
constitution specifically saying just compensation should be paid. While
those five words have been determined by the North Carolina Supreme
Court who have been explicit in our land of the law, excuse me, law of
the land clause, which I'm guessing probably goes back to the magna
carter.
We're one of the only states that doesn't actually have that in our
constitution. Third we are the only state that does not require in its
Constitution that the issue of damages in condemnation cases be decided
by a jury. Sponsors to this legislation believe that a jury trial in
eminent domain cases is so fundamental that it should be spelled out in
the constitution.
The bill provides for a referendum ans the date of that referendum is
November of 2014, and the reason for this is that's the next general
election that is coming up. This is not a bill that's gonna require
additional costs because we're already going to be running an election
statewide at the time. No additional precincts are going to be needed to
open up. If we had held the referendum for example on November of this
year it would have been more expensive because there are counties and
area that are unincorporated that wouldn't normally be holding election
at that time.
I think the final thing before I sit down I'll mentioned that this bill
has come up any number of times in recent years. In the last session it
passed with nearly a hundred votes. The members on this side of the
aisle supported it unanimously, but the members on the other side of the
aisle also two out of three legislators also supported it.
This is a good, good bill, a good proposal for a constitutional
amendment. It's about protecting private property rights, yes. It's
about stating what it fundamental and that is just compensation and a
jury trial when the state or our local governments use that power to
seize private property. And I urge the body to support the bill and the
constitutional amendment. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the house, the first sentence
on line 11 is very simple but the explanation would be very complicated
because the case law for a couple hundred years is all over the place
because the courts just have not used consistent terminology. So what do
we do? Do we have a bill that runs for  two or three pages or maybe
write a law review article ahead of time to explain it? No.
Our bill drafters came up with what I think is an ingenious solution and
that is by incorporating in section four and five some statutory
language, the constitutional amendment will be construed what they say
in [??], that is we know what the intent of the assembly was with then
constitutional amendment because in the very same bill the assembly
reiterated some statutes, changed some statutes, and added some
language. So we know what the intent is.
So for that reason I've put on your desk the statute which is carried
forward, amended and changed, and this is the main statute by which all
condemnations  in North Carolina are done or performed. It's not the
only one but it's the main one. And by incorporating 40A-3 it makes it
clear that those condemnors listed in 48-3, doing the kinds of things in
48-3 are doing it for public use unless certain facts demonstrate that
it's not which is always possible.</p>

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[speaker changes]
Mr. Speaker, this bill is enact to honor fallen heroes by strengthening
the law that prohibits disorderly conduct at a funeral, memorial
service, or processional route. Many of you will remember, back to the
last biennium, especially in Cleveland and Gaston counties, we had two
soldiers and 1 marine get killed in action and we were appreciative to
the speaker for actually coming to Cleveland and Gaston for at least on
of those services. I'm here to recommend this bill, Mr. Speaker and to
accept any questions.
[speaker changes]
Representative Szoka, please state your purpose.
[speaker changes]
to speak on the bill.
[speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[speaker changes]
Serving in the armed forces in an honor. When a soldier or serviceman
raises their right hand to support and defend the Constitution of the
United States against all enemies foreign and domestic, and to obey the
orders of the officers  appointed over them. And posted in that oath
that they take is a oath, if you will, from the country -  from all of
us to support them and their families. What this bill really does is it
makes us live up to our side of that oath. When a soldier has died in
combat, he needs the respect that he is due that we have pledged to give
him because we're all Americans. During my time in service, I had the
honor to serve as both a officer in charge at several funerals and as a
survival assistance officer and I will tell you that on the day of a
funeral, there's no more occasion where emotions run deep and it is that
day that certain groups and people decide to target our fallen heroes.
The time requirement is not an arbitrary thing. At one point in time, I
went to a service member. He was retired but he was a Buddhist and their
tradition requires them to stay at the internment site well after thirty
minutes. They were there for almost and hour and forty-five minutes. So
two hours protects all faiths that we recognize in this country.
Distance is not an infringement on the freedom of speech. In fact, in my
belief, it protects the freedom of speech of the family members who
deserve to have the ceremony conducted in silence at the appropriate
times with the appropriate playing of taps, 21 gun salute and other
things. I just recommend this bill to you.

Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the house.  This is a bill that amends
the felony breaking and entering statute North Carolina. What it does is
it adds in GS 1454, the following language which is: any person who
breaks or enters any building with intent to terrorize or injure an
occupant is guilty of a class H felony.  The reason I filed this bill,
members, is that the request of a couple of district attorneys who had
seen instances where an individual broke into a house sometimes to
assault, sometimes just to terrorize the occupant of that house. Right
now, under present law, if there's not the intent to commit a felony
inside or the intent to commit a

Representative : …inside that breaking and entering is just a
misdemeanor. A lot of times, where this is seen in the domestic violence
realm, and if you think about it, it takes a heightened state of mind
and criminal intent to not only assault somebody but to break in their
house and assault them, or to break in and try to terrorize them. under
current law right now, if someone broke into a house to steal this
little elephant here, which isn’t that valuable, they could be charged
with a felony because they broke into the house to steal the item,
regardless of its value. The thought behind this bill is that if that is
a felony, then surely breaking into a house to terrorize someone, or
assault someone, is a felony. That, in a nutshell, is what this bill
does. It passed the judiciary committee unanimously. I will be happy to
answer any questions if there are any, and urge your support of the
bill.

horseman to hold captive a wild animal, it is pretty simple, on display
fro annual, cultural or seasonal events, and for that animal to be
released at or near where it is captured. The second part actually gives
a venue, in case there are some inhumane treatment of the animal, a
civil venue to be tried or adjudicated in the county in which it

Thank you Representative Lewis, I was looking for another…No chair of
finance. My question is about, we just got a notice this morning that
there will be four bills in the House Finance Committee tomorrow
morning.
Two weeks ago, I guess, Representative Howard very kindly made the bill
summaries available to us ahead of time. I’m wondering whether you can
authorize staff to do that for us so that we have a chance to look at
these bills since we’re just learning about them today?

Thank you for that. I will send an email request that that be done right
now. I’m sure if staff can get it done it will.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to just report to our members that our
House basketball team met for the first time last night, had our first
practice. We had I believe 10 members there and a good time was had by
all.
I did want to comment briefly on Representative Holloway’s comments last
week about the coaching. I guess there are two stories that I could pass
on and you can take your pick. One story is that Roy Williams, and Mike
Krzyzewski and Mark Gottfried all really, really wanted the job and I
was pretty much the consensus choice, the noncontroversial choice if you
will and so I accepted in that regard. The second story is that they
basically took pity on a guy with a bad back that was a want-to-be
basketball player and let me coach the team. So, I’ll let you decide
which one of those is true.
But anyway, I would like to commend, we don’t have a date set yet, but
hopefully when the time (audio skip) the people will come out and
support it. I understand that Representative Howard will be getting
together some cheerleaders for us and hopefully we’ll have some fans and
we’ll promote this thing and have a good time. So, keep that in mind.
Thank you very much.
