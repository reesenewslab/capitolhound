Health benefit exchange.  Two, to provide the future Medicaid
eligibility. Determinations will be made by the state rather than the
federally facilitated exchange. Three, to reject the Affordable Care Act
??? Medicaid expansion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]: Senator Apodaca is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]:  Mr. President, thank you very much. Members. I was
driving down today and I was lucky enough to have my wife come with me,
and all the way down the mountain, she’s telling me how I should drive.
What I’m doing wrong. I’m going too fast, I’m too close to the center,
I’m doing this, I’m doing that. We pull over and go to a rest area. And
finally, I just said, you know what, if you can do it better, just
drive. I’m tired of it. So she drove. But it reminded me of what we’re
talking about tonight.  Very similar to federal government coming down
and saying, okay, we want you to do this, we want to be your partner,
but you have to do it this way, we want to go this way, and we want to
do.  You know what, if you want to do it, do it the way you want to do
it.  Leave us out of the equation. And basically, that’s what this bill
does. It’s not complicated.  We’re just saying to Washington, if you
want to do this, do it your way.  Now this bill, as the bill reader
read, it’s pretty self-explanatory.  Part One specifically states no
state exchange.  Part Two, it does leave individual Medicaid eligibility
decisions with the state of North Carolina, where it belongs.  And part
Three, optional Medicaid coverage will not be expanded. That’s the crux
of this bill. The comments that we’ve been rushing this bill, we’ve done
this, we’ve done that. Folks, this has been around almost three years
now.  We all know what’s in it.  We all know about the Affordable Health
Care Act, or as some of us call it, the Unaffordable Health Care Act.
And we’re gonna find out as we go on down the road what this means to
us. But tonight, this is what we have, and with that Mr. President, I’d
like to, if I may, defer to Senator Brunstetter for a few more comments
on the appropriation side of this, or lack of, and thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, Senator.  Senator Brunstetter, you have
the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you. There is little question that Medicaid and
our Medicaid overruns have dominated the discussions in this chamber
regarding our appropriations budget and process. The problems that we’re
having with Medicaid are a cancer that are affecting the rest of our
budget.  When we have to come in and bail out Medicaid, we’re taking
money from every other priority that each of you value. The shortfalls
have been around for a while.  2009 and ’10, 335 million; ’10 and ’11,
600 million; ’11 and ’12, 500 million.  Serious short falls that require
bailouts at the end of every year.  Now the General Assembly is moving
to fix Medicaid. This body, in the budget this past year, ordered an
audit.  And you saw the audit released by the state auditor last week,
with a number of suggestions that I think the governors agreed with, and
the new Secretary of DHHS has agreed with.  And they’re starting to work
on getting our Medicaid system fixed.  We increased our staffing at the
General Assembly and at the governor’s office, and expertise, so we
could understand the Medicaid system and process better. Senator Apodaca
mentioned that one of the problems is that our hands are tied by the
federal government when it comes to managing Medicaid.  Now, we have a
history of very uncomfortable partnerships with the federal government,
whether it’s in Medicaid or elsewhere.  We’ve seen just recently long
term delays on approvals of plan amendments when we try to manage our
own program.  We’ve seen them sue us, or threaten to sue us recently
that is caused hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements. Now I
appreciate the motivation of people who would like to see Medicaid
expanded, and serve other North Carolinians.  But, it seems to me that
expanding Medicaid, which is a broken system, and broken process by over
30%, makes no sense at all.  It’s going to result in that program
imploding, and then nobody.</p>

Representative: …is going to get the coverage they need. We need to get
our Medicaid system fixed before we ever start talking about expansion.
Speaker: Thank you senator. Any further discussion or debate? Senator
Hines, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To speak on the bill.
Speaker: You have the floor senator.
Representative: Ladies and gentleman of the senate, quite frankly, we as
a state cannot afford the expansion of Medicaid and to issue a state
based exchange. Estimates that we have from the department right now
indicate that the expansion of Medicaid over the first seven year period
will cost us and addition $1 billion in state funds $600 million of that
will come from a wood working effect: individuals who are eligible under
the current system, but not covered, when they come in under the new
eligibility, are not reimbursed at the higher federal rate, but at the
current rate. We also have $400 million, over that same time period, in
additional costs that are not reimbursed by the federal government in
the first few years. The real costs come in 2020, when we do not know
what the reimbursement rates will be. Just to drop that to the 90%
rates, starts adding $100 million more a year that we are required to
come up with just to make these payments. You find the same existing
under our exchange. Current estimates to run an exchange in NC is $100
million a year in operation in the firs year, that grows exponentially.
The costs will be asked to pass onto the tax payers. Now the federal
government comes along with both programs with some nice baits and
switches: numbers of 100% reimbursement for the first year, the second
year, or grant money that makes it all possible, but that goes away,
that disappears, and we will continue to saddle the citizens of this
state with a large burden that we did not for, but will be required to
make those additional cuts to make it happen. Just last week, we saw in
our department, which, in general says, if nothing else, that we cannot
run our current system in an efficient manner. Why do we want to begin
to believe that we can undertake such a massive expansion of a broke
system.
Speaker: Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To speak on the bill.
Speaker: You have the floor senator.
Representative: Senator Hines you ask that rhetorical question: should
we expand Medicaid; but I would reverse it: why shouldn’t we cover
500,000 people in this state that currently do not have health insurance
coverage - 95% do not – 500,000 people you are talking about? What will
the burden be upon our hospitals in this state who are providing care,
because one thing we know sir, is that when this affordable care act was
passed, it was logically assumed by the states that it was bad Medicaid.
If it does not happen then the money that goes to the hospitals to help
them provide, will be substantially reduced an eradicated. The care that
they provide will provide a substantial burden and hardship for many of
those institutions, particularly the institutions in rural areas which
unduly care for those in the state. So, do we have a duty? Do we care
about what happens to them, because those subsidies, there in the past,
will not be there. This is going to put a distortion on hospitals that
were so deeply concerned about not expanding Medicaid coverage, that
many of them came together and explored the idea of what they could do
to make it happen. Many of them even explored the concept of coming up
with a whole harmless concept so they would not be burdened in the event
that after that period</p>

<p id="15:00">
That federal subsidies exist today, that they will reduce.  Right now we
do know under federal law the first three years cover 100% in its
entirety.  And after then, you’re looking at the states only paying,
this state only paying potentially 10%. If you look at the numbers as
well, over that first 5 to 7 year period you’re talking about in terms
of the impact Medicaid expansion. We know that about 2 billion dollars a
year is going to come into this state. 2 billion dollars, of which 1
billion will be net disposable income. In the pockets of individuals
who’re employed in health care related fields. That can go out and help
this economy in this state become more robust.  In that same window of
time, what do we know? Over 23,000 people will be employed in these
related fields. 23,000 people. That’s a significant number. So we get
many benefits.  The benefits that come from the economic expansion, the
benefits in terms of inviting care for those today that do not have
care.  Who are leaving the hospitals in the state and the burden of
providing ?? care. If you think hard and long about what’s in our
interest, what’s in the interest of our citizens.  That’s what we need
to be examining.  I received a letter today from Representative, from
Governor McCrory’s staff.  Suggesting that maybe we should take a wait
and see position and study this a little bit longer. When this thing
came up in Committee there wasn’t a single stake holder group that was
allowed to speak on this bill. Not a single one. It was difficult even
getting the Department of Insurance the opportunity to speak.  We need
to listen. We need to hear what their words will be. We need to reflect
upon the far reaching implications that the failure to expand Medicaid
will have upon this state.  Because if we sit back and we look and we
think and reflect, I think the decided and deliberate decision will be
made that it is in our best interest. Our vested self interest to do so.
 Can the administration of Medicaid be approved?  Absolutely,
positively, without a doubt.  Not just in North Carolina but throughout
the United State of America. And we should seriously accept our
responsibility and challenge in doing so. But don’t throw the baby out
with the bath water.  Look at what you’re doing to the people who can
benefit from this. That’s what we need to be considering. And when it
comes to a health exchange, if we have the ability, to have autonomy and
control and to influence those insurance products that are offered in
this state, to do it in a way that would benefit us, why should we not
do so? Why should we secede that control?  Would you suggest we do that
also in the Department of Agriculture? Why do I use that as an example?
Because we have meat and poultry inspectors in this state that they
hire, they do a great job with.  But we don’t have to have them.  We can
save the money. We can relinquish that control to the federal
government. Would you have us do that too?  And there’s a host of
examples throughout state government that I’d be happy to meet with you
and share with you information about.  Having that control, having that
autonomy, having the capacity to better serve our constituents and to
serve the residents of this state should be what our responsibilities
are as members of this body. And I would hope and I would reflect and
challenge each and every one of you to look in your hearts and souls.
And to think about the duties that you were charged with when you took
that oath of office so recently in this very chamber.  In the last 30
days and say, do we not have a responsibility to those that are
uninsured? To see that they  continue to have care. To make certain that
the ?? are provided for in a mean, reasonable, fair way as it was
contemplated when the Affordable Care Act was passed. And I would hope
that if we listen to those voices, reflected upon what we should do,
that we should offer a state basis exchange or a hybrid model and its ??
Medicaid in the way it was anticipated when this bill was first passed.

One of the issues and I think Senator McKissick just touched on it was
about jobs and I’d say the stimulus fallacy of that.</p>

<p id="20:00">
Think about it. When does adding a billion dollars in state healthcare
cost and piling up new responsibilities with regulations and rules on a
mismanaged bureaucracy create any kind of jobs? Think about that. And
we’ve heard these type of job arguments before in Washington with the
stimulus plan that was passed not too long ago, and I think they were
wrong then as they are now. It’s kind of like taking a shovel full of
dirt out of a hole, walking around to the other side of it filling the
dirt back in, and then announcing that you’ve somehow dug your way out
of the hole. These arguments are all based around a misconception that
Washington can simply send us federal dollars that we can use to
stimulate the economy and fund jobs, but we know differently. At the end
of the day, this is money that’s coming out of the taxpayers’ wallets.
If the federal government’s giving us money, it will eventually and
inevitably have to be made up for with higher tax burdens and higher
premiums for the private sector, the very people we need to be
encouraging to create jobs. This isn’t a job creator; it’s a job killer.
Then let’s talk about the crowd out effect that this will do. Expanding
government-run Medicaid will have harmful effects on private insurance
because it will encourage many employers to drop coverage for their
employees that meet Medicaid’s new eligibility standards. That’s
something I’ve already talked about with my CPA. What am I going to do
to deal with it in my business? What’s the least expensive way for me to
handle it? Studies from MIT and Harvard researchers show that Medicaid
expansion will actually have a relatively small effect on the number of
uninsured, with about four fifths of the expansion coming from the
crowding out of private coverage. That’s the wrong approach. Rather than
throw more people into a broken Medicaid system that costs a lot of
money and doesn’t provide the best outcomes, what we should be doing’s
making the private markets work better. Another issue’s this employer
mandate. Like in the Obamacare, exchanges could stop North Carolina
employers from having to pay punitive tax hikes under the law’s employer
mandate. These new taxes totaling as much as three thousand dollars per
employee per year would be a burden on employers. They would be forced
to use money that could go otherwise to be used for salaries, benefits
or investments. Three thousand dollars per employee. The law stipulates
that the tax applies only in an exchange established by the state. It
makes no mention of federal exchanges, so by choosing not to expand, we
could potentially be saving our businesses tens of thousands of dollars
per year, which for many businesses could be the difference between
staying open or closing their doors. What does that do for job creation?
And I can tell you, I know a lot of businesses that are on the edge on
this mandate for insurance, and a lot of them aren’t sure if they’re
going to be around, and I’ve heard a lot of them talk to me about it.
It’s a serious issue to think about. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor,
Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Brown appears to be
wanting to revisit the Affordable Care Act, and I’m sure that if you all
could legislate that away, you would, but we can’t because that is the
law of the land, and as part of the Affordable Care Act, there are a
number of different revenues put on North Carolina workers, North
Carolina businesses to pay for it, and that is our taxpayer money. It’s
our taxpayer money whether it goes to the federal government or the
state. It’s money that we pay in. By foregoing this Medicaid expansion,
what ya’ll are saying is we’re going to have North Carolina taxpayer
money paid to the federal government go to insure people in Arizona, in
Nevada, in Ohio, in North Dakota, all of which, by the way, have
Republican governors and are expanding Medicaid because they realize it
is critical for the economic health of their states as well as the
physical health of the people. Senator Brown said “How does this help
the economy?” Well I’ll tell you how. Because on a gross dollar basis,
if you factor in just what does North Carolina have to contribute in
Medicaid match over the next eight years, it’s 840 million.</p>

<p id="25:00">
Right? What does that draw down? 15.8 billion dollars from the federal
government paid for by North Carolina taxpayers. So you are all
rejecting money that we as North Carolina taxpayers have paid to the
federal government. That's about 16 billion dollars in economic
activity. There's been a study done by a consulting firm that analyzed
what are the economic impacts of that money. It comes out to about 1.5
billion dollars to the state GDP each year for the next 8 years.
I really look forward to what ideas you come up with this session that
will result in 1.5 billion dollars in GDP growth to the state of North
Carolina; that will result in 23,000 new jobs here in North Carolina.
This is money that will go to insure healthcare in rural communities.
Rural hospitals are genuinely at risk once they lose that federal
contribution for uncompensated care, which they will. And they have
still a large number of uninsured people coming through the door. How
are they going to pay for it?
Either they're going to go out of business or they're going to demand
more out of their insured population. That's you and me, those of us who
are fortunate enough to have health insurance. That will end up raising
your and my premiums approximately 1,000 dollars to pay for that
uncompensated care. This is a deal that is good for the economy and good
for the people of North Carolina. We have the opportunity to expand the
GDP and increase jobs. We have the opportunity to save 2,800 lives a
year quoting a Harvard study.
There was another one that showed when you increase healthcare insurance
coverage, people get more treatment or they go to the hospital. And what
happens today is either they don't go to the doctor or when they do go
to the doctor, they can't afford the prescription drugs or the treatment
necessary to address whatever their health problem is. If we expand
access, we are saving North Carolina lives, 2,800 a year. We can
leverage 15 billion in federal money paid for by us, you and me. And we
can avoid imposing a hidden tax on existing people with health
insurance. Let us not miss this opportunity. Let's vote against this
legislation.

Thank you sir. On Sunday morning I woke up and read my Charlotte
Observer in the editorial section and my good friend from
Hendersonville, Senator Apodaca, was there. Great picture. And the topic
was Should North Carolina Expand Medicaid? He voiced his opinion, more
eloquently in writing than he did today. But there was someone who said
we should do it, a doctor Jessica Saxe. She said she had a patient that
came into her office and she said that the middle aged woman was
complaining of chest pain under her chest bone. The lady had severe case
of diabetes. She had high blood pressure.
She had other risk factors that signify to the doctor that this lady
could or was having a heart attack. So she tried to calm the patient and
tell her that she needed to do a stress test as soon as possible so we
can make sure that we prevent a catastrophic event in her life, her
health. And the ladies retort was &quot;can we do this next month?&quot;
because she simply couldn't afford the care. She said that's an ongoing
and frequent occurrence in her office, that people needing medical care,
healthcare, can't afford service. In North Carolina, we are the 12th</p>

from our general fund, a significant amount of those costs will now be
covered under the expansion of Medicaid, were we to do so.  And, for our
rural hospitals, our sheer survival to provide Medical Care for our
rural communities is dependent on this expansion of Medicaid.  As one
hospital administrator put it, Medicaid payment is surely better than
nonpayment.  I strongly urge you to slowdown on this, to wait, and to
relook at it to consider a method in which we can expand a Medicaid
coverage under the affordable care act.  I will be voting no on the
bill.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor, senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  I've heard from many of my doctors,
physicians.  From pediatricians to family practice doctors.  They're
very concerned, I think you can see that these people have taken their
time out, because they are concern.  Physicians from hospitals across
the state are very concerned, because they know the consequences.  And
they know the true costs.  As senator Stein has said, all of us who have
insurance will pay for it.  But there are other costs that Senator
Bryant referred to, the cost of ill health, which costs us more in the
long run.  Because by the time they get the care that they need, that
they've put off because they could not get to the doctor, they cost us
much, much more.  And I think anybody who was associated with the
hospital, I think senator Brunstetter knows that that is one of the true
costs throughout this.  I also want to talk to the point that senator
Brunstetter said, that because of the expansion of Medicaid, we would
have to cut other programs that we value.  I value health care for all
of my citizens, and my constituents value Health Care for all of our
constituents.  I've heard from them.  I cannot tell you, there flooding
into my office.  I want to also say that this is a moral imperative.  We
owe everybody, as my constituents have told me, to share in what we
have.  And then, finally, senator Apodaca, you said this has been around
for three years, but your governor hasn't been around for three years,
and he has asked us to slow down.  I ask us to slow down, also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ??, For what purpose do arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor, senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Ladies and gentlemen of the senate, if we
adopt this bill, we will be dropping a large rock into the pond that is
North Carolina's Health Care System.  And that boulder may cost, or will
cause significant ripples throughout the system.  And today, our
governor asks us to stop, take some time, and examine those ripples.
Whenever we may think about Medicaid, and we've heard many thoughts
about that, reforming it, carefully auditing it, we cannot deny that it
has become a central part of health care funding across the country, and
in North Carolina.  Now, as our state has grown, so have our residents'
needs.  Just for one example, the number of obese adults in North
Carolina grew from 13% in 1990 to 30% in 2010.  And 1/3 of our children
ages 10 to 17 are overweight or obese.  By not expanding Medicaid, we
will needlessly squeeze the budgets of our hospitals, our clinics and
other healthcare providers, forcing them to make difficult choices about
eliminating programs ending patient care in some areas, and laying off
employees at a time when our state's needs are getting greater.  Now
some have suggested tonight that Medicaid expansion will be a job
creator, while</p>

<p id="40:00">
Others have disputed that. But I can offer you one certainty. Senator
Brown alluded to it, but I'm gonna argue it on the other side. This bill
will be a jobs killer. And I'll offer you another certainty, the
financial pressure will be greatest on our rural community based
hospitals and clinics. We've talked about this at a macro level, Senator
Stein, Senator McKissick, Senator Brown, Brunstetter and others, but I
want to take you to a micro level for a minute. Look at Person Memorial
Hospital in my district in Roxboro. Of it's $85 million dollar budget,
Person Memorial spends nine million dollars, more than 9% of its budget
on indignant and charitable cases.
Last year the hospital of its size had 21,000 emergency room visits.
Person Memorial has been forced to eliminate some programs, among them I
was really sad to learn, obstetrics. There's not a single obstetrician
or OB practice in Person county. And the hospital has not delivered a
baby in five years. This is forcing expectant mothers to travel to other
counties to seek care if they are able to travel regularly. The surgery
department rarely has more than a dozen surgeries scheduled in a week,
and half the patient beds have been converted into long term care, a
nursing home. Without an expansion of Medicaid Person Memorial will lose
$800,000 in access funding as Senator McKissick alluded to, and even
greater amounts to come.
This will force the hospitals leadership to look carefully at all its
programs and its staffing. With 330 employees and an annual payroll of
$12 million dollars in Person county, Person Memorial is one of the
county's largest employers. Personnel cuts will have a significant
impact on this counties economy, not to mention the purchasing power
with fewer programs. Now I share this case with you not just to point
out another struggling hospital but also to shine a light on how
approving this bill will jeopardize the much needed care for the
residents of Person county, 18% of whom are uninsured. Ladies and
gentleman I'm certain if you look around your districts and your
counties, you will find equally critical and equally dire circumstances
among your health care pr9oviders.
Our failure to expand Medicare will also have a significant impact on
our teaching hospitals. There's an increasing gap between the cost of
residency programs and the federal reimbursement for graduate medical
education that helps fund them. For instance last year UNC Hospital's
training cost cost $43 million dollars, but the hospital received only
$13 million in educational reimbursements. This situation is forcing our
teaching hospitals to take fewer residents, further exacerbating our
growing physician shortage.Our state's population is growing much faster
than our ability to train professionals just like these men and women
here tonight.
And the physician shortage our state is experiencing is especially
pronounced in two areas, the pool of primary care physicians, and in our
rural areas. Increasing completion of graduate medical education has
resulted in fewer than 10% of residents pursing careers in family
practice. And that competition is also forcing new residents to practice
in urban areas. In North Carolina, 20 counties don't have a single
general surgeon, and in my Person county there is only one general
surgeon. The gap in medical education funding is also affecting other
medical professionals, such as physicians assistants and nurse
practitioners. While these are the providers who've helped lesson the
impact of the physician shortage in rural communities, there are now
fewer of them and they are choosing to stay in urban areas more often.
Turning our backs on Medicaid expansion will make this situation worse
and worse, forcing patients, especially those in rural areas to have
less access to health care. Ladies and gentleman of the senate, before
you cast your vote on this bill, please check with the hospitals and
clinics in your counties. Ask the CEO's the CFO's and the medical chiefs
of staff...</p>

...and even the frontline patient care staffs, about how rejecting
Medicaid expansion will affect the quality and the quantity of patient
care in your community. Ladies and gentlemen, before we drop that
boulder in the pond, lets please understand the full impact of this
action, because the ripples are washing up on all our shores. Thank you,
Mister President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor to debate, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My colleagues, you've heard certainly from a lot of us
about the concerns we have and one of the things that, and I won't
repeat what has been said, but when all of us came here, we came here to
serve our citizens. Not only in our communities, but across this entire
state. And I have to reflect also on some of the other experiences.
I remember years ago in Guilford County, and it's one of the more
metropolitan counties, but even in Guilford County we had such a large
number of people who were uninsured. And we had to develop what was
called Health Serve. That was started with volunteer doctors and nurses
to try to serve those people who didn't have insurance.
And over the course of the years, it still takes volunteer doctors to
help six different medical practices that serve 50,000 people who are
uninsured. 50,000 people total, but 80 percent who are uninsured. A
large percentage of those are adults with a lot of different illnesses.
They don't just have diabetes. They have heart conditions. They have
high blood pressure. All of those things, which means that if they show
up on the doorsteps of the emergency room, which is what was happening,
the cost of their care goes from 167 dollars per visit that Health Serve
is paying now [??], to 800 dollars.
The cost of uncompensated care in emergency rooms are high. Extremely
high. And if hospitals in Guilford County can't afford it, I know that
hospitals in rural areas can't afford it and they will go out of
business. While we have 50,000 people in our county, we're talking about
500,000. A lot of those are low income and they're minority. And we know
the proportion of health disparities is among minorities. Not only
because of income, but because of lack of access. And I see that a lot
in my job. People who come in for screenings, who are told &quot;Why
didn't you go to your doctor?&quot;, &quot;I don't have a doctor, I
don't have any money.&quot; And it's also a new group of people who are
unemployed. When you become unemployed, you don't have any insurance
because you don't have anything to pay for it with. So not only do we
have those people that we've seen all these years, we've got new people
now, who can't afford healthcare.
Healthcare is preventive. If we insure these people, that's preventive.
We will save our state millions and billions of dollars. If not, we will
incur additional costs. Best is at [??], which is the parent of all of
those six medical practices. Their budget is only 16 million dollars but
they provided 24 million dollars in care, which means 8 million was
uncompensated. So if that is the impact in Guilford, it's more across
this state.
I would impress upon you the importance of making sure that you
neighbors, people you serve in your county, all people aren't the party
you represent. They're different parties, some unaffiliated. They're
different races. But they're North Carolinians who deserve to have
preventive healthcare. And that's what Medicaid expansion's about. It's
about prevention. If we prevent the diseases on the front end, we save
money on the far end. And those are the people who go to emergency rooms
and it certainly is going to put a lot of rural hospitals out of
business. I know that in Guilford County, our county commission's not
going to want to give any more money. They don't have it, and nobody
else has it. So that means that a lot of other people...</p>

When you have serious medical problems, and I'm a male and we all think
we're tough.  But if we think we got heart problems we need to be able
to go to somebody and get it checked, and if we got a problem get it
fixed. You can't just show up at an emergency room and get that kind of
care.  So understand what we're doing here.  We got 500,000 people out
here that can't take care of their spouse, they can't take care of their
children, they can't take care of their grandchildren.  They gotta take
the scraps off the table and show up at the emergency room when the
cancer, when they're bleeding in the rectum and the colon cancer is so
far gone that they're gonna die because they couldn't go get a
colonoscopy. That's what we're talking about here and I just felt like
we ought to get, I don't, this isn't bleeding heart time. That is the
truth and it kinda reminds me of the debate when all of us men gather
round and start talking about women's reproductive health.  We don't
have the experience that these people have, keep that in mind. For most
of you on the other side of the isle, you're from rural districts.  Up
in the mountain counties most of our rural hospitals now are associated
with Mission hospital or with Charlotte Medical Center. East Carolina
has six or eight affiliates that are rural hospitals down in the
Northeast and I know that the state is like that now.  These rural
hospitals have had to go to them for help and they've kinda been
absorbed.  You need to sit down and have a serious conversation with
them. If they lose their DSH money and the people coming in there are
uninsured, there is a very good chance they will be closed.  These big
hospitals aren't altruistic they
aren't doing it just for their health.  They're doing it because it's
profitable or in some cases not profitable but it sends patients to the
mother ship and that's profitable.  When they get to be a big enough
burden they're gonna start
shutting them down. Obama Care or Affordable Care or whatever you wanna
call it is the law of the land and a lot of things are gonna happen.
First thing is everybody would be insured, there's no reason to give you
make-up money for treating non-insured people.  The second thing that's
gonna happen, the federally qualified health centers that a lot of us
now have, there's one in ?? United Center off Dockers and there's one in
Buncombe. That money is gone in 2014.  Those are your free clinics and
they aren't free, the federal government is funding them. They're gonna
quit funding them. And if you don't insure these people, what I'm trying
to tell you is the method that we now use of funding healthcare for the
uninsured is going to go away and when it does you're gonna see, I
think, catastrophic failure in your healthcare system.  It wasn't
anticipated that you would continue to have this large number of
uninsured out here after it went into place. It was assuming that
everyone or most everyone would be insured. The governor sent us a
letter today and I think it's pretty clear that he says we need to move
slower on this on all of this and take some time to figure out what
we're doing and make sure we don't have unintended consequences that end
up damaging the healthcare system for all of us.  So I would ask
you...we just got here, we just started Wednesday.  Good gracious we're
gonna be here till I heard somebody say May.  We're gonna be here till
June maybe July.  We've got plenty of time to work on this bill, plenty
of time to see what happens now that a number of states have said
they're not going to participate in Medicaid.  It's gonna be another
shoe to drop.  This bill needs to go somewhere and hibernate for a
little while, it's not gonna get, it's not gonna change, ya'll got the
votes.  It's two to one, but time</p>

[Speaker changes.]...might benefit everybody in this chamber and I urge
you to vote against the bill tonight.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] To debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] You have the floor Senator.
[Speaker changes.] Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I'll say to my
friend, Senator Nesbitt, that each of us in this Senate are most
concerned about the medical well-being of our citizens as well as the
financial well-being of our citizens. In the state of...an ideal state,
there is no poverty...unfortunately in this state, there is. And there
is no problem with health and there is in this state. These are some
things that this General Assembly and the Senate, under new leadership,
will do everything it can to correct.  Senator McKissick talks about the
Affordable Care Act earlier...about a lot of assumptions that were
there. I think the entire Affordable Care Act was assumption, since no
one had a chance to read it. And then, secondly, as we learn day-by-day
what the rules are, the regulations are being written up just as we
speak, especially dealing with exchanges no one knows what the rules
are. About how to run an exchange.  This bill does nothing to prevent
the federal government, who has decided to mandate us, that this country
will have a national type of healthcare through this insurance package.
To come forward in North Carolina, to organize the healthcare exchange,
to operate the healthcare exchange, and, Senator Stein, even to pay for
that healthcare exchange, since you're concerned about where that money
is going.  Those are all of our tax dollars. The issue dealing with
disproportionate share of hospital money...that was a decision made many
years back, was a bad decision and, again, the federal government
decided or assumed that the states would accept responsibility for this
again, recognizing that in our state, in the Medicaid system, the way it
is today, and I know each of you that have been here at least one term,
know that we spent five-hundred million dollars this last year trying to
cover the overage in Medicaid. And I think it was three-hundred million
the year before and it's not getting any better because it's out of
control and it's very clear from Beth Woods' research..report...that it
is not getting any better and really needs to be completely overhauled.
And this is something that this General Assembly will take action in
doing. To make sure that when we put money into a system, we know that
we get return our investment.  That means good healthcare, that means
not rationed healthcare, that means quality healthcare to everyone as we
can afford to do it.  There are a lot of folks that say, just go ahead
and, as they've done in the past, they say, &quot;just go ahead and keep
spending money that you don't have.&quot; Well, the constitution of
North Carolina requires us to have a balanced budget and, in this
situation, we in the General Assembly...at least the majority party here
in the Senate, are going to live up to our responsibility of following
the constitution and make sure that we don't spend money we don't have.
That kind of attitude has put us into severe problems in the past few
years, has only gotten worse and what we hope to see a
&quot;turnaround&quot; as we've already seen in the last two years. We,
in this General Assembly, should learn a lesson. You don't make
promises...or you don't believe promises from the federal government.
You look at what they've done to us with the insolvent...unemployment
insurance fund, where we went 2.7 billion dollars in the hole. We're
struggling today.  Businesses, Senator Tucker,  businesses are having to
lay people off so they can make their unemployment benefits because we
believed that the federal government was our partner, our friend...and
we could trust them.  You look at the Medicaid system, as it's already
described earlier...500 million dollars was spent this last year and
that's, from what I gather, 2-300 million more coming up this year
because we can't control what the federal government says to us and,
more importantly, we should never trust what they promise us. If they
promised us they're gonna pay 100% for the first three years, and then
maybe 90/10 as Senator McKissick alluded to afterwards, ya' can't bet on
that. That means that we are gonna' accept responsibility for the costs.
We, North Carolinians, who will have to pay taxes that we don't have
that are burdening our economy today...we hafta pay more money for that
and it's our responsibility in this General Assembly to make the right
decisions and base it on the truth and base it on financial or economic
facts...and that is, if you don't have money to spend on it and you know
potential its there, you don't spend it.  It's not up to us...

could do it as it is presently is structured, it makes no sense to put

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate.
Senator Berger for a purpose to your eyes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor, senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Members of this senate, this bill does two
things. The first thing that it does, is it says is that North Carolina
will not move forward with the state based exchange. Fairly simple, that
is the first thing it does. I haven't heard a whole lot of discussion
about that, but that is the one thing. The second thing that the bill
does, is it says, that with reference to the passage of this bill, there
will be no medicaid expansion in North Carolina, but it goes on to say
that no department, agency or institution in this state shall attempt to
expand the medicaid eligibility standards provided in session law 2011
145 as amended or elsewhere in state law unless directed to do so by the
general assembly. So Senator Nesbitt will always have the option to come
back if for some reason the promises of the federal government seem to
be better than they seem at this time. Too many people have been seduced
by the lure of easy money from the federal government. They'll just
promise anything, and they do, often. We have a medicaid system
presently that is broken. It is eating us alive. Our inability to pay
for the medicaid system we currently have is causing us to reduce
expenditures across the state budget, or not have money that we would
like to. And we're talking about adding to that, on the promise from the
federal government that they'll pay for it for the first three years,
and then all we have to pay for is ten percent. Well first of all, if
you haven't looked, the federal government is running deficits at over a
trillion dollars a year. They don't have the money. They have printing
presses, but they don't have the money. And ultimately, if they had the
money it would be coming out of the pockets of North Carolinians and
folks across this nation. At some point people have to understand that
there is no money tree. It just doesn't appear out of thin air. And
quite frankly, we would need a forest of money trees to pay for what the
federal government is trying to cram down our throats. I urge you to
vote for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate.
Hearing none, the question before the senate is the passage of the
committee substitute Senate bill 4 on its second reading. All in favor
will vote &quot;Aye&quot; (the green button). All opposed will vote
&quot;No&quot; the red button. Ten seconds will be allowed for voting
and the clerk will record the vote.
