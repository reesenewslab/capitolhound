<p id="05:00">
Under the stadium. And that if the panthers leave they still own the
land but they don't own the stadium. And they're going to have some sort
of investment at some point because that stadium will then either be in
an absentee landlord, and they're having to deal with the issue of an
absentee landlord, or they'll need to acquire the stadium so they can
tear it down and put something else there. And you know, we can agree or
disagree whether that was the best idea when it happened, but there's a
dollar a year, ninety-nine a year lease on that land, and if the team
moves and you've got an empty stadium sitting on your property in your
center city, it's going to be an economic drain. Aside from the fact
that you've lost the impact of the team there. So they thought that by
doing the renovations they'd be able to help create a tether. Part of
that too and some of you may have gotten emails about this issue of
giving money to the Panthers for a privately owned stadium verses
keeping the money in the Charlotte Convention Center which is a publicly
owned. The improvements that the city would then pay for will be owned
by the city. So if the city decides to pay for the new escalators it's
not that they're giving the Panthers this money and letting the Panthers
do with it as they wish. They would be actually paying for the
installation of those escalators and the city would then own the
escalators. A plus to that is the city gains not only the tether, but
they also gain an economic interest in the stadium that currently they
have no ownership interest in at all. And so it does provide a benefit
to the stadium that kind of counters the argument that you may have
heard from some on emails that you're giving this money to millionaires,
and you know, it's all privately owned. It does create an opportunity
for the city to get some kind of ownership in there. So given that, what
we looked at was said, realistically, in this economy, this is not the
year to do a sale, an increase in taxes. Frankly, Charlotte is currently
the beneficiary of more occupancy tax and prepared food tax than any
other, all the specialty taxes, than any other municipality in the
state. And so, we didn't feel like it was appropriate to increase the
tax at this point in time, particularly, too, with tax reform out there.
With tax reform we didn't really have any sense of what other ancillary
taxes would be would be impacted and this just wasn't the time to do
that. So we put our heads together and tried to come up with a solution
that would allow the city to invest in the stadium, to get that sort of
ownership interest, provide a tether, and to make the team less
attractive for people who want to move it out of the Carolinas, and we
came up with this option. The city has several existing taxes that go
into a convention center. The convention center, depending on how you
ask, and some of you might disagree with me, is close to being paid off.
Now it's about the same age as the stadium and it's going to need
improvements itself. But there is some additional funds that they have
there that could be use to finance the improvements, not all of them,
but some of the improvements that the Panthers are asking for. So all
this bill does, it doesn't increase a tax, it doesn't give money
directly to millionaires, all it does it give the city permission, if
they so choose, to pay for renovations to a stadium, that they would
then own the renovations. And if for some reason they decide, or if the
Panthers leave before they do it, that they decide they'd rather use
that excess money for amateur sports, we gave them permission to also
use it for amateur sports. The reason for that was because the
hospitality and tourism industry would also like to see the city start
participating in amateur sports and they also wanted an increase in tax,
so we thought we'd go to the city and say you have these revenue
sources, you know better than we do, what your priorities should be, to
spend the money that you already have, so therefore we're going to
broaden the uses that you can use the tax money that you are already
collecting and you can use it for these things. And that was sort of our
solution, some people love it, some people hate it, but we thought it
was way better than increasing taxes or doing nothing and really
increasing the odds that the Panthers would leave. So that's my
explanation, I didn't know if you all wanted to add anything. Mr.
Pearum, open for questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Chair opens up the
conversation for questions. Representative Fisher. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is a question for the bill sponsor. You're
broadening permissions for the city, but you're broadening permissions
for them to use money that is tax payer money, correct? How do the city
residents, or the taxpayers, or the people who have provided this public
money weigh in on this? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's a good question. Of all
of the special revenues that the city has, we looked at the ones that
were not voter approved. Because if the voters had approved.</p>

<p id="10:00">
certain use in a certain way we were not going to touch it. There were
these three that were not voter approved that were already designated
for hospitality tourism types of issues. So we felt like they were
logically consistent and mission consistent with the current use that
they already have. The City Council that stands for reelection this
coming fall is in support. It's not their preference but they have not
asked us to rescind it, so in that sense they're support of it. I will
say personally you all can speak otherwise, I've not gotten one contact
from a constituent that did not, no I take it back, I got one yesterday.
But up until then I had not gotten one contact from a constituent that
did not think this was an excellent idea. So while there are a number
who would prefer more I have not had any contact from anyone who said to
provide less. I don't, if y'all want to comment on what you're hearing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  OK thank you. Representive Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chairman first of all Representative Samuelson I've
gotten lots and lots of emails now to be sure they're all the same
they're from one group. But anyway I've gotten lots, 15, so they're
opposed to it, to what you're trying to do with the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I'll comment on that. They sent them apparently to
committee members. I finally got one of them forwarded to me and that's
the one I got yesterday. Apparently they were forwarded to committee
members. In some cases they seem to think there was state money
involved, which it's not. And their other issue was the idea of taking
money from the publicly owned convention center to the privately owned
stadium which is why I wanted to make sure people understood that the
city will still own those improvements in the stadium.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well that was really just in response to what you said
of Representative Fisher. I have a number of concerns about the bill.
And I guess first of all the question is I see it on the bill summary
but just does everybody is it not true that because of the NASCAR two
cents that Speaker Black asked us to approve that we pay 8% occupancy
tax in Mecklenburg rather than 6 at most everywhere else?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct which is another reason why we did not want to
increase their taxes. That's why I said they're the beneficicary of more
special taxes than any other municipality.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  And ?? tax  is 1%? OK. Well I'm.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Followup?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I'm sorry. I guess I'm concerned about the
fact that the 1989 General Assembly gave approved this tax for special
purposes, specific purposes, and so for this as you know and explained
very well, let's say that the convention center does have needs next
year. The problem I have with it is that it was approved by the General
Assembly for one use and now it seems you're really taking money from
there and using it elsewhere. And so I, it seems to me problematic in
that respect. And I guess more generally what do you think about
subsidizing a for profit operation that is according to the papers
making a lot of money. I can't remember the number. But how do you feel
about generally as a principal of government?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Your first question was this is a tax that the General
Assembly approved back 20 plus years ago. I will note that it was at the
request of the City Council and that this is also at the request of the
City Council so that's logically consistent. They came to the General
Assembly before and asked for permission for one use. Now they're asking
us for permission for another use. So in that sense it's logically
connected. In terms of subsidizing a team that has a lot of revenue we
can go back and forth about whether or not the numbers in the press were
accurate. But aside from that, that's why I made a point of making sure
people understood that it gives the city a tether to the team and it
gives them an ownership interest in the stadium that they currently do
not have. So the money is still going for a similar type use as the
original investment where they are investing the structure. They're not
giving the money to the team and letting the team do whatever they want
to. It's still logically consistent with the convention center funding
and the other types of funding they have. And I will say at one point
the city did ask for permission to expand the uses further which would
have possibly having them doing some operations pieces and we declined.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Followup.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to thank you very much for the explanations to
speak briefly on it and I don't want to prolong it. But even though I'm
a big opponent of corporate welfare in which I think this really is even
though it's done creatively. I just can't support this and I told
Representative Carney I just think it's wrong this ?? operation is
profitable as the panthers when we're doing so many other cuts to the
average citizens of this state right</p>

<p id="15:00">
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I have a couple of questions of the sponsors.
Here you're talking about maintaining stadiums, ballparks, and other
public places that have a seating capacity of 60,000 or more. Other than
convention centers and the stadium, what other facilities do you have
that has that capacity?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
None, that's why it was written like that. We picked that language off
the original bill that had, there was another bill that had something
that references the stadium when they were doing the initial, those
structural improvements, so we picked that exact language out so it only
describes that stadium.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. The other question that I have is if we own the escalator in a
facility that is built custom for that facility, that escalator can't be
used anywhere else. Did you all look into the possibility of
proportionately- the amount of renovations that are being put in that we
proportionately own part of the facility, that if the facility is ever
sold or anything that we own at least partial ownership of the facility
for the renovations and things that we're doing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll ask, and staff may know the answer to this, if not, this does have
a referral to finance, I can get a more specific answer. I sort of asked
the same kind of question in a meeting with them, and was told that the
way the contract's written it makes it clear what the city owns and what
the city doesn't own, but it does give them in essence a type of
ownership. But yes, they own the escalator but the escalator is attached
to the building, and I can get you more details on it. There was some
reason why they couldn't do what you were talking about with the
proportional ownership sort of thing, but it does provide more of a
tether when right now, all they've got is the land underneath the
building. So it gives them an additional tether to the stadium itself.
But I can get more, I don't know if you're in finance or not, but this
does go to finance, and there's one other question we're going to
clarify for finance, it's making sure that the language we've got is
correct and the totality of the statute for that type of ownership and
making sure that it's in there correctly. The intent is there, we just
want to make sure, one of the attorneys asked a question whether we had
it worded right.  So we're going to check that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair.
Just a couple questions, who owns the stadium?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, yeah, it's Jerry Richardson, know the stadium's owned separately
than the team, and I think it's and LLC, or there's all these different
corporate structures. I asked one and they're like 6 different corporate
structures. Somebody else owns the team that owns the stadium that's
affiliated with the team, and I think Jerry has most of the, Mr.
Richardson has most of the interest in the actual ownership of the
stadium.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So it's not owned by the city.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. It does not. The land it sits on is owned by the city, and they have
a dollar a year, 99 year lease.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, this question may be for staff, we have had a number of
projects since I've been down here, requests by cities to use, to levy a
occupancy tax. My question is have we had one, have we issued these
taxes for facilities that have not been owned by cities that have
requested them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's a question for staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, or if somebody else can answer it, that's fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Adams, our occupancy tax expertise is pretty low. We will get the
answer to that question for you from our occupancy tax experts, in
between here and finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I add one thing? It's not just, you also need to check on the food
and beverage portion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Rayne Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair.
Just want to make sure I'm real clear: Okay, with the taxes, the
previous taxing authority, that was for the convention center, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Two, there are three that are covered by this bill. Two of them are
explicitly for the convention center, one was more hospitality issues in
general.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Follow up  Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Were the taxes for the convention center due to sunset at any particular
time or were they open ended?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One of them is, one of them's due to sunset in 20, like 32, I've got it
in here somewhere.
Oh. The 1% prepared food and beverage tax is due to expire in 2034.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Rep. Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Expanded authority. Do they have to choose among all of their wants like
the street car da da da da or is this just simply restricted to the
Panther Stadium and like you said the sports center or whatever other
plan they have in the works. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The revenues from these
specific taxes will only be allowed to be used for the types of choices
they have here, however these choices could also be funded by other
revenues that the city has and so by doing this what we're saying to
them is you need to prioritize among all your wants and wishes and so
yes, this is not enough to fund all of what it gives permission for,
whether it's the convention center, the amateur sports or the stadium
improvements, it's not enough for all of that so the city could say we
don't want to do one of these other things that we were going to use
general revenues for and use it on one of these projects. Nothing is
stopping them from doing that anyway. When they approached us they
didn't want to reallocate that money and so that was why they wanted new
money. What we're saying to them is we thing you need to set your
priorities. We can't give you any new money. We think you need to look
at your big picture of priorities and decide how you want to spend your
revenues that you've already got. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Comment, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma'am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Three comments. Number
one, I think it's time Charlotte learned to live within its means. It
wants a lot. It's already 4 billion dollars in debt and I've got real
concerns about that. I could never have voted to finance this with state
money and in answer to Representative Adams question, the stadium was
built on the back of PSLs. I'm one, own 3 seats, I would never vote to
give a dime of state taxpayer money to this facility. I would never vote
to give expanded tax authority because you can see the kind of debt that
they're in. I have no problem with them having to choose among
alternatives like each and every single one of us in our homes have to
do every single day. We don't get what we want. It's not always good to
get everything we want. I will vote for this bill because it doesn't
expand the taxing authority. I think it's good discipline for them. I
don't want to see the team go but if they go, that's, I don't really
have a dog in the fight even though I own PSLs they haven't really been
very good. I don't care. I don't go to see them anymore anyway, so I
guess that was all. Thank you, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair
didn't realize you were such an avid fan. Representative Bowles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I think Representative Brown said pretty
much what I wanted, but also the follow up on Representative Luebke's
remarks on corporate welfare, I think this doesn't, this gives Charlotte
the authority, it doesn't automatically divert the authority and so
Charlotte had the option of doing it or not, so I think what this bill
will give them, the choice and we don't direct that money. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, can I comment on that too. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To remember that Charlotte, this isn't
money going to the team itself, this is money to help maintain an asset
that sits on city owned land. The city has an interest to make sure that
that asset is maintained and it is cheaper in the long run for them to
keep the team here creating that 636 million dollar economic benefit
then to have the team go and then they've got an empty stadium that
they've got to help figure out how to take care of, so it's a wiser use
of the money and it's not going straight to he team owners. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Clarification, Mr. Anderson, if you will, and I think it's a very
important distinction for me. There's been some conversation about using
public money. Using public tax money. Now my understanding is none of
the revenue that's going to be used comes from my taxes that I pay to
the state of North Carolina nor anyone else that lives in North
Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct. It's only paid by those people who
come and do occupancy or buy prepared food and beverages in Charlotte.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I think that's a very important distinction for
people to understand because a lot of the criticism I've been getting
and I'm sure a lot of others are we do not want to support the Panthers
with public money. Well, in my opinion, it is only public money as far
as it goes for those people who stay in the hotels in the Charlotte
area, eat in restaurants in the Charlotte area, generate that income and
to my understanding it is just limited to that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct. I'll pay more of it than you will. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
very much. Thank you Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Cleveland is recognized.</p>

<p id="25:00">
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I have the same concerns that Representative ??
has. We're playing a shell game is what we're doing and we're giving the
city of Charlotte the authority to support their panthers stadium. I
don't know how many hundreds of millions the panthers want to rebuild
the place but I think it's wrong. And the perception in the public is
we're giving them taxpayer dollars. And that's the perception out there.
And in fact we are the taxpayer dollars might be coming from the
Charlotte/Mecklenburg area but we are giving them taxpayer dollars.
Although it's a neatly crafted work around I don't think it's right. I
think that state money of any sort it's not state money. Tax money of
any sort should not be used to support private enterprises. For my
entire life have heard of the benefits of stadiums, coliseums,  of
convention centers. I have yet to hear or see one that has paid for
itself. But there's always peripheral good things that come from the
having one in my town. I have not seen any good results for the people
that actually pay the bill. Now there might be some employment in a
restaurant, there might be some tax dollars come in some other way. But
looking into the actual full cost of these facilities and the actual
return is just not there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Earle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you. I would just like to kind of
bring it to the attention that there are huge consequences of the team
leaving North Carolina. As Representative Samuelson said earlier more
than 6 hundred and some million dollars generated by the panthers.
Almost 40 million dollars alone comes to the state. If we lose those
revenues that's going to be funds that are going to have to be made up
somewhere else. And the comment on how much Charlotte owes, Charlotte
has a triple A bond rating so the funds that are owed are being paid and
I think we all have a dog in this fight. Because we are and we talk
about creating jobs. We are talking about over 5,000 jobs being lost. I
live one street over from the stadium and ?? stadium has been there. I
mean we've had a huge huge number of restaurants. We have street
vendors. We have a lot of folks that is going to be impacted if the
stadium leaves and I certainly don't want a huge empty stadium sitting
there in my front yard. I think we all have a vested interest. If the
money that's generated just in the city of Charlotte. If that comes out
of Charlotte's budget then that's going to impact a lot of people.
Programs are going to be cut or else city taxes are going to have to go
up to make up for some of the loss. I mean I think we need to look at
the big picture. If you don't want to stay in a restaurant, I mean stay
in a  hotel then don't stay but mostly all over this state if you stay
somewhere in a hotel you are going to pay some occupancy tax. And if you
don't want to go out to eat then don't go out to eat and you won't have
to worry about paying for it. But I think that is a huge economic impact
that we need to be aware of and plus the fact the city will have
opportunities to use the stadium for 4 or 5 events. That they will
benefit and not have to pay for where as now they don't and Richardson
has said he does not want to leave Charlotte. He will not leave
Charlotte as long as he lives. But as has been said there are cities
that have built stadiums just wanting a team. There is only 32 teams</p>

so, you know, if they can’t buy a team to come...move, then they got an
empty stadium. There are stadiums waiting for people to come and I think
we just need to look at the big picture of the impact that this team has
and it’s not just about giving to rich, fat cat, ?? I don’t know how to
categorize it. I just think we need to look at the big picture of what
it brings to the city, the county, and the state of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, seeing that we have eight other bills on this docket today
and I believe hearing most of the major arguments at least two or three
times so far, at your discretion, I’d like to make a motion when you
think it’s appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ll call you at the appropriate time. The chair appreciates the fact
we do have eight more bills cited and this does have a serial referral
to Finance, so I will encourage the members to wrap up your questions as
quckly as possible. Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is there any kind of way
that this can be adapted. That we could at least get the lease reduced
proportionately with the amount of funds for renovation. I’m just trying
to figure out some kind of way we could get ownership into a facility
that we...I understand all about the surrounding economic development,
but we’re going to end up owning nothing, and like they’re saying, other
cities have stadiums that they own that are looking for teams, I’d like
to see us own something besides the escalator that can be used nowhere
else but a stadium.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we won’t own anything, the city will. But we’ll look into it and
try to figure out how that works and do what we can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, the chair recognizes you for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I’d like to make a motion that we accept, or that we give
a favorable report to House Bill 193, I don’t believe that’s a PCS, with
a serial referral to Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion before us. All in favor of a favorable report for the
original, for serial referral to finance. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed say no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair says the ayes have it. Thank you, Representative Samuelson.
Our next bill has a PCS. I have a motion from Representative Setzer to
accept the PCS for House Bill 222. It has a serial referral to Finance
as well. Representative Moffitt, if you’re prepared to present your
bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Members of the committee I have this bill
and the two bills following it. I’ll move through them in the interest
of time, fairly quickly. The first bill is a bill that was developed
with our local officials back in Buncombe County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, Moffitt?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the chair could interrupt for a second. I did not hear, did you
inform the members of receiving a revised summary from the pages right
now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, you’ll be receiving a revised summary as
indicated by the chair. The change in the summary is, we are asking that
the county of Buncombe be given this authority, and the original summary
indicated the city of Asheville. Does that suit the chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excellent work sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. If you have one that says the city of Asheville, it should be
the county of Buncombe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I dont’ have the right bill summary and would like to have that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If not, Mr. Chairman, the Committee Substitute is wrong because it says
it authorizes the city of Asheville, as does the original edition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have House Bill, do you have 222 in front of Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do. What I see, and it’s just been pointed out to me, under bill
analysis it mentions county of Buncombe, under the summary at the top it
says city of Asheville. I assume Representative Moffitt, you said we
should go by the county version.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct, Representative Luebke. Is that sufficient, Mr. Chair, to
proceed with this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe we’re there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The city of Asheville, in conjunction with the county of Buncombe have
asked that they be given authority for a design/build method of
construction for a project that they are in joint development of.</p>

and it was not in the very, it was in the pretty recent past where, if
you had a bill that you wanted to bring before the legislature and it
was a local bill that you would work with your local delegation to come
to some agreement, maybe have a meeting prior to introduction, and
consult with each other about what you might want to do in terms of
legislation. I will tell you that I have not had a chance to meet with
my delegation about this bill. The first that I knew about the bill was
last week. But all that aside, what used to happen is that you would
come to consensus and that no local bills would come before the body
unless the local delegation agreed that it was, that they were on board.
And I think one thing that this helped was to preserve the idea of local
rule. That if local governments were doing their jobs and they were
doing the things that needed to be done locally that Raleigh did not
need to interfere in that. That was one approach. I think things have
changed now, obviously, but beyond that and specific to this bill the
city and the county are already working on a transition for the county
to assume this role in terms of zoning. The process, again, I think
would be better handled locally. We don't need legislation, and you'll
see a number of Representative Moffitt's bills and McGrady and Ramsey's
bills coming forward that deal primarily with local problems. I believe
the city and county should be allowed to work with the county to get,
work together through a transition plan, and if this can happen in
Asheville in Buncombe it can happen at any county and city across the
state. And so I would urge this committee to think about the idea of
allowing a city and county to move forward together to work through this
issue and to keep in mind that severe limitation of annexation is bad
public policy. It stifles growth. Most of the development that happens
in the county is on the edge of the city of Asheville. And so how do you
just completely put the brakes on that? And this is over years. So there
is also frequently a need for the city to use annexation to clean up
jurisdictional confusion about boundaries at highway interchanges and
other purposes that just promote basic public safety. And so I think
that this is a little bit of overreach. I think that, again, Raleigh
should not be interfering in the business of local governments and I
would urge this committee to really give some serious thought to what
could happen in your own cities and counties across the state. I will be
voting no on this bill and I would urge the committee to do the same.
Thank you so much.

Representative Mobley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was just wanting to question the fact, had we
accepted this proposed committee substitute, but I guess it's being
discussed already.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

If we had voted to discuss this proposed committee substitute.

Yes ma'am, we did. Representative Setzer made the motion.

Sorry.

Representative Wilkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Maybe several questions. Representative Moffitt
has the Asheville City Council weighed in on this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. I met with Vice Mayor Esther Manheimer on January 2nd this
year and explained to her what we were considering, or what I was
considering in regards to local legislation, and I mentioned repealing
the ETJ authority that they had. They were aware of it. At that point,
probably two or three weeks later, they engaged in conversations with
the county because they felt, in my conversation with her, they knew</p>

<p id="45:00">
since annexation form has taken place, that the ETJ issue would be next
in coming, and that she had spoken to the city manager and told staff to
prepare for this inevitability.  And that's where we are.  As far as
the, if City Council has made a public statement on this issue, I'm not
aware.  Privately, I'm not aware of other comments except from the
Vice-Mayor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Moffitt, is that to say that Ashville
city council has not taken any kind of action, any kind of vote as it
pertains to this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'm not aware of any, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up please, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think one could surmise that any request that came to
you as it would pertains to the filing of this bill, would come from the
county of Buncolme.  Is that a correct assumption?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Are you asking if the county of Buncolme came to me
regarding bringing this legislation forward?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]May I respond, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir, that's what I'm asking.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]No.  This legislation was really brought forward by me,
simply at the request of many of the constituents that live in ETJ
areas, not only in our county, but other areas across the state.  We are
sensitive to the plight they have in regards to having to answer to the
city is that control their property, but do not have the opportunity to
vote for those folks.  However, doing this on a state-wide basis is a
little more complicated than doing it through a local act.  In regards
to this particular local act, our county, we have the benefit in the
fact that we have county wide zoning, so we have the capability in our
county management structure within our own planning and zoning at the
county level to handle any land use planning issues within the ETJ.  So
removing the ETJ is something I just discussed when running for office,
and this is me delivering on my promise to do so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Representative Moffitt, and thank you for
your indulgence, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]My pleasure.  Representative Hollo?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Senator, one quick question
for Representative Moffitt, to help educate me a bit   Are there a lot
of other cities in the state that have already eliminated the authority,
or other ones that you know of?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Representative Hollo.  As a history on that,
I would have to refer your questions to staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Staff, could you give a quick response for
Representative Hall?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We believe in the past different counties have has
their authority to exercise ETJ restrictions.  There are also other
counties that have had it extended.  We can give you a list of currently
applicable at different times and different places.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, staff.  Representative Setzer is recognized.
For a motion and comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]At the appropriate time we'll plea back for a motion.
Would you like to make your comment now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir.  Some of you may or may not know, but I used
to be a mayor of a small town, and I served on the town board as a
commissioner.  During my time as a mayor, and I no longer live in the
city, I live out in the country, I don't support the ETJ.  Now, Catawba
county is blessed with county-wide zoning, but the point was made, and I
support this point, that the people in the ETJ have no say over what is
done over them because of the zoning that's laid across their property.
Now that is an issue that causes a great deal of heartburn.  Now I did
live in the city, but my family, I mean my family never did, and I grew
up outside the town of Catawba.  It's a lovely place, you're all welcome
to come sometime.  I'd love to show it to you, it won't take long for a
tour.  I was the official referee of 650 people, and enjoyed my time
there.   But, extraterritorial jurisdiction is a problem, and I think
this is a good first step.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just have a clarifying
question</p>

Representative Fisher said that the county and the city, I don't want to
say a come to Jesus moment, but they're coming together and it sounded
like from your presentation that that kind of started after you notified
them of your intention to file this bill, is that correct or incorrect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's exactly what
I thought. Thank you so much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Setzer did what I was going to do so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Adams. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
think my question has been answered. Let me just make sure.
Representative there has been no vote or no comment from the city
council regarding your proposal, is that correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not
that I'm aware of, no, ma'am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Did you make an attempt to get
one? I mean to find out what they thought, other than speaking to the
vice-mayor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I did not. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher is recognized again. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A question for the bill sponsor. Were
you aware that the city and the county had already begun a process of
looking at some agreement and then preparation for the county to take
over the ETJ areas and just, you know, as a follow up to that, had they
indicated to you that this would be a process that would take maybe 120
days or so to work through and could they have the time to do that
without it being legislated? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative
Fisher. I guess two things. The difference between the PCS and the
original bill, we did change the effective date from 60 days to 120 and
that date was developed in conversation with the city manager as well as
the county manager, so that timeframe is an acceptable timeframe for all
parties involved. The first part of your question would require a level
of trust between me and Asheville city council. To this moment there is
not that trust. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one more follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And so most of the bills that
we're going to see coming from you having to do with the City of
Asheville have to do with your inability to trust the City of Asheville,
is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, that's incorrect. The conduct of
the City of Asheville, as long as the City of Asheville continues to try
to exercise authority of people outside of their corporate limits, the
General Assembly will continue to intercede. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want
to say a word in favor of ETJ, extra-territorial jurisdiction. The
reason for ETJ is to make sure that it makes some sense the way you have
development in your area and ETJ allows a city to deal with issues that
are adjacent to the city limits as I understand ETJ and I think that's
very good, otherwise you could have a residential area. We have ETJ in
Durham and it's worked out very, very well for city and county and we
don't have any complaints against ETJ and it's because. Representative
Moffitt, I just wanted to make this point. ETJ keeps, if I understand it
correctly, would keep a county from zoning a strip mall next to a
residential area when the residential area is inside the city of
Asheville, and I don't know anything about Asheville, so I'll just say
between the city of Durham and the County of Durham, is that not true.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you want to respond to that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll
let Nathan respond. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, just to
give you some context. The city and the county over the period of beyond
a decade have had discussions about trying to resolve this ETJ area. One
of the many failures that occurred when I was on the Board of
Commissioners and served with 4 members of another party on a 5 member
board is we tried to enact a joint planning area adjacent to the city of
Asheville to eliminate ETJ and it would be some combination of county
regulations and city regulations so as that area grew we could reach
some compromise. One of the ongoing complaints of people who live</p>

?? E T J areas was the fact- number one they could not vote for the
people that lived on city council, so they did not really have a large
amount to say about what went on in that area and the other complaint
was that the city of Asheville chose only to enforce certain regulations
in their E T J. So we had adult bookstores and other things that were in
E T J's that the county had regulations to prohibit certain uses but the
county regulations could not apply as long as the city was excersing E T
J authority. So I would submit this proposed bill is not a controversial
bill. We've had much discussion with  Asheville city council. They
understand the annexation policy of the state of North Carolina. They
are not adamantly opposed to rescinding their E T J. The county is
ready, willing, and able and they have the regulatory capacity to
regulate the E T J area and enact a full range of ordinances so the
people in those areas have the same protections as people that live in
other areas of the community. So, this really cleans up a lot of
problems we've had in the past; I will submit is somewhat more
controversial. This really is not a controversial bill, would be my
argument.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak briefly on the bill. Representative Ramsey, I disagree. This is
a very controversial bill because, well first of all, because it's a
local version of what I think members of your party are going to put
forward as a state wide bill, at least that's what I'm hearing, and
specifically, with respect, you did not answer my question about why you
couldn't have a strip mall next to a residential area, but just to go on
and bring the comments to a close, it's important to remember that while
the complaints come from people whole in an E T J, they do not live in
the city and they are not paying city taxes. And they are benefiting
from the economic livelihood of the city. They would not live were they
live if the city of Asheville was not an economic engine. So, I mean, I
think there's an equal swap because people who live outside the city
limits, they live off the city and I live in the city of Durham and pay
double  taxes. My friends who live out the county, do not. Yet they
wouldn't be living in Northern Durham county if it were not for Duke
medical center and everything else that provides jobs in the city. So, I
don't think it's unfair at all to have E T J. We just have a
disagreement but it is controversial, representative Ramsey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I have one question and a comment. My
understanding was there had been little to no communication with the
Asheville city council and then I just heard in a separate statement
that there had been a great deal of communication with the Asheville
city council so I'm a little confused there. But, further with a comment
if I may mister chairman, with regards to E T J's, in my community I had
a similar situation with the city of Burlington. We had some individuals
that lived right outside the city E T J that, same thing, we had no
representation. We don't like the E T J until someone came in and tried
to put in a landfill and all of the sudden they all loved E T J and
begged us to do everything we could to keep this landfill from coming
in. So, there is two sides to this E T J issue and I hope that members
will keep that in mind. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you representative Ross. To address your first question,
representative Ramsey is former chair of the Buncombe county comissioner
so he had an ongoing relationship with former and current existing city
council members where I do not. In regards to your second question, we
are sensitive in regards to those E T J matters which is the reason why
this is a local bill. We are comfortable  with the land use planning
capabilities of our county. We have the regulatory framework in place
and it is just time to remove this overlay jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Setzer is recognized for a motion.

Thank you mister chair, I move for a favorable report to proposed
committee substitute for house bill 224 and re-refer to the committee on

<p id="60:00">
Regale us with another presentation? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will. Thank you
Mr. Chair. This last bill is oddly enough regarding the City of
Asheville. It is repealing a 2009 local act which gave permission to the
City of Asheville to take 5% of the public enterprise water system
revenues from the water system and use them for water related projects.
The issue here is the definition of water related projects. From a
policy standpoint, public enterprises should be managed with the utmost
of integrity and no money should be diverted from any public enterprise
into any city’s general fund for any purpose. This local act goes
against that policy and this particular bill seeks to repeal that local
act that’s in place. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does that complete your
presentation, sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is the extent of it. Yes, Mr.
Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher is recognized for a
comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. [PAUSE] I think that
you know what you’re again seeing here is this idea of Raleigh needing
to tell Asheville what to do. Or Raleigh needing to tell local
jurisdictions or local governments what to do. Several years ago, the
Sullivan Acts were passed and the, part of that resulting legislation
was that the City of Asheville could use up to a certain percentage of
money to work on projects that were related to water, to infrastructure,
to sidewalks, streets, anything that had to do with water maintenance.
And what Representative Moffitt’s legislation is about to do is to take
even that away. I would submit to the committee that this would upset a
very delicate balance that’s been worked out over several decades. Other
cities in North Carolina have the ability to use revenues for street and
sidewalk improvements associated with water line improvements. And this
bill would take that away. There have been outside auditors who have
looked at the money that has been used by the City of Asheville for
those improvements and they have, their findings say that that money has
been used responsibly. What I don’t understand is, and I’ll just end
with a question. Why is it that just about every bill that we see here
coming from Representative Moffitt, coming from you, has to do with
limiting Asheville’s authority? And why is it that we haven’t been able
to have any sort of delegation, conversation around these issues before
we see these bills appear? That’s my question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Representative Fisher. I appreciate the question. I appreciate the
fact that you would like the public to know that our local delegation is
dysfunctional. It is. In the interest of full disclosure, the bill we’re
repealing at this moment is a bill crafted by Representative Fisher.
It’s an amendment to a bill that she was also part of in 2005, in
regards to Sullivan Acts 2 and 3 that were crafted in conjunction with
Representative Fisher on the House side and, ?? Representative Goforth,
Representative Sherill on the House side, she’s saying together, that
the local delegation came together to craft local legislation to where
Raleigh would interfere with the operations of the City of Asheville at
that time, which she finds distasteful now. But more to point, this
issue is whether or not it is appropriate for this body to allow public
enterprise</p>

?? dollars to be diverted from public enterprise into a municipalities
general fund at the same time that the public enterprise is being pushed
into debt simply because they do not have the cash flow necessary for
the ongoing maintenance and repair of their existing infrastructure and
this is on top of the fact that our public water utility back home is
losing 30% of its water through its aging infrastructure.  So when you
start looking at all those facts, it would be legislative malpractice on
our part if we were to continue to allow a city to utilize public
enterprise dollars to subsidize their general fund in a very loose way.
To give you an idea, there is one project that they have funded where
the water line extension is $189,000 but the road and sidewalk
improvements that they want to put in there are 2.1 million.  So in the
spirit of when that amendment to the ?? Act was adopted, it was adopted
to allow the city to build new sidewalks and improve roads, just in the
immediate area of where the street and sidewalks were cut for the
utility repair and replacement.  So again, although this is regarding
the City of Asheville, we have a broader policy argument in regard to
public enterprise oversight and management.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to explain to the committee members.
I am a co-sponsor of this bill and the reason that I am is because,
well, it is a local bill.  Local in this sense means where the water is
and the water system managed by the City of Asheville is in part, comes
from Henderson County and in fact Henderson County has a number of its
residents or users of this system.  Representative Moffitt has explained
the policy side of this.  Everyone has already heard, no doubt, there
will be water legislation moving forward.  Well, this isn't it but you
may want to know how this relates to it.  Whether or not the General
Assembly in its wisdom were to pass water legislation that I anticipate
that we will introduce in the near term, this piece of legislation makes
sense.  It dovetails whether the legislation were to pass or not because
for the reasons that Representative Moffitt has stated, this can stand
alone and even if we never move on other water legislation, this piece
needs to be addressed.  And, if we in fact do move on legislation to
move the management of water from the City of Asheville to a regional
governmental entity, this legislation also makes sense because in that
case, frankly, the so called ?? Acts don't have any real application and
so I am saying to you, that I am on the bill because it is important to
Henderson County.  We are impacted by what is going on here and too,
this legislation makes sense no matter what is to occur in the future
with respect to the management of the water system itself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just had a question for the bill sponsor.
Do you happen to know how much money the City of Asheville withdrew from
water receipts for 2011-2012?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can give you 10, 11, 12,combined, is that sufficient?  $2,658,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the fiscal year
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.  For the fiscal year 2011-2012, of the utility revenues, the
total amount that the city used for infrastructure improvements related
to waterline projects was $574,310; 2% of utility revenues which is
right in line with what other cites use to go along with water
improvements, infrastructure improvements related to waterline repair.

the chair recognizes your motion  and puts it before the committee. All
those in favor please signify by saying &quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those opposed, please say no?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The &quot;aye&quot;s definitely have that, and the chair thanks Rep.
Moffitt for his presentation this morning ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We're moving on to House bill 186, Rep. ?? you're here? Okay.
This is a PCS, we're moving on by the motion of Rep. Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Rep. Pittman.
Mr. Chair, with your  permission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 186 is a bill that would allow the towns on Lake Norman to
enforce ordinances 2500 feet from the 760 water mark, which is the high
water mark on the lake. Primarily noise ordinances out into the water,
within their city limits. I will acknowledge that 2500 feet from the
water as I had that pleasure of speaking with Rep. Setzer earlier today,
could theoretically go slightly cross into another county's
jurisdiction, but it would be a nominal cross as most of the time, the
county line is in the middle of the lake. So this bill simply allows
this provision for towns like Cornelius to allow that if there's a boat,
houseboat blaring music  5 feet of the coast in a cove, to enforce noise
ordinances like they do anywhere else. The coastal communities most of
them already have this right, we're simply asking for the same right as
the coastal communities and the lake communities. There was one
opposition, which is why we have the PCS, that was from primarily from
duck hunters concerned that this would take away their ability to fire a
gun in duck hunting. The PCS specifically limits that so that cannot be
a problem moving forward with this legislation. And so Mr. Chairman, I
am happy to answer any questions at your pleasure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Rep. Moffitt is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I have a question for the bill sponsor?
How does this affect wakeboard boats that are playing music at a rather
high level and they're passing by this particular zone or passing
through this zone versus being stationary?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is my understanding of this legislation that it would not affect them
because the noise ordinances for the current towns are static noise that
can be heard for a period of time, a doppler effect noise impact is
almost what I believe you're referring to would not be subject to this
ordinance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would presume that these- there's multiple towns in this particular
bill, do they have a uniform sound ordinance and if so, what are the
hours that that ordinance applies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would argue that they probably do not have a uniform sound ordinance.
I don't think that's accurate. Most of them have a limitation at some
point of night, there are some towns- I'll give you a primary example:
Huntersville, where I served on the city council for 7 years, that some
noise ordinances that exist 24 hours a day. So you couldn't go into your
garage and work on an engine and test fire it at 3:00 in the afternoon
if you kept it at a decibel level for a period of 60 seconds above a
certain decibel point. So I don't necessarily believe there's
continuity, I do believe though there is continutity from what the
city's asking to do on the water versus what's already admissible and
permissible on the land.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I've actually looked into this issue and I've
spoken to some of the local authorities that brought this forward or
asked for this to be brought forward. I think it's a good bill and
that's an appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just have one question. I know 2500 feet, if my math is correct, is
just about half a mile, and I'm not familiar with the geography of Lake
Norman living on the other side of the state, is it possible, are there
places in Lake Norman that are more than a mile wide, so if I wanted to
go out there and listen to Stevie Ray Vaughan at 120 decibels I could
pull up somewhere in the middle of the lake and be more than 2500 feet
from either side?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My recommendation would be go to the Catawba county side of the lake.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I object. Strenuously I object that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, Lake Norman is the largest man-made lake in North Carolina,
there's certainly cases where that's the case. The other thing you have
to understand is it does not prohibit you from going 2000 feet out or
going 1500 feet out and playing Stevie Ray Vaughan, or any other music
you'd care to listen to. It would have to be at a decibel level upon the
shoreline that would cap over</p>

<p id="80:00">
Limit so if you were sitting in the middle light blaring music, the
likelihood of that pushing over the desk pool I would say is nominal at
best. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
have some problems with this. I mean, having a town enforce its
ordinances 1/2 mile onto a navigable body of water disturbs me to say
the least even though it might have a good rationale for it. Who's
measuring the decibels at the shoreline. Do you have devices set up
there so if it goes to a court you could say he was at 110 decibels at
this time of day and here's the piece of mechanical provided evidence? I
just, the concept to me is, you know, a little strange. Don't we have, I
don't know. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You're going to find that most of my bills
tend to be strange by nature. I appreciate the question Representative
Cleveland, and I would like to preface this has nothing to do with the
city of Asheville, so I would say that as it is and currently the
majority of towns I'm talking about there is not static measurement
equipment. The regulation would require a complaint to be notified to
the local police department. The police department would then actually
have to come and stand on that personal property's owner and they have a
decibel meter that is issued by law enforcement, it could not be a
private citizen, it would legitimately have to be a certified law
enforcement official of one of the town's municipal law enforcement
agencies. They would hold the decibel meter. If it exceeded that decibel
of the permissible decibel amount for more than 60 seconds at that point
it is enforceable, recordable and transmittable for the court of law. So
there is no, you couldn't arbitrarily sit in my backyard and say hey,
that boat over there, Jeff Collins is listening to Stevie Ray Vaughn and
I can see right here on my handheld device where they exceeded the
decibel limit and that's not fair. It would have to be done by a police
officer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move for a favorable report on the proposed
committee substitute on House Bill 186, unfavorable to the original with
a subsequent referral to Judiciary B. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. We
have a motion before the committee from Representative Moffitt. All in
favor please signify by saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All those opposed, please say no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That sounded less than the decibels needed for the
chair to make a determination. I think the ayes have it and
Representative Jeter, I think you have another bill to present. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. This is another local bill for the town of Cornelius.
This one is, they currently have, this is Bill 195 I believe, Mr.
Chairman. With your permission I'd be happy to present. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, sir. Please proceed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] They have a design
build clause that was permitted to them some years ago. It currently
sunsets on July 1st of this year. They have some existing bonds, they
have some bonds that they have yet to sell that they would like to
continue to be able to utilize in the design build method which has
proven to be effective in their community. They would like the sunset of
this bill to be extended until June 30, 2016. That's the only change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. I'd like to at the appropriate time make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. It would appear this is the
appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move a
favorable report for the bill with referral to regulatory reform.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a motion before us from Representative
Faircloth to give a favorable report to House Bill 195. All those in
favor please signify by saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Opposed, say no. The ayes have it. Thank you Representative
Jeter. Representative Brian Brown is before us to present House Bill 191
with a serial referral to finance and Representative Brown if you're
ready. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Unlike the previous
bills today, this one truly is a straightforward, non-controversial
bill. This is a bill that was brought to me by the Grifton Town Manager.
In 2006 a single parcel of land sitting outside of the city limits of
Grifton, the town limits of Grifton, was looking to become a daycare
center and in an effort to make that available to become a daycare
center it needed to be annexed.</p>

into the town of Grifton in order to be tied into the sewer treatment
facility within Grifton. Unfortunately, the project fell through at the
time. The parcel of land was never tied in to the sewer treatment plants
and the owner of the parcel of land has requested to the town board of
Grifton to be ?? back out of it and the town board of Grifton voted
unanimously to allow that to take place and thus I am before you today.
So without any questions I will welcome them. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Setzer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At the appropriate time I'd
like to make a motion for favorable report. Do we have any questions for
the committee? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, just very briefly. So
you're telling us, Representative Bryan, that the city manager requested
this by implication of the city council supports the managers position?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir and all the documentation is right there
before you from the board meeting, the board minutes - [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Seeing no other
questions, Representative Setzer you are recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to make a motion for favorable report for
House bill 191 in ?? the committee on finance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have
a motion before the committee from Representative Setzer to give
favorable report. All those in favor please say aye. All those opposed
say no. The ayes have it. Thank you, Representative Brown. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Millis will be before us to present House bill 205 with a serial
referral to finance assuming that meets our approval today.
Representative Millis, the podium is yours sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Chair and members of the committee. This bill before you today
is at the request of the town of Bregaw. It's in regard to the makeup of
the tourism development authority board. Currently the town of Bregaw
has a 3 member board. In the way that the current law is crafted is that
3/4ths of that board has to be active in the promotion of tourism and
travel. With a 3 member board, this presents some confusion. Since that
law was crafted, the house chairs for finance revised what is required
for actual being in compliance to one half of the members of the tourism
development authority board have to be active in the promotion of travel
and tourism. So as a result to not only clarify in order to be in
compliance but also to clarify for the town of Bregaw that their 3
member board is adequate in order to meet the intent of the law I'm
requesting your approval for this clarifying language. As you can see
that the proposed language before you strikes the word 3/4ths and
replaces it with 1/2. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you done sir? Representative
Millis have you completed your presentation? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have
completed my presentation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative
Setzer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to make a motion for favorable
report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wilkins. I'm sorry.
Representative Floyd. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a question. Why not
majority instead of 1/2? [SPEAKER CHANGES] In 2005 the House finance
chairs changed the percentage of the members to be currently active in
the motion of travel and tourism from 3/4ths to 1/2 so this bill here
would actually be in compliance with what is the current guidelines for
these boards in relation to occupancy tax. So not only would this
legislation now be in compliance, it also clarifies the issue and clears
it up with at a 3 member board stands. Because not only is it important
to make that change but right now, the way the law is written, is that
1/3 has to be actually active in the business of collecting the
occupancy tax so you've got 1/3, you've got 3/4, you've got a 3 member
board. If we don't make this change then it will be confusing on the
behalf of maybe requiring a 4 member board. Does that answer your
question, Representative Floyd? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes man. Christopher
Southern Pines. Yes man. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Setzer, you're recognized for motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I move that when favorable report be given to House bill 205
and re-referred again to the committee on finance. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, once again, Representative Setzer's put a motion
before us. All in favor of his motion please signify by saying aye.
Those opposed say no. The ayes have it. Thank you Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair and members of the committee.</p>

Welcome. Representative Elmore is going to present house bill 270.
Representative Elmore, [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. As Representative Boles informed me I am the
last thing between you and lunch. So I will speak fast about my local
bill. I have consulted with the house delegation, which is me, about
this. But I have also talked with Shirley Randleman , our senator
representing district 30. She's running an identical bill on the senate
side. What this bill does it puts a referendum on the  ballad in one of
the municipalities in my district the smallest municipality in my
district. The background on it in the original town charter the town had
recall capability in it's charter. But in the 70's the General Assembly
striped all of those recall capabilities from the municipalities. What
this bill does it allows through voter referendum in November that the
people of Ronda can vote to put this prevision back into their charter
if they choose and the bill also spells out how the recall would be
conducted if they place it back into the charter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank You Sir. Representative Collins is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My commotion whatever you think is appropriate Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question, I'm just a poor little country boy from Cumberland
County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will bare with you, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Fifty percent, I mean, why not fifty one percent I'm just...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What the fifty percent number is that is the percentage that they would
have to get on a petition of the registered voters. Right now there is
266 registered voters in the town. That means, to allow for a recall,
the person would have to go and collect 133 signatures to in-act the
recall mechanism.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
???, would it be...I would feel a little better if he got 137, but...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The signatures do not remove the person from office, all the signatures
does is allow for special election to be conducted and then the voters
would come to the special election just with normal election procedures.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??? Boles wants to go to lunch, that's okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I would like to make a motion that we give a favorable report to
house bill 270 and thankfully it looks like there is no referral to
finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a final motion before us from Representative Collins for a
favorable report on house bill 270. All in favor signify by saying Aye
all opposed say no. The chair says ayes have it. Ladies and Gentleman we
