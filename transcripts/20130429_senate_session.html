House bill 149 calendar. Senators, we can move right into our calendar
for the day, starting with public bills with a third reading, r7oll call
bill, House bill 488. The clerk will read House bill 488,
regionalization of public utilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, what purpose do your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. To make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbiit, you have the floor for your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate. I wanted to make a
motion that this bill be taken off and put on for next Tuesday. I think
that would be Tuesday the 7th of May, and I'd like to speak to that
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, you have the floor to speak your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, and I think all the members are aware that
Senator Apodaca is out for the rest of this week, and I've not had a
chance to talk to him and I wouldn't talk to him under these conditions,
about a bill like this. I just, I suggested to the folks that are still
here that we put this bill off till he can get back, and that came back
no. And I felt it important to bring it to the membership. I have a very
hard time with a contentious bill like this being heard. When a member
is not here and has a very good reason for not being here, and has a
very good reason to have us, if you would take care of them while
they're gone. Senator Apodaca doesn't like this bill much more than I
do, and probably when he gets back, he won't have anything to say about
it, but I just really think that the members ought to think about this.
I know he was asked and said go ahead and run it, but all of you have
been where when your parents passed, and sometimes your friends need to
take care of you too. But anyhow, that's my suggestion to the
membership, that we put it off till next Tuesday. This is not time
sensitive, and you all know me pretty well. I'm not trying to stall. I'm
going to say the same thing next Tuesday that I'm going to say tonight.
But I think out of deference to our each other, we need to not do this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter , what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter  has the floor to speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, thank you for giving me a heads up on this so that we
can talk it through. Senator Apodaca was very clear that although he's
going to be very disappointed in hearing what Senator Nesbitt has to say
tonight, other than a technical amendment, he has said what he intends
to say on this bill and would like us to run this, so I would ask that
you vote no on the motion to carry this bill over to next Tuesday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So Senators, we're going to have to vote on the motion now. The motion
is to postpone to a certain day. All in favor. All in favor of the
motion to postpone to a certain day will vote aye, opposed will vote no.
5 seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the
vote. 16 having voted in the affirmative, and 32 in the negative. The
motion fails. The bill.</p>

Maybe they didn't want to pay that, but I think bottom line is the city
of Hendersonville looked at this bill and said, &quot;I don't want any
part of it. I don't want to have to bill the water and sewer for these
fellows out in the county that have spent all these years not tending to
their business. They don't have a water source. They don't have a sewage
treatment plant, and they want, first of all, access to the two of
those. That's probably two billion dollars worth of assets over there in
our system that they want immediate access to. And then, they want us to
pay ninety-four percent of the build-out for the rest of their system.
This is insane. I hope that you now understand what's going on and just
how crazy this can get when somebody decides they're going to start
messing with these assets. The Henderson County system that could take
all of this and spread it among its people over there is not
participating in this deal. It's time to vote against this bill and the
others that look just like it. By the way, we're fixing to do the bond
thing here. You just need to know that. You remember all the hoorah we
had about Charlotte and whether or not we could ?? transfer those bonds.
And we got an opinion from several lawyers. But Vance Holloman with the
Treasurer's office put a letter out to us that said he was seriously
concerned about taking assets from local government that were under
bond. The reason being you will have to disclose, once you start doing
this on any bond issue, that the asset you're bonding for your revenue
source could be taken from that entity at any moment by state
government. When you do that, you're going to damage the bonds all over
this state. Never mind it didn't happen in your county. It doesn't
matter. If it happens in my county, it could happen in your county. And
there are bonds associated with this that would be transferred. And they
have every bit the same problem. There's absolutely no way that the
conditions could be complied with by the date you're supposed to
transfer this property, and we're just wading in the swamp, folks. And
we need to put a stop to it before it gets out of hand. I urge you to
vote against the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion today?
Hearing now in request before the senate. Is the passage of the city
committee to substitute the House bill 488 as amended on its third
reading? All in favor, vote &quot;Aye&quot; Opposed vote &quot;No&quot;.
Five seconds to be allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the
vote. Thirty-one having voted the affirmative, sixteen in the negative,
If senate committee substitute the house bill 488 as amended passes its
third reading, the amendment will be engrossed and sent to the house for
concurrence in the senate committee substitute . Senators, we have a
leave of absence. It's an excused absence for Senator Hartsell for the

429:
Speaker 1: Procedure and courts, because I have never been there before
and I would like if you could explain to me why mediation is not in here
and the need for arbitration which is a new procedure.
Speaker changes: Yes ma’am, Senator it’s actually not new, I have
handled a number of small claims actions and when that actually xxxx
goes to arbitration before it goes to trial in District court . This
continues that procedure, and makes it as condition preceded in order to
collect your fees and costs if on the third appeal you were in the
district court for trial.
Speaker changes: Mr. Chairperson
Speaker changes: Senator can I ask for what purpose you arise?
Speaker changes:  I would like to find out about mediation because we
have talked about that and would like to know..
Speaker changes: xx
Speaker changes: So the lady wants to speak to the
Speaker changes: I am sorry I have to ask Senator Cosby to
Speaker changes: to address.
Speaker changes: To specifically address
Speaker changes: Senator Cosby  ..
Speaker changes: On mediation. Thank you.
Speaker changes: xx ma’am.
Speaker changes:  xxx a question?
Speaker changes: Can you ask the question please…once again.
Speaker changes: xx I am just looking for why mediation is not
specifically addressed in the bill.
Speaker changes: Yes ma’am, I didn’t have the vote to change the
procedure. I didn’t want to answer, I did not vote to change the current
procedure of the law. Mediation is always available if the party so
desire, the court could direct the parties to consider the act. It
doesn’t change anything, it allows the court procedure for the appeals,
just  for the other members to understand when you appeal, when you are
in small claims court you can always appeal for a[ tridenovo??]or a
district court. Xx However when the jurisdiction of that court is only
$15,OOO/ it’s automatically arbitration that is considered . This tries
to keep that up. So even if the parties after arbitration wanted to go
into a trial in District court with the jury, the judge could still
order mediation . The parties could at any time agree for mediation and
I am not opposed to mediation  whatsoever , it has solved a lot of cases
for me and the circle that the arbitration and the continued adversario
??status of the case would make it happen in the xx sooner rather than
later. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister president, thank you. Members, what this bill does is it takes
many of the regulations that are on the books regarding public schools
and removes them. These are reports that are either not used or
redundant in some way, have no useful purpose, and information is found
in other places. And what we try to do is remove all of those, but I
have an amendment, mr. president, to send forth to members to have a
copy.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mr. president. To explain the amendment. Something new on the
scene is called power school. Power school is replacing the NCY's
legislation. It required a whole lot of data from schools to be entered
on attendance and absences and whether you were eating in the lunch room
and on and on and on. And now, the power school is going to replace
that. However, in power school, and you will be hearing about this if
you talk to school people, it is requiring much more, it's much more
broad based, lots more information. And I'm asking DPI to limit the
scope of that and the amount of time that it takes.
The teacher, in the classroom, is going to be taking from five minutes
up to fifteen or twenty minutes of class time to do this report. They
gotta punch in all this data. Some of the data, I can not for the life
of me see where it is necessary. I don't know enough to be sure that
it's not. So I'm going to ask DPI to report back the ?? oversight by
July 30th what changes in reductions they make in this bill and exactly
how much on average time it takes from the classroom teacher. And if
necessary, we will come back and fix that too. That's all the amendment
does.

Thank you, Mr. President. Currently those people with low vision in the
state of North Carolina that need a bi-optic lens, which is, it looks
like a little binocular on top of the lens that people with low vision
very quickly glance and look at street signs or other things they need
to read while they're going down the road. Currently they can't use it
when they're trying to take a sight test for driving. With this
legislation they will be able to take the test with the bi-optic lens,
but plus must go to meet the certain requirements for restrictions only
to drive during the daytime and they must not only pass the vision test
