I ?? the meeting to order. House Sergeant at arms today that's with us
Young Bay, BH Powell, ?? Gadsden, and Tony O'Marshall. And our pages
Caroline ??, from Wayne ?? Drone, Burns, and William Byers. If I
mispronounce your name, I'm sorry. That's all my years of experience as
a teacher, I've forgot how to do it. We are going to take up House Bill
628 first. Representative Presnell.
[Speaker Change]
House Bill 628 basically it started because we had a US forestry service
building that was built in Madison county, and they used no North
Carolina products in that building.
[Speaker Change]
??
[Speaker Change]
They even ordered bamboo flooring from Brazil. And it really just kind
of made me mad. So I just decided to put this bill in here. I think it's
a good bill. I do have the commissioner Traxler has signed off on it, he
loved it, thought it was great. The home builder like it. By using North
Carolina products we have jobs that are created from the loggers to the
saw mill, and the finisher on the wood, contractors building it, plus
it's much less cost then it would be to get your bamboo from Brazil, and
the shipping it over and stuff like that. And there's other products
that are also used, 'cuz it does talk about other equally using
products, product based ?? or products manufactured or produced in this
state. And that's good.
[Speaker Change]
Representative McGrady.
[Speaker Change]
I don't have a bill summary on this. Is there a bill summary available?
Nobody I believe has one.
[Speaker Change]
There's no bill summary.
[Speaker Change]
OK.
[Speaker Change]
Do you wanna ask staff them?
[Speaker Change]
I'd like to ask staff a question, and then a few questions for the bill
sponsor. In the bill it refers to every major facility construction
project of a public agency. what does that mean? Does that mean local
schools? Are we just talking about state buildings here? Or what's the
breath of the bill? If staff could answer me.
[Speaker Change]
Barbara.
[Speaker Change]
Staff will need to research that and get back to you.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Chairman that's a pretty important question as to what the breath of
the bill is. It's one thing if it refers to simply state buildings, it's
a whole nother thing if we're capturing a whole group of local projects
of all nature. If I can ask the bill sponsor I guess. Can I follow up?
[Speaker Change]
Yes you may.
[Speaker Change]
My reading of this bill is that it's really a bill that effectively
eliminates lead certification. It doesn't specify that but the effect of
this would be that. Am I reading it right?
[Speaker Change]
Well they don't, they just need to use North Carolina products in their
building, whatever they build. Why buy bamboo from Brazil? We've got
oak, cherry, pine, whatever you want.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up.
[Speaker Change]
You may.
[Speaker Change]
I guess again I think my reading of the bill is that effectively this
would end lead certification. And you're saying that is not your
understanding of the bill.
[Speaker Change]
That's not what I proposed.
[Speaker Change]
One follow up and then I'll stop.
[Speaker Change]
Representative McGrady staff has the answer to your first question.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Representative McGrady a major facility
renovation project means a project to renovate a building when the cost
of the project is greater than 50% of the insurance value of the</p>

<p id="05:00">
prior to the renovation, and the renovated portion of the building is
larger than 20,000 gross square feet of occupied or condition space, as
defined in the state building code. It does not include a project to
renovate a transmitter building or pumping station, and does not include
a project to renovate a building having historic architectural or
cultural significance, under part 4 of article 2 of chapter 143b, and
public agency means every state office, officer, board, department, and
commission and institutions of higher education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I can follow up to the explanation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then as I understand this only relates to state agencies and not county
buildings, am I right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then following, last question of the bill sponsor: Rep. Presnell, I
wonder why in the bill, why not just a bill that requires local wood be
used in public projects as opposed to wading into the whole
certification area? I was wondering if what you were proposing here
couldn't be done in a rather more direct fashion than upsetting the
building certification process that we've currently got in place?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well we did want to use the building standards sustainable with the
American National Standards Institute. If that answers your question.
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I think that this is a more complicated bill as
Rep. McGrady was suggesting in his remarks, this is a much more
complicated bill than has been represented, and I don't understand why
staff doesn't have an explanation, but I would respectfully request that
we displace this bill until we have a bill explanation. It's totally
standard in the general assembly, it's just to me I can't really
understand the bill if staff doesn't provide the explanation. I would
ask that we displace the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Presnell, are you into that, or not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I really don't want to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Isn't it a matter of committee procedure and not a matter of what the
member wants? It's really not fair to us members that staff has not
prepared a bill explanation. I don't see how we should move forward
without a bill explanation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I hear what you're saying.
Rep. Brisson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Not sure I understand everything the bill sponsors
trying to ??. Basically, what I'm trying to pick up on it is we're just
trying to promote North Carolina products, we're not telling- we don't
need to tell who to bill and how to bill or whatever, we just want to
make sure that when materials are available that are- we have in North
Carolina, North Carolina grown materials, be used. Is that what you're
trying to get at, or you're not trying to tell folks how to build their
buildings, or..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, exactly right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So I don't know how the staff can help you get it worded right, but at
the end of the day, I think we're just trying to promote North Carolina
products here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Daughtry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. My question is, to be sure that the state gets
the best deal that they can get from a financial standpoint, when you
build a building, I don't want to see them having to spend 10 or 20%
more to build a building if they use North Carolina products as opposed
to going somewhere and getting additional products. Are we pretty sure
that they'll be competitive? For example, the bamboo you talked about,
if that's 50% cheaper than anything we can buy here, I'd hate to see
them not use the bamboo, if that was the cheapest thing they would get.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say that by the time you have it shipped over here from Brazil
and go through the gas and everything else, it would not be cheaper.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Terry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a quick question, I wonder if staff knows how many offshore markets
our North Carolina trees sell to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we know that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, we'll have to research</p>

<p id="10:00">
Get back to you. I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Presnell, we're going to pull your bill until we get this
information together. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 686. Representative Tine?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a PCS. I made a motion to have the PCS before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pardon?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They told me it was a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas moves that we have the PCS before us. All in favor
say aye. All opposed, no. Motion secured.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This bill is centered around the new North
Carolina Seafood Park authority, which approached me to changing its
name to better match up to what it actually does. Most of the facility
is utilized by marine industry. We build boats, we have some commercial
fishermen, there are several different industries there that don't
really meet the old name. Also with the expansion of the Inglehart
Marine Industrial Park, I thought that now was a time to go ahead and
change the name. I worked with their attorney and their board to make
sure that this gave them the corrections that they needed. There's two
things beyond the name change which most of this bill is about the name
change in all the different spots, but one is expanding the improvements
and things that it can make to be consistent with the new name change.
There was a removal of cooperation with the federal government. It was
not intended to skirt any federal requirements, it was simply that if
Oregon Inlet should come into state hands at some point or during the
negotiation process thereof, it may be in the community's best interest
to actually take an adversarial role with one of the federal agencies so
that we might better serve that port area, so that's why that was
removed. It's not meant to ?? any laws, it's simply there so that it
gives them all the tools that they need to be able to work with the
federal government, and if there's any questions-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Anyone have any questions-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Mobley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question of the bill sponsor. My question is, if there was any
or has there been any push back or negative from the commissioners or
municipalities around this area with regard to this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I haven't had any opposition. I work very closely with the board
that oversees the park to make sure that it met their needs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Any time there's a major rebranding or
remarketing of something, there's going to be costs involved with
changing signs, stationary, I don't know what else. What kinds of things
are involved with this? What's the cost and who pays it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, we have a representative from the- the executive director from
there and he would be able to better tell you if that's alright, Mr.
Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Idenitfy yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Bob Hill (??), director of the ?? Facility. There will be some very
minor costs, and it's basically stationary and a couple of signs. We're
talking, at most, 1000- we don't have a lot of signs, so we're talking
about 1000, maybe 1500 dollars and we'll pay for that out of our
receipts. We have the money to make the exchanges.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Anyone else? Representative Brisson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think somebody's already answered my questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Steinburg?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I'd like to move that we give an unfavorable report to the original
and a favorable to the substitute, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You heard the motion. ??. All in favor say aye. All opposed, no. The
ayes have it and the motion's secured.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, members.

It certainly is. We've got one individual that wanted to speak with us
today and we're going to allow that and this is Vanessa Harrison,
president of A T and T in North Carolina and she's going to speak on the
rural investment project and we've passed out some stuff for you and she
can come forth right here. Vanessa, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you so much ?? for allowing me time to get on your calendar to
come and speak to you about a project that A T and T is involved in
along with the wireless industry here in North Carolina. I'm here today
on behalf of seven thousand employees with A T and T in North Carolina
to thank you for your support of the laws and policies which encourage
private investment and help drive economic growth. And we all know in
this environment today economic growth is very important. You and your
predecessors have worked very hard and diligently to make sure that
North Carolina laws make sense in our changing economy and that's the
second reason that I am here. It is to give you an idea of more changes
that are about to come and how they will benefit North Carolina
especially families who live in rural areas. As you know wireless
service are becoming more and more important today in our lives than
ever before. In North Carolina today wireless subscriptions outnumber
traditional landline phones two to one. Thirty five percent of american
households are wireless. Over the past six years since the smart phones
came out we have seen at least a thirty thousand percent increase in
mobile traffic. That's a lot of data. A lot of emails, lot of text
messages, lot of baby pictures being transported over the network. At A
T and T we are committed to meeting the needs of our customers and our
communities and that is why we have invested ninety six billion dollars
in the U S economy over the past five years and more than any other
public company here. And in North Carolina here alone we've invested
more than one point five billion dollars over the last three years and
we plan to continue this investment but we can't do it without your
help. Looking ahead, we recently announced a project that is called
project velocity I P which is basically an enhanced broadband project
and that project costs our company fourteen billion dollars and so you
can see why we are very very excited about this. And my role in this
today for A T and T North Carolina as president is to make sure that we
get as much of that money right here in North Carolina and to do so we
got to have a very friendly public policy environment with updated rules
that will allow us, and when I say us I mean the entire wireless
industry, to be able to deploy the technology that we need and have
partnerships with our local and state government. So our L T E which is
what we call our broadband network now is one of the technologies that
we will use to build out this platform. Another part of that plan is to
build out our four G L T E advance network to cover three hundred
million americans by year end two thousand fourteen. It's right around
the corner. And to deploy fiber to an additional one million business
customer locations in our wire line service area by year end two
thousand fifteen. Another benefit of this project will be to expand and
enhance our wire line and I T network to approximate fifty seven million
customer locations by year end two thousand fifteen. And then, our plan
for A T and T is to ensure that we have ninety nine percent of our
customer location in our twenty two state footprint, we want to ensure
that they are going to have high speed broadband and internet access
either by mobile or wire line internet access. The transition to this
new platform, it benefits all consumers but especially those that live
in rural areas here in North Carolina. So let me give you some examples
of how</p>

<p id="20:00">
..how this will work. Broadband, we know that broadband connects rural
America to more physicians. Rural America has fewer than half the number
of primary care physicians per one hundred thousand residents than the
urban areas do today. That's a big disparity. And so, tele-medicine
helps reduce that rural American disparity among the physicians, and it
allows seven point five million rural senior people to receive care
right there at their home. This project also leads to higher production
to farmers, and it enriches the ability to small farmers to effectively
compete with large farms. We know that eighty-four percent of U.S. farms
with sales and government payments of two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars or more have access to a computer, we know that eighty-two
percent of these farms have internet access, and then seventy-two
percent are using the internet for farm business. Some of the ways they
are using the internet for farm business is monitoring pesticide, and
herbicide applications. They're using it also for animal tracking and
identification, for monitoring water, or flood levels - like,
Representative Mobley and I was talking about right there in Bertie
county. Farmers are using it to monitor crops, and the health of the
crop, and the rainfall. It's also used to indicate when frost events are
going to take place, which could negatively impact the crops. It's used
to track your shipments of perishable crops, and crop input. They also
use it to monitor equipment movement, and their performance, I think
somebody was telling me this morning that they have GPS systems on the
tractors. And, to use it for web cameras to view hazardous or remote
areas where they're not physically located. So, we believe that it's the
project VIP, broadband project here in North Carolina will benefit our
rural communities as well as expand coverage for the communities in our
urban areas. Making these things possible requires investment and
capital. That's why I am committed to get as much of this money here, of
this 14 billion dollars, that is my job. My job is to get as much of
that money here in North Carolina. And the job of my team, which we have
been charged to do, is to make sure that we have the right public policy
climate here to do that in North Carolina. And so that's why I'm so
thankful that you all allowed me to get on your agenda, be able to be
able to come and hear this project of what we're doing, ?? the support
of helping to update these policies as we need it. And you're helping us
do that, by continuing to evaluate and update our telecommunications
laws, and policies to encourage the investment that we're speaking of in
new technology. Thank you so much, and, please, if there's anything A T
&amp; T can help do, we're always willing to partner with our local
in-state governments to make it happen. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Miss Harrison. Members of the committee, any brief
comments or questions while we have Miss Harrison here? I just had a
senior moment, Representative. Waddell, Representative Waddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, I have those all the time, too. I do
appreciate you coming and talking to us today about access to broadband
in rural areas because that is a real big concern of mine. And it's
gonna be necessary to be able to promote new business opportunities out
in the rural areas, too. So, I applaud, that. I only have one question ,
really, about broadband access in the rural areas. I'm one of those
farmers that uses the computer a lot, and I also use the computer to
access cameras, an am having problems. Presently I don't use A T &amp; T
, I use one of your competitors, Verizon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, did you say something?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You want me to dismiss him?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's okay 'cause we're all in it together.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's the only access I've got and they've got better cell coverage
down in my area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And where's your area?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In Columbus County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But, presently, to access those cameras I'm having to use hardwire, or,
routed services. And, the cameras are not amenable to using the
hotspots, or you know, the..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wifi?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wifis yet. So, I was wondering what kind of process, or what kind of
thinking is there to</p>

<p id="25:00">
you know, further access- for me to be able to access those cameras and
do some of those other things you were talking about, because they're
dependant on hard wired or router services.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well that's a very good question and that's part of the objective of
this project is to allow in situations like with you, with you that you
have hard wired technology. We are expanding our technology so that you
will be able to accomplish that via wireless technology, which would
give you a broader coverage and with our 4G LTE technology would not
only give you a broader coverage but would give you a faster service on
that. So that each application would have to of course be examined, but,
in tomorrow's environment, we're looking for you not to have it hard
wired, that you would be able to use that just throught wireless
service.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Mobley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'm always excited about hearing you mention
about some of the more rural areas such as the one I serve. 2 questions:
How will the various counties access these monies? Is it going to be
from you office, or whether the means of being able to utilize these
funds for broadband or what have you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me make sure I understand whether the meaning is being able to
utilize the funds? ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? various counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. We already have a very aggressive buildout plan for the counties
where we're going, and it's all of the counties. We obviously can't
share some of the things, but we have a map that we can sit down and
discuss with you and show you, we're in those counties that we have the
white spaces, and we're in those counties that we're planning to build
out so that it would give you an understanding of how much broadband
would be coming there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Once you- I heard you say you had mapped out your plan and have- and you
and I will be getting together to talk, however, what is the projection
on the actual starting up this process so when the monies are actually
going to hit the counties?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's here. It's here, so that's why my job is to keep it. We have our
plan for 2013 through 2015. And of course, 14 and 15 will continue to
grow dependant on how successful we are in getting the technology
deployed in these counties, and not just in the counties, but in the
cities and towns as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Harrison, as you can see there's sufficient interest in this
committee for what you're trying to do and what you want to do, and we
look forward to cooperating with you fully to help you accomplish what
you're about accomplishing and especially in the rural areas of North
Carolina. So unless there's something enormously urgent, we're
adjourned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.</p>
