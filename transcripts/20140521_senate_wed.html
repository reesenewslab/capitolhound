Senate will come to order. Sargent At Arms, close the door. Members will
go to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery, please silence all
electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer today is Reverend Peter
Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery will
please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. Let's pray together. Father, thank you for sending
your holy spirit here, right now, that carries us along as a body.
You've brought us this far and you're gonna bring us to the destination
that you would choose fit. Lord, none of us are appointed by chance. Nor
have any of us have gotten to this place on our own esteem. We are
keenly aware of that. This is a secret, sovereign appointment. May we be
humbled today by that knowledge. Thankful for the gift of this place,
this assembly, those that have come before, those that will come after
us. And so Lord, we can feel the largeness of this place. We're only
gnats sometimes Lord. What would it be like if we were to worry less
about people's opinions and the approval of others? So Lord, may our
confidence to legislate calm from your favor, from your assurance,
rather than from our own ambivalence or our own attempts to make up what
we want to make up. Give us freedom and give us faith. Thank you Lord
for that. We pray in Christ's name.  Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, please recognize for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. The journal for Tuesday, May
20th 2014 has been examined and found to be correct. I move that the
Senate dispense with the reading of the Journal and that it's found

Quite a retinue of things he had done. He was a member of this body, he
was an adviser to the governors, and he was a mentor a a lot of young
legislators from both parties, I might add. Zeb was a very unselfish
person, he gave of himself entirely and I can remember, I just got to
know him over the past six years or so, but there are some around who
knew Zeb Aly forty years ago, some of his law partners who are in here
today. Zeb was a great fella and I understand he represented all of the
veterans organizations in the state before the general assembly as their
lobbyist, pro bono.  Now knowing Zeb Aly that's not like him, but he did
that as a labor of love because of the roles that the veterans have
played in our state for all of these years. Now, over the past several
years, Zeb was not in the greatest of health, but he would hold court
every morning that general assembly was in session down in the
legislative snack bar at breakfast time, and he had something wise to
say about everybody that walked in the door, be it an old guy like me or
a young woman, he was much more flatteringly speaking about them than he
was me, but he was great to sit with, and hear him with all of his
stories. Now before we got into this silly rule of not being seen in
public with lobbyist anymore, back in the days lobbyists and legislators
did hang out together quite a bit at night.  Zeb had several rather
infamous watering holes around town, where he would go and invite people
to come in and share a little spirits with him , and Zeb was quite the
character along those ways.  One of my fondest memories was hearing him
sing melancholy maybe. Zeb Aly was certainly a true friend to not only
the general assembly and this state government, but to the veterans and
that's where our concentration is today.  And Mr. President I commend
this resolution to the members of the body and the memory of Zeb Aly and
in honor of all of our veterans here today.  [Speaker changes] Thank you
senator.  Any further discussion?  Bearing none, the question is for the
senate is the passage of senate resolution 809. [Speaker changes] Mr.
President. [Speaker changes] Senator Davis what purpose here lies?
[Speaker changes] To just speak briefly on the bill. [Speaker changes]
Senator Davis you have the floor. [Speaker changes] I think it's
important for us to recognize all of our veterans, those who have
served.  But I do want to pause, and say, I was wondering if I should,
but I think it's appropriate to stand to our disabled veterans, those
who are reminded everyday, of the service the sacrifice, the pain, the
scars of battle, especially to our disabled veterans, we continue to say
thank you for your service and thank you for what you endure for us.
Speaker changes] Thank you senator.  Any further discussion? Hearing
none.  The question for the senate is the passage of senate resolution

Everybody's in. Forty seven having voted the affirmative, and zero in

The floor of the Senate please stand and be recognized. Thank you for
your service to America. Senator Apadak is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President I believe the next bill will be Senate bill 786, energy
modernization act. I move rules be spend it to the end of Senator Rucho
may have staff join him on the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My objection,
Sir ordered. Senator Harditil has a leave of absence for the remainder
of this session. Also, upon the motion of Senator Newton and Bryant of
Wilson county. The chair is happy to extend courtesies of the gallery to
Wilson North Carolina chamber dynamic leadership program. If your with
us from that program today please stand and be recognized. Thank you so
much for being with us. So, at this time Senators were going to move
into the remainder of calendar public bills, second reading roll call
bill Senate bill 786; the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate bill
786 energy modernization act. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President thank you and members of the
senate. Yesterday, we had both in commerce and finance a rigorous debate
and also discussion and questions regarding senate bill 786 energy
modernization act. This bill is a continuation of our process to make
North Carolina energy independent, to diversify our economy into the oil
and gas service industry. And what that does ladies and gentlemen it is
will promote economic, stimulate economic growth and create many good
jobs beyond the 220,000 we've created up to this point. I will go
through briefly with each of the items that are of top priority so that
what we can do is continue our chance to better understand this bill. It
is a very important bill. And we will be able to respond to any
questions subsequently. First part is on section one, where we did
change the date. That allows the mining and energy commission an
opportunity to have some additional time if need be, to January 1st of
2015. To allow them to do the proper due diligence and providing us with
the safe and efficient rules and regulations that will be the best in
the entire country and North Carolina will be proud of them. Second, we
will talk about some A.P.A regulation changes that basically allow for a
process of changing certain the time schedule from legislative date to
calendar days so that we can expedite the process and allow a little
more efficiency in that sense. Well also talk about, in section 2f were
exempting fiscal notes so that well have an opportunity to and again
there is a date certain or a sunset of December 31st so that the oil and
gas commission will have the opportunity to move forward as they make
the decisions in managing Shell Gas exploration and development in North
Carolina. The, part 3 section 3a, there is a date certain that has been
established. And as we were discussing yesterday, what this does, it
authorizes the department of energy, excuse me of environment and
natural resources and the M.E.C which is the Mining and Energy
Commission to issue permits for</p>

<p id="020:00">
Oil and gas exploration, development, production, etc., including
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. What this does is it
establishes a date certain so that what many of the businesses or
industries that are looking to come to North Carolina to help us develop
our energy resources, will know how to plan for the future. And what
this does is it gives them an opportunity to make, to prepare themselves
for the investment in our state.
Going on to Section, or Part 4, there will be, since the Mining Energy
Commission will have achieved its goals early in '15, then we will have
established a North Carolina Oil and Gas Commission. These are the
people that don't do the due diligence and planning the rules. But these
are the ones who will help us implement the process if that those rules
have been established.
We will also restore the mining commission back to its original purpose
of overseeing the mining in the state of North Carolina.
Section 8, we have established what is a trade secrets. And there are a
lot of folks that are saying, wow, trade secrets. We have trade secrets
in the state of North Carolina all the time. And under the circumstances
there was a procedure for them to be managed. Whether you're talking
about trade secrets in products liabilities and the like, and also under
oil and gas trade secret protection. It's just a requirement that is
there, but we do have a process to store, safeguard and make available
trade secrets upon any point during an emergency situation, so that the
first responders, the police in that area and/or any medical staff will
be able to know exactly what is going on and will be able to have access
immediately upon request.
Section 9 talks about the landowner will be responsible for providing
the survey if there is any type of dispute. And it takes the state out
of that, primarily because that will be a battle between the individual
and/or any type of neighbor or any kind of driller in that sense.
The Section 11, when there is a fee for drilling. That fee from the DENR
actually is there to pay for the paperwork and all that's necessary for
that one piece, roughly two-acre plot for the drilling to occur and that
first fee was set at $3,000. And then talking subsequently with
administration and the like, we found that $1,500 of additional for
every other well beyond that point. So the first well is $3,000
permitting fee and any one beyond that would be $1,500. Since the work
has already been done, there's no reason to have to pay a higher price
for redoing the same work on that site.
We also are clarifying monitoring of the water quality. This has always
been a key part of this and I will tell you that Chairman Womack of the
Mining and Energy Commission and his MEC, Mining and Energy Commission
members, have done a remarkable job over the last two-plus years in
putting together the rules and regulations that will safeguard shale gas
exploration and development in North Carolina. And again, as I mentioned
earlier, will lead to North Carolina being energy independent. And that
can't do anything but to help our businesses and small families survive
in or state even at a higher level.
But Section 13 clarifies the area to monitor water quality. And what we
did establish is a one-mile diameter from the well site, which is half a
mile radius, which is the strictest size of actual radius in the
country. It's second,it's actually the strictest. Pennsylvania was at
2,500 feet and we'll be about 2,600 and some change. So what that does
is it allows for monitoring of the quality of water during the entire
drilling process, to make sure that there is no contamination and this
will help safeguard our environment.
Again, a continuation of 13, there is a requirement that any type of
information that is received on the water quality must go to DENR within
30 days, and also to.</p>

adjacent property owners as a matter of sharing the information. There
were a couple of good things that were done in addition and what was
accomplished so that there will be no misunderstanding is the rules that
are set by the state of North Carolina and built on science and safety
within the environment and ?? are the rules that we will all live with
and they can’t be exceeded by local rules. It also prevents waste water
from being injected back through waste water wells. The way the MEC has
established it, all the waste water products will go back and be
recycled to be reused again which is a very efficient process of doing
so. Another area that we’re talking about is providing noise abatement
as we reduce the sound from what would be natural gas compressor
stations which will also improve the environment surrounding that kind
of activity. The other part that we were able to activity during our ??
visit to Arkansas, and we used a number of their very good suggestions
included in our rules and regulations and also on this legislation, is a
bad actor provision. Now what that means ladies and gentlemen is the
fact that other companies, drilling companies alike have been working
elsewhere in the country and they may not have abided by safety rules,
they may not have paid their bills, they my not have abided by
environmental laws and like, and part of the DENR process in evaluating
whether a permit should indeed be issued is that if you are a bad actor
that is a reason not to allow you not to receive a permit in North
Carolina. We only want the top quality drillers in this state so that
whatever we do will be done the right and the safe way. There’s always a
provision that seismic serving cannot be considered trespassing because
it never really impacts the local property owner’s lands. Sections
seventeen through nineteen parts six is the severance tax. Now what that
is, you can see the chart before you talking about oil and gas
condensates, marginal gas, and gas in general. The first years ’15 to
‘18 an incentive to convince and to entice drilling to occur in North
Carolina so we can indeed find out exactly what we have in North
Carolina and that is if you don’t drill you won’t know just the quality
of the oil and gas, and actually natural gas and condensates. So it is
an incentive to say come here and you can get  a cheaper cost on taxes,
but then you see in ’19 and ’20 and so forth all the way out beyond
2023, that tax increases and is going to be based on the price of
natural gas which is a sliding scale that will be very beneficial to the
state of North Carolina as we receive revenues and as this industry is
growing. The remaining parts were dealing with studies and the studies
that were part, and this is an additional effort to try to better
understand exactly what we will be doing in planning for the development
once we can drill and identify the natural gas reserves we have there,
you can’t bring it to the marketplace without transmission lines and all
the other things that will be necessary for that kind of activity to
actually generate the good quality jobs and the like. So we’re studying
what type of infrastructure is going to be required to accomplish how we
would do it but there’s no way of knowing exactly where it is until you
know where you have the natural gas reserves so it’s just a planning
phase and that’s why it’s a study. We are also studying the feasibility
of an LNG port and another very important part and we experienced that
in Pennsylvania when we were there if and what effect that kind of
traffic and transportation pressures will have on the traffic
infrastructure in the area that the drilling is occurring and we have
the Department of Transportation and DENR..</p>

Help us determine what steps need to be taken to be sure those road
infrastructures are protected along with our bridges. I believe that
that probably takes care of the significant parts of the bill, and I
will ask members of the committee to pay close attention and to go on to
the MEC, Mining and Energy website. And this is a copy, hard copy of all
of the, there’s roughly 120 rules and 103 pages of what has been worked
on by Chairman Womack and the Mining and Energy Commission. I urge you
to read it. It’s public knowledge. It’s there. And my understanding is
that each of those are nearly unanimous from the entire commission as to
how these rules were approved. The process will continue, and once they
finish the rules, it is turned over to the Rules Review Commission who
will go through the rules, make sure that they’re in compliance, and
then subsequently turn it over to the General Assembly sometime after
January, 2015. I urge members of the committee, public to spend some
time looking and reviewing these. These will be the actual perfect
example of what rules and regulations in shale gas exploration and
development for the entire country. We were able to use people’s good
ideas. We were able to find the mistakes they made. And we put North
Carolina in the position where we can avoid or minimize any risk in any
manner.
Mr. President, I believe I’ve reviewed the bill. I’ve talked about the
rules and regulations that are there. And I would be willing to answer
any questions. I have some staff to assist me on any legal issues. And
then subsequently, I know Senator Newton and Senator Brock would like to
add a few comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Is there any discussion or debate? Senator Newton,
what purpose ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, we’ve been at this process for
quite some time. North Carolina began investigating the possibility of
developing our energy resources through shale development before I was
elected. I was elected in 2010. Governor Perdue looked at this issue. I
believe she even took a trip to Pennsylvania to check it out. As I
recall, her Administration concluded that we could develop our shale
resources here in North Carolina safely and responsibly and that it
would be a good thing to do. When I was elected in 2010, beginning in
2011 with Senator Rucho and others in the chamber, we began the process.
We legalized horizontal drilling. We legalized hydraulic fracturing. And
we began the course of what we needed to do to put in place a modern,
regulatory system to make sure that if we’re going to develop these
resources, that we do it safely and responsible, so that our citizens,
so that these pages and their families, so that our economy would grow.
Now, colleagues, all across this nation, wells are being drilled and
have been for more than a decade. Millions and millions and millions of
dollars of economic activity have been occurring in states like
Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio,
Colorado, Oklahoma. Oh, yeah, Texas, North Dakota. I read a story in the
Wall Street Journal not long ago about one of the only stores that Home
Depot was going to open anywhere in the country, because they weren’t in
an expansion mode, was going to be in North Dakota. And that was a very
tiny town with no population. I wish I’d a brought it with me today, but
I didn’t. And you wouldn’t think they’d put a Home Depot store there in
the middle of nowhere. And the reason was because that was where the
action was. That’s where the activity was. That’s where people wanted to
buy for their homes and their home improvements. That was where they
needed a store. And North Carolina, unfortunately, has missed out on
some of that because we have been very deliberate. We’ve been very
steady in our progress towards making sure that we are ready to develop
our shale resources. So, after almost four years of work, and it’ll be
close to five years by the time permitting would be authorized under
this bill, we</p>

Note:  I also used &quot;??&quot; for words/names that I was unsure of.
. . . ready to have the jobs come to North Carolina.  My colleagues have
heard me say it before, and I will say it again.  North Carolina needs
the jobs, and America needs the energy, and I’ll add something to that.
I’d certainly rather buy the energy from my fellow North Carolinians
than from some other country.  I’d much rather send my money to Lee
County or wherever it is that they found the Shell gas here in North
Carolina than in some of those countries that we read about in the
papers  and on the news that don’t like us so much.
I’d whole?? lot?? rather see new millionaires in Lee County than
gazillionaires in Saudi Arabia.  I challenge my colleagues who – who
question whether or not we should do this.  Those of us – those that we
have heard in the media – tell us time and time again how the – how the
world is going to come to the end, and we’ll never be able to drink a
clean glass of water again if we allow this to go forward.
That’s simply not the case in the other states around this country.
Other states have figured out how to do it.  After four years, we have
slowly and carefully proceeded through this process to create a modern
regulatory regime to make sure that this state will do it safely for the
benefit of our citizens.
This bill is one of the final steps in this process.  This bill will
ensure that we have these rules that Senator?? ?? referred to – the 120
rules that the MEC?? has been working on for years now that I think only
one of them had one opposing vote.  I believe all the rest of the rules
passed unanimously.  These rules that – that ensure the rules themselves
– ensure that we have full disclosure of what the compounds are,
requiring that these mixtures be disclosed to Frat?? Focus??  I believe
that is – I have it here in front of me – Proposed Rule 15ANCAC05H.1601
– Chemical Disclosure Requirements.  Go online and read it.  It’s a
pretty good set of rules.
We’ve had the opportunity to look at what other states have done for
years.  We've had the opportunity to look at the mistakes that they’ve
made and the things that they’ve learned, and North Carolina is in a
great place because we didn’t have to make those mistakes.  We didn’t
have to have those learning pains.  We were able to look at everybody
else and say, “that’s good for North Carolina.”  That’s what we need to
do in North Carolina.  That’s what’s going to protect our people and
bring us jobs.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for us to move forward.  It is time for
us to move beyond talk.  It is certainly past time for us to move beyond
the lies, the made-up facts, the “sky is falling” mentality.  It is
certainly time to move beyond the folks who want to turn the lights off.
 It is time for us to acknowledge that as my good colleague, ?? Tucker,
pointed out in committee yesterday, this technology has been around
since the 70’s.  It’s time for us to move into a modern energy economy,
and it is long since past time for this state to get into the energy
business.
I commend the bill to you.  I urge your support, and as Senator??  ??
has said, I stand ready to answer your questions.  Thank you.

Working in the process for a long time, we’ve heard and – talked to me
about – or I’ve talked to y’all about – my family that came to North
Carolina to set up the first ?? in Lincoln County because of the energy
and what energy means to economic development.
But when we’re looking at this bill, one reason why I was very
interested in it is where I live – where my family lives, maybe not –
not on the property where we think it might be, my – my area, my
district, or people I go to church – people I go to church with, my
community, people I see on an everyday basis, and I’ll look at them
eye-to-eye about how will we craft legislation, how the rule process
will go through to make sure we will make this as safe as possible.  And

With this slow deliberate process that we did in North Carolina we did
not have the growing pains as other states. Arkansas had over a hundred
whales in the ground before they started the rule process. We're way
ahead of that, way ahead of that and we've looked at Pennsylvania, all
the other states, we're getting to the game really late but you know
what we're not going to have the missteps they did. You know as far as
our dependency upon foreign sources of fuel, of what we could do here in
North Carolina, what it would do to us if we ran more pipelines through
the state, how it would help our military installations at Camp  Lejeune
and Fort Bragg. We've got transmission line that goes right up through

industries can latch onto natural gas, cut their fuel cost, cut their
operation cost. I talked to one farmer, he said if he had natural gas
his energy consumption would drop by two hundred thousand dollars per
year. Imagine that would do with our IT companies we have in this state
where some of our data farms pay almost a million dollars a month in
energy bills, a million dollars a month of how we can drop the price,
how we become competitive. A paper I wrote in college how economic
develop follows cheap energy or low cost energy, this is it. This is how
we get there and it's interesting we look at economic development and we
look at all the incentives and all the packages we try to lure industry
into the state and they always say the crown jewel to get, one of the
big factories to get is an automobile plant manufacturing facility. Now
I've got freightliner in my district and when we had the trucks rolling
out before the EPA regulations on sulfur engines, it was fantastic and
an automobile plant is a billion dollar investment by the automobile
companies. When we were in Arkansas there were boys out there who said
'You know what about the automobile plant, that's what you're after,
every state's after it. It's a billion dollar investment'. Do you know
how much was invested by the companies last year for natural gas at
Arkansas? A billion dollars. We get our automobile plant every year. Now
we went through some really rough times and we're slowly getting out of
them. Now Senator Hartsell's not here right now but when I first came to
Raleigh one of the first meetings I had was over at the commerce
building that the largest layoff in state history was happening in our
districts. I had family in that plant and already went through an
economic depression, the economic textbook version of our economy was a
depression. Textiles, tobacco, and furniture were going, going, gone.
But looking at what we have now, the opportunity we have and a way to do
it in a safe way, this will start bringing the jobs here and those
people we've reached out to across this nation and all these different
areas we're way ahead of it, we're already doing it in our community
college program. So when they come in to start the process it's not just
people from other states, North Carolinians are working here. Arkansas
said we saw people coming right across the border from Texas, we're
going to have North Carolinians here as well working. I urge you to vote
for the bill and let's get North Carolina to be first in economic
development.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Hunt what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Hunt has ?? to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. President. First let me say I do like the
bill. I like the energy independence that it's going to bring us but we
want to have the absolute best bill that we can have. The question I
have, and I don't need an answer on the floor today because it's
apparently very complicated. The question I have is are binding
capacities sufficient to guarantee to safety of these whales? When I
read the bill I just have difficulty quantifying what is the binding
amount.</p>

So, as old Monte family hasn’t do that I can tell you I wouldn’t had a
contractor that didn’t have a performers mind, the performers mind is
cheap that if you, if the developers and if the contractor in this case
the driller don’t do his job he is got the financial aware with it to
come in there and clean up, if he does that chance make a miss. Also,
binding companies would do, a lot of do diligence for you, they would
not write them on if somebody is not qualified, they hadn’t got
experience they don’t have a background in this. So, between today and
tomorrow I’m gonna be trying to find out similar answers about binding
capacity. You can get a one million dollar bind for $10,000. If you are
qualified in drilling and that’s peanuts and the grand scheme is saying
it’s a drilling these rails and they just seems to me we need to make
sure that we are not passing an opportunity to have the financial
backing that we need if something does go wrong, thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein what purpose you have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have ___[??] amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein forward your amendment is the amendment on the dashboard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amendment is on the dashboard. Members you can pull that up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein moves for amendment bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein has recognized and speaks to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. The provision having to do with the chemical
compounds and the packing fluid it is my strong belief that we should
know, the people should know what those chemicals are. You don’t have to
disclose the formula the relative weightings of those chemicals you just
disclose the ingredients just like on the side of a box of cereal it
take you all the different ingredients that are in that cereal they
don’t tell you how much of each of those ingredients are in there that’s
the secret not what the ingredients are. This bill keeps the people for
knowing what the chemicals in the packing fluid are? My amendment
doesn’t do however with the entire provision it focuses on Subsection B
which is on page 12 lines 5 through 11 and it does a very simple thing,
it gets rid of what is a disproportion of penalty, you all have made a
felony for somebody who discloses the chemical compounds to somebody
even if that person thought that person was entitled for the
information. The only knowing requirement is that the person knows that
they were disclosing it but if they thought they are disclosing it to
somebody who isn’t entitled for that information you made that person
subject to a felony. We have state law and trade secrets, in 24 and 66
it is entirely civil as a consequence, we have got the ___[??]
management article it is a ___, I think this is wholly disproportionate
particularly when this information should be public in the first place.
You are happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any question, discussion or debate for Senator Stein?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator I want to ask about the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ____[??] has forward the debate amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and thank you Senator Stein for your amendment
___[??] College not disport the amendment, if we understand it correctly
if the ___ portions relating to the disclosure of this we are requiring
all the chemicals or solutions that they will be held by the state
geologist. So, there is disclosure, it’s just not a public disclosure in
order to protect the trade secret. And also the rules that I talked
about earlier the rules that the MEC has proposed and we expect to be
come into effect will also require those compounds and solutions to be
put on which is called Fracfocus which is a wide spread depository that
deals with a number of aspects of that. So, this is unnecessary, this
amendment would, it would tend to harm our ability to move forward,
there are certain industries that we all understand what trade practices
are and trade secrets are and a number of companies are concerned that
we put a competitive…

Advantage if those are revealed so I urge you to vote against the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator (??) you are recognized. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator (??) has the
floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton provided
some good insight. The bottom line is that the Mining Energy Commission
and the DENR have had a chance to review this and came up with what is a
very reasonable and safe way to manage a trade secret. The term felony
is also in line with a previous part of the law that in the case that
there is hazardous waste. That kind of provision is there for a felony.
There are areas that I may be as sensitive and are down but the bottom
line is the Mining Energy Commission came up with this. It makes good,
positive sense and it allows us to be able to attract industry here. I’m
sure Senator Stein, with his vast knowledge in organic chemistry and all
the other good things would be well served with all of those chemicals
but the reality is that is available for the first responders, for the
police aid agencies, for the medical teams that will be responsible to
meet that and there will never be a problem with them understanding
exactly what’s involved. I urge the Senate to vote down this amendment
and let’s move this Bill forward. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
further discussion today? Hearing none, question for the Senate is
passage of Amendment One. All in favor vote aye, opposed vote no. Five
seconds will be allowed for the voting and the clerk will record the
vote. Bingham, Bingham no. Seventeen having voted in the affirmative and
twenty-nine in the negative. The amendment fails. The Bill is back
before the body. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, what purpose (??) [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the
Bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick has the floor. Speak to the
Bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have heard a lot today about the need for us
to move forward expeditiously in issuing permits to go, for someone go
out in our countryside with cracking crews and begin cracking right
away. But I think if you were to ask the average North Carolinian what
they thought, they would tell you that they would want you to be
cautious, deliberate, thoughtful, and make certain that when rules are
adopted relating to cracking in this state that it protects our clean
drinking waters, that it protects our environment. Many of us have seen
the stories and documentaries about fracking up in Pennsylvania and
other places where they go in there to someone’s home and they turn on
the faucet you see flames coming out sometimes. Flames coming out,
that’s not what I want to see in North Carolina. I don’t want to see
that in anybody’s well. I don’t want to see that even be a possibility.
If it takes us an extra year to get it right, it’s what we need to do.
We do not need to go out here and establish a drop dead date, July 1,
2015, and say we are going to be issuing permits regardless of whether a
variety of issues have been resolved and addressed fully and completely.
Need a full, complete set of rules, not a partial set of rules. I
commend the commission for adopting the rules they have up until this
time but they just don’t go far enough in addressing a lot of critical
issues that we need to be concerned about. I know there are many people
who I have spoken to who are concerned about the compulsory poling
issue. What’s going to happen to those who don’t want to participate?
There are a lot of people who have looked at this Bill the way it is
drafted right now and they look at the way we are now moving back away
from the commitment that we made just a year ago dealing with the
presumptive liability range for those that might be out there drilling,
pulling it back from 5,000 feet to roughly a half-mile. I understand
that may still be a (??) standard but why back away what we told the
people that we would do. That troubles me. And when I look at the fact
that when you don’t always know the concentration of all these chemicals
that are going to go in to this fracking compound, this fluid that they
are injecting into the earth. Grant it, it may be a trade secret. Grant
it, it may be held by the commission or DENR and be pulled out in case
of emergencies, but one thing we need to know is that</p>

… pretend to be an ecologist because I’m not, but I’m sensitive,
concerned and committed to protecting our environment and making certain
that those pristine drinking waters remain that way and that we don’t
have any flames coming out of faucets, that we don’t have any discharges
into our rivers and streams that are potential pollutants, that we don’t
have any unintended consequences. How many times have we had bills come
back before us that we had to fix because of unintended consequences? It
happens time and time and time and time again. We’ve got a chance to do
it and to do it right. It’s even in the best interest of the industry to
know with some certainty what they’re getting into. You heard Senator
Hunt talk earlier about bonding. That’s an important and significant
consideration. A lot of things we need to do. We don’t need to rush to
judgment, issue a drop-dead deadline, we’re going to issue those permits
regardless of whether we’ve got all these fixes in place. This is one of
those fixes and we can try to work on this one today. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, for what purpose do
you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton has the floor to speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mister President. My good friend Senator McKissick
and I have had conversations about this process of moving forward on
shale gas development, and with all due respect to my colleague, I’m not
sure that there would ever be enough time to satisfy him. We could be
here when my son Thomas over there was elected and we’d still be
debating it, and I think Senator McKissick would be happy because as I
told to him yesterday, there comes a point in time where we have to fish
or cut bait. We’ve been working on this for four years. You’ve raised a
couple of issues about the mythology of the flaming faucets that’s been
debunked a few million times now, and you brought up bonding that
Senator Hunt talked about, and if you will recall, in the last bill that
we had last session, we covered the bonding quite a bit, and we’re going
to satisfy with Senator Hunt that we’re going to make sure it’s done
adequately because we are being very deliberate. I would just generally
hazard a question of if five years isn’t long enough to figure out how
to do it when all the other states in the country are figuring out how
to do it, how long does it take? 100 years? 200 years? Never? Eternity?
This amendment does nothing but delay the process, which is what many
that oppose moving forward on this area want, is to delay. We need to
defeat this amendment. We need to continue the process, the deliberate
process that we’ve had for the last four years, and move forward so that
sometime in 2015, we might have the opportunity to have some jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Newton
will yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, do you
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator
Newton. I’m looking at Senator McKissick’s amendment, and it’s on the
section on prohibited discharge, and there are already three prohibited
discharges and he’s just adding another one where it talks about waste
water that has pollutions in it. How does that delay anything? It just
is adding more protections to the people. It doesn’t delay when the rule
takes effect or when the first issue can be licensed. It’s just looking
out for the people. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, the Mining and
Energy Commission has been working on this for years. They have
addressed this – I’ve forgotten the rule number. They don’t allow the
discharge to surface water under their rules. This amendment is not
necessary. It’s just to continue to talk about an issue that doesn’t
exist. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?
Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to
speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker has the floor
to speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just am recalling last
year. Senator McKissick continues to talk about pristine drinking water,
and we all want pristine drinking water; however, last year I recall
from the Independent Weekly in Durham when the Durham City Council voted
against a fast-track development project because they were concerned
about the runoff in the Jordan River, that it was brought to the Senate
floor and we fast-tracked through the development even at the
disagreement of members of his own party, and so if Senator McKissick’s
worried about the pristine drinking water, we need to worry about it in
both cases even in Lee County and even in your county, Sir. Thank you.

none, the question before the Senate is the adoption of Amendment…</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ?? moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McClaren, you are recognized to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, this is a very simple
amendment. It would be to delete Section 14 which prohibits local
governments from enacting local ordinances that regulate oil and gas
exploration.  Many of us come from local government backgrounds.  We’ve
been mayors.  We’ve been county commissioners.  We’ve been city council
members and served in local government.  So we know how important it is
that we make good decisions that affect our local communities.  Senator
Rabin just spoke about Lee County that he represents. I couldn’t have
agreed more.  Local people need to be able to make this decision.  But
where it comes to issues that relate to public safety, health, welfare,
the community, I think local governments needs some input in this
process or I would just say that deleting Section 14 would enable these
local governments to be able to have a voice in this process.  If land
use planning is something that in a rural community, for example where
agriculture might be a primary industry, and that’s a concern to that
community, or if it’s a larger city where it’s just not advantageous to
have hydraulic fracking occur, then I think that local government ought
to have input in the process.  That would be amendment I ask you to
support.  Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues and Senator McClaren, I appreciate
your amendment. I would observe that if we are going to have an industry
come and we’re going to embark upon the kind of development of the scale
that we hope will have in North Carolina, we need to make sure that we
have a uniform approach to this and not a patchwork of local ordinances
and zoning, specifically zoning that would be designed to prohibit the
activity in the first place. Senator McClaren and I, we worked on this
together, and I know he’s generally a supporter of moving forward on
developing our energy resources.  We have had the benefit of doing a lot
of examination in Arkansas of events and so forth there. One of the
things, unfortunately he was not with us then, we went to Texas and we
examined how this was done…</p>

to handle it just fine.  It’s important that if we’re going to encourage
this development that we do so in a uniform manner. This is a mirror
image of how we deal with hazardous waste and so forth.  We need to make
sure that we’re handling this as a state in a very uniform and even
manner so that we don’t have one system a mile away from a different
system.  The industry needs to know what the rules are and they need to
know who to go to in order to be told what it is they need to do to make

Senator Woodard for what purpose do you rise?

To see if Senator Newton would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, in reviewing your bill, I’m trying to find a little more
about compulsory poolling.  Can you direct me to the sections that speak
to that and help me understand a little more of what this bill’s
position on compulsory polling would be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s a study, Senator Woodard.  I believe it’s section 25.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And you’re leaving it at that with this bill then?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
???
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ask your question again, I’m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What I see in section 25 is the extent of how compulsory pooling is
going to be addressed under practice of fracking in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At this stage, right now it’s the current law of North Carolina.  It has
been since 1945. We have compulsory pooling so we’re going to study it
further to see if there’s any further changes that need to be made.
Ok, alright. Make I speak to the bill, Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Actually, Mr. President, I have an amendment I would like to offer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Woodard, if you can send your amendment forward. The clerk will

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Woodard moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Woodard is recognized to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had a chance to visit with my Farm Bureau Board of Directors in Castle
County last night and we were talking about a few farming issues and
asked them what was on their minds. They said two things.  Coal ash,
which we will be talking about in the next few weeks here, I suspect,
and fracking.  It’s in the 6 o’clock news.  One part of fracking they
were most concerned about was compulsory pooling.  And we had an
interesting and actually in-depth conversation about the property rights
around compulsory pooling.  I’ve got to say as I read this, it’s pretty
thin and it really moves things down the road.  This bill, as presented,
breaks the promise that was made in 2012 to fully develop rules
governing the practice of fracking. On this issue, this bill kicks the
can down the road by asking for more study around compulsory pooling.
Senator Newton in his introductory remarks called the rules a pretty
good set of rules. Ladies and gentlemen, they are incomplete set of
rules. The sponsors are asking you to step on the gas when we only have
three wheels on the car. Landowners need to know their property rights
and how these rights will be impacted by the practice of fracking before
the fracking crews show up with their drills, before the fracking crews
construct seven-story towers and 5000 foot long pipes under their
property.  Before the fracking crews start driving heavy trucks up and
down their rural roads.  This amendment helps define that compulsory
pooling and helps not kick the can down the road and helps us complete
that.  So I would urge your support of this amendment on compulsory
pooling.   Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho has the floor
to speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Woodward apparently
didn’t see before, but this is your rules and regulations, Senator
Woodward. They’re available to you on the MEC website. Read it and it
would be very helpful. Secondly, as Senator Newton alluded to, in 1940s,
common law has the pooling law in place, and the law is presently there,
and what we’re in the process of doing is as we proceed forward, this
will be how we start. If it requires any additional changes once we
start the process then it can be adjusted accordingly. There are 38
states in the United states that have some form of forced pooling and
we’re in line with most of them, so in reality what we’re saying is the
law is there, we will evaluate as we proceed forward to determine if
indeed we need to try and alter any of the forced pooling law that we
presently have under common law, and if it’s needed then the MEC and the
resulting Oil and Gas Commission will make those recommendations to the
General Assembly, but under the existing law, the MEC has come forward
with a plan, the DENR said “Well it might not be workable by changing
what we presently have,” so we do have a workable law in place, we’re
going to go forward with it, all the safeguards are in place that need
to be for what would be allowing everyone that would be involved in the
acreage  to enjoy and share in the prosperity that will come of it, and
that is how it is designed and that is how it will be moved forward. And
again, if need be, it can be changed upon recommendation from the body
that will evaluate its effectiveness. I urge you to vote down the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?
Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the adoption of

question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, do you yield? [SPEAKER

Rucho, you’ve told us several times you’ve read all the rules from front
to back and I trust you for that, and I haven’t read them and I’ll
disclose in front of everybody I don’t intend to read them, so I will
ask you the question I’ve got. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And Sir, I hope I have
an answer that will satisfy you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much.
I’ll trust your answer. You have mentioned that the state geologist will
be the keeper of this proprietary chemical information, and I can
appreciate the fact that these companies would want it kept proprietary,
sort of like Coca Cola doesn’t want you to know what they make it out
of, although it was interesting to read today that it will clean your
tires, it will get grease out of dry-cleaning… Coca Cola does a lot of
things for you. But my question is this: Does the state geologist have a
responsibility to report if he reviews these chemicals – and I’m not
talking about after there’s been a problem; I’m talking about when he
receives them from company XYZ – if he sees something that concerns him
in that cocktail, has he got any responsibility – not a moral but a
responsibility to report that back to the Commission, or does he only
open up the envelope to see what the cocktail’s made out of after
there’s been a problem? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jenkins, all I can say
is when the geologist as part of the DENR, and the emergency management
people who will in advance see this and be able to determine if indeed
they suspect a problem, their avenue would be go directly to the Mining
and Energy Commission or subsequently the Oil and Gas Commission with
any of their concerns. Nothing prohibits them from going forward and
asking for clarification. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah but you say that
nothing prohibits them, but are they responsible? Do they have a
responsibility to report it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just checking with our
staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And what was the staff’s answer? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And the staff’s decision on the legal issues… I never made it
to be a real lawyer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, so you didn’t read it all
either. Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The custodian under the law is the
geologist, but he really is…</p>

… under the jurisdiction of the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources and the Mining and Energy Commission. There are a lot of very
knowledgeable people on there. When they get a chance to review that
material and if they determine there’s a problem, that’s where the
action will take place. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jenkins, if you’ll
address further questions to the Chair please, and then we’ll… [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Another question, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, do
you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Then they do have a
responsibility to report something that they are concerned about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Either to report it and… they will be the recipient of
that information and it will be stored by the geologists, so in reality,
if they found anything there, as they did, with any of the procedures
informing these rules and regulations that have been established, they
will either take action through the rules process in or directed to the
General Assembly for concerns that they may have. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President, follow-up question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jenkins
has a follow-up question for Senator Rucho. Do you yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Would you agree to a friendly amendment that would make it a
mandate that they have to report any concern they have instead of leave
it up to their discretion as to whether they do want to report? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Having spoken with my attorney, the Mining and Energy
Commission would be the appropriate group to take action on it. They
will have received that document and it is nothing more than stored
under the jurisdiction of the geologists, so they would be responding,
as they did to any information they had as they formulated the rules. If
the saw problems in there, they would have taken corrective actions that
would have been there. So the DENR and the MEC would have taken that
action. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I give up, Mister President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock, your light is on. We’ll go with you.
Senator Clark, make sure you just press your button so I know. Senator
Brock. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the Bill a second time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Brock has the floor. Speak to the Bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Senate, under the rules of the
Commission, if you take a look at the rules, page 74 – if not, there’s
been much made about what’s in it, at the side of a, I wish you would
say Cheerwine or Pepsi, a North Carolina product can, rather than a Coca
Cola. I mean it’s a fine drink but it came out of Georgia, so please use
one of our North Carolina products. But if you look at what it says, it
says a notification shall include the safety data sheet for each
chemical and the following information: anticipated quantity, mass or
volume, method of containment, chemical classification, and towards the
commencement of well stimulation activities, a complete list of all base
fluids and additives to be used in well stimulation activities, unless
it’s a trade secret, and a trade or common name of each chemical subject
to the safety data sheet, the CAS registry number, the range of
anticipated concentrations by mass or volume, and the mixture for each
chemical and the purpose of each chemical mixture that will serve in the
well stimulation process. That’s exactly what you read on the side of a
can of Cheerwine or any other soft drink that you choose to partake in.
The information’s there, it’s in the rules. Then you see they’ve done a
very good job of being very thorough, very safe, into making sure that
we make this the safest process in all of our country. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Walters,
for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator Brock a
question please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock, do you yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] By all means. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock, you mentioned
the material data sheets, and I assume everyone that’s in business today
understands that you have to have a material data sheet on any vehicle
that you have, where you can anything from grease, fuel, antifreeze,
it’s required by OSHA. Well these well drillers have to have that same
information. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, it’s just like…</p>

<p id="085:00">
The answer, Mister President. It’s just not the recipe for it. You see,
if you look at the ingredients on the side of a can, you see the
ingredients, but just not the recipe of how to make it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock, do you yield for a
follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So just for
clarification for me, Senator Brock, you’re saying that they will have
to have on those vehicles or those trucks they’re transporting or on
those jobsites, anybody could walk up, ask for their material data sheet
and they would have to produce that, and what chemicals or whatever else
they may have, it’s on that side? I think that’s a state law in North
Carolina now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I will say one thing. Working on a
site as activists, they are, as the ones we saw in Arkansas, you will
see something that’s a very dangerous site, somebody moving parts there,
but one thing that is is that the chemical status are disclosed through
the state geologists, local emergency management. They know what’s there
in case if there ever is any type of incident, we know how to take care
of it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Last follow-up, Mister President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Brock, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And I hear you and you’re defining that scope with geologists
and other folks, but are we defining that for the local law enforcement,
OSHA inspectors and the like? Would they also be available? Would the
information be available to them? [SPEAKER CHANGES] All this information
is available now and actually is available in other states. There is a
public database and it’s available. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clark has the floor to speak to the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President, I’d like to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clark, you can send forward your amendment.
Can we have a page get the amendment from Senator Clark, please? Bring
it up to the front up here please. Give us one second, Senator Clark. If
we can get this… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, Mister President. Folks,
clearly… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clark, hold on one second. We need to
get it scanned in, need to make sure it shows up on the dashboard. Is it
on the dashboard? It is on the dashboard. The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Clark moves to amend the Bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark is recognized to speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly I support energy exploration and I support bringing more jobs
to the state of North Carolina, but the concern with hydraulic
fracturing for a lot of folks across North Carolina is ensuring that our
water is safe to drink, making sure the proper protections are made and
that they have some sense of surety that frequent testing is done to
ensure that the water quality remains good, and that’s what this
amendment is all about. Miss Lane, could I get the graphic up please?
Now one thing that we’ve often heard is we’ve heard that North Carolina
has some of the most stringent requirements in terms of water quality
for any state out there in the nation that’s doing hydraulic fracturing.
Well it depends on what you mean when you say that. If you’re talking
about the required distance from the well head up to which you will
test, it’s true that we have the most stringent requirements. As a
matter of fact… is that graphic up yet? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clark,
excuse me one second. Just for your information, the supplemental
document you’re asking to be presented is not on the dashboard. It’s not
able to get it up here, so if you want to keep speaking to this, that’s
fine. Go right ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, so we know that under the
statute Senate Bill 786, what we’re asking is that the water quality be
tested and water sources out to 2,600 feet, okay? Now that is by far the
most of any state out there in the nation, okay? Now however, when you
look at other aspects of ensuring water quality, we don’t come up to
snuff. So for instance, if you look at the Illinois public law, they
have some additional measures that I think that we should come up to in
the state of North Carolina. For instance, both of us do require testing
of the water source prior to engaging in hydraulic fracturing; however,
when it comes to who’s doing the testing, things change. Okay, in the
state of Illinois, they require an independent third party to do the
testing. In the state of North Carolina, based on Senate Bill 786, we
make that an option. I think we should make it mandatory that the
testing of the water be done by an independent third party. Furthermore,
we only test, according to Senate Bill 786, we will test post-start of
the fracking operation twice in a 24 month period.</p>

<p id="090:00">
I don't quite think that is often enough. If we look at what the state
of Illinois is doing, they're testing four times during that 24-month
period. Furthermore, they specifically stated that they're going to test
at the 6-month point, the 12-month point, the 18-month point, and the
24-month point. Our Senate Bill 786 says we will test two times during
the 24-month period. Does that mean we can go almost two years and wait
till month 21 in order to do the testing?
I think we owe it to our citizens to test more frequently. Now that is
the discussion with ?? a couple of days ago and the conversation went
down a somewhat uncomfortable road. And she made the statement, she
said, well, that made me feel some kind of way.
When you're in your kitchen, when the citizens of North Carolina are
there and they turn on that tap, and they put that water into that
glass, and they put that glass up to their lips, I don't want them to
feel some kind of way. I want them to have confidence that the water
they're drinking, not only was it safe when the hydraulic fracturing
started, but it continues to be safe.
I would recommend that we test at a more frequent rate than what we're
currently going to do based on Senate Bill 786. I urge you to support
this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to thank Senator Clark. He's been a real good
committee member on our joint energy policy committee and we thank him
for that.
I think, at this point, we have depended on professionals with MEC to
determine the best way to do this. And what they did say was they had to
have one testing prior to any drilling activity and at least two, at
least two follow up tests during the 24-month period. It doesn't
preclude them, the MEC, who has the authority, to request more as they
deem necessary. And under the circumstances, why wouldn't we allow the
professionals to determine what would be necessary and in the best
interest of the citizens of that area?
Chairman Womack happens to be from Lee County and he's not about to let
anything bad happen to his community, where his is a county
commissioner. In reality, that would be one reason not to support this.
Secondly is the fact that when you have someone paying for this testing,
they say a third party, generally the oil and gas operators will accept
the financial responsibility and should accept the responsibilities for
that testing. Could be done by a third party, but you shouldn't preclude
the independent or the oil and gas from helping to participate in what
is part of the activity that they are contributing to.
And the last part dealing with the requirement on a website. That
information is within the ENR, MEC, oil/gas and the property owner. They
should be able to determine, indeed, if there's any problems, that
they'll get rectified. And be sure that if, indeed, an accident did
occur, that that property owner would be kept whole.
And with all of that being said, Mr. President, I would say that we
would vote down this amendment and move forward. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate?
Senator McLaurin, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you want to speak to the amendment or to the bill?
We haven't voted on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We're on the floor for the amendment now. No, I just
support the amendment. I think the water supplies are crucial. And I
think it's important that we take steps as we move through this process
to be sure that citizens across our state feel very comfortable that
we're doing everything possible to make sure that that water quality is
safe. That drinking water is pristine as it can be and that we're all
not in any way doing something to damage our drinking water. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate?
Senator Bryant, to what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant has the floor to speak to the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, members, I also want to stand in
support of this amendment. I think it's a reasonable approach to
reassure our citizens about the safety of their drinking water given
current experiences people are having with concerns about water quality
and water safety. And I think the standards set in this amendment are
very reasonable and would, I think, reassure a lot of folks, so I
support the amendment. Thank you.

Mr. President?
??? Please rise.
Thank you very much. Just briefly to speak on the bill.
Senator McLarin[sp?] you have the floor to speak on the bill.
Thank you again, Mr President, members of of the Senate. We've had some
good discussion today  and for many of us, many of you, I think in the
chamber, it's a clear-cut decision where we're going with this bill
today. Many support hydraulic fracturing because it could lead to
high-paying jobs and millions of dollars in revenue for our state. Who
could be against that? Over half the states in our country allow
hydraulic tracking to occur, and let me start by saying I'm not
anti-fracking. I've been a part of the petroleum and energy industry for
the past 34 years. You can look it up, it's public information on my
statement of economic interest. I own stocks in oil companies. I'm proud
to have worked in that industry for many many years. It's helped build a
better America and we're far less dependent on foreign oil now because
of energy exploration across our country. But I also have to share this
with you, last night this bill, it kept me awake, thinking about what's
best for our state, what's best for the industry, what's best for the
constituents I represent back home, and certainly for our local
governments. If we're going to protect North Carolina for future
residents, we've got to make sure we have a clear policy that recognizes
local government's authorities after the best interest of their
community. I spoke about that a moment ago. Local government control and
input is a conservative principle. We must also find resolution on
issues like water quality and we've talked about that some today,
property rights, certainly is an issue that has been discussed here
today. Infrastructure needs, cost, and look beyond the uncertain dollar
signs to provide safeguards for our drinking water and our land for the
future, and for our children and grandchildren. And I believe we can do
this. And I believe we can do it safely. And it's certainly in our best
interest, and it's certainly in the industry's best interest to do that.
I've learned just this week that there's a earthquake fault line in one
of the counties that I represent. We've heard today legitimate questions
from Senator Jenkins, Senator Walters about maybe some issues that
haven't been completely worked out yet. I know we're still working on
that, but these are legitimate issues, and we should always err on the
side of caution, I believe.  I traveled to Arkansas this past year,
Senator Newton mentioned that. I didn't realize we'd been working on it
for a year, Senator Newton. I've been here a year and a half, and I
certainly didn't expect things to start when I got here, but I know that
a lot of work and study by staff , by the Mine and Energy Commission has
gone before my representation here, but I love this state too much for
us to make what could be a hasty decision. I think we need to slow down
and take a step and really make sure we're getting this right. It's so
important for the future of our state, and I hope you'll make the right
decision today, for the future, make the right decision for our
citizens, because, energy independence,yes. Very, very important. But
protection of our land and our water, that has to be our highest
priority. Thank you.
Mr President.

Senator Tarte, ?? your ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill authors a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, do you yield for a question,
from Senator Tarte? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, who's asking that
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tarte. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd be remiss, based on the conversation so far today,
we've all talked about the composition of the cocktail or the chemicals
being used in the list, but I think most of us, or a number of us, may
recognize that arsenic is poisonous, so is selenium, actually in both
directions, if you don't have any, you develop hyperthyroidism, which is
fatal, or potentially fatal, if you have too much, causes brain damage,
which is also fatal. Plus, equally important is the composition, the
actual percentage or amount of each chemical being put together. So, my
question is, does the geologist, besides knowing the actual chemicals,
will they know the percentage that's being used? Because I'm completely
comfortable if that person or that individual knows. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tarte, the geologist is just the keeper of it. It will be
reviewed by the DENR, and they have plenty of scientists and officials
that can manage any questions that they have, and then secondly, what
they have is the Emergency Medical Response Group that will be part of
this, will also have the expertise to determine if indeed there is a
problem. So I don't think there's any concern as far as identifying it
in advance, to respond to Senator Jenkins' question, or if an emergency
arises, the physicians, the first responders, and all of the people that
will need to respond to this emergency or accident, if it does occur,
will be well prepared to manage any of the circumstances. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Foushee, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Foushee has the floor to speak to the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members, I rise to raise concerns
that I share with many in my district and across this great state. But
first, I wish to commend the Mining and Energy Commission for its work
addressing many of the concerns that I think all of us have heard from
constituents in our districts. However, I think it is still safe to say
that threats remain regarding what fracking will bring to our state,
including what we will do with toxic waste water, how to address toxic
air emissions, and protect nearby families, and how to protect property
and families when fracking operations cease, but contamination issues
come up years later. There's too little known about the effects of
fracking, and too much has been done to protect the companies in that
industry from liability should something go wrong. We have all heard
concerns about water quality and quantity. I represent Chatham County.
Chatham County is a rural county that is adjacent to Lee County, that
too often has issues with water quantity. I am concerned for farmers in
western Chatham, who struggle to deal with water problems yearly. Now,
these same farmers fear contamination of that water as well. We know
that fracking uses millions of gallons of water per gas well, per frack,
and a well can be fracked up to 20 times. There are still concerns
surrounding waste water disposal, as this bill does not prohibit waste,
surface discharge. I am concerned also that this bill does not provide
protection for unwilling landowners to have gas extracted from their
property, and has the potential of breaking the bonds of community in
many of our communities. Moreover, ??</p>

As we've already stated, property rights of those not wishing to
participate are violated by compulsory pooling.  Finally, as our
colleague has already stated, this bill is an affront to local
governments, and the communities that they govern.  Counties are charged
with promoting the health, safety and welfare of their residents.
Therefore, they need the authority to protect their residents from the
impacts of fracking.  Local governments know their communities better
than state, and therefore are better equipped to determine how to
provide for their health and safety.  So, I'll end my comments by saying
that until we know more, we are not ready to move forward with this
process.

Thank you.  I'll give the cliff notes since the hour is late. I hope
that all of you took advantage of the free blood pressure checks going
on today.  That's a very good thing to do, and it was nice of the people
who came here from East Carolina and other places to assist us with
that.  And my statement is about high blood pressure resolution.
Hypertension is the primary, or contributing cause for 45% of all
cardiovascular disease deaths, and 45% of all strokes occurring in
hypertensive individuals.  In 2011, 32.4% of North Carolina adults
reported being told that they had high blood pressure at some point in
their lives.  It has been estimated that almost half of Americans with
high blood pressure either do not know they have it, or will have it
adequately controlled.  If hypertension was completely eliminated from
the population, there would be 34.6% fewer cases of stroke, and 17.9%
fewer heart attacks.  Reducing hypertension would not only increase the
quality of life for North Carolinians, but would also substantially
impact health care costs and disability in North Carolina. 7200 Medicaid
enrolled children have a diagnosis of hypertension.  222,400 Medicaid
enrolled adults have diagnosed hypertension. This is 41%</p>
