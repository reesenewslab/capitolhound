Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. To speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. We had a good debate on this yesterday and a
vote was fairly close. I felt objected in the third reading and I
appreciate you all carrying it over till today. I thought everyone could
have some time to think about it. When you look at this bill in its
essence, at a minimum it is confusing to the public as to where they can
go for information. You're going to have some counties that put it on
their local internet sites. You're going to have some that advertise in
the papers, they're going to be all over the place. And I think that's
number one, people ought to know where they can go to get information on
this. The second piece of information I've seen is that in almost every
instance the paper's website attracts more people than does a government
website. I know my way we actually have a government TV station and I
try to avoid…</p>

… all costs and immediately change the channel and as an emergency when
I stumbled over it. Most of you would do the same thing. It’s not a
place you go for information. And when you shake it all down, it’s about
people being able to get information about their government and I – this
is one where we are fixing something that didn’t broken and we are going
to break it and people are going to be less informed and I think will
all be diminished because of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other discussion or debate? Senator Davis, what purpose you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen you have to remember
first and foremost, this is a local bill. And if people are going to be
confused about where they get the information then they are going to be
confused about who their commissioner is. The local government is going
to be in-charge of this and they are going to decide what they are going
to do. It was well spoken last evening that you can leave it the way it
is and put ads in the paper, you can put on the government website or
you can do a combination of the two. And I heard like Senator Kinnaird
who was worried about some of these papers who are going to go out
business because of it. First of all the North Carolina should not be
part of the business model for newspaper in the state. I believe
wholeheartedly in a free press, but that doesn’t mean that is just
newspapers. We have a tendency sometimes I think to think that
newspapers are arbiter of what is true. And I can give you some examples
in the latest edition of the Goldstar Paper, who are – that’s not so. In
this newspaper in an article that was written by in the news of the
Goldsboro Paper, the News-Argus, its Staff Herring said these. He said,
the woman said, she was a clerk of the Committee as essentially the
Chairman's Executive Assistant and Secretary. And what he is referring
to is my Legislative Assistant Kate Culberson was a source of some
information. And the inference in this article is that she was not
telling the truth. And I am here to tell you that what he didn’t say,
that's my Legislative Assistant is my sister and she is not going to lie
for me, she is not going to lie for you, she is not going to lie for
anybody. And this article is riddled with ??. I'm not going to say that
their attorney for the news organization is a liar, but I'm going to
tell you that the truth seems to have escaped him frequently. There are
lot of other things in this bill, they impugned our fellow Senator Tommy
Tucker and attributed comments to him that were not true and you and I
both know that Tommy Tucker doesn’t tolerate fools very well, but he is
an honest man of integrity. And he is going to stay the way – say at the
way it is and some people don’t like that. I find that very refreshing
personally. Also in this article it impugns our Senator Fletcher
Hartsell. It says that he was not here for the vote in the State and
Local Government Committee. I know he was there, because I followed him
from – we were double booked that day. We were in what, Program
Evaluation Committee which he chaired, and we walked back over to State
and Local Government, because we knew that our vote was going to be
important that day. And after the gavel came down and that committee was
recessed Senator Hartsell and I walked back to the other committee. He
was there for the vote. And I'm telling you that if you are going to
believe everything that’s in the newspaper, you are going to be
ill-informed. They had a mission for distorting what happened in that
committee. Well, I believe this is a local bill. We ought to give the
local people the authority to do what they want to do to best serve
their citizens and their local government. They know what's best for
them, we don’t enrollee. And if they choose and I have some, all seven
of my counties wanted to be involved in this. And some municipalities
did not, it’s an option, they can do what they think best serves their
people. And for that reason I'll be voting for this bill, I think you
ought to as well. And also if you believe everything in the paper it
says here that Senator Jim Davis from Greene County, will obviously
facts escape them on that regard. I'm not from Greene County, I'm from
Macon County. I think that was a mistake, Senator Don Davis from Greene
County may think that’s an egregious error. But anyway that you know
that even though we share the same last name, Senator Greene is always
impeccably dressed. Sorry, Senator Davis is always impeccably dressed
and he is half my age…</p>

He has a better tan, and he's of another party, but this just goes to
show you that you cannot believe everything you read in the newspaper.
They get their facts wrong sometimes. And its up to us to discern whats
true ad whats not. Senator Cannere also last evening was concerned about
these newspaper and I would suggest that she have her newspaper contacts
my newspaper and we have two in our district that are free. You're
talking about access for everybody? These are free, all you have to do
is pick them up. And right now this bill that is presently before us
will give us the opportunity to give these people an opportunity to get
those ads, have those ads appear in their newspaper. So i think this
thing does a lot of good things but the main thing that it does, it
gives the local government flexibility and I would commend it to this
day. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate?
