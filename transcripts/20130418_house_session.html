elected body to tax the citizens to pay for the total cost of the bonds,
and the citizens who have to pay for the bonds, are the least informed.

this piece of legislation is that it identifies the time that the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. House Bill 587 is an education reform
bill that is intended to create an unintended consequence. Its objective
is to exempt intellectually disable students, otherwise and officially
referred to in other circles as mildly retarded, from the ACT College
Entrance Exam.  Currently all juniors, with the exception of the
severely intellectually disabled take the ACT. And House Bill 587 seeks
to exempt what would be the 98th and 97th percentile, who have an IQ
between 55 and 70 and who are intellectually disabled, from a college
entry exam that is nowhere near what their curriculum or their god-given
ability is. So with that, these students are almost always put into the.</p>

from my county.  There are many more.  There are some success stories
from these groups; these kids have much to offer. And with that, the one
thing that this bill seeks to do is not to make them endure a test that
absolutely humiliates them, irates [sic] and makes their parents very
mad and oftentimes frustrates educators that ask why do I have to give
this test.  In the process, we spend between 130 and 190 thousand

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the House, this one's a little shorter to discuss.  588 is
another education reform bill that has two objectives.  The first and
primary objective is to make the individualized education plans that we
use to ensure that our disabled students receive the best education with
the least restrictive environment is able to be done better, but also
more efficiently in terms of time by the educators who have to prepare
them.  So with that, it basically directs the state Board of Education
to seek out ways to use technology with drop-down menus, select items,
and such as that to make the forms that are very laborious with a lot of
narrative simpler, shorter, but more thorough. The second part is a very
surgical correction in terms of education reform but also some
regulatory reform. I simply, within the constraints of federal
guidelines, reducing the disadvantaged student reports from two required
per year to one required per year.  These, and others that will follow
in the next couple of weeks, come from a very thorough look by multiple
expertise--subject matter experts in the field of education given inputs
for regulatory reform.  And, I ask you to support 588, please.

you, Mister Speaker, the first all are saying thank you to the bill

amount of work is then placed into it. do something that this General
assembly has talked about for many many sessions me years Bill has eight
parts to it, and no one that is Thursday. I'm not going to go over all
late but I am going to go over the first two parts and talk about the
real red meat of the bill, Mister Speaker, then a few good recognized
arson glazier and other primary sponsors if they choose to speak normal
encrypted, and Glazer go through parts of three through eight and allow
him to come back in touch on the first two parts that I will spend my
time talking about with my minutes,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
the two pieces of this bill that is the real red meat and potatoes that
we've been so interested in for many sessions again as part one into
which deals with issues of tenure and deals with the issues off
alternative pay performance pay merit pay whatever term you choose to
call it will start with partone of the bill, which in my opinion, is the
first attempt for the first real short of parts of the general assembly
of how are we going to get to a performance pay our merit pay model. we
talked about it. we've talked about it. we decided we want to do it. the
problem is that I can figure out how to do it. it's complicated in many
education institutes in things other states who done it is a struggle to
get there. what this bill does is it creates a task force to study
things like performance pay merit pay and compensation in general, and
this will be one of our speaker and be appointed by the president
protem, the Senate age chamber non members, which includes four members
of the legislature. the age group and then stakeholders from the
education community calls it is very important. I believe I have by and
to keep everyone seated at table, working together to try to come up
such a plan, this task force within bring a plan him General assembly
Russ to work with and move forward with us. I hosted a true performance
by plan or the state art through the bill deals with dinner for another
hot subject that we've talked about for video years. it will pardon me,
I'm struggling a bit with allergies less law about sniffles, but the
genuine reform as under current law denier is something that basically
is forever once you achieve it. you've got it. so how does this help us
with our effort to try to make sure we have high performing a very
effective teachers in the classroom. it basically uses the Colorado
model, but acquits it so that it fits in North Carolina and it sends up
a probationary non- probationary status. you currently have in your</p>

<p id="50:00">
...allows you to start out with a non-probationary status. And why is
that important? One, it helps us to allude law suits. We spoke with
staff, when you have tenure, you have a property ownership of something.
And to just strike that away and take it away it would be certain law
suit.This would allow them, who already have it to start out with
non-probationary status. But what's the game changer? The game changer
is you can lose it under this plan. How do you lose it? You lose it by
first... when you are observed by your principal at the school and
you're given a poor observation and they identify a problem, you have
one year to fix it. People go through life situations and things come up
that could cause a person to have a bad year in teaching. It could
happen in any career. but this gives you a chance. One year to fix it,
if it's not fixed you lose your non-probationary status, you then go to
probationary and in this bill we do not change the definition of what a
probationary teacher is. And you can be let go. Making it, having a way
and creating a way in a much easier fashion to get rid of a tenured
teacher. Which we do not have in current law. How do you get to
non-probationary status if you're a beginning teacher? Well, under
current law it takes four years to get tenure status and stand in the
same school system. This bill leaves it, it takes four years to get to
non-probationary status with again the catch is, once you get it it's
not for life.You've got to keep performing. So this is truly, in my
opinion the performance model that we've been asking for. You do well,
you keep non-probationary. You start slippin' up, you've got a year to
fix it, you don't fix it and then the superintendent or the principal
can remove you from the system. Mr. Speaker that's the two heaviest
lifts, in my opinion of this bill. I do have an amendment, but Mr.
Speaker I'd request that you let the other primary sponsors speak if
they so choose. I know Representative Glazier wants to be recognized to
cover the remaining parts of the bill and he may have comments on the
first two sections as well. But after they conclude, if I could be
recognized for the amendment before we begin any debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the house, I thinks it's appropriate, before we
get started given that this is dealing with an education matter, we have
several teachers up in the gallery that the chair would like to again
extend a courtesies of the gallery to the teachers in the gallery.
Please stand and let us welcome you. [applause] Representative Glazier,
please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members and I will be brief. I do want to say
first, thank you to all of the members who've participated. This is
truly a bipartisan effort. And in a sense in a very different way than
the senate approach a corresponding bill that we'll be looking at. This
really involved a lot of stake holders and a lot of work to get to this
point. My task is to quickly outline the last couple sections of the
bill and then one last comment on the first sections. Part three of the
bill creates additional professional development capacity for the
teachers. And allows them flexibility but also encourages more digital
capacity and integrated digital capacity in that professional
development. Part four of the bill is simply representative Langan's
bill. Which I believe unanimously, well it didn't unanimously but passed
by a large margin in the floor. that modifies the A through F standards
in a way to at least include growth components. And in a way that
perhaps gets a better rating for schools relative to what they're really
doing and how they are improving. The next section of the bill,section
five, you've already voted on. It was part of the School safety bill.
And it really just makes sure that the school improvement teams are what
we think they are.If there's transparencies, the teachers and parents
really do have a say in those plans. And that those plans are used not
only to improve school but to deal with school safety issues that we
know exist. The next part of the bill, part six, is following a Rhode
Island model which creates academic credit for clerkships, internships
and summer work experiences. And directs the State department to look at
setting standards for contact hours, supervision requirements and
academic requirements so that we can actually give students academic
credit in certain areas for their work over the summer and  for work
that we think aligns with the common core or with any of the standards
that we have. And accelerates their ability to remove and get out of
high school faster.</p>

<p id="55:00">
and finally, the last part of the bill, which is section seven, simply
is a good amendment to the Medical Care program.  We have a number of
people were designated as medical team members in schools.
Unfortunately, we didn't put in there that they have to be trained
before they're designated as medical team members, which might be a good
thing, since they're handing out medication and things like that.  So,
that's the remaining portions of the bill, my last comment on the first
two parts are very similar to representative Holloway's, and that is
you'll see an amendment which will correct a few things, and take us
forward.  But this really is the best model that I've seen in the
country for how we keep good teachers, how we don't hurt good teachers.
We in fact make sure that they keep a non probationary status and can go
forward and do the things they want.  At same time making it a little
easier for systems to make sure that teachers who are not continuing to
perform are perhaps allowed to leave, and asked to leave little quicker
in the system, so that we can move forward.  I think this is based on
the Colorado model, which had 94% of its legislatures voting for it.
There's certainly work to be done, when it passes over to the senate,
but I really think there ought to be accommodation for all of the
leadership who's been involved in allowing us to move this bill forward,
I think it does a whole lot more to improve better teaching and better
learning in the bill that we may be seeing coming over from our sister
body.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  The amendment, if you're looking at it on the
dashboard, and I'm so old school I went up and asked a clerk where was
the copy.  I'm always over here struggling.  But, the amendment really
is nothing more than pure technical and clarifying language.  As
representative Glazier referenced, we've been meeting with all the
stakeholders.  This just adds more clarifying language to clarify what
our intentions are in the bill.  It does not change anything, and it
just helps give them a little more comfort.  I'd be glad to go into more
explanation, but in all honesty it really is nothing more than just
technical, and clarifying language.  Ask for your support.
