  If you will take your seat, we will go ahead and get started.  Okay.
Good Morning. We are going to be done by recognizing our pageants. I
think we have some of them haven’t been in here this week. So, Pardon
me. They say they can’t here. If I give any cause to this, I am
concerned. So if the pageants will go to a mike and introduce yourself
and who you are sponsored by, where you live and where you go to school.
[Speaker Changes] Good Morning. My Name is [inaudible]. I am from
Halifax County. I go to school [inaudible]. I am sponsored by Senator
Angela Bryant.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, thank you for coming
[Speaker Changes] Hello. My name is Jeffers Andrew. I am from North
Carolina Jones County and I am sponsored by Miss Pat McElraft.
[Speaker Changes] Good Morning. My Name is Josh Rogers. I am from
Jamestown and I live in Guilford County and I am sponsored by Senator
Trudy Wade.
[Speaker Changes]  Very Good. Thank You Gentlemen. Thank you for helping
this week. Your Sergeant in arms, we have Barry Miller from the house.
Thank you DH staff. [Inaudible]. You got the door and Jim Hamilton.
Thank you Jim. You know, we had an interesting week. We gathered a lot
of information. It makes me think of a story that used to circle in the
court house. Back in the day, when if you are publicly drunk, you were
publicly drunk.  There were no, you know, all those things that had not
been added and you had been lying on the side walk or coasting or
bagging. You know this is fact that public drunkenness was public
drunkenness. So the story goes there was a lot of public drunk people in
the court that day they had been charged. And the DH started calming up
the individuals. And the first guy gets up and the judge says sir, he
said, how many drinks did you have. Facing the judge, he said, a couple.
Thirty days. How does the next defend it? Judge asked the same question,
how many drinks did you have? The man said a couple. The Judge said,
thirty days. This went for a while and there was one good alternative
guy sitting at the back. He was paying attention. So the DA [inaudible],
he gets sent to the witness stand and the judge says, sir, how many
drinks did you have? Facing the judge, he said, I am not even sure . He
said it could have been one drink , he said, it could have been three
drinks, but I am sure it wasn’t a couple. So, that’s kind of How we are
in here. We ask questions. And it’s not like there is a right or a wrong
answer. We are gathering information. So I appreciate the inputs we had
this week. And you know this really helps us and as we move forward I
want you know that there is no right or wrong answer. We just to want
some answer. So if you don’t know an answer, just tell us we don’t know
right now and we understand that and we know that you are going to get
it back to us. So, the program today, if I had a program. Thank you. Now
I have two. We are going to call upon Charles and he is going to do the
financing the court system and court cops and then he will go into
special district courts. So if you want to wait till he finishes on the
first segment and then we will open it for questioning and then we will
move to the next section and then we will open it for questioning. So
again I appreciate you are being here and I appreciate all the hard work
this week.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Madam Chair. I will be here again next week.
I am afraid.

  When a, when a, when a citizen, when a person is paying, their overall
judgment, in what order is the money applied?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, madam chair. I know that first on the priority list is money
that goes back out to citizens, so I believe restitution is the first
priority for money that is collected. I saw that while looking through
some documents on the financial management system yesterday. I don&#39;t
know what the remainder of the priority is, but I do know that money
that is returned to citizens is what happens first, basically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wow. That&#39;s interesting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So can we get the AOC to get us that chart of the priority orders for
distribution and send it to all the members? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This pie shows disbursements and receipts in fiscal year 13-14. I put, I
put a chart, or I put a table online so it&#39;s far too long and far
too complicated to appear in a PowerPoint slide that shows all of the
different places that AOC disbursed their moneys in fiscal year 13-14.
They issue a report, such a report every year. In this case, you can see
262.1 million was returned to the general fund. This is generally the
general court of justice fee, although there are a few other fees that
feed into that. There was 69.3 million returned to local governments in
terms of funds, forfeitures, and then other, there are certain facility
fees and, and other fees that do go back to local governments. 348.5
million in money returned to citizens. Some of that is restitution, the
largest part of that is condemnation awards. That is a, a very
interesting category and the document online lays this out, what the
money is or how the money is returned to citizens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, madam chair. Out of official funds, ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma&#39;am, and, and the chart online does list, list what those are.
The largest, the largest amount of that does go to the court of
information technology fund. So out of that 5.7 that&#39;s returned to
AOC special funds, I believe, I think we said it was 5.2 million that
was going back, into the court of information technology fund? So most
of that is that phone fee, that $4 phone fee. Then there&#39;s receipts
to other state agencies. That&#39;s the 55 million. This will be law
enforcement retirement, law enforcement officer retirement, law
enforcement officer training. There are a number of other small fees
that are designated to particular agencies, but that is, a lot of that,
and the misdemeanant confinement fund, 25.2 million of that is
misdemeanant confinement fund. This is a chart comparing general fund
collections, this is the amount returned to the general fund by the AOC,
with appropriations over the last 10 years. It is kind of a complicated
chart but I&#39;ve attempted to track how much the percentage of the
returns was is compared to the appropriation. Representative Faircloth
asked about court cost waivers. This is the result of a court cost
waiver report from 2013. I put the statewide number across the top and
then I put a few outlier counties, this is broken up by county. And as
you can see, Cumberland county had most of the partially waived court
costs in 12-13. Mecklenburg and Robinson had a lot of, about half of the
full, fully waived court cost in 12-13. There&#39;s a special category
over here for local rule. What I learned this morning, I didn&#39;t know
what that was so I pulled that together, but what I learned this morning
is that it is basically an, a category in USCIS that mostly is for
trying to track how these, how these waivers come about, whether they
come about by local practices and local reasons. So for our purposes,
these probably should, they should have been aggregated in with the
fully waived and partially waived categories because essentially there
are so many unknowns there that we don&#39;t care. Yes sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Child, I take it from what you just said that there is no known
answer for why

  There’s this huge spectrum of fully waived and partially waived court
costs throughout the counties that appears to be explained by judicial
temperament, just the judicial personality of those counties. Some
counties are just more inclined to waive these fees. Is that your
impression. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair, thank
you Madam Chair. Senator Jackson at this point it would just be
conjecture, so what you just said seems reasonable but we actually, we
don’t have any hard facts about why Cumberland has so many partially
waived court costs while Robertson would have so many fully waived court
costs. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have several clerks
here today. Do any of those clerks have an answer? Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] Clerk of Court in Crawford County. I would just
say it’s the temperament of [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] And their discretion
to waive costs. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Susan, if you could start over please
in the mic. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. My name is Susan Fine. I’m the Clerk
of Court, Forsyth County. In Forsyth County waivers is the bench,
judicials have the right to waive costs and enter judgment so that the
only discretion that can be used, so I would say as he said, the
temperament of the bench in Forsyth. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma’am.
Representative Boles. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Maybe I’m, I can’t remember or,
does a judge have to fill out an explanation why they waive the costs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. You all passed a special
provision the year before last that directed judges to fill out a direct
reason, finding of facts before they issued a waiver. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
But I think you’re talking about when the costs are remitted, aren’t
you? When they don’t pay any costs? Are you talking about that? I think
he’s talking about when the costs are remitted the judge has to write
out a. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A reason [??]. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry,
Madam Chair. I would have to give that back. I don’t know. I would have
to get that information and get back to you. This is, these are waivers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Waivers. These are waivers. [??] Do you want to
respond to that [??] . [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. These
are waivers here, these are not remittances, so this is a report of the
court costs that have been waived as reported or as recorded by the
clerk at the time of judgment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I was wondering if some of these could be
[??] and also where it’s low income. That could be, I’m just conjecture
there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, eventually. They’re just not [??] . Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. Is there anywhere that [??] .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. I think it would be difficult
to get that. We can go back to AOC and see, no, they’re saying there’s
no way. That since the clerk, well, since the judges waiving the costs
at the point of, I believe that the way that they’re collecting the data
it would be probably difficult to link up what the costs would be,
actually as I’m saying it, we’ll talk to AOC and get back to you. I’ll
have to get back to you on that. That actually doesn’t make much sense.
If we know what sort of offense they are, then. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a comment Madam Chair, is it seems that we’re
talking about a significant dollar figure here. [??] sometimes
understanding this is the only way to [??] these particular fees and
costs [??] . [SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually that was the costs to remit [??]
$50, $180 [??]

  We’re gonna do some clarification on this particular part of the
presentation and then we will come back to the committee with that, and
I have Representative Stevens. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair.
When I first saw [??] County I [??] and actually looked at
Representative Graham and said I guess since there’s a lot of indegency
there and so that’s one reason it’s this way. I can tell you from
experience in Stokes County, a lot of times the judge will waive the
court cost because of the good record. So if they find them guilty and
they haven’t ever had a ticket or it’s been 30 years where they don’t
have a ticket or 40 years we’ll waive the cost because, you know,
they’ve had such a good driving record, so there’s any number of
discretionary reasons I think that the judge does that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Speciale. [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] Why
they’re doing, why they’re waiving this? Is somebody correcting that
information? Is there a report available? Is there a way of getting that
report? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The judges should be stating the cause. I know
that they’re pulling this report from information that’s entered in ASIS
so there is a waiver report so it does aggregate the number by county. I
don’t know if there’s any correction of the reason. I’m looking at, AOC
is saying no, that they’re not collecting the reason when they collect
the waiver information. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So what do we need to do for them to
collect the reason because if you give a reason and nobody’s paying
attention to it. [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I seem to recall, I think this lady is checking that we thought
we had made a special provision that [??] for waivers. So. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] But Madam Chair, I think one of the clerks was going to respond
that there’s not a place to put it in the system. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, let’s let the Senator finish and then we’ll recognize [??] on
that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We need to clarify that perhaps. [??] [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Let me bring it back to this slide. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So does one of the clerks want to speak? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. Jan Kennedy, Clerk of Superior
Court in Hanover County, you’re correct, Senator. There was a statute
that was passed that the judges have to make a [??] in effect whenever
they are waiving or remitting the court costs. That finding is put in
the file as it may be and it’s not recorded but it is put into a CCIS
and there is no, it’s basically what’s done is it’s in the file, so
there’s no tracking system per se. The finding is put into the case.
Into the [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just have one question. Do we know
that the judges are doing that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
So they are doing that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
In New Hanover anyway. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In New Hanover, yes, ma’am, I
can say that my judges are. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair.
Yes, there was a report due March 1st to AOC. It is overdue, it is
coming soon is what I’m hearing on, this would just list the number of
waivers for the 13, 14, I don’t think it’s gonna list the finding of
fact. That doesn’t sound like that’s being tracked. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
do we have a timeframe on when we should be getting that report.
Somebody from AOC? No? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m with the Administrative
Office of the Courts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We
hope to get that report to you next week Madam Chair, however it will
not be by a judge. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does it comply with the requirement
of the report? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ve changed our system, so we’re
trying to do a report that doesn’t by a judge. We will have that
information but we may not have it for this report because I think at
this stage if we have it we only have two months of information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jackson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to
ask a question of the AOC. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You may. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you, would ASIS have at least able to report the type of charge

  That’s being waived, like just giving you my, I only practice in one of
these four counties, but in Wake County I can tell you that 95% of those
224 fully waived court costs were charged I’ll bet you with public [??]
cause that’s usually the only time I ever see a judge in Wake County
waive court costs is someone, somebody’s out on the street begging for
money and so of course they can’t afford the court costs. The choice is
either leave them in jail at the taxpayer expense or let them go without
court costs, so I wonder if at least the minimum would be court cost
waived type of a thing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you
have a question? Oh, I’m waiting on somebody from ASC. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now, but. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair, thank
you. No, because there would be multiple charges and we’re not able to
assess the specific waiver for a specific charge. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Did
that answer your question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not the way I had hoped.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Remember, no right or wrong answers. Have a question?
Representative Turner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to ask the [??]
regarding the [??] how much information [??] is even collected [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jane Kennedy, Clerk of Superior Court in New Hanover
County. Yes, they’re waived, and it’s up to most of my in New Hanover
County, I have instructed my staff to put more information in because I
know that there’s the data out there. I can’t speak for all 100
counties, but I have always instructed my staff to put more information
in the special comments. So it depends on each county, but we put in
there that yes, it is waived so that the information’s there in case
somebody in the General Assembly wants that extra information. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you
have instructions on practices and procedures that’s been given you by
the AOC that addresses this issue or is it just kind of each county’s
doing it every how they wanna do it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No instruction,
but I’d like, Madam Chair, thank you, Jane Kennedy, Clerk of Superior
Court, no instruction for those specific. If you understand CCIS and I
believe Mr. Taub did a screen shot yesterday on it. If you look at that
screen shot there are certain bullet information that you will enter,
you know, was court costs waived and you’ll enter that, but there’s a
specific comment section that you can put in that comment section what
you want and that’s why I’ve instructed my staff over the years to
always put as much information in there so that if there is a data
gathering of information people can go to that screen. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Other questions? Yes. Senator Jackson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just
a brief comment. Based on that it seems that it is therefore impossible
to tabulate useful data based on the rationale that judges are using and
that maybe we should look into a check the box system and give judges an
option so that we can actually produce some data. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Jackson. Other questions? Comments? [??] [SPEAKER
CHANGES] In 2011 a North Carolina State Auditor conducted an audit of
court collections. Can you all hear me okay? I’m sorry. The auditor
found that court collection rates for certain offenses were at 85.1% for
traffic cases, 84.3% for cases resulting in unsupervised probation. AOC
responded that, I’m gonna read down my slide, that compliance rates for
infractions were at 99%. That these collections include DWI and criminal
defendants, some of whom were sent to prison. Some of this population is
among the poorest in the state and that due process may delay
collections. I think the point area is that sometimes what we see as
collections is not necessarily collections. It may just be money that
has been imposed by not necessarily money that the court system imposes
is not always collected I think is the point. [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
think a lot [??] by infraction. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One

  give two comparisons with other states. The National Center for State
Courts in 2013 did a survey of administrative offices of the courts
around the country and found that of the unified court systems from the
states that responded, in North Carolina 2.2% of the entire state budget
is spent on the court system. As you can see from the chart here on the
left, that is actually pretty close to the median of what states spend
on their court systems out of their entire general fund budget. On the
right there&#39;s some non-unified court systems. That number would
naturally be lower because generally they&#39;re paying for
appellate-level only and the local governments pay for circuit courts
and trial courts. The NCSC also has a comparison of filing fees in other
states and I brought this chart forward just for information for
y&#39;all, so you can see where filing fees fall in North Carolina
compared to other unified systems and non-unified court systems. And
that is all that I have on financing the court system and court costs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m gonna try to do this, if I may, to hopefully
resolve any confusion and hopefully where we won&#39;t have to go back
to this slide. We talking about different kinds of waivers on slide 12,
because you&#39;ve heard the waivers where you can pay on them online,
where they get a ticket to waive their appearance in court and they go
ahead and pay their fine and cost. So that is a waiver. So on slide 12,
in the court world the judge can remit cost. He can remit it partially
or in whole, so on slide 12, this is where the defendant goes to court,
judge hears the case, and based on some factor the judge decides either
to remit partial or full cost on that case. So that is what slide 12 is
actually doing. It&#39;s separate and apart from those waivers, where
people are waiving their court appearance, if that helps any. Questions
on this part of the presentation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Secretary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For the benefit of those of us who aren&#39;t in court
regularly, can we have one of the clerks ?? judges ?? separate cost of
?? what takes place and how is it ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Which clerk would like to respond to that?
Representative Faircloth, if you would just restate your question,
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma&#39;am. If you can give us an idea of once the
judge orders a certain cost be payed, what is the process for the
payment of that and the record keeping and the enforcement of the ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Jane Kennedy, clerk Superior Court in Hanover County.
In Hanover County, the defendant physically goes down to ?? cashier and
makes the payment via credit card or cash, cashier&#39;s check, the
money&#39;s receipted in, and comes back. Sometimes they&#39;re given
time to pay. If they are then of course they&#39;re assessed the $20
installment fee, and they come back as to a date to be determined and
pay that money and do the same thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If they don&#39;t pay ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If they do not pay it, we issue an order for arrest or
failure to appear and collect that money later. And if it&#39;s a
chapter 20 offense, of course their license is eventually revoked, and
they call us up very upset and want to know why their license is
revoked. They&#39;ve been stopped, arrested, and put in handcuffs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ever a ?? process ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, sir. There are, if it&#39;s probation. I&#39;m
going with simple traffic. I&#39;m speaking, you&#39;re getting into a
much greater, down the line, if it&#39;s a probation case, and
they&#39;re revoked. That&#39;s a whole &#39;nother area. We can talk
about that, but. Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Daughtry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just looking at this slide up there. There&#39; court
costs, waivers. Weren&#39;t waivers used in this particular slide means
waiving the cost? That is what the waiver in this particular instance
means. It&#39;s confused the word remit or waivers in respect to cost.

  These are the districts that have family court. I think I showed you
this slide the other day but I don&#39;t think it hurts to but
information in front of you again. And there are other specialty courts
these are operating in counties these are funded with local funds, with
grant funds, or their not funded. I have a chart online in the specialty
courts folder of the website for today shows where these courts are
operating and what sort of funds they are using.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Do we have questions? Representative Daughtry.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
This is for the AOC and I don&#39;t know these towns these particular
districts supposing family court ?? as opposed to some ??
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Madam chair good morning I am Mckinley Wooten deputy director of the
ALC. Representative, those decisions were made locally, a lot of it had
to do with case load the number of cases that were coming in but the
local chief district court judge basically in a lot of these were
replaced certainly before I got to ALC but those requests came from
those districts that have the interest locally to follow the family
court model.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you madam chair. My question and concern I guess is that they
recommended that we take it state wide at nine point six million. And of
course if you offer a family court administrator every district is going
to want to take it. But why would we make that recommendation when
we&#39;ve got two very large districts who are doing better statistics
than those without one? I guess, what would be the rationale? If I was a
judge and you were offering it to me I&#39;m going to take it but
I&#39;m already doing well without it. So, maybe like your ALC&#39;s
rationale for recommending it go state wide.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Someone from ASC. You wanna get back with us?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I&#39;m Brad Holloway ASC, think part of the recommendation came from
your right those two districts were doing better than. But I think the
recommendation really came from a  when you compare globally family
court districts versus non family court districts at least on percentage
of cases pending more than three hundred sixty five days family court
was doing better. So I think that&#39;s where the logic of the
recommendation came. And also from concern from the members of the
general assembly at the time is that if family court is valuable then
does it need to be state wide. The question of if it&#39;s good for one
place would it be good for others as well. Thanks for the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
So, I guess maybe more my question or even recommendation would be that
we allow every district to have an extra administrator whether they want
to do family court, front court, or drug treatment court let them decide
which one will be beneficial for their district as opposed to simply
imposing a family court on everyone. Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
And from my experience when the family court was created and started to
be put out to the counties there was input from the locals which is
correct and a lot of the decisions were made by the chief district court
judge and bar. Bar had a role in that too in whether they thought it was
beneficial whether they thought it would move cases. The local bar had a
big input in that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well I think you can do anything with the districts you want to and it
seemed kind of interesting to me that you picked two non family
districts and compared it to one family court district in Mecklenberg
county. And I think maybe if you want a fair comparison maybe you just
need to do a little, include it all. Just like you said globally
how&#39;s it doing globally? I mean I might cherry pick three districts
and decide to compare them. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a fair
comparison.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yeah, I think that staff wants to respond then AOC wants to respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative McNeill I&#39;ll put that whole report online for you to
look at. I did pull out these three districts , I just wanted to
illustrate that while family court did generally perform better in some
of the districts

  That was not a universal and I believe that, I think you took it the
other way and I’m very sorry about that. That is my fault. I should’ve
pulled the glove away in that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m Brad Fowler, ASC, if Representative, the full continuation review
report that we have pulled this out of, it shows both family court
versus non-family court in general and then these comparisons, and it
explains the methodology in the report better, these were peer groups,
so Mecklenberg was compared to the biggest non-family court district
just like Wake was, and if you go in there, there’s to district 8 which
has three counties, it was compared to multi-county districts of similar
size, so in the full continuation review, each family court district, a
peer group was picked for them to look at their similar groups that were
not in family court, how they did. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Hurley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] have to be in [??] whatever, they put
them all together and they’re [??] and so part of the chart is to really
compare if you do a separate [??] . [SPEAKER CHANGES] Other questions?
Yes, Representative McNeill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Wake should’ve
been in here because I think Wake’s a [??]. Wake has a family court
district. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, there are several pages of
statistics here that include this grouping, so I’ll make sure that our
report is in the folder at the end of the meeting here today. So if it’s
not already. I may have already put it in there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Other
questions? I have one question for staff and William, I don’t know that
you would be able to take the question, it may have to go to Miss
Legett. 2011 we had a difficult task in trying to balance a budget with
a decreasing amount of money, so can you tell me if there are any other
programs, non-statewide programs, that are still in existence other than
family court? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe, if I remember correctly, and
I’ll go back and look to make sure I’m telling you the right thing, but
at the time there were several non-statewide programs of this type
across all of the [??] agencies. There was, drug treatment court was one
of them and that was eliminated. Family court I believe is the only one
of them still [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, follow up. In that same
train of thought and discussion, we had several programs that we did
pass through funding. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am, and I [??] [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, ma’am, so can you speak to those for those members who
were not involved and possibly weren’t even here in 2011 in the budget
process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am. At the time there were several
[??] that received pass through funding that [??] in appropriation that
passed through AOC or at the time [??] correction and then went to a
non-profit somewhere else to [??] . All of those were eliminated. The
only ones that remain now are the actual [??] that received
appropriations from [??] but there are many more [??] for our process
[??] . [SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me, and access to civil justice was cut.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, does this other, okay,
yeah. [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Other questions? So our next meeting is
Wednesday, March the 11th and I’m sure the staff will have us some great
reports and we’ll have plenty of discussions and I do have one question
that I would like to ask the AOC and it may be some information that you
could get us. You know, we talk about, a lot about the local courthouses
and how morale is down in the local courthouses and I know that it is. I
hear it every day. I have clerks telling me that their staff’s trying to
hold on but they don’t know how much longer they’re gonna hold on, so,
you know, I know a lot of the court staff, they haven’t had raises. They
had the little, you know, some had steps last year, some had very
minimal raises last year, a little raise the year before. Can you get me
any

  ...information regarding internal rates is that the AOC has given...at
the AOC and I&#39;d like to know what the amounts were and where that
money was...what source of the funding was. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McNeil.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And this is something that I would like to see if it&#39;s possible and
I think AOC [INAUDIBLE] to do it. I know the clerks are allowed to use
some of their lap salaries -- or however you want to phrase that term --
this year to give, I think, basically as they choose. I like to kind of
break down by county how much the clerks were allowed...how much of that
lap salary they got and were allowed to use because that kind of goes
back towards what you&#39;re talking about as far as the raises go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[NAME INAUDIBLE]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I clarify that is [INAUDIBLE] reserve. I know, but I just want to
make sure that-- [INAUDIBLE] reserve is a recurring funding for us
that&#39;s going to continue on and it happened when Representative
[INAUDIBLE] is paid ten thousand dollars and Representative Johnson is
paid twenty thousand dollars and Representative Johnson leaves and
Representative Salmon takes his spot, but he&#39;s only getting paid ten
because he only got ten thousand dollars in salary reserve. [CROSSTALK]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say it&#39;s just a matter of semantics and if we&#39;re
[INAUDIBLE] laps hours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, the laps hour is generated by vacant position. So, you&#39;ve got
a position that&#39;s only filled six months out of the year, the other
six months of salary that exist, that&#39;s lap salary. That&#39;s
non-recurring money and there are several allowable uses for that in the
staff sheets and you see that-- Don will talk about this more, but DPS
has over eighty million dollars left after every year. So, there&#39;s a
difference in the allowable uses for those two pots of money and last
year you did specify that the clerks could keep their salary reserve and
use that to provide raises.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then I will rescind that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Proceed, sir.
