  <p id="00:00">I&#39;ve met them all.  I&#39;ve had governors come in and reverse
decisions of legislative leaders with ten or fifteen members who we
thought were going to have a certain position.  Governors have immense
power.  And now that they have veto in North Carolina, it&#39;s even
more than just immense. It&#39;s an active role in law making and
legislating.  The governors over here, his people sit in with the
majority party when they&#39;re deciding budget matters, when
they&#39;re deciding subsistent matters on laws and stuff.  Come on.
The governor ought to be able to convince four or five out of 34
Republicans that he has the right idea about something.  Or if he
can&#39;t, it must not be the right idea.  And that raises some other
questions.  But certainly, certainly, an executive official ought to be
able to get at least 15 to 20% of the people in his party to agree that
he&#39;s going down the right path in deciding what the priorities of
the state ought to be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So is your strategy for this session to try to convince Governor McCrory
[SP] to carry your agenda?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. What we will do is tell him possibilities, expose possibilities of
what North Carolina can be.  We will be strong advocates for our agenda.
 We will advocate it.  We will try to convince people that it&#39;s
where the state ought to go.  The issues that I was raising with you are
kinds of things that we believe very passionately in and will work hard
for.  But, at the same time, the governor has to have things that he
feels passionately about in ways that he can move the state forward.
And we are willing to work with him to achieve those things that he
feels very strongly about, but it&#39;s going to take the help of some
of his fellow partisans.  Not fellow partisans in this sense but some of
his party members to get some of these things done.  If he is unwilling
to go outside what the leadership in the Senate says they want and
convince members individually that he&#39;s got a vision that&#39;s
better for the state, then, no, he will not get the things done that
he&#39;s indicated he&#39;s going to pay attention to.  At least that
I&#39;ve seen him say he wants to focus on for the next four or five
months.  But we offer ourselves, again, as a willing partner, to share a
vision and to help him move this state forward in the areas I&#39;ve
talked about....in job creation and in making sure that the middle class
gets the benefits of some of these things that we&#39;ve tried to do
here over the last three or four years.  And in educating our kids.  So
we offer ourselves as a partner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Marks question cuts into what I wanted to get into.  And really
that&#39;s more along the lines of in general terms if you both could
access the state of the Democratic party right now both in your chamber
and also across the state.  You&#39;ve got Tilus [SP] who tauted the
conservative revolution and now he&#39;s senator and he just ousted a
Democrat.  And, also as a backdrop, you have the moral Monday movement
and how it&#39;s been certainly very vocal against a lot of the
conservatives who are in office, and we see how the election turned out.
 If you could access the status of the party.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, from the standpoint of the legislature?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a sense of where we need to go. Now, I learned in sand lots and
stuff as a little kid in kindergarten that if you&#39;re competing for
something and somebody stacks the deck at 45 degree angles, then
you&#39;re going to slide down the other side and it&#39;s tough to have
a fair fight. You mentioned Tilus being elected to the United States
Senate by the smallest margin of any senator who got elected in this
last cycle I believe.  So you had 48/49% of this state voting
democratic.  If you had 48/49% of the legislature as democrat, you
wouldn&#39;t ask me that question.  And so you have to ask why you have
to ask that question.  And that is because the deck has been stacked so
one-sided in the way that they drew these districts that they basically
make 25 to 30% of the state irrelevant in participating in the
discussions in how the state ought to be governed.  Because you totally
ignore the democratic members in both chambers.  So that is a stacked
deck.  We&#39;ll keep fighting against that.  The Democratic party is
geared to fight for it and we&#39;ll continue to do that.  There&#39;s
going to be a reorganization of the state party in the next several
months because  [END OF AUDIO]

  <p id="05:00">Other elections for new officers and new directions and so we&#39;re
looking forward to that, but then as the elected officials in this body
we&#39;re ready to proceed with the kinds of messages and the kinds of
agenda that help move the state forward on the grounds that I just
mentioned to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And one closing comment on that. We
have to be really careful about how we characterize what the facts are,
you know? If you look at local elections across the state, equal voting
for democrats in their county commission and other races that they had
and you&#39;ll have municipal elections as well, and so the demise of
the democratic party may be overstated here. If you look at some of the
House seats that we were competitive in and the ones that we won and if
you look at some of the republicans that were defeated, you&#39;ll see
that they&#39;re not invincible. That some of their top members did lose
in some of those elections. So we&#39;re going forward on the issues
that we believe in. Again, the way we looked at education last cycle and
we helped make that a priority, we weren&#39;t irrelevant in that and we
see the results in the increase in starting pay for teachers and
education and we&#39;ll do that in other areas. So, again, take a, maybe
it&#39;s time to take a broader picture and a broader look and see what
the citizens really are saying by the way they vote in certain races.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The third branch of government has been chiming in as
well. The Chief Justice has been talking about court funding and the
operating budget for the courts have fallen by 40% since the recession.
Seems like an issue that your leadership would get behind as well to
restore some funding for operating the courts and also to raise
salaries. Any comment on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ve told the Chief
Justices and the justices on the Supreme Court and the judges on the
court of appeals, as a lawyer I know the importance not just as a
lawyer, everybody knows the importance of the third branch, but I see
what they&#39;re talking about when they say technology is 20-30 years
behind and, you know, if a full branch of government is not keeping up
with the other two, is not keeping up with the industry and stuff that
it&#39;s trying to regulate or trying to pass judgement on, then
you&#39;re not gonna get justice in the way that you ought to have it. I
agree with the Chief Justice, I agree with the court that the resources
in our courts is abysmally low and something has to be done about it. On
the other hand, as I tell the court, and I really mean this, they are an
equal branch of government and they have the rare distinction of being
the branch of government that determines whether or not how they&#39;re
being treated is fair. The Constitution basically calls them a co-equal
branch and if they can&#39;t carry out the duties that the Constitution
mandates for them to carry out, it might be that they need to be more
proactive in ensuring that this legislature and the governor, both
legislative and executive branches hear what they say and hear their
concerns. Now, you know, there&#39;s some question, you go back to the
Leandro decision. The court is a little bit reluctant sometimes to tell
the legislature how they&#39;ve got to get involved in funding things,
but that might be one of the Constitutional mandates for the court, but
short of that, this General Assembly ought to be more sensitive to
adequately funding the courts because justice and fairness are hallmarks
of this democracy that we&#39;re in and you can&#39;t have that if you
can&#39;t get the courts to work in the way they should. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I wonder if we&#39;re gonna see the democrats put forth any
call to action legislation specifically with language that might try to
prevent it from passing the cost, you know, costs on to rate payers.
That was something that came up last session and was defeated in
committee. I was wondering if we were gonna see anything like that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don&#39;t know that you&#39;ll see it as a specific
bill, and that was part of the questions we, we had today, but I&#39;m
sure there will be advocates in our party for the proper treatment of
the consumers, of the taxpayers, and certainly in a situation where you
have a logical byproduct of an activity, this economic activity, we
would expect everyone who was involved in the process to pay their fair
share, and if they&#39;ve mishandled it just like in all other
situations, they should pay the costs as opposed to taking bonuses
during a period of time they have been in charge of these companies and
paying also dividends to taxpayers during these same periods of times
when these violations would&#39;ve occurred, have occurred, and then
later when they are discovered to say no, we&#39;ll put it on the rate
payer, so I&#39;m sure whether it&#39;s amendments to bills, discussions
in committee, whatever, you will see that fairness and that advocacy for
the consumers who have already paid for this to be done in a safe
manner. You will see, I&#39;m quite sure, people from our party saying
we should treat the citizens fairly, the consumers

  <p id="10:00">[inaudible] [SPEAKER CHANGES] One more then we&#39;ll cut if off.
It&#39;s great to see, anybody have one more? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a
quick one. Specifically on the environment I wonder where your push for,
initiative for jobs and some of the environmental concerns that might
circle around, say, fracking or offshore drilling or some of the things
that we might hear from [??] when they have their press conference in 30
minutes. To what degree, how will democrats balance those concerns for
the environment with your own push for jobs? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, and
I&#39;ll be real brief on it, speak on it a little bit. When we look at
the job creation from renewable energies industry in North Carolina, one
of the top job growth industries as opposed to other states. That&#39;s
one thing. The second thing as far as the cost of clean ups and the
damage that we suffer by people&#39;s, again, medical conditions and the
impact that they have, needing treatment as a result of those, we have
to figure that into the calculation. So it&#39;s not just the simple
calculation of saying there was a job that was in this particular
industry. What costs do we pay generally for this industry to operate in
the way it operates and who pays that cost and who benefits when the
industry is conducted in that manner. So we have to have a broader
evaluation of is this really job creation or is this an expense that
we&#39;re incurring that we pay society wide. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I
think we recognize that we are sensitive to a lot of the environmental
concerns that have been raised on a broad range of issues, the whole
regulatory scheme and the ability to act with reduced jobs and all that.
We think that fracking is basically going to become a non-issue because
most of the reports are indicating that the folk who could afford to do
it don&#39;t think that there&#39;s enough to invest in North Carolina
and so they&#39;re probably not going to do it. If that issue starts
coming to fruition and starts coming to fruition and causes concern,
we&#39;ll certainly be actively involved in debating some of the
environmental issues and other ways to ensure the safety of our
citizenry. This has been great. We&#39;ll do it again. Hope to see you
in two weeks. Be careful in this ice.

  <p id="40:00">Good afternoon. I apologize for being late. I think what we found was
that Speaker Moore was in one room waiting on me and I was in another
room waiting on him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This isn&#39;t an omen, is it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. We&#39;re still smiling.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We came together at the end, so there you go, it&#39;s all perfect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So welcome, we appreciate you all being here. The speaker and I will
take your questions in just a few minutes. I think we both would like to
just talk about a couple of things in advance. I want to express my
appreciation to my Senate colleagues for, again, selecting me as the
Senate President Pro Tem, looking forward to the next, this upcoming
session, and in the next two years working with the members of the
Senate, working with Tim Moore as Speaker of the House and the House
members and working with Governor McCrory and people in the executive
branch to hopefully continue some of the things that we&#39;ve done over
the past two and four years. A couple of those things, as you&#39;ve
heard me talk about before, is tax reform, I think we&#39;re beginning
to see the fruits of a lot of work that went into the tax reform that
took place. I think it has made North Carolina a more competitive state
in terms of our business tax climate, the rankings are fairly clear as
far as that&#39;s concerned. Another thing that we had done, and I think
you&#39;ll see us continue to work on, is regulatory reform, trying to
address the interface between government and the need that we have to
move forward with protecting people and protecting our environment and
the business community and the need we have for a strong business
community for job creation and the economic development that occurs
there. So we&#39;ll continue to do that. We decided that we&#39;d let me
kick this off because I &#39;m sort of repeating and Tim&#39;s the new
guy, so I am extremely pleased that the House has selected Tim Moore as
its speaker. I am looking forward to working together with Tim.
We&#39;ve known each other for a number of years, we&#39;ve shared some
dark nights in other places and have had a good time and have worked
together on a number of things. So, Tim, welcome and I understand you
have some things you want to say.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Bill. Well good afternoon. First off, thank you all for being
here today given the weather. We&#39;ve had a very good session today, a
good start to the session with unanimous votes, both for the rules for
the Speaker and for the Speaker Pro Tempore. I hope that that indeed is
what is setting the tone for this upcoming legislative session.
We&#39;ve accomplished a lot these last four years. We&#39;ve done so
much as far as increasing the employment of folks in this state,
creating jobs, roughly 260,000 people now have jobs that didn&#39;t four
years ago. We&#39;ve lowered the unemployment insurance taxes, we have
worked tirelessly to try to bring new jobs to this state and we want to
continue doing that. We&#39;ve passed major initiatives for
transportation and we&#39;ve worked to improve education in this great
state. So we&#39;ve had a great partnership, Bill and I have worked
closely together over the last four years and even when we were in the
minority in our respective chambers and we are friends and I believe we
are going to have a very productive session this year. You all know the
issues we are going to be dealing with and we are already having
dialogue and we&#39;re looking to find common ground to reach those
solutions. I do want to thank my House colleagues for their vote of
confidence today. It&#39;s a humbling experience. I had a lot of my
family here today, my two sons, somebody stumbled and fell and my
youngest one saw it and he just about couldn&#39;t keep a straight face
at that point so we got through that, that was probably the toughest
part because then her brothers are ones looking at the other

  <p id="45:00">Other ??? but it went very well. It was a very, very nice occasion
having everybody&#39;s family&#39;s here and all and I think it actually
sets starts us off setting the right tone. That it it&#39;s not about us
individually as legislators, it&#39;s about families and it&#39;s about
the people of this great state. It is an honor to be here it&#39;s a
little different. You&#39;re old hat at this; I&#39;m a little new at
this. Looking forward to getting to work, and I&#39;m glad to take any
questions at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you state your question, Tom.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you expand on what you mean by expanding tax
reform or taking tax reform further. Are you going to be shoring up loop
holes here or a little tightening it up or really advancing the cause.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we&#39;ve made a lot of progress in connection
with tax reform over the past several years. I think it is something
that we will continually look at. As far as specifics I don&#39;t have
anything specific to propose or to bring to ya.  I&#39;ve read and seen
on some of the things that y&#39;all have reported on that there are
some members who are talking about a number of things. I&#39;m sure
there will be bills introduced and we&#39;ll take a look at them and
we&#39;ll see what has support and what doesn&#39;t have support. I
would say that there is a sense amongst a number of folks that we&#39;ve
made some big changes, we are seeing some results, we are seeing some
things that we like, and we&#39;ve got some things that we need to let a
little more time go before we know exactly how we&#39;re doing. So
we&#39;ll just. I&#39;m sure there will be bills introduced as to what
we be taken up and what will be passed we ware gonna be here for a
while.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick follow-up then. Can you, can you talk about your
confidence that the decisions made in that tax round, last round of tax
rounds were the right ones since it seems that we have less money coming
in to the state now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely, John. Listen what we are talking about is,
at this point, some folks think is actually a timing issue. We have, I
think we&#39;re running, $190 million dollars behind projections and
there are a lot of folks who think that what we are dealing with is
situation that has to do with the timing. Remember our sales tax
collections are up substantially. Our corporate income tax collections
are up. Where we are lagging behind the projections is with individual
income taxes. Now the other thing you need to think about is we&#39;re
talking about maybe $200 million dollars, 190 million dollars, in the
context of a $20 billion dollar budget. Now, when we first got here, we
were looking at a short fall of $2.5 billion dollars. This is not
something that is from my perspective and I would say from the
perspective of most of our members is something that we would consider
to be a major concern, something that we would consider to be an
indication that there&#39;s a problem somewhere so I feel very good
about the tax reform. I feel very good about the direction we are going
in. There&#39;s a need always for us to take a look at things and if
something needs to be done we&#39;ll see what needs to be done. ???
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a follow-up. I hear what you are saying about a
percentage of the overall budget but it&#39;s still not chump change and
there&#39;s a lot of things that a lot of legislators have said they
want to do this year including that you&#39;ve pledged to get starting
teacher pay up to $35,000 dollars this year. If it turns out that
it&#39;s not a timing issue, what happens?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m not going to deal with hypotheticals as far as
that&#39;s concerned. We were able to deal with a $2.5 billion dollar
short fall. If we end up with a situation where we are short from the
projections we&#39;ll manage. We will manage in a way that will continue
to move North Carolina in the right direction, continue to move North
Carolina forward, continue to fund the schools at levels that need to be
funded, continue to take care of our social safety net. It is something
that, in the grand scheme of things, is no where near the scope of the
issue of what we&#39;ve dealt with before today. Tim, you can talk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You are doing great.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well this is a quick question regarding tax reform.
One of the things that was included in the changes to the tax code was
really broadening the base and that is something that the bond agencies
have wanted to see for a long time. There was a little bit of broadening
but not as much as people on both sides of the aisle say really should
happen just for the state&#39;s economy to be on good footing. Is that
something you&#39;d like to see? A broadening of the tax base?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I. You want to take it or you want me to take it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I take the tough questions. You take the easy ones?
I&#39;m glad to take it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let&#39;s both do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Perfect. Go ahead. We&#39;ll get this worked out
eventually.

  <p id="50:00">There are a number of members who are still talking about broadening the
base. I think there&#39;ll be some discussion about that. I have not
counted noses. I&#39;m sure the speaker has not counted noses. I
don&#39;t know where we would be with that, haven&#39;t seen a specific
proposal, but I do think it&#39;s part of that larger discussion. I
don&#39;t think you&#39;re ever finished with looking at what sorts of
policies are appropriate for you to consider to try to make things
better. So I think there&#39;ll be some discussions about that. It&#39;s
kinda early for me to see whether or not we&#39;re going to have any
specific legislation approved or even introduced at this point. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And I agree with Phil on this. It&#39;s too early to tell. I
have always supported limiting taxes and so anytime you talk about
broadening the base, you want to get into the, that&#39;s a conversation
that really goes beyond one we can fully have today because I feel
certain on our side we wanna make sure that anything we do along those
lines would be revenue neutral in other ways. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
Earlier, just a few moments ago, your democratic counterparts were here
talking about some changes to ethics laws in light of what has been
occurring with some accusations made regarding Governor McCrory. Two of
the things, one would be to place a ban on outside earned income for
full-time politicians like Governor McCrory and others. Second, we can
do a statement of economic interest to provide more detail about how
much money people have received or the size of stuff. What do you think
about changes to the ethics laws to provide what they would say is more
disclosure and more transparency about what elected officials have going
on outside of this building? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have some very
extensive ethics laws already that cover everything. I haven&#39;t seen
what their proposal is so I don&#39;t know the details of it and from
everything I&#39;ve seen there&#39;s no merit to the criticism, frankly,
that&#39;s been levied against the governor on this. It appears that
it&#39;s coming from a liberal activist group and it&#39;s all
politically motivated, and it&#39;s always unfortunate when that
happens. It&#39;s always better if we can focus on the merits of issues
and not get into those kinds of things like that, but we have to
disclose quite a bit as it is. I&#39;m not sure what else you would
disclose that we don&#39;t already, and so I don&#39;t know the merits,
the specifics of what they&#39;re talking about. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Either as a follow up or Senator Berger can chime in, for instance, the
Federal Disclosure Form says you have to provide a range of how much you
own on a [??] stock or how much you receive from this consultant or x,
right now SCI just says anything about $10,000 and doesn&#39;t put a
more narrow dollar amount. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think if a bill&#39;s
introduced to make specific changes or if we get a recommendation from
the ethics commission that certain things may need to be modified,
obviously we&#39;re going to take a look at it, but like the Speaker
this is the first I&#39;ve heard of this, so it is not really something.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First I heard of it too 30 minutes ago. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well, it&#39;s easier to ask the question than it is to answer
the question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s
what they tell me anyway. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s right. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] What can we expect to come up this session with the Senate,
whether it&#39;s Jdig, the owner&#39;s already said that he wants
something to happen in the early weeks of the session and you&#39;ve got
the film senate folks still rattling cages and historic preservation,
what can we expect in any chamber on any of them or all of them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Want me to go first this time? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
We&#39;ll flip a coin. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That question actually in some
sense, in some way piggybacks on the question about tax reform because
some of what you&#39;re talking about are things that were dealt with in
tax reform, and so I&#39;m sure there are folks who would like to
revisit some of those and discuss some of those. The Governor has
indicated for some time now and Secretary Skvarla has also indicated
that they would like to see the legislature consider and pass some
changes to our incentive structure. I would like to defer until I see
specifically what they are proposing. You know, we had a bill last time,
I think it was 1224, that passed the Senate, there were some parts in
the bill that folks in the House didn&#39;t like and we were unable to
see that passed into law, so let&#39;s see what the Governor proposes. I

  <p id="55:00">I think there&#39;s support in both the House and the Senate, you can
speak to the House cause you were in it. But I think there&#39;s support
for doing everything that we can to try to make North Carolina a
competitive place for the creation of jobs. Does that mean that we
continue to go down the incentives road that we&#39;ve seen in the past?
Do we do some other things in addition to the tax reform? And we just
have to have that discussion, and let&#39;s see what the governor
proposes.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] ??? Mention on that, House Bill 1224 that
was talked about, that&#39;s an example of a bill where a form actually
ended up killing and trumping the substance last year. The reason House
Bill 1224 failed, in my opinion, was not because of the incentives part,
it was because of a lot of the other things that we loaded on the deal.
And I certainly share responsibility in that as Rules Chairman at the
time. And so we took that as a learning lesson on our side to try to be
more focused, but when I talk to our colleagues in the House, when it
comes to just head-on, direct, deal with incentives, nobody loves
incentives that I know of, nobody likes them. So the question is, what
do you do to allow North Carolina to be competitive with other states?
We&#39;ve made a lot of great strides these last four years by lowering
the overall tax burden, by passing regulatory reform. By doing the good
things that we&#39;ve done. But we may, in certain instances, need some
incentives. I agree with Senator Burr that we need to collaborate with
the folks at commerce, we need to find out what it is they need, and I
believe that we&#39;re ready to try to help. At the end of the day, we
do wanna see more jobs come to this state, and whatever we can do within
reason, certainly on the House side, we&#39;re prepared to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] With Chiquita announcing today that they&#39;re going
to pull out of Charlotte, they were recipients of incentives, ??? do you
think? [SPEAKER CHANGE] That&#39;s the first I heard of that, I hate to
hear that news with Chiquita though. You don&#39;t know why companies
locate, you don&#39;t know why they leave sometimes. Back before I was
here, I was active with our local economic development commission, and
I&#39;m in a county that&#39;s been economically distressed, a rural
county right on the state line. We could look across the state line and
see what was going on in Greenville-Spartanburg. We saw what happened
with BMW, we saw the other growth. We saw where we would come up short
sometimes, and where we would land companies, and sometimes you wondered
if you were being used, for example, to play against and negotiate in
other states. So it&#39;s hard to really get in there and know the real
reasons that things happen, but any time you hear of a company not
coming here, or leaving, you kind of kick yourself and you always wonder
what could you do better to keep that from happening. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
You ended last session of the House and Senate having some disagreement
on Medicaid and Medicaid reform, I think even ??? on a proposed special
session to continue those discussions. Your interim committee that was
looking at the form of what Medicaid reform might look like, basically
it says in your report that &#39;yes, we think there aught to be
some.&#39; Have you all had any discussions about what that might look
like going forward? How you might bridge some of those differences? And,
if at some point you might take on what Governor McCrory has handed out
a few times, which is Medicaid extension? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members
continue to discuss reform, I think there&#39;s broad agreement that
Medicaid reform is something that North Carolina needs to address. The
question of specifically what that reform looks like is one that we are,
at this point, unable to answer in terms of there being a majority in
the House and a majority in the Senate, this is what it&#39;ll be. I
think we will continue as we move forward to look at that. I think the
issue of Medicaid expansion is one that we&#39;ve answered time and time
again, and I don&#39;t see that the answer is any different at this
point. There is a minor case that can be made that Medicaid expansion is
the right thing for us to do in North Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGE] I
continue to be unconvinced that Medicaid expansion is a good idea. We
acknowledge that there&#39;s some problems with Medicaid, and I think
that we need to find a way to come up with a reform program to address
some of the spending, address the waste. I don&#39;t think just throwing
more money at it is the solution. And what happens of course, if
there&#39;s money that comes in from the federal government now, but
that could very easily go away in two years, and the state is stuck
picking up the tab at that point. I just don&#39;t think that that&#39;s
a good long term play for us to make.

  <p id="60:00">Governor McCrory announced with Mayor Growley the other day that the
Dorthea Dix property is gonna be sold and he announced the terms.
What&#39;s you all&#39;s reaction to the terms that the governor came up
with and is there any possibility that we can see any legislation or
reaction from the legislature to either revise those terms or kill the
deal? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, what I would say is I like the process
that has been engaged in in this point. What you&#39;ve had is the
executive branch and the city of Raleigh spend a good bit of time
looking at this and my understanding is there&#39;s been a pretty good
bit of give and take on that. As far as the specifics of the proposed
agreement, we&#39;re still looking at it and the thing that I have said
consistently, and I think an number of members have said consistently,
is that what we have is, we have a state asset that we&#39;re talking
about transferring and it&#39;s not, it is a state asset that I think
everyone acknowledges has value and we want to make sure that the
taxpayers of the state receive fair consideration for a transfer if that
takes place and we&#39;re looking to see if that&#39;s what the governor
has come up with. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Back to Medicaid reform, I wonder if
you both would address this. Last session obviously there was plenty of
discussion, plenty of work on it, but there still is this stalemate
between the Senate and the House, how do you break that? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] During the interim a couple of committees have met and
discussed this and I understand there have been some conversations
between the stakeholders. What I sense from folks I&#39;ve talked to
about it is we would like to see the various groups involved whether
it&#39;s the doctors, the hospitals, the insurance companies, try to
work together and collaborate perhaps, maybe a little more than
they&#39;ve done in the past and try to come up with some solutions.
There is some common ground in some places and then obviously there are
some differences, but it&#39;s just going to have to work itself out.
But I know we&#39;ve had two interim committees that have dealt with
this issue and it&#39;s not easy. I mean, if any of us in the room had
the answer to this problem we&#39;d be pretty well off I guess, and
it&#39;s a complex issue and when you make a change here you affect
something here, but I think you&#39;re gonna see us work together and
collaborate as much as we can between the two chambers to find a
solution. What it&#39;s gonna look like, I don&#39;t think either of us
can say at this point. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, let&#39;s hope to have an
answer. What are your thoughts on, or what will we see this year on
possible historic property tax credit and so forth and the privilege
licence we were so worried about? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Historic tax
credits, again, we talked a little bit about that as far as tax reform.
A decision was made in the context of tax reform in terms of what we
were going to do there. I think there are some folks who would like to
revisit that decision. We&#39;ll see as we go forward whether or not
that&#39;s something that had support. With reference to privilege
licence taxes, that&#39;s something that I know the governor has been
involved in communicating with the municipalities about some of the
issues there, but we quite frankly are interested in what the
governor&#39;s proposal will be to address that and we&#39;ll see
whether or not there is that support. Remember, one of the reasons that
the change took place as far as privilege licenses, there were some
entities that were really creating tax schemes that were very uneven and
were creating some real impediments for the business community and for
our ability to be a place that is receptive to business involvement, so
they, those concerns exist. Those concerns were one of the reasons that
the tax went away. Let&#39;s see what the governor proposes and
we&#39;ll see where we go from there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, [??]
from Senator [??] what is your [??] idea of what flat rate state wide
city and county [??] to the local governments. What do you think of
that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think there are probably a lot of ideas out
there about what we ought to do. Some folks probably think we ought to
just leave it like it is and not have the authority for privilege
licenses. Some folks think that we can reinstitute something. Let&#39;s
let the session move forward and see what kinds of proposals are out
there. I don&#39;t know as I stand here what kind of solution has the
support of the majority of members in my body much less both bodies.

  <p id="65:00">Back to the historic property. There&#39;s talk about a grant program. I
know some folks are talking about that as opposed to getting away from
it being a tax credit issue. So there may be some discussions about
that. The Privilege License Tax that&#39;s, I&#39;m interested to see
what the Governor&#39;s proposal is because we, we really did need to
deal with some abuses that have occurred across the state and I
won&#39;t recount all of that, but the case was very compelling where
people who were being taxed who really did not have any reasonable
forseeability of having to pay taxes to a municipality so that&#39;s one
of those where it kind of got out of hand. Whether we take a look at it
or not, I don&#39;t know. I agree with Senator Berger, it&#39;ll just
depend upon the session and where the interest is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma&#39;am. Oh I&#39;m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger, do you plan to change your approach to
teacher pay and offer better and some more substantial raises this year
in light of the fact that teachers received such small raises last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have. We passed last session one of the largest pay
raises for teachers that&#39;s we&#39;ve seen in North Carolina. We did
that in the context of changing the pay structure and collapsing some of
the steps. I think we&#39;ve made a commitment, and it is one of the
things that I know the Senate is intending to do. I think the House is
and the Governor as well to get the beginning pay up to $35,000.
We&#39;ll take a look at ways that we can reward our best teachers for
providing real value in terms of improvement of student performance in
the classroom, and I think that&#39;s going to be the focus of what
we&#39;d like to see in connection with addressing teacher pay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The whole idea of public education is not just a
political issue for me, I have two sons who are in the public schools,
and so it is very personal. I&#39;m personally invested in this, frankly
moreso than politically invested, if you will. I&#39;m proud of the pay
raises we passed this year, and we did the pay raises that did benefit
newer teachers more than more seasoned teachers because that&#39;s where
the folks at DPI told us they needed to focus because that&#39;s where
the high turnover was. That&#39;s where the real disparity was, and we
needed to make sure that we took care of that. I would like to see us do
more for veteran teachers, absolutely would. Believe me I&#39;ve got a
lot of relatives who are teachers, and I hear about it all the time. And
because - I value the job that they do, and I want to see us do it.
I&#39;m proud of what we did last year. I think it was a huge step in
the right direction, and I guess the biggest pay raise for teachers in
what, 10 years?  So I think that is a great record we can be proud to
have on education. Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Following up on that, there&#39;s some agencies that
says there&#39;s a talent retention issue state crime lab, ???. What
about raises for other departments, or all state employees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That that really has - the crime lab issue is
something that I&#39;ve dealt with both in my law practice and we hear
about a lot. The high turnover where, of course, a private lab can come
in and hire these lab analysts away and pay them much more money and
that adds to the backlog. We&#39;re gonna have to deal with it.
We&#39;re gonna have to find some way to deal with it in terms of
staffing whether it is pay raises and other things that the AOC has come
to us and the other agencies, and I believe that on our side we will
want to try to find a way to do that. As far as other state employees,
of course, all state employees got a raise this year, and depending on
the economic circumstances, we&#39;d always like to do that, but it is a
little premature to know what we can do and how far we can go until we
know exactly how much money we have.  Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Since the last session there have been at least three
constitutional challenges to the way certain committees are appointed:
Coal Ash Management, ??? Review, and Mining &amp; Energy, wondering if
there&#39;s going to be a legislative response to that? There was a
legal response to it, and how you think those lawsuits are going to
unfold, or if there is someway to work that out with as far as
legislatively?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ya know in my professional life I try to predict for
clients how a case is going to turn out and sometimes I&#39;m right and
sometimes I&#39;m wrong so we feel very confident that the position that
has been taken by the legislature, both recently and long term, is
entirely consistent with what we are doing and with what we intend to
continue to do with reference to boards and commissions. We feel like
the courts will vindicate that position. Feel like the precedent is that
the courts have previously vindicated that position. I don&#39;t know
that...

  <p id="70:00">That there will be any specific legislative response other than I
don&#39;t anticipate us making any changes in how we deal with those
issues. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I agree completely with Senator Berger on
that. I think our legal position is very strong. Again, I try to predict
that also and it is the precedent for years and years is that the
General Assembly has the right to name appointments to various
commissions and boards. It&#39;s not overstepping the legislative
authority in doing so and I don&#39;t predict either a legislative
response to the lawsuit or to the challenge, but I don&#39;t see any
change to what we&#39;re doing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And remember
there&#39;s another good reason for us to have the ability to make those
kinds of appointments, and that is there are some commissions that need
to have some independence from both the legislative branch and the
executive branch and that independence is actually bolstered by the
ability of both the General Assembly and the executive branch to appoint
members to certain committees. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sitting here I get the
feeling could be in 2011 or 2013 seems like a lot of the same issues are
gonna be on the table. What&#39;s gonna be different about this session
other than Speaker Morris here instead of Speaker Tuft. Is there gonna
be less focus on social issues, more focus on something else? What are
some issues that are gonna come up that haven&#39;t? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
We, if you look back at the list of social issues, for example, that we
came in in 2011 we wanted to deal with, we&#39;ve addressed most of
those and so they&#39;re done and so we, I think we&#39;re at a position
now where we can focus on governing, actually moving forward with
managing the affairs of state. Working on our budget, trying to improve
efficiencies. I mentioned an initiative today that I talked about in my
acceptance speech about trying to engage in some more public/private
partnership on the after school issue with agencies that already exist,
something that wouldn&#39;t cost much money, and those are things I
think we ought to look at doing. Making sure we&#39;re being responsive
to folks back home, but above all, on top of all of that is doing
whatever we can to bring more jobs to this state, and I think, I&#39;m
committed to see us focus on economic development, job retention and job
growth. That to me is, those are the top three issues if you will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You know, former Senator Runstetter used to, when we
were in the minority and then again when we were in the majority, used
to remind our members about either the failure of state government to do
what he called the basic blocking and tackling of government and the
need for us to do that. There are a number of recurring issues that are
just always gonna be there. Education is one of them, and so that&#39;s
something that we&#39;re gonna talk about. Regulatory environment is
another. We&#39;re gonna be talking about that. So a lot of these issues
recur and a lot of these issues are things that, that unfortunately, you
know, may not be so sexy but it&#39;s something that needs to be done. I
think one of the things that we want to do is to make sure that the
message is out there that we want to build on what we&#39;ve done over
the past four years and build on it in a way that we capitalize on the
fact that our unemployment rate has been cut almost in half. We
capitalize on the fact that there are almost 260 plus thousand people in
North Carolina working now that were not working four years ago. That we
capitalize on the, on the fact that our education reforms are beginning
to show great promise, particularly Read to Achieve and some of the
initiatives that have taken place that hopefully will improve the
outcomes for the kids as we go forward, so while I&#39;d like to be able
to stand up here and tell you that there&#39;s this great new initiative
out there and we&#39;ve got all kinds of money to pay for it, that&#39;s
just not where we are. I don&#39;t know it&#39;s where we&#39;re gonna
be. I know the governor is talking about infrastructure. I think
that&#39;s one of the things we&#39;ve not, other than the
Transportation Reform Measure, we&#39;ve not addressed in a way that I
think a lot of folks would like to see us address. I think capital may
be a new thing that folks start talking about a little more, but what
we&#39;ll do there and what that will look like remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you holding up two fingers because you&#39;ve got
two questions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I&#39;ve got two, but I&#39;ll
just ask the one, but it&#39;s for both of you. I&#39;m curious what you
think about Senator Brown&#39;s idea that the legislature take a look at
how sales tax is distributed in the state and perhaps change that so it
benefits our rural communities some more? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s,
when you talk about tax reform, that&#39;s one of several dozen issues
that crops up, and, you know, politicians in both parties have talked
for a number of

  <p id="75:00">about how North Carolina&#39;s changing as a state, and one of the ways
it&#39;s changing is that we are seeing a state that has pockets of
fairly substantial growth and prosperity and you have pockets that are
struggling. One of the lines that you mark there, in some respects, is
the difference between some of the urban, suburban, and rural areas of
the sate. One of the things that you see in that context is the sales
tax distribution. So I think it&#39;s something that&#39;s worth looking
at, whether or not there&#39;s support to make any kind of change or
substantial change there remains to be seen but it is something that
more and more people are talking about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know your wife-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, we&#39;ve got a 3:00 ??, or else I&#39;m in big trouble.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, there&#39;s been talk in Greensboro about possibly changing the
makeup of the city council straight from the board, changing how people
are elected, is that something you would support and if so, what would
it look like?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know, Senator Wade has taken the lead on that issue and I am hearing
some of the same concerns that she&#39;s been hearing, that have led her
to begin the process of talking about that. I&#39;m interested in what
her proposal looks like but I think there are some very good reasons for
making some changes and I think she may very well be on the right track.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You were asked earlier about being sued over some of the changes you
made, and of course one of the people suing you is the Governor, I think
fairly heard some frustration from, particularly your chamber, Senator
Berger, over the past couple years with them, but I also heard you did
say today that you&#39;re looking for him to put forth some proposals,
you&#39;re looking for him to take point. Can you give me a sense of,
after two years of working with this governor, have you figured out that
relationship, are you still figuring it out, and when he does bring you
those proposals, how much weight are they going to carry over here
considering some of the struggles that you&#39;ve had from time to time,
such as him suing you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was asked a question similar to this a couple weeks ago and I think
all relationships evolve and the governor and I have what I consider to
be a good working relationship. I think when he makes a proposal, there
are two things, one, you&#39;re cognizant of the fact it&#39;s the
governor that&#39;s made the proposal, so it&#39;s not the same thing
necessarily as you dreaming it up or something of that nature, so
it&#39;s important to pay attention to. The second thing is the quality
of the proposal. If we&#39;ve got a good proposal from the governor, I
think it will meet with a good response, if there&#39;s a proposal that
needs work then we&#39;ll try to work on it. I think we probably have
substantial agreement on things that need to be worked on, there are
differences, him and I are going to have differences on how to solve
certain things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you want to take a crack at that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I personally like the governor, supported the governor, and we obviously
will have some differences. The lawsuit over the Boards and Commissions
appointments is one of those, but as I&#39;ve said before, we work
together when we, to advance common initiatives we have in common but
then when there&#39;s a disagreement, we do so candidly with one
another, respectfully, see if we can reach a resolution, and if we
can&#39;t reach a resolution, I&#39;ll advocate for the House position
every time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The other thing, Mark, and you&#39;ve heard me say this before, I think
all of you probably have, I think the important thing is when all is
said and done, what are we doing to move the state forward? I just
don&#39;t think you can find, over a two year period, a situation where
a governor and a General Assembly have worked together more to advance
positive legislation that has made North Carolina a better place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

  <p id="85:00">I just hadn&#39;t paid that much attention to it, Mark. I think
that&#39;s been mainly an issue of interest here in Raleigh and any
other day it&#39;s a counsel of state issue unless we file something to
intervene. [speaker changes] That&#39;s the question that does seem
very??? [speaker changes]
No one has come to me asking anything, told me that ???  there&#39;s no
body beating my door down. [speaker changes]
?? saying that some of that ??? [speaker changes]
I really don&#39;t know. I apologize, if I did, I would tell you.
[speaker changes] Following on from the stuff about putting records
online, one of the proposals that your boys talked about ?during the
interview was medical examiners and getting death certificates
computerized but it&#39;s going to cost about five million I think was
the estimate that they gave from the medical examiners office so there
was so talk about money and any thoughts on that?
[speaker changes]
I haven&#39;t heard that cost projection, but we need to do it, and
again, as a small town attorney, I handle the state cases for ??? all
the time and if you&#39;ve got a situation where you&#39;re needing to
get a death certificate or something started because of some pressing
legal matters, the delay really is a problem. So we need to find a way
to fix it. Now whether it takes five million, that seems to me, I guess
in the big scheme of a twenty-one million dollar budget, that&#39;s not
much money, but I would think it would be a little cheaper than that. I
mean, ll you&#39;re talking about at some point is some person entering
data into a computer a little more quickly, and why it would cost five
million dollars, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve always thought that some of
these cost projections, how much things cost, maybe I&#39;m in the wrong
business, maybe I need to be doing whatever it is that making these
projections cost so much, it certainly doesn&#39;t happen in a small
town law practice. [speaker changes] Ready to go? [speaker changes]
Ready to go, yeah. Thanks ya&#39;ll appreciate it, be seeing you for a
few months. [speaker tells various individuals goodbye, chatter]
