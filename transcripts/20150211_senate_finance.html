  will take their seats, we will get things rolling. Welcome. That’s
always in order to do that, and I would like to thank our
Sergeant-At-Arms staff, of course. We have Terry Burnhart, Charles
Morales and Andrew Melias. I don’t see Andrew, but he’s standing by, and
there are no pages here today, so we will jump straight into the bill
that we’re going to hear. I understand this is a PCS, and Senator Rucho…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that we adopt the PCS for discussion on Senate
Bill 15. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 15 PCS, motion made by Senator
Rucho. All those in favor, please say “aye”. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed? Motion carried. Senator Rucho, you have the
floor to explain your PCS. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee. It’s good to be here again. Senate bill 15,
which is a PCS encompassing 15, 16 band 17. For efficiency we chose to
put it all together because of the fact that we want to get this moving.
I’m going to explain the titles, pretty much, of the three, and then I
ask staff, Mr. Chairman, if they’ll be kind enough to go through and
explain in detail, but what the part one does is it enhances the program
integrity, and ladies and gentlemen, what that really is looking for is
the unemployment insurance system and DES has had a policy of making the
payments and/or overpayments and then having to chase it down, and what
we’re trying to do is say “Let’s be sure upfront that that is indeed an
eligible person at a certain level and not have to waste all the money
chasing it,” so that’s going to be something with the GDAC and we hope
that that will improve the system. It’s doing well now; we expect it
will do a lot better when this is implemented. Second part is dealing
with the… would make the following changes, and in a sense, this is
pretty much what we passed the last time, on 1069 is my recollection,
and we’d all passed it out of here, agreed and sent it. It got lost with
the Governor’s veto, but what it does is it does photo ID requirement,
which is something we’re trying to get done; extending some deadlines –
extending some deadlines on the rules portion, which my understanding
from the Unemployment Insurance Oversight Committee, which again, this
is where this bill originated from. We passed it unanimously out, and
the DES is in the process of getting the rules approved in a very quick
manner, and hopefully at some point we can get an update, Mr. Chairman,
about what the status is on that. And the last part is part three, which
is clarifying the appointment process. On one of the earlier bills, we
actually put together a board of review, which is an independent board
which is essence allows the beneficiary who feels that they were not
treated properly as far as the decision process at ES to make a
decision, and what this does as by the independence, it really allows
them to have an independent review of their particular case. Hopefully
by being independent, it reduces the likelihood that the cases will go
on to court, which makes the system a lot simpler, and it also
establishes staggered terms, Now you have a three-member commission, and
under the circumstances, what we have is everyone goes off at the same
time. Makes no sense. We want to make sure that you have at least one or
two experienced people on the board as they rotate off. And the last
part of that one is we’re going to ratify the unemployment appeals
decisions of that commission so that there’ll be no misunderstandings
that they’re not legal decisions. Mr. Chairman, I’d ask staff to go into
more detail if possible. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Rucho.
Staff, ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I do. I’ve had some good
medicine and I’m ready to go. As Senator Rucho said, this bill contains…
most of this bill are the provisions that this body ratified last
session in House Bill 1069 but that the Governor vetoed. I briefly was
going to point out the three new items, and then if the Chair would
like, we have staff that can go into detail some. The first part of this
bill, as Senator Rucho noted, is new. The Unemployment Oversight
Committee spent some time looking and talking with the Division of
Employment Security about improper payments, and as you know, this body
has

  <p id="05:00">
  Devoted a lot of resources to trying to help agencies talk one with the
other through GDAT, the Government Analytics Development Center. So what
this, the first part of this bill does, is just to require the division
to do certain things, to report on certain items, to try to make sure
that these resources are being adequately used. And that is the reason
that this bill has a sequential referral to the information technology
committee. The second thing that this bill does, that 1069 did not
address, was the extension of the deadline for the division to adopt its
rules. The division has been operating without rules since December 31
of 2012. So the committee spent time at each meeting, talking to the
division about this problem. Through the course of the interim, the
division has been working closely with OSVM and with the rules review
committee, and we are confident that they are on track to have permanent
rules adopted by July. In fact, the rules will be in the register on
March the second. So what this bill does that the 1069 did not do is to
extend that deadline of December 31, 2012 to May 20th of 2015. That is a
date that all parties know will be met. And lastly, with the board of
review, the committee wanted to be sure that not only was the board of
review an independent body, but that it had sufficient staff and so the
changes in that part of the bill from House Bill 1069 just notes that
not only the board of review but its staff must work independently, and
it requires commerce and the board of review to give a written report to
your appropriations committees by May 1st of this year, so if any
budgetary concerns are there, those bodies will be able to know it as
they put together their budgets for this ??. So Mr. Chairman, those are
the new items in the bill and if you would like, we can give you a
detailed explanation of each part. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Ms.
Avery. I’ll turn it back over to Senator Rucho and that is at his
disposal. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. I would trust that we could
open up to the committee for questions, if there are any. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Members of the committee, any questions or comments?
Senator Ron Rabin, not to be confused with the chair or the vice-chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I think this is a really good bill, well
thought-out and put together. In a very sound way. But I did in the
reading of the content, come up with three questions, probably for staff
just to try to either, is there or ain’t there and if it ain’t there
then there’s three things that might want to be there. The first one
deals with, as we go through finding the waste, fraud and abuse, and I
think the system is set the way it is in the law to do that, is there
someplace that we address what’s the penalty for the offenders now that
we’ve discovered who they are? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Avery. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes sir, that is in the statute. And if, I will locate it and
answer that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, I just, it wasn’t apparent to me
when I went through it. But if it’s there, then that covers that one. I
was a little bit concerned in the photo ID world also, because I find
that it’s very explicit with regard to what kinds of photo ID are valid.
And then there’s a little clause, the last bullet or the last alphabet
number that’s in there, sort of opens a loophole and I’m wondering if it
would be a good idea to include the kinds of things that would not be
accepted, so that it’s not up to someone’s discretion as we go through
it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Avery. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Greg Rooney can
address that, and the division is here as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
Senator’s correct. The last item, there is a catch-all in the list that
gives DES the authority to accept other types of government-issued ID.
But it’s not any ID, it does have to be a government-issued ID. And so,
it doesn’t give them the discretion I guess to take something that
wasn’t issued by, I’d have to go to that place in the bill, but it lists
like the United States, another state, a commonwealth of the United
States, a territory of the United States, so there are some parameters
on the discretion of DES but the idea was that rather than come up with
a list of every possible type of identification because DES is currently
accepting types of identification that are not on the

  <p id="10:00">
  There are some oddball federal identification cards that are issued by
the US government that are not on the list and so that catchall was to
allow them to authorize the use of things that they&#39;re currently
accepting now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s
fine but I still think that somewhere in there there ought to be
examples of stuff that would not be accepted because of the loophole in
there and the last thing in the third part deals with the board, okay,
it says in there that one person has to represent employees, one person
has to represent employers and then there&#39;s someone who represents
the general public and I&#39;m wondering if it might be well to put some
words in there to suggest we don&#39;t want to overload to either
employee or employer like some sort of professional or academic body or
something like that. I&#39;m at a loss to figure out how to fix it but
coming back to it so we don&#39;t get another [?? crosstalk] [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator, good question, and I will say to you that the governor
makes those appointments into those categories and he was able to manage
that clearly. We&#39;ve got some excellent people that are on that right
now. I think it&#39;s enough where no one group will control it.
It&#39;s all even and balanced and hopefully they can continue to do the
job that they&#39;ve done up to this point and there is actually, Mr.
Chairman, three other resolutions that will actually be confirmations of
each of those individuals at a separate, probably on another committee
other than ours because they have not been able to be properly confirmed
and so what we&#39;re doing is getting the structure in place with this
bill and the confirmations will occur in another committee and that will
pretty much validate the fact that they are indeed properly validated by
the law and secondly setting those standard terms so that we can be sure
as this commission moves forward there will be no loss of experience in
one year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Rucho. A brief note, we
do have a page, Briana Yeoho, who&#39;s sponsored by Senator Brown.
Welcome to the Senate this week. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Tillman, you have a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. I was interested in the first question that Senator
Rabin had and I found that there are penalties and there are ways of
collecting, but I did [??] there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir.
Senator Barringer, you have a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chair. I applaud this. This is good. Anytime we can cut out fraud
it&#39;s great, but I am skeptical of government data systems. Will
there be any delay in payments at all in implementing this protection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] There should not, no,
ma&#39;am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, Senator Blue, you have a question,
sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is  there any, and
I&#39;m referring to page three at the beginning of line, any definition
as to what a job contact is? [SPEAKER CHANGES] There aren&#39;t and I
didn&#39;t explicitly go into that because that&#39;s in previous, but
you can either for staff or PGS, they have an answer to this question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, DES has talked about this at the oversight
committee meetings and so a contact could be as minimal as applying for
a job on the web, and so that was part of the policy argument in favor
of moving towards five job contacts per week because someone could sit
at a computer in the modern world and just send out a resume five times
and that would be sufficient, so the thinking was the number of job
contacts per week should be increased because it didn&#39;t really
require somebody to go through any great effort to satisfy a job
contact. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. And I understand that, of course,
by the same token even in Wake County, there are people who don&#39;t
have instant access to the web, but will do whatever is necessary to

  [SPEAKER 1] Seek work, if it means catching a ride downtown once a week
going place to place to get jobs then you&#39;re right the context
within which I was trying to raise this question was with the
requirement with five job context. And I just wanna make sure that we
don&#39;t make it impossible for folk who aren&#39;t--aren&#39;t middle
income people who don&#39;t have computers readily available, and people
who don&#39;t quite frankly have the-the transportation. Let me follow
up on one other thing though because what I&#39;m interested in this,
did you consider incorporating in to this bill some kind of trigger
because at some point I&#39;m assuming that we&#39;re going to stop the
accelerated collection from employers? To make up the difference in the
tax that was owed, the taxes that were owed. So I&#39;m wondering what
you&#39;re thinking, Senator Rucho, about triggering reduction? And if
it&#39;s not in this or you&#39;re contemplating doing something pretty
soon-
[SENATOR RUCHO] You are talking about, question, you&#39;re talking
about triggering the reduction in the--
[SPEAKER 1] In the rates-
[SENATOR RUCHO] Unemployment and insurance payments from the employers
?? ?
[SPEAKER 1] Yes sir.
[SENATOR RUCHO] It&#39;s automatic, it&#39;s on the previous bill. And
my understanding is as of May of this year we will have payed off the
entire debt. And then that means an automatic reduction from where it is
today to what is the normal 42 dollars per employee per year. So the
businesses will start as of January of 16, because that&#39;s done on an
annual basis. They will start to enjoy a lower rate so that they can
potentially have more money and hire more employees and then secondly we
will continue on the-the state portion and try to generate upwards of a
billion dollars in revenue reserves for when the next recession comes
into place.
[SPEAKER 1] One last follow up on that, is the billion dollars the magic
number? Or is it formulaic driven?
[SENATOR RUCHO] This was part of the overall review when we put together
the entire package, which you were aware of, and as we were building it
and our payments that was one that we at the department felt was a
number that we could live with.
[SPEAKER 2] Senator Bryant?
[SENATOR BRYANT] Thank you Chairman. I was wondering if the sponsor or
somebody on staff, whichever is best, could just give me a brief review
of the appeal process because I notice we&#39;re eliminating this
reconsideration and I can&#39;t--and there looks like there might be a
couple of other changes I noticed they talk about a superior case or
something that came into play? Could somebody just review what it is now
and what we&#39;re changing? ??
[SENATOR RUCHO] I-I will take on the first part of that in this and what
the appeal process we&#39;re eliminating is. You have a decision made by
the ?? staff and then the appeal says the same staff will make another
decision, and what we&#39;ve done is said why do you have the same group
try to make a different decision? So we move that to the, to the
independent commission, that they will have an independent review of
that case that is not related, be it that it&#39;s independent of DES
three judge group, by a three member group. And hopefully they&#39;ll
know one way or another, different than the DES, if it&#39;s validated
or it needs to be changed. It&#39;s just trying to streamline the system
to make it simpler and it actually, with this commission place, the
independent commission is probably fairer for those individual to get a
fair hearing on their concerns.
[SPEAKER 2] Thank you Senator Rucho, Senator ?? follow up your ??
[SENATOR BRYANT] Is there anything else involved in this process, this
appeal to this board review. Do you have to pay anything or is it no
cost?
[SPEAKER 3] Thank you, Senator Clark?
[SENATOR CLARK] ?? ?? a support of staff ??
[SPEAKER 3] Certainly.
[SENATOR CLARK] Page 9 lines 8-16--
[SPEAKER 3] Repeat that line, please sir.
[SENATOR CLARK] Page 9 lines 8-16, could you please read those--read
from that section please?
[SPEAKER 4] Yes sir Mr. Chairman, this is the process for confirmation
of members of the review, that the governor appoints, confirmed by the
general assembly. As you may recall there was--the governor was late in
making his appointments and that was something that was frustrating to
the unemployment insurance oversight committee. So what this bill
attempts to do and what 10 69 attempted to do was to set up a more of a
schedule, so that things could be followed and people

  <p id="20:00">
  Appointments weren’t made in a certain time, that there was an avenue to
make sure the process continued. Specifically on lines 8 through 16.
This would require the Governor to submit the name of the person he
would like, he or she would like to appoint to the board of review by
May 1st of the year that that term would expire. The term would expire
on June 30th. So the Governor would submit the name to the General
Assembly by May 1st. The General Assembly would have until May 30th to
confirm that person. If the General Assembly fails to act, fails to
confirm the person then in essence it has not been confirmed and the
Governor would need to resubmit another name. If the Governor fails to
send a name to the General Assembly by May 1st, then it becomes the
prerogative of the General Assembly to make that appointment and the
bill would provide that in odd-numbered years it would, the president
pro tempore would, it would be upon the recommendation of the president
pro tempore and on the even-numbered years it would be upon the
recommendation of the speaker of the house. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Senator ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Mr. Chair? Does this process
effectively give the General Assembly veto power over the Governor’s
nominees? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It gives them the confirmation process, so
if they are not confirmed, then they are not duly appointed. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So if I understand this correctly, if the General Assembly
decides not to act on the Governor’s nominee, then that, essentially
that position becomes vacated. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct, and
the Governor would need to send a new name to the General Assembly for
confirmation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not send the same name, even though it
was the General Assembly that chose not to act on the name. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That would be correct. If the General Assembly [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So effectively, the General Assembly would have veto power over
the Governor’s nominee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Clark, it’s not necessarily that. It’s, what it is, is
that the General Assembly can have a no-confidence vote or a no
confirmation vote. It’s basically allowing the Governor to recognize
that the General Assembly was not happy with that confirmation and
rather than putting any Governor in the position of being embarrassed,
it’s basically saying, “Come back with another name.” So you can either
have a no-confirmation vote or, and submit another person. So it’s not
doing anything to take away the Governor’s power. The General Assembly,
under the way this commission is, and it’s modeled after the utility
commission, the banking commission, what am I missing? The industrial
commission. They all go through the confirmation process, just like this
will. So there’s no effort at all on anyone’s behalf, to take away that
authority. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Rucho. Senator McKissick,
your question or comment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a pretty
straightforward one. I think most of my questions have been answered.
But the provision here authorizing to disclose social security numbers
to DES for purpose of verifying employment and claimant identity, I take
it we do not have that authority at this time? Is that what I’m to
understand by this provision being included in the bill and has it been,
I mean is it going to be a problem with DMV? I don’t think they have all
social security numbers for all licensed drivers, but I could be
mistaken. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All I can say to you is that the department
asked for this because they were having troubles identifying and
validating that an individual is indeed the person. They’ve had a number
of cases where there were fraudulent claims and part of it was that they
really couldn’t prove that that was the individual. This will go take a
giant step forward, to allowing them to have that, that opportunity to
validate that that potential recipient is indeed who they are supposed
to. And apparently from what I understood, even out of Washington, they
are very comfortable with this effort, as far as the Department of
Labor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So what I’m understanding is, Washington is
encouraging us, or they’re comfortable with this provision, I should
say. But more importantly, it’s to eliminate identity fraud. Is that
what we’re getting to? Where somebody, maybe a claimant for benefits,
using somebody else’s name and this will be a way to cross-reference it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct. And Secretary Fallwell, during the
commission, the oversight commissions meeting identified that there were
some serious problems, and this is another step to make sure that it is
properly run. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Senator Stein. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Given that the
Governor vetoed this about, last session because of the affect on his
appointees, does this address the Governor’s concern and have we heard

  From his office, his likely reaction to this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My understanding is that the fact is this is
different. It&#39;s been smoothed out, it&#39;s been simplified so that
there&#39;s no misunderstanding. Whether the Governor supports it or
doesn&#39;t support it, well, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll have an opportunity
