[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister President and members of the Senate.
 Unfortunately I didn’t get this up to the ??  previously I have an
amendment sort of an ?? amendment to 1133 that I’d like sent forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Send forward your amendment.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Senator Hartsell moves to amend the bill.  Senator
Hartsell is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Thank you Mister President and members of the
Senate.  What we have done in this omnibus amendment which hopefully
will be on your on the dashboard, in my old age, I apologize, I keep
forgetting terms, especially their new terms, but ?? before we have
tried to clear up several of the issues raised here in rules or on the
floor yesterday.  This is a single omnibus amendment, which does the
following; it addresses the issue of vapor products in jails in a
fashion that I think will assist and is consistent with what we’ve tried
to arise.  We deleted two sections that were actually adopted yesterday
in Senate Bill 773.  We have modified a date on a report for the state
Board of Education, we have adopted language that is consensus language
with the between the estate personnel office and the state employees and
I believe that’s it.  I would commend it to you.  Hope you have an
opportunity, I don’t know of any objection to any of this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Further discussion or debate on amendment one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Mister President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Senator Jenkins, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    To ask Senator Hartsell a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Senator Hartsell do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Senator Hartsell first sort as a side note, if you
have any questions about technical terms you could check with your
friend Senator Bingham.  He would be up-to-date on all of those.  The
parts of the bill we to out yesterday that dealt with the department of
commerce, what are we doing those?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That’s not in this amendment; there will be a second
amendment it is being prepared to address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Further discussion or debate on amendment one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Mister President?  Senator Robinson what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    To ask the bill sponsor a question,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Senator Hartsell do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Senator Hartsell, thank you, in the reference
yesterday the section was 57,  page 53 that exempts article 3 and 3C of
chapter 143, which has to do with contracting the states provisions for
contracting with minority women in business enterprises that percentage,
so that’s not in your amendment?  Can you speak to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    That is one of the amendments that were waiting,
drafting; I'm waiting to get that second omnibus amendment dealing with
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Okay.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Senator McKissick hold on just a moment.  Let the
record
reflect that Senator Newton is in the chamber.  Senator McKissick, for
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    To ask Senator Hartsell a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    He yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Hartsell I was at a meeting here on the
dashboard the information here dealing with state employees.  Can you
explain exactly what we are doing in this particular provision here that
is different from what it was previously, interested in a career status,
what this language purports to accomplish?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Mister President if I might, it’s a little unusual,
I would like to defer to my good friend Senator Tucker, to answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Senator Tucker, sir would you yield to respond to a
question from Senator McKissick?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Yes sir if I can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  He yields, Senator McKissick could you restate your
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes I was just questioning what these provisions
purport to accomplish as release that</p>

...status of state employees. It looks as if this changing some terms
and conditions relating to their status as employees and it’s addressed
in sections 55.3 as well as the preceding sections here if I were to
thumb down on my dash, going down further to section 55.3 and that
entire section, particularly subsection 3.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Answer, Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, in this, both SEANC and HR have looked at this. They
feel that an employee has two years, but less than ten year of ?? to
service and moves to an exempt position will be covered by the
subsection that still protects them as a state employee under the state
personnel act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In terms of...first you said, SEANC has approved this, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct. We sent it over, the House Committee, according to their
rules, had to hear it again. At that time, Senate raised issues. HR and
SEANC got together, their attorney, Mr. Harris, they went back and
forth. They cleared the language to make sure that there was, I guess
from your perspective, no reduction of protection for the state
employees. They have come to agreement on that and everybody's fine and
there’s no opposition to this section.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on amendment one. Hearing none, the

Senator Brock is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, this would make a
change in the reporting requirement for a schedule 5 drug, which is a
non-opiate, non-narcotic controlled substance. What this will do is
allow a physician to give us seven day sample to a patient to see how it
will work before it’s actually reported. That would save the...before we
start getting into the heavier dosage or more addictive medicines, this
one is a better medicine, not as addictive and they can try that out at
first to give a seven day before you take the drug and have a heavier
drug that’s out there used by the patient. I urge your support for it.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, I’d like to say, and I

Howard Bryan, years ago. I think only Senator Alran would remember
Howard Bryan, who found more typos than anybody that I’ve ever run
across. But it should be the word is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.

technical amendment to the technical amendment. And might be able to

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Send
forward your amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Newton moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton’s
recognized to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President. Colleagues. This is an amendment to the, I believe it’s
section 23.5A, should be up on your dashboards. Simply put, there’s been
a problem with the reporting requirements that we as a legislature
passed in the last session on instant background checks for purchases of
firearms. There’s been a problem since we instituted that provision,
where we strengthened it. The clerk’s office and the AOC have been
unable to effectively carry out our mandate, which began July 1, 2014.
The bill as it originally, as it’s written right now, would simply
repeal that provision, and I do not agree with that. I do not think
repeal is the appropriate way to go. I think if we repeal it, AOC will
never put in place what we need, the interface that needs to be done to
have these reports made so that we can all be confident as legislators
and all of our citizens can be confident that the background checks are
reliable. So I propose this amendment, which simply put, will delay the
implementation of this mandate to January 1, 2015, and makes it, gives
time for AOC to report to us about what it is they can actually do and
requires the clerk’s office to do everything that they can do as far as
reporting. I’m happy to answer any questions, but I want to make it
clear and plain to you that if we, in my opinion if we do not change
this provision, what we’re doing is voting to repeal the strengthening
of our background check system and if you vote for the amendment, you
are allowing time to get it right. Happy to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or further debate on amendment 4.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, do you
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’m completely in agreement with what you’re trying to get done
here. My only question has to do with the calendar. We put this
requirement on them, that may not be practicable from the clerks’
perspective. But you’re trying to create an incentive for them to come
up with an answer and for them to report back to us. But by having it
take effect on January 1, 2015, it means that it will take effect
January 1, 2015 and we as a legislative body won’t have had an
opportunity to come up with a fix if a fix is derived through their
reporting to us. So what I wanted to see was whether you’d be willing to
move it to July 1, 2015 because that gives us at least a couple months
of legislative session to fix it. Otherwise the clerks have an
obligation that they may simply be unable to meet, as a matter of
practice and law. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Stein. We’ve
talked about that. I personally and I think Senator Randleman and others
are not in agreement to do that and I want to explain why. Because</p>

<p id="35:00">
Reasonable view that you hold. The problem is is that we passed this
legislation a year ago. And AOC and I'm, I'm gonna call them out in my
opinion has totally flopped and failed to do anything about really
solving and coming up with a fix. And so I, I personally, and I think
others agree, that if we kick the can that far down the road, what they
wanted was a repeal so they would never have to it. That's what I think
happened is that they were behind the language to repeal it outright. So
I'm not willing to give them that much time. They've already had a year,
and what this amendment requires is that they report to the JPS
oversight committee on October 1 of this year. What it is that they
propose to do and what can be done. And then following that is when the
January 1 requirement would come into place. We, we ease, and I'm sorry,
but I had to pull out my reading glasses here, we do ease the
requirement to say what can practically be transmitted is if you, if you
read on line eight I believe it is of the amendment, and that is an
easing of the burden on the clerk, so that, because we want, as of, as
soon as possible them to be sending everything they can send and
everything that ?? we'll take, and there may be one or two areas that we
previously said they have to do it that they practically can't do it,
and we want to send everything they can. And I'm afraid that if we go to
fifteen, they'll figure out how to never get around to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A point of personal privilege out of order?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to send up a senatorial statement please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forward your statement. Senator Goolsby is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister President. This senatorial statement honors the recent
passing of Franklin Irvin Williams senior. He is a man in my local
community, has lived in Wilmington since about 1958. He served in this
body when he was appointed back on July 14, I'm sorry, June the fourth
of 1985 by Governor James Martin to fill a vacancy. Senator Williams
received his doctorate in pharmacy from the University of Georgia in
1958. He was born originally in Duplin County, but after he got his
doctorate in pharmacy he came to Wilmington, established William's
Pharmacy, and then later became a pharmacy consultant. He was a member
of numerous boards and commissions in Wilmington throughout the years.
You would see him at just about every single Republican function along
with his lovely wife Marilyn who survived him. He was a member of the
United States Army National Guard. He served from 1949 to 1961, was
called back to, back to active duty during the Korean War from 1951 to
1953, and during that time he was promoted to the rank of Master
Sergeant. He was a faithful member of the Winter Park Presbyterian
Church. He served there as a deacon and taught Sunday School over the
years. Like I told you, he passed on July the 14th. He was honored
yesterday in Wilmington as I understand it with a memorial service. I
could not attend because I was up here on these duties. He passed away
at the age of 82 years old. Like I said, my</p>
