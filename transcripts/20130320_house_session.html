further extends the protection of thousands of veterans who filed their
discharge papers as they were instructed at their local courthouses and
to prevent their social security numbers and other personal information
from being available to the general public. And it simply extends the
timeframe of that protection such that someone living beyond the time
they came off active duty plus 50 years, it extends it to 80, so that
the protection and the propensity of all cases outlives the person
themselves, so that their information is not vulnerable. Thank you.

...Indication from the clerk. I'd like to send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar moves to amend the bill on page
2, line 12 by, between by deleting registry and substituting register.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. The first part of that, as the reading clerk
indicated, was the change based on the Department on Cultural Resources
advising us that we had a technical matter. The more important section
is lines 6, 7, and 8 of the amendment, and this adds a section that says
where the regulations adopted pursuant to this article governing the
permitted uses of land or structures subject to North Carolina
residential code for one and two-family dwellings. This should resolve
the issue that some folks had raised, in terms of being worried about
boarding houses and nonresidential uses coming forward as a result of
the legislation. Obviously, that would not be the intent of the bill
sponsors, and this just adds an additional restriction that makes it
very clear that municipalities are able to pass regulations pursuant to
the articles governing the permitted uses for residential one and
two-family structures, dwellings. I would appreciate your support on the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion? Further debate on the amendment?
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the amendment
sent forth by Representative Dollar for the House Committee Substitute
of House Bill 150. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 116
having voted in the affirmative and 1 in the negative, the amendment
passes. Now we're back on the bill. Representative Luebke, please state
your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I will be
brief because, as you remember, we had a long debate on this yesterday,
on this bill. I am, I continue to be troubled about the issue of the
neighborhood overlay. We talked yesterday about the situation in Chapel
Hill and my own district in Durham, and Representative Terry is
concerned about this situation whence in Salem. I will say, for the
body, for all to hear, Representative Dollar and I have had a
conversation about it and, I guess, it's fair to say he's, I don't want
to put words in your mouth, Representative Dollar, but I think you'd
like to keep looking at it and, maybe, try to address our concerns. For
myself, and whenever I'm not really sure, protective language is going
to go in the bill because the Senate may not agree to it. Once it leaves
here, it's in the Senate's hands. I would urge members to continue to
vote against the bill if you are concerned about situations where
neighborhoods go to the city council, or the town council and ask for
protection. That's different from what the emphasis that Representative
Dollar has put on the bill. But if you think about the second part of
it, neighborhoods asking for protection, that is not yet explicitly
supported in this bill, and for that reason, members I'd urge you to
vote no on the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Terry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. And I do share a bit of concern
that you have heard expressed by Representative Luebke. And basically,
my concern is that property owners' rights to purchase a home that has
lasting value, not diminishing value, is where I have difficulty, and I
believe to some degree, that Representative Dollar has presented an
amendment that speaks to that, to the extent that perhaps it allays the
concern of the neighborhood. So, I would respectfully and reluctantly
not attempt to amend any further. But I still reserve an awful lot of
concern regarding both the rights of raising value rather than
diminishing value. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion? Further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute to House Bill 150 as amended on its third reading. All in
favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.</p>

Copies of those. I looked at statistics. Here's a death statitics for
you. 10 people a day die from this cause. 2 people a day are children
under the age of 14. Is is melanoma, no its drowning. I haven't seen
anybody come to us and ask for a bill that will ban children's use of
swimming pools or any other bodies of water. Yet that's over 600 kids a
year dying from this. Beta for me falls into three categories. Its
either an hypothesis which is an educated guess. Its a theory which is a
lot of hypothesis put together and tested repeatedly. Or it is a law,
which we observe but we cant tell you why it does what it does.  Which
is why you're sticking to the ground when you walk. Because of gravity.
The supporters of this bill said there is no such thing as a safe or
healthy tan. Then we must have had a lot of neanderthals passing away
for sun exposure. Because they didn't have vitamin d supplements. They
didn't have the knowledge that it was bad for them and to stay out of
it. Thats a kind of extreme language, it really makes it difficult
sometimes for people to take the sort of positions that they do on
bills. You've received the hand out about melanoma being contributable
to sunbed use for systematic review in that analysis. You understand
what an analysis is. Its simply a gathering together of a lot of studies
and then making a ruling or understanding based on what they prove. I
have in my hand a study that I looked at which stated. The main cause of
contagious malignant melanoma has been contributed as commonly caused by
sun exposure but the matter is in dispute. This particular study was
probably not included in the meta-analysis. And with my training i have
to ask why and I have to make a decision based on my answer to myself.
Secondly once we go through the necessity, we get all the facts. Then it
becomes our responsibility down here to make a policy change. We have to
understand what we're doing. We are trying in this body literally to
control peoples lives or to mold their behavior. And determine what we
think is best for them to do. If this was a field or an area where we
had no regulations I would be the first one to cast a yes vote. We have
regulations however. They were put in in 2004 and they are that anyone
up to the age of 14 has to have a physicians written prescription to
visit a suntanning bed. And up to age of 18 they have to have their
parents written permission. And I just want to let you know that when
you see my name on a bill or on a vote, that you realize why I vote the

However, with the FACTUAL information that we have about tanning beds,
and the problems that they can cause, I don't see how you could vote
against this bill regarding the policy or anything else. When someone's
18 years old and they can make that decision on their own as a full
adult, have at it. But when they're a child, they're a child. And that's
the way it is. I'm thankful that I don't have skin cancer. But if ANY of
you DIDN'T go to that screening, make an appointment with your doctor
and have a checkup. It is very important. My mother is a 16-year breast
cancer survivor. My father, before he passed, had prostate cancer. I'm a
hypochondriac where this type of thing is concerned; and I was going to
going to go immediately anyway, but Monday it was taken care of. But, I
urge you to support the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the

The Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This Body, in 2004, had a bunch of ?? in the
bill that passed regulating tanning beds for 14 years and under. We're
asking today to change that to 18 years and under. Not a big change, but
a lot of big news has come along in the last ten years or so since this
bill was originally passed. There was a reason that the bill was done in
2004. The reasons were, whereas most indoor tanning salons bulbs provide
a significant amount of UVA/UVB radiation, those types which are found
in the outdoor sun can cause various types of damage to the skin that
may lead to skin cancer. And whereas past studies have suggested, the
tanning beds contribute to instances of melanoma. In a recent study in
the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, it indicates the use of
tanning devices may also contribute to the instance of melanoma skin
cancers, and dermatologists across the country are alarmed with the
number of teenagers and young adults who continue to patronize tanning
salons; regardless of studies that correlate between sun exposure and a
wide array of skin cancers, and so on. This bill passed; it was
incumbent upon this Body and others looking at this to continue to look
at the data as it came in. Other studies have been cited by this medical
journal, which had other articles involving non-melanoma skin cancers
that are rising at an alarming rate. I leave you with Plato's comments,
2500 years ago: &quot;We can easily forgive a child who's afraid of the
dark. The real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the
light.&quot; Thank you, and I support this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McElraft, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. When the lobbyists and one of our wonderful
dermatologists came by my office, I invited them in and smiled at them
and I said, &quot;I know what you're here for, and I appreciate it, but
I'm absolutely a 'no'. I believe in parental rights, I believe parents
know best for their children, and I believe that tanning beds are safe
for children. After all, I've read the literature.&quot; And after
listening, and trying to figure out why a dermatologist would take the
time, when it's her business to make money off of people who have
cancer, I started listening more intently. And then I realized that she
was there because she had a passion for her patients, and a compassion
for them. And she truly believed that tanning beds were harmful to these
children. I changed my mind, and I'm going to vote &quot;yes&quot; on
this bill. You don't put sunscreen on because it's not an intense heat,
you're not reminded that it IS harmful to your skin. When you go out in
the sun at a beach, you put your sunscreen on; you're protected more.
But in the sunning tan bed, for children, they're not going to be
reminded they need to put their sunscreen on. Parents are not aware of
the literature that we've all been made aware of by the kind
dermatologists that took their time to come down here, and the lobbyists
who have done their job to let us know this information. It is our job,
when we have this information, to protect those children. I hope you
will consider that, and vote &quot;yes.&quot;

Debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]The Gentleman is recognized to debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]I'm so glad to hear that our brother Mitch is
not cancerous. I on the other hand have had numerous things taken off of
me and they we're all cancerous. A couple on my back. One on my chest.
They had to go to go about four times on the bridge of my nose to get
that one to stop growing. And one were I actually had a chunk taken out
of me and stitches up here just this past fall. I've never been in a
tanning bed. I used to go out to you know, I grew up in Newborn. I used
to go down to the Atlantic beach all the time and lie our there all
afternoon, all day. With no suntan lotion or anything like that and then
come home and put Noxzema on it, which now they say is the worst thing
you can do, and swear I'd never do it again and then I went right back
and did it again. I even got sun poisoned one time. In spite of all
that, I was gonna actually offer an amendment to this bill to put
parental consent in there and I talked to Mark Hallo about it, and he
convinced me not to do that. And I'm saying all this to say I have a
very strong commitment to parental authority. Which makes me very
nervous that here we go again telling parents what decisions they can
make and what they can't make for their children. And so I, have
difficulty with this bill and I'm probably going to catch some flak for
it if I vote for it and just to tell you the truth. I'm just telling
your where I am. I ain't made up my mind yet. So I hope some of you all
can convince me one way or the other. But I'm just, I'm very nervous
about making decisions for parents. I'll just have to say that. I'm very
nervous anytime the government starts making decisions for our citizens
that they ought to be making for themselves. So, I guess it sounds like
I'm gonna vote against the bill but I'm just not sure yet. So, I'm
listening very, with great interest. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Well,
Representative Pittman you've inspired at least four other people to
speak. Representative Avila please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]To speak a second time on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady is
recognized to debate the bill a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]I just to
address a couple of comments that was made and first of all
Representative Setzer, I'm thankful for you that you were not diagnosed
as cancerous and everybody in here should have a regular screening. I
do, because believe it or not I am at risk of melanoma if I get in the
sun. You wouldn't think it looking at me with brown hair and brown eyes.
But I am. And I have a full body check out once a year. So all of you do
that. In terms of Representative Stam's statement earlier about the
benefits of swimming, there are benefits to the sun as well. It's called
vitamin D and it's not always getting as much through our diet as we
would like and we take supplements. But the thought is also safe from
that stand point because one of the things that bothers me about
removing the restrictions that we have and basically saying that you
can't do it, is just the same thing that we have when we've told
teenagers that you can't smoke. You and I both know that they do. What
we've asked now to do is remove any kind of check and balance on our
children in a tanning bed. They're free to go any where they want to go
to get a tan. Forever how long and you've heard Representative Pittman
describe how a lot of them are going to do it. Where, with the structure
that we have currently they're in a controlled environment. These people
educate them. They analyze their skin. They talk with them about the
time they should be there and why they shouldn't. Do we need to improve
the education? By all means. We need to emphasize mightily within the
industry the dangers, and not ignore the facts that you need to know
about cancer risks. But we're not getting that if our kids are laying on
the beach. Representative Fulghum ended with a quote, and I'll do the
same. I'ts Paracelsus, and his words were. Poison is in everything. And
no thing is without poison. The dosage makes it either a poison or a
remedy. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Ladies and Gentleman of the house

[Speaker Change]
Mr. Speaker and members of the House, I had four daughters, the
daughters had teenage years. Those were very challenging years. We had
discussions about tanning beds many times around our dinner table. Many
times I lost that debate because they convinced me that they had the
prom to get ready for, or some other special event. And I would sign to
allow them to go to the tanning bed. Tanning beds are not good for
teenagers. They do have an alternative which we eventually figured out
and moved to and that is spray tans. So when daughters want to get all
gussied up and look for the fancy dress and shoes to go to that prom or
some special event, they can go to the tanning areas and get spray tans
and that does just fine for their purpose. So I also support this Bill.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Steve Ross, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
I too have four daughters and I discovered the same thing. Real life
story, real quick, and I’ll be brief. Fifteen years ago, as some of you
know, I had my little bout with cancer. Went down to Duke University and
went through treatment. First day I was down there I was sitting there,
went in and had some lab work. I came back out and I was sitting in the
waiting room. I don’t know how many of you have been down in the waiting
room down at the Cancer Center at Duke, but it’s kind of a somber place.
When I came out I sat down. I sat down next to a young girl, twenty one
years old. And I looked around the room and everybody else was at least
my age or older. And I looked at her and I said, to make conversation I
said, you must have a parent or a grandparent that you brought down
today. She looked at me and said, no sir. She said I’m here for myself.
I said, really. I said if you don’t mind, what for? She said I have a
spot on my arm. I said, well spot on your arm, that’s probably not to
serious. And she looked at me and said, no. She said it’s something
called a melanoma. And she said that the doctor told me I don’t have
much hope. And I never forgot that. I went home after that and my
daughters were never allowed to go to a tanning bed. And we discovered
the spray tan. But that’s, that’s a real life story. It does happen.
Unless you’ve been on the side where you seen it, or felt it, it’s just
hard to understand. But that’s, that’s something I’ll never forget and I
support this Bill. Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]

[Speaker Change]
The gentleman’s recognized to debate the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and I’ll be very brief. I’ve sat through this
issue in both Health and Human Services and Regulatory Reform and I am
sensitive to the argument that Representative Pittman Made. I know it
puts many of us in a difficult position in that, in one sense we have a
conservative view on government. I think it came up in one of the
meetings that, well we’re pushing an anti-State. And I think we’re
sensitive to that. We don’t want to see big government influence coming
in and telling families and everybody else what they have to do. But I
have to tell you I have to look at this from the standpoint of a
healthcare professional as well and I think some of the other comments
have already been eloquent when it comes to healthcare. And the question
I rose in caucus was, well if you really believe that then we need to
repeal the laws against commercial selling of tobacco and cigarettes to
minors. I mean, I think there’s an appropriate place to draw the line.
And everybody might not agree where that line is. And it comes up all
along when there are issues like seatbelts for instance, or smoking, or
whatever. But my point was, if you’re going to be a purist about it, you
know, then you got to let your children go to the supermarket and buy
cigarettes. You know, as it is now, if a parent wants to go and buy
those cigarettes and take it home and give it to their children to
smoke, they can do that. And as this law stands, if a parent truly
believes that it’s in the child’s best interest to be able to have a
tanning bed and do that at home then they can do that. But I think there
is a great preponderance of evidence that it is not good for children to
go to tanning beds. And that there’s a much higher incidence of melanoma
and I think pretty much throughout the medical professions anyway, there
seems to be no doubt about that. Now I know there are those that will
argue that, but I just wanted to address this issue of the anti-State.</p>

is concerned, we have to come down on the greater good. And for that
reason I do support the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to ask Representative Hollo a question, if I
might.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hollo, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not even going to state which way I'm going to
vote on this bill because I really do not care to influence anybody
'vote on this. I just had a question, though, based on my personal
experience. When I was, I still suffer somewhat, from psoriasis, but
when I was very, very young, I had a, not very young, teenage years
probably. I had an outbreak that was bad and required me to go to a
dermatologist's office and go in their stand up tanning booth for a
number of sessions. It just occurred to me that if indeed the tanning
beds are, if the capability is somewhat similar, because it was
ultraviolet radiation from their lamps that was actually helping to
control the psoriasis I had, you don't cure it. It probably would have
been a much cheaper alternative for me to have gone to a tanning bed for
a number of sessions, if indeed their beds can do the same thing. I
assume they can, since they're ultraviolet radiation. I was just
wondering if there is any medical exception here for somebody who might
be doing this to treat a medical condition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Usually, in a dermatologist's office, those machines
are regulated, they're inspected more frequently and you can determine
the dose of ultraviolet radiation was given. My understanding that some
tanning beds, depending on the bulbs, the age of the bulbs, the age of
the machine, you can not necessarily regulate how much UV radiation is
given.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute to House Bill 18 on its second reading. All in favor vote
aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. Ninety-four having

to whether or not they would mind us taking up a bill in debate while
they're actually counting the Board of Governors votes so that we can

Sargent Ares?? will pass out the ballot at this time.
There is one other clarification of the house come to order. When the
clerk read in the committee report, regarding the candidates, there were
candidates that have subsequently withdrawn. That was for information
purposes to properly report and the committee report, but they are not
included in this ballot. If you’re looking for them, they are not there
for a reason. They did withdraw from consideration.
The chairman also asks, just so I can keep track of picking up ballots
that when a member has returned their ballot to the sergeant in arms,
please just turn on your light.
The sergeant in arms will actually do this a different way. When you are
prepared to turn in your ballot please turn on your light. When all
lights are on the sergent in arms will pass through the floor and pick
up the ballots. We expect 118 ballots. The gentleman ?? state his
inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we mark this with an X, a check, do we fill in the blank?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair would suggest you mark with an x, a check or a circle.
Ladies and gentleman of the house, the chair stands corrected, There are
2 members who have excused absences, there are also 2 members who have
been excused from voting for certain rules.
As members complete the ballot, please turn the microphone light on.
Please illuminate your lights. When the count gets up to 116 we will

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
H.B. 230, amend law defining home schools. Ladies and gentlemen, this
does one thing and one thing only. There are- we're not taking any
public funds, we're not writing any new regulation. All we're doing is
allowing third parties to be involved in home schooling of the parents'
children. Might be that somebody doesn't know math and need a math
teacher. Perhaps a child is disabled and they need someone to help out
in that regard. So that's what this does, and that's all it does. For
those that wonder why people have been using third parties for a long
time. Back in 1999, the director of the DNPE went to the attorney
general's staff and asked for an unofficial ruling on whether or not
third parties were okay and he said no, so they created a home school
guidebook where it basically discouraged it, what we're doing is
changing that, codifying it and clarifying it because they've been doing
it all along, providing the same rights as anybody else and that's
basically all we're doing. So I commend the vote and ask you to vote for
it.

What we’re looking at, basically, is empowering the parents and helping
the parents better educate the Homeschoolers. I also stand in support
because it’s been great this year to see the Homeschoolers come by my
office. If a lot of you’ve seen them, they’re in the halls. They’re
walking.
They went through the whole process of learning the process in Raleigh,
which I think is great. It’s great too see the Homeschoolers that are
here walking door to door. In a Committee, we even had a Homeschooler
speaking in favor to the Committee on this Bill as well. I recommend the
Bill and I hope you’ll vote for it.
[Speaker]: Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
[Representative Jones]: To debate the Bill.
[Speaker]: The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[Representative Jones]: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of
the House, I rise in support of this Bill. I’m one of the Homeschool
parents active in the General Assembly right now. I’ve been studying
this issue pretty closely for at least 20 years. I just want to say that
many of you have probably been inundated with some emails from the
Homeschool Community in North Carolina.
Many for it and perhaps some against. I just wanted to kind of raise
your awareness and get your thoughts about this a little bit. I want you
to understand that there are countries in the world today where
Homeschooling is illegal. There are families around the world that are
seeking asylum even now in the United States, simply because they desire
to have the right to raise and to educate their children as they see
fit.
I want to be sympathetic with those letters from Homeschoolers that may
have approached you against the Bill, because I will tell you, the
Homeschool Community is diverse. Just as political parties and other
large organizations. I just want to remind you that there are some
50,000 Homeschools now in North Carolina and over 100,000 Homeschool
students.
There’s not always one collective voice, but the North Carolina Home
Educators and the North Carolina Coalition of Home Educators and many
other groups are in support of this Bill. I will tell you that there is
always some degree of skepticism or fear if you will, from the
Homeschool Community any time legislators open up the law.
Because they recognize that there are many places in the world and many
governments that are very oppressive when it comes to family rights,
parental rights in this way. I am sympathetic to those. I will tell you
that, again, as someone who has met with Homeschool groups around this
state and someone that has looked at this issue for a long time. I am
very convinced that this Bill is good for education. It’s good for the
citizens of North Carolina. It’s good for students. It’s good for
Homeschoolers and I would commend the Bill to you.
[Speaker]: Representative Martin, please state your purpose.
[Representative Martin]: To debate the Bill.
[Speaker]: The lady is recognized to debate the Bill.
[Representative]: Thank you Mr. Speaker. I just rise to give you my
perspective on this as one of the primary sponsors. Many of you know
that I’m interested in rolling back government. I don’t want to add a
lot regulations so I really questioned was this necessary. But in fact
it is. It came at the request of the North Carolina Home Educators.
It’s the fourth arm of government that’s the issue here. The book of
regulations that goes along, the book for non-public education, which
then takes our statute and adds all the regulations. Which is where it
says, a parent or guardian not meeting this Homeschool legal definition
which is that it’s the parent or guardian or member of the household who
is teaching the core academic courses being defined as Language Arts,
Math, Science and Social Studies. They would be in direct violation and
would void his or her Homeschool legal status. This does change any of
the other requirements for Homeschooling.
Now there is supplemental instruction allowed that once the parent has
given the instruction in the core areas, then they could go outside of
their own skills for supplemental instructions. This is what is
happening today in the Homeschool environment is that there’s many
people taking advantage of Co-ops. There’s online classes available.
There’s community college classes.
There’s just a lot more resources than they had when we originally
crafted this legislation. So all that we’re doing is improving outcomes
for these students. Allowing the parents, who are still taking the full
responsibility for the education of these children, to have the option
to say, I can’t provide you with the training for calculus and I’m going
to hire a tutor. They are still owning that. That’s what this Bill does
and I recommend it to you. We’ve had great support and improve the
outcomes for all of our children. Thank you.
[Speaker]: Representative Adams, please stated your purpose.
[Representative Adams]: Thank you Mr. Speaker. To speak briefly on the
Bill.
[Speaker]: The lady is recognized to debate the Bill.</p>

<p id="085:00">
[SPEAKER] Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. I thought we’d better try
to at least show that this is a bi-partisan concern. I've never been a
home schooler. I am an educator and I've been involved in education for
forty years. And one of the things that I've tried to do with my
students is to make sure that they got the benefit of resources actually
outside of the classroom, more resources than I could provide for them.
I think that when you try to at least think that children can only learn
from the teacher in the classroom, I think you’re really limiting them.
As we talked about this bill in committee it seemed to me that as we
always need to try to clarify what’s in the law. If it’s something in
our statute that enables people to have a different interpretation, I
think we have a responsibility to the citizens to make sure that
everybody understands exactly what the expectations are.
I think it’s a good bill. I think it will overall improve what we can
provide for children and while I've never tried to teach at my children
at home, I do have some things I've taught them at home. But I think
that as we provide resources in classrooms, I think additional resources
will be helpful to children who are home schooled as well. And I do
support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wonder if the bill sponsor,
Representative Malone, will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES ] Representative Malone, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
{SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Sir. I have been contacted by people on
both sides of this issue. And the concern that is most often raised with
me is the idea that this might open the door to additional government
regulation rather than less. Have you assured yourself through the
efforts of staff that allowing the additional sources of education would
not open the state to determine the adequacy or determine what those
other sources must be?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, the short answer to your question is yes. Also,
I would point out that there’s nothing stopping anybody from regulating
almost anything around here. You know that too. Now, as far as the home
school guidebook and how it came to pass, some people are concerned
about their freedoms and able to go forth and home school their children
are worried about the regulation. This does nothing in the way of
regulation at all. It just clarifies the language and your abilities to
do what you need to do.
There are some subsections in here that reference supplemental teaching
and things like that. Those will be more than likely struck or clarified
again when we pass this bill.  And nothing will be done any differently
for anybody. They’ll all know, however, what it is they can do as far as
the home school is concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I thank the gentleman. Could I ask a question of
Representative Martin?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Martin, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You made mention of how there is, I got the impression
that now if you use a third party person to help with home education,
that that is in fact a violation of the law. And so there is question of
one’s ability to continue to home school if you’re not able to say
become competent in calculus, for example. Is that a correct
understanding of the situation that it is now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. And the work around is the supplemental
instruction. In this guidebook it says the only sources of the academic
instruction listed in the statute are parents, legal guardian or a
member of the household in which the child resides. The only exemption
given is for a two household home school arrangement. Therefore, the
student receiving academic instruction from someone out the household
would be in direct violation of the statute since academic instructors
who do not live with the student are not included in the listing of the
three types of persons.
And then it says, once the parent or guardian each year has provided the
initial foundation of instruction in the academic subjects, they may
arrange with other persons if he or she wishes to provide supplemental
learning activities. So in that case, I may be a parent who says, let me
tell you about calculus as a higher math. But I don’t think that’s
what’s intended here. And if we change that to the parent still assume
full responsibility for the academic instruction of their students for
the choosing and the sequencing. So I think it will not regulate what
the parent is, that they are taking that responsibility not giving up to
the state to check on them but they will be able to use the resources
more freely</p>

Thank you Mr. Speaker. To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I intend to object to a third reading so that we can prepare an
amendment to do just what we're talking about fixing, to allow it to be
parental choice for the kids to attend  a single school.  That would be
their option.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion? Further Debate? If not the question before the house
is the passage of the house committee substitute to House Bill 250 on
it's second reading.  All those in favor vote aye.  All opposed vote no.
The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 117 having voted in the
affirmative and none in the negative, house committee substitute to
House Bill 250 has passed it's second reading and will remain on the
calendar.
Representative Lucas, please state your purpose.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Rules Chair will be able to
announce the results.  The Chair understands there is a tie that we will
have another  runoff ballet, but the Rules Chair will report those who
are voted in and the procedure for the next vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Members of the house, I'm going to read the
totals of the votes for you and I'm going to start in the order of those
who duly elected at this point.  The top vote getter was Rodney Hood
having  received 105 votes.  Second place was Henry Hinton, having
received 93 votes.  Third was Champ Mitchell, having received 88 votes.
 Fourth is Laura Willey, having received 83 votes.  Fifth is Doyle
Parish, receiving 82 votes.  Sixth is Roger Achen, receiving 72 votes.
Seventh is Joan Perry, having received 60 votes.  In eight place is
Jimmy Barnes, having received 57 votes, however, with 58 votes being
necessary for majority, does not receive a majority of votes.
Therefore, pursuant with the rules, Mr. Barnes will be in a runoff with
the person in ninth place, being Jim Nance, who received 52 votes on the
first ballet.
That's the order of the seven who won on the first ballet and the runoff
again will be between  Mr. Barnes and Mr. Nanse.  And Mr. Speaker, if I
may,  we have ballets that have been prepared for distribution to the
members under the same procedure and the only two names that will be on
those ballets will be Mr. Barnes and Mr. Nance and I do wan to remind
the members the members, we did receive two ballets in the last process
where the members did not vote for the eight members.  This time it
shouldn't be too simple.  You just vote for one, and only one.  So, with
that being said, please remember to write your name, sign your name, and
vote for one and only one person on your ballet if you want it to count.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Sergeant at Arms may pass out the ballets at this time.  Members,
again, please be sure to vote for one and only one candidate.  If it is
not marked clearly, the ballet will be deemed invalid and please sign
your ballet.  If the Sergeant at Arms will please go ahead and pass out
the ballets, but rather then passing through the isles several times to
pick them up, after all the members have illuminated their light, turned
their light on, make it bright, the Sergeant at Arms will then come
though one time and pick up the ballets and the tellers will be the same
as were involved in the first count.

Please stand and allow us to welcome. Members again after all lights are

after you have completed your ballot and you are ready to have it picked
up. The sergeant arms will proceed through the aisle to pick up your
ballot. Chair also understands that members who have been recused from
the prior ballots would be recused from this as well. All members who
have completed their ballots will please turn on your lights. If you
have completed your ballots, please turn on your lights. The chair still
sees four five lights that have not been illuminated. The chair assumes
that member needs more time to complete the ballot. Members please leave
you lights on until such time. We have live members who have not turned
on their lights. Sergeant arms may now proceed through the aisles to my
right all lights are on. We still have one light that’s not on. On the
left side Rep Alexander, the gentlemen needs little more time to catch
the ballot. Sergeant arms may now proceed through the chamber and
collect the ballot.  As the sergeant arms collecting  the ballot and the
teller retire to the conference rooms to make it little bit closer if e
have to get you to vote, we are going to move on to the calendar. The
chair understands that the members were interested in   other votes.If
the house could come to order. These are the votes total for those who
are not nominated. Davenport 38, Neal 30, Knott 48, Roseman 38,
Schwaznek 47, Wiley , was a candidate earlier. Members I would also tell
you that the ballots are public records and they are available for
inspection at the clerk’s office after the session today.  Pagers, Looks
like e are going to do some overtime today but your quitting time has
just com come up at 5 o clock Thank you for your service today and we
will see you tomorrow. You are now released. Any members who has not
passed the ballot to the secant at arms, please indicate it this time.
Chair understands that all ballots are in the possession of the rules

[Speaker Changes] Speak on the process Mr. Speaker
[Speaker Changes] Gentlemen will be recognized for a point of personal
privilege and  would advise the member of the rules related to the point
of personal privilege. Gentlemen is recognized
[Speaker Changes]  Mr. Speaker and Ladies and gentlemen of the house. I
refused to vote on the last vote and I did so simply because o the fact
that when democrats were in power we saw to it that republicans were
well represented in the board of governance . Have this travesty
happened this afternoon did happen when no democrat with all guts

…who you favored. And we voted for them and kept them on the board. And
not one Democrat was elected put of this House. And I think it’s just a
doggone shame and a travesty that you ask us to help you. You talk about
reaching across the aisle. This is no way in shape, form or fashion
reaching across the aisle and asking for our help. I just can’t
understand for the life of me, why we can’t get the same thing that we
gave you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Mobley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady’s recognized for a point of personal
privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My concern piggy-backs on what
Representative Michaux had to say. This is my, beginning of my 4th term.
And as I remember our former speaker when it came to being reasonably
fair. And I particularly remember the last time we voted on the Board of
Governors, him saying that you will vote for at least two Republicans,
as we caucused.
It concerns me greatly, my heart is heavy, as I think about some of the
things that are coming down the pike, with regards to our communication
boards. What are we coming to? Are we going to try to make everything
right, and what’s just for the majority of the people in the state of
North Carolina? You certainly don’t need to be here. And I’m including
myself in that. If I can’t do what’s right, than the master will remove
me. Because I know I came here to do his will. And for the people of my
district.
So I admonish you as we move forward in other decisions that we make,
that we do the right thing and try to provide some equality for all
people. Not Republicans, not Democrats, not black or white. But all
people. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, please state your purpose. And
ladies and gentlemen, the Chair would remind members that in points of
personal privilege there are limits as to what should be discussed. The
Chair’s allowed a little bit of latitude in at least one or two
comments, but the chair would be mindful of the rule. Representative
Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for point of personal
privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House and I just feel like I’m compelled to respond. We just went
through an election for the Board of Governors. It was a nomination
process, and I don’t believe anybody would argue that the people that
have been elected are qualified. They’re eminently qualified. And, yes,
you can argue which one of the people won, but they won by majority
vote.
But I would just remind you of one thing, the Republicans won the
election, we’re in control, we intend to elect Republicans, and import
Republicans, and we make no apology for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanted to ask Representative Mobley a question as…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pierce?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, now I heard you…

the gentleman was rising to determine whether or not he could be

gentlemen yield? The gentlemen does not yield. Rep Pierce

[Speaker Changes]  Thank you speaker, As I was saying and Rep Lucas
almost stood up. This is not a good attitude to have this afternoon. And
I understand that the party in power has the right to do what they think
is right. But the tone of it is what hits me. And I am amazed that

20 seconds. But the chair wishes you to make sure you  confine your
remarks.  I know there are emotion on this issue. The chair would also
point out that cording to rule 11 any member who would like to record a
protest on the proceedings the chair would encourage them to do so.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Speaker for your time. I am just going to
leave it alone because its obvious that this matter is going to keep

it was a sad day today for me as the others would say the attitude and

[Speaker changes.]...for the rules, all of us are bound by those
requirements. And so sometimes we're gonna be put in a position where we
can do what we wanna' do or what we know is right to do and I think that
discussion was being had today. So as you read your rules and you look
at rule eight, about the question of privilege, note how prominently the
question of dignity and integrity of the proceedings is put in those
rules.  There's a reason for that and we're all bound by 'em...I didn't
vote for 'em on the first day myself but, since the majority said that
we should abide by those rules, I think you have now bound yourself and
you owe yourself a responsibility to do that...and so, again, I think
the minority is askin' the question...can we rely on you to abide by
your own rules that you adopted. Thank you, Mister Speaker.
[Speaker changes.] Ladies and gentlemen, the Chair has received the
report from the Tellers and from the Rules Chair and the run-off
election between Barnes and Nance???. Nance????? received 60 votes,
Barnes received 55 votes. Nance???? would be the eighth nominee.  Ladies
and gentlemen, we will explain the process now. The...pursuant to
Article 6, Section 5 of the North Carolina Constitution, the vote will
be viva voce, which is a voice vote.  All in favor of the election of
the persons listed by Representative Moore, I'm explaining this so we
will come back and put the question, will say aye and those opposed will
say no. Now this voice vote preceeds that an electronic vote.  The Chair
anticipates that there will be people on both sides of the vote. The
Chair will...would suggest to members, because we are goin' immediately
to an electronic vote...I guess we could do a count on the voice vote
but I wanted to assure you that there is also an electronic vote
recorded after viva voce vote. Clerk is posting the question. The
question before the House is the election of the persons listed by
Representative Moore. Those in favor will say aye. (Ayes.) Those opposed
will say no. (No's.) The ayes appear to have it.  The ayes do have it.
The persons named or elected to the UNC Board of Governors...and I would
make one point...that Representative Moore, the Chair did call out
Representative Nance in that as a technical point. Now, this election
will be confirmed with an electronic vote.  All in favor will vote aye.
All opposed will vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will
lock the machine and record the vote. 84 having voted in the affirmative
and 29 in the negative. The motion passes. The election of the newly
elected UNC Board of Governors is confirmed and the Senate will be so
notified. Messages from the Senate, the Clerk'll read.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, given the tone of today, and I'm a little
bit. I think I heard enough today. So, if the Speaker will be so kind,
it would be ?? the chamber that he would carry these four bills over
until tomorrow. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd, I appreciate
your point, but I have assured a member of your caucus that we would
carry some bills that they would like to have done today carried
forward. So, the Chair doesn't anticipate a significant amount of time.

be included in the calculation of credit hours for purposes of the
tuition surcharge and to require that uniform procedures be implemented
in the university of North Carolina system to provide appropriate
advance notice to a student when the student is approaching the credit
hour limit regarding the tuition surcharge. The General Assembly of
North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members, this is a bill that
was sponsored by Representative Johnson and Holloway, and myself. It's a
recommendation that came out of the fiscal division's review of the
tuition surcharge policy of the last four years, and it was, I believe,
unanimously passed at the education committee. It does two things. It
simply provides that credit hours that a student has from a
non-constituent university campus or community college that are coming
in do not count for purposes of the tuition surcharge penalty, and the
second is it requires the university to develop a uniform procedure of
notice to students that they may be being close to being assessed a
tuition surcharge so that they can make plans accordingly. It is agreed
upon with the university, and I know of no opposition. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion. Further debate. Representative
Adams, Please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. To ask
the gentleman a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, does
the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, I think this
is a good idea. I'm wondering if you had any thought about the time for
the surcharge notification, and I mean an earlier period of time. Was
that considered at all? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It is, and that's part of, I
think you and I had a brief conversation, and I've had conversations as
a result of that with the president's office. And I believe they're
going to try to put in place more than a semester's notice as people
approach it. Since this bill will go into effect in the fall, there's no
way to provide a notice beyond that. We're trying to get it passed fast
enough. As soon as it's passed, they'll provide the notice. And the
university's already working on their own policy pursuant to this to get
out notices for the fall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I speak on the bill
briefly, Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think it's
certainly a good idea. I've had some calls from students; and, having
worked with students, oftentimes, when they get to that junior and
senior year, if they're not made aware, I mean, I just personally think
we need to be talking about making them aware and their parents, when
they come in, because some of these totals can really add up. And, so,
when you get into that semester before you graduate, and you see you owe
four and five thousand dollars, you're not going to be able to do it.
So, I think this is a good start, but I'm hearing from students who -
they're not paying attention much when they get that notice those six or
eight weeks out. And then the parents are calling because they didn't
realize that they had these costs. The other thing I think it would do
to have a very early notification of the surcharge is so that students
can plan better. A lot of times, they incur these costs because they're
taking more hours because they've changed their majors and they need to
really think critically before they make those decisions to know that
it's going to impact them financially down the road. So, I think it's a
good start, and I hope that we're able to really resolve it so that the
students really don't suffer in the end. Thank you.</p>

Rep. Floyd, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Rep. Glazier will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Glazier, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Glazier, is it possible that this can be up front than before the
student gets to his or her junior or senior year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well thank you for the question Rep. Floyd.
The notice of course is- there is a tuition surcharge police that's sent
out before anybody even becomes a student so that they know in the
handbook what tuition surcharge might be if they violate the rules, but
this is to give students notice who're approaching or appear to be close
to the 140 credit hour limitation so that they know if they exceed that
they're going to get hit with a substantial penalty. So there's only so
much notice you can do because it's for students who are approaching
that position so that they're aware that they need to be very serious
about what they're doing so there's a limit to how much notice you can
give but students are aware of th existence of the policy from the
beginning of their enrollment at the university if they read the
handbook. Of  course you and I know that most of the students don't
necessarily read the handbook, but we can't do much about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Chair, would he yield for another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you're actually saying that this is the second- this will be the
second notice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This would be their- They're very specific student-directed notices as
opposed to the general notice, that's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.

Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the General Assembly.
This bill comes to us from the treasurer's office, it's an agency bill,
and what it does, it limits public disclosure of information held by the
treasurer to the names and last known address of owners and holders of
unclaimed property. It's to clarify that cash must always be reported as
unclaimed property so that the people can receive that back. It
eliminates requirements for a holder of unclaimed property to file an
affidavit with reports and certifications of compliance and it
eliminates a $10 processing fee paid by holders of unclaimed property
for an extension of time to file the report on unclaimed property. I
would appreciate your support. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, this is Senator Clodfelter's bill, and
it just provides for the cancellation of an aircraft labor or storage
lien upon the payment of a bond. We allow the payment of a bond in these
disputes for any other kind of personal property, but aircraft were not
included. And so, all this let's you do is if you're having a dispute
over the payment of, payment for repairs or whatever, is to let you pay
a bond during the dispute and be able to use your plane. So that the
bond could cover whatever the resolution would be, and we have that for
cars and for others things, but we don't have it for airplanes, and so
this just conforms the law for airplanes, I'd appreciate your support.
