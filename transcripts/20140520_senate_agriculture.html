<p id="00:00">
I'd like to call the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Environment and
Natural Resources to order. It's good to see everybody back and we're
gonna get down to business and part of it is a fairly long bill that's
over 62 pages. It's Senate Bill 734 but first I'd like to introduce our
Sergeant at Arms today, in case you all get rowdy they'll throw you out,
Donna Blake, King Kirby, Steve Mckay, and Jowles Jeffries, Thank you all
for the job you all do. And our pages that are here today are Jordan
Singin from Raleigh, sponsored by Senator Sanderson, Josh Johnson from
Fuquay-Varina, raise your hand, Corbin Robinson from Spring Lake,
sponsored by Senator Ravin, Jennifer Matthews from Winston Salem,
sponsored by Senator Parmin[?], and Madison Gelani from Mint Hill,
Sponsored by Senator Tart, and Madison Henderson from Dunn, sponsored by
Senator Jackson. Thank you all for the job that you all do today and
hopefully you'll have a good day today. Maybe you'll take some of our
seats before too long. In fact, Chad Barefoot was a page for us just
last week. I can say that now, I took that ribbing for a lot of years.
But first we'll have up the PCS for Senate Bill 734. Senator Wade moves
that for discussion all those in favor will say &quot;I,&quot; all those
opposed &quot;no,&quot; Senator wade would you approach? And our
Sergeant at Arms and Pages will be passing it out, and before we start
let me say that if there's any proposed amendments let's get those to
the Clerk and so we'll take a look at them. We'll have until 11:45 for
all amendments to be brought up for us 'cause it's a long bill, it's a
lot of information, we'll give everybody time, 11:45 if they do have an
amendment to get it up to the Clerk and then we'll probably recess for
five minutes just to make sure we get everything together and get what
copies we need to out to everyone if it's any type of substantial
amendment so that we can vote on it afterwards. We'll have until 11:45
to get the amendments forth and then we'll take a quick recess and then
come back and vote on the amendments and then vote on legislation right
after that. Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I think you've all had a change to take a look
at this bill and I would just like to do a couple remarks here. A lot of
committees and commissions had input into this particular bill and there
is a large volume here and I think we should start by just having staff
go through the bill and then we can get the questions, if that's okay
with the committee and you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, actually, and that's what we'll do. We'll have staff to go through
the bill and then, if you would, members, if you would hold your
questions until the end so we can get through the whole thing and we'll
go through the questions and the amendments at the end. Jeff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. co-Chair, as Senator Wade mentioned a number of different
provisions went into this proposed committee substitute so we're gonna
have a number of different staff people briefing different portions of
it so we'll be jumping from provision to provision and we'll try to also
identify, for the ones that came out of different study commissions,
which ones those are. My colleague Karen Cochrane-Brown's gonna begin
with the administrative law provisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Beginning with part one of the Bill, section 1.1
makes amendments to two provisions relating to administrative law. The
first one deals with a section of the law that provides for rules that
are adopted by certain environmental agencies that impose standards on
natural resources that are more restrictive than Federal Law are
prohibited under our current law unless those rules would apply to one
of the five exceptions that are listed in the summary. This provision in
this Bill would add a new section that would require, basically, that if
the rule is allowed to be adopted under this provision, because it meets
one of these exceptions, that that rule would then</p>

It didn't have to be treated as though it had received ten letters, and
would be subject to legislative review in the next legislative session.
So, the effective date would be delayed for those kinds of rules.
The second part of section 1.1 would amend the process for the periodic
review of the existing roles. This was enacted last year, in the
regulatory reform active 2013. This provision would amend the definition
of necessary with substitute of public interest which is a category of
rules that basically determines that if rules have that designation that
they have to be re-adopted. This provision would require the agencies to
re-adopt the existing rules, and it would impulse more restricted
standards than is imposed by federal law on similar area.
This provision is made retro active to the effective date of last year's
bill which is August 13, 2013. So, all agencies that have already
completed the review under the process would have to re-do the process
under this new standard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. Section 1.2 of the  bills, and you all see
recommendation.
Section 1.2 A would repeal a provision that was in the 2013 regulatory
format which limited the enactment of local ordinances by cities and
counties. It is essentially an early sunset of that provision. Sections
1.2 B and C would direct deal in the department of agriculture to report
to the ERC on any local ordinances interfering with any areas subject to
regulation by those agencies by November 1, 2014 and November 1, 2015.
Section 1.2 D would prohibit cities and counties from regulating
fertilizer. But, this section would not affect the inner's authority to
enforce water quality standards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. Section 1.4 would repeal the lottery over site
commission. This is not the commission that regulated lottery, but an
over site commission. This provision was contained in senate bill 10
last year and is brought into this section and section 1.4 B makes a
confirming change.
Section 1.5 both A and B deal with representation of small business end
of these, and certain administrative appeals. These two sections would
amend the administrative procedure act and the tax law, to allow small
businesses to be represented by one or more of its owners in an appeal
before either in it a contested case in OAH, or before the property tax
commission in tax cases. The provision defines a small business entity
as a limited liability company or corporation that is owned directly
either directly or indirectly by one or no more that two individuals.
Section 1.6 exempts small business entities from the real estate license
law and exempts their owners, officers, managers, and employees of a
closely held business from the requirement of obtaining a Realtor's
license, when they are in connection with the property they own or
lease. Closely held business defined in this provisions is a limited
liability company or corporation with no more that two owners.
Section 1.7 makes a small amendment to a law that was enacted in 2011
that required quarterly reporting by state agencies on a number and use
of mobile devices that they have. This would make the reporting
requirement extended to an annual report rather than a quarterly report.
The next eight provisions were recommendations of the joined legislative
administrative procedure of over site committee beginning with section
1.8- this section amends a number of obsolete boards and commissions,
this was recommended  by APL last year, was also included in senate bill
10 and was not enacted, so was included in this provision as well.
Section 1.9 would clarify the re-adoption of these existing rules
process. Last year when that law was enacted, it didn't provide a
specific process for the actual re-adoption of rules, so this would
delegate the authority to set the schedule to the rules review
commission. It would also provide that agencies can amend rules as part
of their re-adoption process, but it includes a provision that rules
that is re-adopted without any change or without substantive change, the
agencies is not required to prepare a fiscal note for those rules. This
is intended to streamline that process.
Section 1. 10 is a somewhat technical amendment to basically amend the
professional corporations act to authorize occupational licensing boards
to adopt rules regarding (end)</p>

…The act of the rises those licensing to collect and to implement the
statue but it doesn’t them specific rule making authority this just adds
that real making authority. Section 1.11 amends the section that
requires occupational licensing boards to report annually to the
Secretary of the State, the Attorney General and the Joint Legislative
Administrative Procedure Oversight Committee this provision adds a
couple of additional items of information that have to be reported and
make some other technical changes. Section 1.12 authorizes the office of
administrate hearings to allow documents and a contested case to be
filed and served electronically. Section 1.13 amends the education law
to specifically provide that the State Board of Education is subject to
rule making under the APA and contains a provision that is similar to
the APA language that provides that any policy that has not been adopted
in accordance with the APA cannot be enforced. This provision also
specifically authorizes that if an agency fails to act as required  by
law that someone agreed can comments a contestant case in that situation
and have a ALJ determine whether or not they have in fact fail to comply
with the law if so the ALJ can direct them to do so within a specified
time. And finally that provision also clarifies that the right of
judicial intervention applies when a final decision has been
unreasonably delayed. Section 1.14 streamlines the rule making process
by eliminating the requirement that agencies obtain a certification of
adherence to rule making principles prior to submitting the propose tax
of the rule for publication. The provision also amends the fiscal notes
section of the APA to provide that the agency must obtain a
certification from OSBM and connection with certain rules if they have a
substantial economic impact. Section 1.15, clarifies the burden
provision in contested cases, it clarifies that the petition has the
burden in most cases but establishes that in two categories of cases
specifically when a case involving the imposition of civil fines and
penalties and when the case involves the suspension or discharge of a
career state employees in those cases the burden shifts to the agency.
And the provision also directs that Joint Legislative Administrative
procedure oversight committee to study whether there are other
categories of cases where the burden should be shifted. Those are all of
the APO recommendations the next provision Section 1.16 clarifies the
law with regard to legislative appointments and it makes it clear that
we are the law governing legislative employments of worlds commissions
provides that in case where the Speaker and the President pro tem are
directed by law to make recommendations to the General Assembly on the
recommendation or in-consultation with a third party that consultation
is not binding but purely authorizes them to accept it. The third party
must submit a recommendation at least 60 days before the expiration of
the term or within 10 days of a vacancy. And if the third party fails to
meet those timelines they are deemed to wave their opportunity to make a
recommendation or exercise consultation. Similarly, in cases where the
Speaker or the pro tem are directed to make recommendations based on
nominees received from a third party, the third party is also subject to
the same time rotations and will deemed to what been wave, to wave their
opportunity to do so if they don’t need the timelines. I think now we go
into part 2 the Permitting Reforms Section 2.1 amends the Administrative
Procedure Act to create a new process for contested cases in which
multiple license are required from an agency for a single activity. The
Secretary or Chief Administrative Officer of the agency is authorized to
issue a written determination that the agency decision is only
reviewable on the date the last license for the activities issue denied
or otherwise disposed off. The written determination made by these
Secretaries or Chief Officer is not subject to a contested case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The next series of provisions are more related to environmental and
regulatory laws opposed to administrative law…

<p id="15:00">
The first section is section 2.2. This provision of the PCS would amend
the process for filing a contested case on an air quality permit
decision made by the Environmental Management Commission. It would
provide that the filing of a contested case by a permit applicant or
permittee would stay the EMC's decision, while the filing of a contested
case by a third party, a party who is not the permit applicant or
permittee, would not automatically stay the EMC's decision. It would
also limit the ability of the third party, a person not the permit
applicant or permittee, to file a contested case to circumstances where
the EMC's decsion would result in an excedence of a national air quality
standard.
The next section, 2.3, would direct the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources to treat a dairy waste containment basin as closed and
no longer part of an animal waste management system, if several
circumstances were present. That would be if the owner of the basin
demonstrates, to the department's satisfaction, that the basin has only
been used for dairy waste, the basin was constructed prior to 1967, it's
not been used to contain dairy waste since September 1, 2006, the only
liquid currently in the basin is from rainwater or rainwater runoff, and
the nitrogen levels in the basin do not exceed 40 parts per million.
The next section, 2.4, would amend the process for filing contested
cases regarding the Coastal Area Management Act or CAMA permits,
decisions made by the Coastal Resources Commission. It would provide
that the filing for a contested case by a permit applicant would suspend
the permit, and prevent any action that would be unlawful in the absence
of the permit, while the filing of a contested case by a person who is
not the permit applicant would not automatically suspend the permit.
Next section, 2.5, would authorize the Governer, during the state of an
emergency, to issue an executive order to vaive the requirements for an
environmental document or permit issued under several articles of the
environmental statutes. This includes the Environmental Policy Act which
is the SEPA article, State Environmental Policy Act article. Article 4
is the Sedimentation and Pollution Control article, and Article 7 is the
CAMA article. There would be waivers for permits and documents under
those artcles for the repair, protection, safety enhancement or
replacement of a component of the state highway system that provides
road access to an unincorporated municipality or unincorporated
inhabited area bordering the ocean or a coastal sound where bridge or
road conditions, as a result of the emergency, pose a substantial risk
to public health, safety or welfare. The executive order must include
the duration of the waiver and the specific activities to which the
waiver applies, and also this provision provides that replacement could
increase the size or capacity or change the location of the
infrastructure being replaced.
Section 2.6 would roll back a fee that was enacted last session for a
permit for under-dock oyster culture. This type of permit authorizes a
the holder of a permit to atach up to 90 square feet of oyster
cultivation containers to the person's dock or pier. Under current law,
the fee for that is a hundred dollars. This would repeal that fee for
the permit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 2.7 would amend the law governing local
government leases for renewable energy facilities. Currently any city
can lease property for up to 10 years but certain cities are allowed to
lease properties for up to 20 years for the purposes of renewable energy
siting. This changes that law to make it 25 years and it applies to all
cities throughout the state.
Section 2.8 applies to closing-out sales or going-out-of-business sales.
Under current law, the business has to obtain a license from the Clerk
of the City or from an officer designated by the Board of County
Commissioners. This goes through and amends the statute so that the
license would be obtained from an officer designated by the governing
board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 3.1 is a recommendation of the General
Assemblies Environmental Review Commission. It would make a couple of
changes to the regulation for activities that impact isolated wetlands.
First it would increase the amount of isolated wetlands that could be
impacted without a permit from one-third of an acre to one acre for
areas east of Interstate 95, and from a tenth of an acre to a third of
an acre for areas west of Interstate 95. It would also decrease the
amount of mitigiation that would be required for impacts to isolated
wetlands, and finally it would direct the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources to study the regulatory thresholds for mountain bogs,
which is a particular kind of isolated wetland.</p>

and report it's findings and recommendations to the Environmental Review
Commission by November of this year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.2 would authorize the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission to
grant a brewing, distillation, and fermenting course authorization to a
college or a community college that offers the program as part of it's
curriculum. This provision would be similar in scope to the
authorization for college horticulture[?] courses that was enacted back
in 2002.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.3 of the PCS is also a recommendation from the Environmental
Review Commission. Last year's regulatory reform bill created a carbon
monoxide detector requirement for hotels and motels in the state, this
goes through and amends it, primarily to make some technical changes but
also to create a system by which the local fire inspector must notify
the local health department of any sort of violations and give the owner
of the facility time to rectify the violation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.4 would provide that if the Environmental Management
Commission receives a rule-making petition from a local government with
jurisdiction over an area to be served by a proposed water intake that's
impacted by a reclassification of those waters made by the MC after
January 1st, 2012, the unit of local government and the unit of local
government requests repeal of the re-classification, the EMC must grant
the rule-making petition. While this is happening the re-classification
and any related local ordinance changes will be stayed while the EMC
promulgates rules that are retroactively effective to the date of the
original re-classification. Basically undoing the reclassification. It
also directs units of local government that filed the petition for
rule-making to repeal local ordinance changes that they had made to
implement the initial reclassification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.5 directs the Building Code Council to amend the state
building code so that the accessibility requirements for swimming pools
are no greater than those contained in the Americans with Disabilities
Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.6 of the PCS would establish a disclosure privilege for
environmental audit reports that would generally prohibit the use of
these reports as evidence in civil or administrative proceedings. The
PCS defines environmental audit, in part, to mean a voluntary internal
evaluation or review of one or more facilities or activities at these
facilities that are regulated under environmental laws or management
systems related to the facilities. If that report or audit is designed
to identify and prevent noncompliance and to improve compliance with
these laws the definition also specifically provides that an audit must
be a discreet activity with a specified beginning and scheduled ending
date reflecting the auditor's bona fide intended completion schedule. In
addition to the disclosure privilege for the audit report and use of
evidence in civil or administrative proceedings, the provision also
prohibits persons that conducted or participated in the audit who
significantly reviewed the audit from being compelled to testify in
civil and administrative proceedings. In addition the provision would
generally establish an immunity for owners and operators of facilities
for imposition of fines and penalties for violation of environmental law
that was discovered through the conduct of an environmental audit and
then voluntarily disclosed to the enforcement agency. The provision
specifically provides, however, that with regard to waiver of penalties
and fines the waiver shall not be granted until the enforcement agency
has certified that the violation was corrected within a reasonable time.
So that means the Enforcement Agency retains it's discretion in that
regard until the violation is resolved.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.7 of the PCS would exempt a childcare program operated by a
non-public school before or after normal school hours from licensure and
regulation by the Childcare Commission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.9 would direct the department in the Environment and Natural
Resources to review it's air quality monitoring network and requests
from EPA the authority to remove any monitors that are not required by
Federal law. It also directs the department to discontinue all monitors
that are not required by Federal law and for which EPA approval for the
discontinuance is not required. This would not</p>

… prevent the department from installing temporary monitors as part of
an investigation of potential air quality violation or in response to an
emergency that could cause imminent danger to human health and safety.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 3.10 amends the Good Samaritan Law to clarify
that a person who performs emergency services voluntarily, not expecting
at that time to be paid for those services, is protected from liability
under that law. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 3.11 of the PCS would direct
the Environmental Management Commission to amend its rules and the
administrative code that pertain to open burning without an air quality
permit, to provide that in addition to the open burning of leaves, tree
branches and yard trimmings, a permit would not be required for the
burning of logs and stumps when certain conditions are met. This Section
would also amend the statutes to prohibit local air pollution control
program authorities, the department and the EMC from regulating
combustion heaters, appliances or fireplaces in private dwellings,
except as authorized by federal law. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 3.12
would direct the Coastal Resources Commission to adopt rules to disallow
establishment of any inlet hazard area where the location formerly
contained an inlet that had been closed for at least 15 years, where the
inlet has moved from the location due to shoreline migration, or where
the location includes an inlet providing access to a state port via a
channel maintained by the army core of engineers. This Section would not
prevent the CRC from studying inlet hazard areas or designating new
inlet hazard areas. Section 3.13 would authorize the WRC, Wildlife
Resources Commission, to issue a Field Trial Dog Handler or Judge
Permit, which will allow a dog handler or judge in a field trial to
participate without having a hunting license. They cannot participate in
hunting activities, but field trials using exclusively
domestically-raised water fowl or game birds or legally-taken dead game
would not be considered hunting activities. And this Section would
become effective July 1st, 2014. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 3.15 is a
recommendation of the Legislative Research Commission Committee on the
assessment of the Utility Regulatory Fee. The Utility Regulatory Fee is
charged to all public utilities operating in the state. It’s a
percentage of their revenues that are earned in their state. However,
for some telecommunications companies, the General Assembly has enacted
reforms to allow them to participate in a lesser form of regulation that
is less work for the Utilities Commission. The PCS would amend the
actual fees and the percentages that these are set at to allow the
telecommunication companies who have opted for this lesser regulation to
pay a lesser amount in regulatory fee, and to adjust the regulatory fee
for all the other utilities to cover the operating expenses of the
Utilities Commission and the public staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Section
3.16 would make an amendment to a legislative change made last session
to one of the Jordan Lake rules. It would provide that the piping of a
stream allowed under a permit issued by the army core of engineers would
be an exempt use rather than an allowable use. The difference between an
exempt use and an allowable use under the rules is that an exempt use
does not require local government authorization while an allowable use
does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 317 A, B and C of the PCS would repeal
various air quality reporting requirement for the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources and the Environmental Management
Commission. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 3.18 would provide that when a
venomous reptile is seized and FDA approved antivenom for that reptile
is not readily available, the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences
or the North Carolina Zoo must euthanize the reptile unless it is
protected under the federal Endangered Species Act. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 319 of the PCS would transfer the rule-making responsibility for
onsite waste management systems from the Commission for Public Health to
the Environmental Management Commission. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 3.20,
under that provision the General simply finds that the Governor’s Waste
Board that was repealed in 1993, its rules are no longer enforceable or
necessary, and it directs the Secretary of Environment and Natural
Resources to repeal those rules and prohibits the enforcement of those
rules by any political subdivision in the state. The Board was repealed
in 1993. Its authority was given to the Secretary of Environment and
Natural Resources and that authority largely involves local ordinances
that might affect the signing of a low-level radioactive waste facility,
and this authorizes the Board and now the Secretary to preempt those
ordinances under certain circumstances. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 3.21
of the PCS would amend a provision that was enacted in 2013 to provide
for reduced flow alternatives for waste water…</p>

?? systems as required by rule, such that and in addition to, exempting
establishments dwelling units would now be exempt from the flow rate for
design and any design flow standard under certain conditions. This
section would also direct the Commission for Public Health and the
Department of Health and Human Services to establish flow-rates by rule
that are based on scientific evidence specific to soil types that are
found in this state.
[Speaker Change]
Section 3.22 would repeal two obsolete provisions found in the criminal
law. The first one relates to using profane or indecent language on
public highways, this provision is likely unconstitutional, and the
second deals with refusing to relinquish a party telephone line in an
emergency, we no longer have party lines.
[Speaker Change]
Section 3.23 of the PCS would increase certain penalties for the taking
of protected plants. The PCS would increase the fine from a minimum of
ten dollars to seventy-five dollars and the maximum fines from fifty
dollars to a hundred-seventy-five dollars per offense. This section of
the PCS would also require the Clerk of Court for the jurisdiction to
report the conviction to the Plant Conservation Board provided that the
plant taken is also listed under the Protected Plants List pursuant to
the Plant Protection and Conservation Act.
[Speaker Change]
Section 3.24 would amend the Motor Vehicle Law to increase the penalty
range for violating the handicapped parking privileges provisions. Under
current law, the minimum penalty is a hundred dollars and the maximum
penalty is two-hundred-and-fifty dollars. This provision would raise
that range from a minimum of three-hundred dollars to a maximum of
five-hundred dollars. The provision also removes the requirement that
signs designating handicapped parking spaces must state the maximum
penalty for parking in violation of the law. ?? adds a provision
prohibiting signs from displaying incorrect maximum penalties
[Speaker Change]
Section 3.25 of the bill would repeal redundant and obsolete reports.
This section was requested by the Utilities Commission.
[Speaker Change]
Section 3.26 of the PCS would repeal the requirement for the State
Energy Office to conduct energy audits of each state agency and
institution of higher learning as a part of the Department of
Administration’s Facility Condition and Assessment program. This section
would also change from annual to biannual the required updates to the
management plans developed by state agencies and institutions of higher
learning to manage energy, water and utility use.
[Speaker Change]
Section 3.27 would amend the State Coastal Stormwater Rules. Under those
rules certain properties that were ?? by a certain date are
grandfathered in and not subject to the rules. This would expand that to
also include properties that are directly contiguous with those
grandfathered properties.
[Speaker Change]
Section 3.28 would authorize the use of any pesticide registered by the
pesticide board to control any species of mole other than the star-nosed
mole.

Section 3.29 would exempt any residential building subject to periodic
inspections by the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency from a county
or city’s authority to conduct periodic inspections as part of a
targeted effort within a geographic area. If the residential building is
in compliance with federal standards and provided the owner of the
residential building supplies the compliance results letter from the
North Carolina Housing Finance Agency to the local inspections
department.
[Speaker Change]
Section 3.30 of the bill would direct the North Carolina Building Code
Council to amend a certain provision in the fire code. Currently if more
than one means of egress is required in a building you cannot have
security grills on more than one half of those exits. This would direct
the Building Code Council to amend that provision to say that you can
have security grills on all exits providing that they are openable from
the inside when the building is occupied and are maintained in an open
position when the building is occupied by the general public.
[Speaker Change]
Section 3.31 of the PCS would rewrite the laws to require that any
person engaged in the business of landscape contracting must obtain a
license. Briefly, this section would more clearly define the term
“landscape contractor” under the statutes. This section would establish
requirements for landscape contractor ?? including application
requirements, qualifications and examination in continuing education.
Section would provide for exemptions for ?? establish the North Carolina
Contractor Licensing Board, establish standards for issuing licenses to
corporations, partnerships and persons doing business under a trade
name. This section would establish fees and</p>

articulate causes for disciplinary actions, civil penalties, and
injunctions. This section would become effective August 1, 2015.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.32 would allow a person who discovers a shipwreck or salvages
marine artifacts from state waters, and who donates the artifacts or
contractual interest in the artifacts to the state, to retain the right
to access the artifacts and display them on tour or conduct research on
them if he or she meets all the following conditions: one, pays 40% of
the net proceeds from display of the artifacts to the general funds,
two, leaves at least one-third of the artifacts in state custody, three,
provides to the state to-scale replicas of unique artifacts at no cost
while the artifacts are on display elsewhere, four, returns the
artifacts to the state at least every two years for a period of at least
one year, and five, promotes the cultural and natural heritage of the
state in any display of the artifacts. The right would be valid for 30
years after discovery of the artifacts and the state will return
replicates to the person who donated the artifacts or the person there
designated at the end of the 30 year period.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.33 would transfer all rule-making authority for matters
related to solid and hazardous waste management from the Commission for
Public Health to the Environmental Management Commission. Similarly,
section 3.34 would transfer rule-making authority for matters under the
North Carolina Drinking Water Act from the Commission for Public Health
to the Environmental Management Commission and that includes drinking
water rules to regulate public water systems.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.35 would allow certified well contractors to run, install,
maintain, and repair electric wiring, devices, appliances, and other
equipment between a well pump and a pressure switch without having an
electrical contractor's license. The section would also direct the Well
Contractor Certification Commission to establish minimum education
requirements for this type of work.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.36a would provide that private well water programs
administered by county health departments must use the standard form
developed by Deener[?] unless unique conditions that could be a public
health concern would be mitigated by the use of another form. This
section would also require that local health department registries of
private wells must be searchable by address served. Section 3.36b-d
would provide that neither Deener[?] nor a local well program may
require that well contractor identification plates include well
construction permit numbers. A local well program could install a plate
with this information on a well at it's own expense. And 3.36e would
provide that a contractor does not have to be on site for an on-site
pre-drill inspection if the well location's marked with a stake, or
similar, and the contractor is available to answer questions by phone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Part four, comprising studies, begins with section 4.1, The Honeybee
Working Group. This section, or section 4.1 of the PCS would direct the
Department of Ag and Consumer Services to create the Honeybee
Improvement for Vital Ecology Working Group. This working group would be
directed to proactively address the issue of colony collapse disorder
and is directed to report its findings and recommendations to
Environmental Review Commission before November 30th, 2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 4.2 would direct the divisionary fisheries to designate an area
of approximately 10,000 acres ?? is a recommendation to the
Environmental Review Commission for the establishment of the Senator
Jean Preston Marine Shellfish Sanctuary and to create a plan for
managing that sanctuary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 4.3 is a recommendation of the Environmental Review Commission's
Water and Sewer Working Group. It would direct the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources to study the statute's and rules
governing inter-basin transfers and to make recommendations as to
whether they should be amended. Deener[?] is directed to report its
findings to the Environmental Review Commission by October 1 of this
year. Similarly, section 4.4 came out of the same working group and is a
recommendation of the ERC. It directs the program evaluation oversight
committee to direct the General Assembly's Program Evaluation Division
to study the benefits that may result from the merger of public water
systems and waste water and collection works.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that completes our overview.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you staff and, as you can see, it's a quite lengthy bill, very
detailed, Senator Wade. Also I mentioned at the beginning of the
committee, sorry but the, if you have any amendments please have those
up on the clerk so we can get them ready and pass out, if you have an
amendment send them forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Woman: Comments unless there's questions
Mr. Chair: Questions from the committees? Senator Hartsell.
Senator Hartsell: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is probably for staff. I
got here a little late, which isn't unusual. But my understanding is
most of the, if not all, the APO oversight provisions are now in this
bill, the recommendations are in this bill. The one I was particularly
interested in, however, is the one that relates to &quot;Shall Meaning
Shall.&quot; Is that in this bill? If you could point that out to me,
where it is. I just hadn't been able to find it.
Woman: Mr. Chair, may I answer?
Mr. Chair: Yes.
Woman: Senator Hartsell, it is in the bill. It's in Section 1.13 of the
bill that is the same recommendation that was approved by APO.
Mr. Chair: Senator Ford.
Senator Ford: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I got a couple questions here,
one has to do with Section 1.5. Staff, I'm looking for a little clarity
as related to a business-owner now would be required to have an attorney
for an administrative hearing, under this provision this would be
repealed but the business-owner would not have to have an attorney. What
types of hearings are we talking about here and making sure that I'm
correct that the business-owner would not be required to have an
attorney.
Woman: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senator Ford, those two provisions relate
to specific types of administrative hearings. The first one amends the
Administrative Procedure Act, so it would only apply to contested cases
and in those cases, you are correct that small businesses, and they are
defined in this section, would not be required to have an attorney in
those kinds of cases. The second provision applies specifically to
property tax cases before the Property Tax Commission and it amends that
law specifically to provide that small businesses do not have to have an
attorney in that case as well.
Senator Ford: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Next question.
Senator Ford: A follow-up: it has to do with Section 1.6. I want to make
sure that I'm also interpreting this correctly, looking for
clarification from staff, that a real estate, licensed broker is not
needed when a business owner wants to sell their property. Is that or is
that not correct?
Woman: Senator Ford, under current law there is an exemption for
corporations. This provision would specifically apply that exemption to
closely-held small businesses and that term is defined in this provision
of the law, in this amendment.
Senator Ford : The follow-up: so am I correct that a business owner
would not need to have a licensed real estate broker to sell his or her
property?
This provision would add to the current exemption the owners of a
closely-held corporation. That is correct.
Mr. Chair: Senator Ford.
Senator Ford: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Question about Section 3.33 and 3.34
in terms of transferring the full ?? of authority of drinking water to
the Environmental Management Commission away from the Public Health. I
just wish for some further some clarification. Have there been some
problems, have there been some issues here that necessitate a change
along these lines? Again, just looking for some comments on this either
from the staff or from someone.
Woman: I really could not answer that. It really is a policy decision,
so I'm afraid staff can't be much help on these particular provisions.
Mr. Chair: Senator White. Take the mic.
Senator White: My understanding was this would make it a much smoother,
streamlined type for the consumer and also we had developed this new
environmental department which should take over that. Most of the
well-drillers that I've talked to said it was not very streamlined for
them to go from different department. In fact, one basically said to me
please put it back.</p>

the way it was. So evidently at the business end they're having problems
with which agency to go to and what department.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. ?? Well again, we've got section 3.33 that
has to do with solid and hazardous waste management and then section
3.34 that relates to drinking water rules, so I can understand the well
drillers with some input maybe on the drinking water but I'm not sure
I'm hearing what I'm looking for in terms of some clarification and
rationale for doing this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Basically it's that DENR manages that department and
that's basically where it needs to be, where DENR can manage that
department.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, just discovered another
question that I have for Senator Wade. Can you bring a little bit of
clarity to me for section 3.2? What is the rationale thinking process
around allowing community colleges and colleges in the state to sell
alcohol.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford, ask Senator Bingham right there. He's
going to become the new czar of all beer in the state. I'm sorry. Sentor
Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would say that this is a growing industry in North
Carolina, and that certainly our colleges are providing this education,
and there is a limit to the amount, and the volume equals 64 cases of
beer. That's 24 12-ounce bottles that they can sell, and they have to
have, of course, a permit to do that, and they're limited to 6 events a
year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. What happens to the proceeds?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll defer to you if you know that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bingham's just here to drink, not to take up
the money. The ?? staff's got to answer the question about the
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman and Senator Ford, the provision indicates
that the net proceeds from the retail sale would be retained by the
school and used to support the brewing, distillation and fermentation
program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And it is a fast growing industry. In fact, we just
had a company that makes the refrigeration equipment move their
operations, or half their operations, to Davie County because it's
halfway between the two epicenters of the craft brew industry, which is
Asheville and Raleigh and we're smack dab in the middle, plus smack dab
in the middle on the east coast, so it's a fast growing industry and now
we can prepare our students for jobs that pay very very well in this new
industry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. To the sponsor, and ?? to staff.
In terms of the transfer of the rule-making authority from public health
to the environmental management commission under DENR, I'm concerned
that when you look through the legislation, so much of the standards
have to do with protecting the public health, so where is the public
health expertise going to come into play in terms of these rules,
transferring this rule-making authority. It's not &quot;does it affect
the environment?&quot; Even though the environment is a factor. It's
&quot;does it affect the public health?&quot; So how is that expertise
going to be referenced in the process?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think DENR requested this or was aware of making
this request. Certainly DENR is responsible for the environment, and
certainly public health falls under the environment. I think it's just a
change on the department, but the same standards would be kept up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. I'm just wondering from a policy
perspective or structural perspective, if there's anything that needs to
be done to make sure that the public health expertise is involved in the
process, and some of the standards are about public health, and I was
curious as to is this done in other places, or how do we get both sets
of expertise to the table in such an important area. They could create a
danger to public health quickly, that's all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could staff respond to that?</p>

The only think I would know Senator is that DAMC does have a license
physician appointed as they handle matters that arguably in other areas
related to public health safety welfare and the environment natural
resources but there is a physician appointed to the EMC.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more statement Mr. Chair I just wanna just express a concern, well I
think it’s great that we have a physician there is a whole body of
expertise related to public health, protection of public health etcetera
that we don’t loose that in this process somehow. So, hopefully there
will be other address that would apply.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A comment is not mistaken this area of public health was formally in and
was moved public health and it sort of embedded back &amp; forth in the
number of occasions overtime I’m not sure exactly what raise that but my
question is it’s actually in the same way now if it’s a transitional
issue, if we are stripping the commission for public health or we are
making authority in certain areas and assigning that to the
Environmental Management Commission and the bill is effective when it
becomes law, my question is what is the effectiveness of existing rules
relating to those issues, promulgated previously about the, I mean by
the commission of public health until such time as rules are adopted by
the Environmental Management Commission? Is that taking care of in some
fashion here that’s my question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, Senator ___[??] the APA has a provision that deals
with that situation, 150B 21.7 basically provides what the effect of the
transfer of duties from one agency to the other is that it basically
says that the rules in effect until the new agency chooses to amend
them. So, there should of an administrative change of the existing rules
to the new agency.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, in that case does the new agency administer the old rules in that
until they adopt new that’s the one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ___[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, just a couple of questions and follow up the
certain force always good when the small business not required to have
an attorney and we are paying enough so it’s a good thing. I just wonder
thank you for bringing that out, let me see Mr. Chairman excuse me,
which page it is? I have noted it…And I guess this question is for staff
so on the rail driller we are talking fine so they might help me with
that I had a note that they can only run, well that it clarify that it
can only run between the pump in the rail, which one is it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
31854.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and I appreciate that, under the statement it says, including
your license requirements etcetera and it says equipment by certified,
equipment by a person certified as a rail contractor will run an
electrical wires, could that language be more strict if it says, shall
only could be equipment by a person certified and as a rail driller
shall only run electrical wires from the rail pump to the pressure
switch is that shall language anymore ___[??] and what’s already in the
bill, the opinion of staff please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ___[??] I don’t believe that the Shell language would
necessarily be any stricter, the assumption is an…

…From the electrical contactors license in a section that already
exists. So, we are simply adding to a laundry list of assumptions from
the electrical contractors and if you look at the language of the bill
on page 57 you can see that assumption only applies to the installation,
construction, maintenance or repair of the wiring and devices when
running electrical wires from the well pump to the pressure switch.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for follow up sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On Section 3.31 rewrite landscape contractor license and statues. I’m
not looking at the legislation just a summary but does that require a
minimum revenue where someone has to have a landscape contractor
license, what about the guys that ___[??] and back, Moses Church Graft
once a week and gets paid for the retired gentlemen or someone like
that, just to explain that applicability to me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, Senator Tucker that is addressed and the contract has to be
at $30,000 before they have to have a license to go out and do it. So,
it exempts the person that knows your yard everyday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thought so I just wanna make sure but it was clear on that so there is
no problem there. Thank you Miss. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions, I think we had an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Check later offers and amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman one more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ___[??] just one more question about the community colleges
Senator Ford ask about the process, you said still 64 cases is that a
year, a month, a day or what just a clarification on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m pretty sure that means 64 cases and there are six events that they
can have per year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
64 cases in total but they can have six events let me be more specific.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, follow back up on that thanks Senator Tucker. Maybe I
misunderstood but the language makes reference to retail and whole sale,
I mean I’m trying to figure out the qualities for retail and whole sale
is that going to work within given those limitations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I’m gonna have to refer that to staff as I’m not actually breed
any beer as far as quantity. So, can I look that up for you and get back
with you Senator Ford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, just follow up, it seems a bit of contradiction with the
limitations but then you are adding language as it relates to retail and
whole sale and so if we are going to allow this let’s allow them to be
successful. We will look into that and get back to everybody like I said
it’s probably, if it’s never we will take care of an amendment. We will
have a referral to finance. Senator ___[??] forward an amendment, those
amendment on page 69, 12 to 15 by rewriting the lines to read. The
amendments ___[??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. It raise the amount of impacts of isolated wetlands under
55A-NCIC02H.1305 B2___[??] shall be less than or equal to one acre of
isolated wetlands for the entire project.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions or comments on the amendment, Senator Shepherd?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is just clear language all across the state, right. One acre and
that clarifies here on one side an interstate, nine acre on the other
side and he just clear language one acre.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In this way if you are one side at 95 and your neighbors on the other
side at 95 you both are at one acre.

Thank you, Sir any questions? Senator Tucker moves to adopt the
amendment all those in favor will say, ‘I’.
