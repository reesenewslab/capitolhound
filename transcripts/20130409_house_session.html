[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee substitute for house resolution 363. House resolution honoring
the founders of Springfield Memorial Baptist church while observing the
church's one hundred fiftieth anniversary. The house resolves.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will read the resolution in its entirety.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Whereas, Springfield Memorial Baptist Church, located in Stanley, North
Carolina, can trace its origin to 1863, when 12 people organized the
Galilee Baptist Church, now First Baptist, between the Towns of Stanley
and Mount Holly; and Whereas, the congregation later split into the
Hickory Grove Baptist Church, Galilee Baptist Church, and the Brunington
Baptist Church, which remained on the grounds of the original church;
and Whereas, Reverend Tom Barnwell served as the first pastor of the
Brunington
Baptist Church; and Whereas, after a few years, the church was destroyed
by fire, and, on September 18, 1874, Rufus and Susan Friday donated land
for a new church; and Whereas, a log structure was built to serve as the
church, which was named Springfield Memorial Baptist Church in honor of
the pastor at the time, Reverend Burton, who came from Springfield, West
Virginia; and
Whereas, the next pastors to serve Springfield Memorial Baptist Church
included Reverend George Washington, Reverend Ellis Lee, Reverend
Ranson, Reverend Miles Beam, Reverend R.D. Harris, who served as pastor
of the church from 1908 to 1929 and helped to build a new church,
Reverend C.F. Gingles, Reverend J.W. Harriston, Reverend C.W. Thomas,
Reverend J.F. Wingate, Reverend P. Barnett, and Reverend T. Armstrong;
and Whereas, for 150 years, the Springfield Memorial Baptist Church has
prospered, attracting new members; adding new facilities such as
classrooms, an educational building, an auditorium, and a Family Life
Center; and expanding its ministries and missionary services;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives:
SECTION 1.
The House of Representatives honors the founders and leaders of the
Springfield Memorial Baptist Church for their contributions to the rich
cultural heritage of North Carolina.
SECTION 2.
The House of Representatives expresses its appreciation to the members
of
Springfield Memorial Baptist Church for their continuous service to the
church and contributions to the religious heritage of the State of North
Carolina.
SECTION 3.
The Principal Clerk shall transmit a certified copy of this resolution
to the pastor of Springfield Memorial</p>

[Speaker changes.]  ...protector of the 1886 Roanoke River lighthouse,
contribute to the history of the ??????? Sound and Waterways of North
Carolina; whereas Eatonton??? was the home of many black artisans who
contributed to its cultural development including the ?????? family of
African American architects, builders and carpenters...Miles ????? the
first, is son Hannibal ?????? Senior and Hannibal's sons, Hannibal ?????
Junior and Miles ????? the second, whose designs and construction stand
to this day. Whereas much of Eatonton??? was declared a national
historic district in 1973, recognizing the many historically significant
homes and public buildings that stand as authentic examples of over 250
years of architectural progress in America, the 1736 St. Paul's
Episcopal Church, the 1758 Cupola House, a national historic landmark
with national significance, and the 1782 Barker House, long recognized
on the National Register of Historic Places, and whereas in 1918, the
people of Eatonton????, fearful of that significant part of that state's
heritage was endangered, created an organization which became The Cupola
House Association to defend against the irrevocable loss of this
historically important dwelling. The first such act of preservation by
private citizens of North Carolina, and one of the first in the nation.
Whereas, the General Assembly of North Carolina created the Eatonton????
Historical Commission in 1961 as evidence of the unique role Eatonton
and Chowan County played to the preservation and perpetuation of the
history of the colony and the state, and whereas Eatonton??? on the eve
of its 300th anniversary was defined by Forbes.com as &quot;one of
America's prettiest towns&quot;, thereby awarding Eatonton???? the honor
of being the only 300 year-old town in the United States to hold such a
distinction, this recognition further proves Eatonton???? has retained
its exceptionalism throughout its historically significant 300 years and
confirms what residents and visitors alike have long enjoyed.  That
therefore be absolved by the House of Representatives, Section One the
House of Representatives honors the memory of the early residents of the
town of Eatonton????? for their contributions to their community, the
colony of North Carolina, the State of North Carolina and the Nation.
Section Two, the House of Representatives extends sincere good wishes to
the current residents of the town of Eatonton???? and Chowan County on
the occasion of their 300th anniversary and embraces with enthusiasm,
the town's plan to celebrate the occasion throughout 2013. The House of
Representatives further acknowledges Eatonton's????cultural dedication
to the preservation of historic buildings that contributed to much to
the development of North Carolina. Section Three, the House of
Representatives equally notes the perpetuation of the memories and
stories of the leaders who have made such contributions to the colony,
the state and the nation and encourages the citizens of the state to
join Eatonton and Chowan County in demonstrating respect for and pride
in our history and heritage.  Section Four, the principal Clerk shall
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the Mayor of the Town of
Eatonton????, Chair of the Chowan Board of Commissioners and the
Superintendent of the Chowan County School Board. Section Five, this
resolution is effective upon adoption.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Steinburg, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the resolution, please.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[Speaker changes.] Ladies and gentlemen of House and esteemed visitors
and guests, it is with great pride that I get up here today to speak on
this resolution, which is honoring one of the most, very special places,
not only in North Carolina but, indeed, in all of America.  This is just
a partial list, that you heard in this resolution of the historic sites
that are there and preserved for all to see, now and for generations to
come.  I am proud to call Eatonton????, North Carolina, home. It
was...and I don't believe this was mentioned in the resolution, it was
the first capitol of North Carolina. It was the Provincial Capitol of
our state, and, as a matter of fact, this 300th anniversary celebration
came about when it became known that I was going to run a bill to move
the state capitol back to Eatonton??? from Raleigh. It was thought that
perhaps this might be a....</p>

It’s been circulated to dozens and dozens of groups. I’ve got 13 talking
points and I’m going to just mention 4 or 5, and if you have some other
things you want to ask, Representative Graham or myself will answer, but
we have this statute that’s been around from the twenties, and it was
badly written than and because of that, it’s been construed all which
way all over the state. We need some consistency, so these changes make
these statutes simpler to read, deleting stilted phrases, redundant
terms. This includes gender-neutral language. It clarifies that board of
adjustment hearings shall follow quasi-judicial procedures, it makes
terms consistent one section to the next, it tells you how to do an
appeal from a board of adjustment so that from one town to the next it’s
the same procedure so that you’re not caught in a trap, and finally you
may know that from board of adjustment requires a supermajority, four
fifths vote, but it shouldn’t be that way for many of the things. It
maintains that supermajority for variances where a citizen wishes to be
excused from following the law through variance, but it changes to a
simple majority for things like special use permits, conditional use
permits. There’s a lot more in it, but it’s been thoroughly scrubbed by
people who are interested in this kind of thing and I ask you to vote
for it. Thanks. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further</p>

Thank you mister speaker.
This bill came before the ?? committee and I question it. At that time
and since that time I've done a lot of work with my local DSS as well as
other DSS's across the state and talked with some of the directors or
staff and I'm still concerned about the deal. I think the amendment was
good but the bill is not what we need in this state. And the reasons are
many. I want to share a few with you. One is that the employee case
worker safety is an issue for me. And I mentioned that in committee.
I've had case workers over the years tell me that they were threatened
by some of the clients. Some have been</p>

This is of D.S.S's, really does have um.. a staff stretched to its Nth
degree and the disclosure of information regarding recipients, uh.., is
something that I believe is going to have to go into a new system as we
automate the intake system of the D.S.S's and it may even require a new
way forward for the persons who are programming and providing um.. the
technology that...that reduces the cumbersomeness of the intake process,
and because of that reason at this time I believe that we have not
vetted this thoroughly, particularly as it relates to the cost of how
the staff would be overworked in the process of ensuring that the demand
is met to provide the full disclosure of all these recipients for all of
whom we are now currently spending an awful lot of time and doing
overtime to ensure that all the information goes into the system that is
required just to get them through intake, and for that reason I believe
I heard reference uh..something about a study commission or study group
that could possibly take into account all of those cost that we may not
see just now, beyond the cost of just of uh..uh.. a criminal background
check. Thank you so much. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr speaker. Dialer please
state your purpose.[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if representative Arp would

gentleman yield?[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Arp isn't all your doing in this
bill asking the D.S.S's to follow federal law, ain't that all your
doing? That's correct,I ... I would humbly ask that members read the
bill and the amendment that we put in there. Uhh.. I believe we've
addressed all the federal issues and in fact uh. Representative
Farmer-Butterfield spoke to her DSS director, and uh talked with him
about his concerns and try and incorporate those in the bill. Um.. I
assure you, I to I'm supportive of a study commission, and I'm gonna
author that going forward, but what this bill does is um..uh..um.. It
alleviates any federal issues regarding the confidentiality, and it sets
in place the motion going forward uh.. for the uh.. law enforcement to
be initiators of request, but what this does is start the ball rolling.
Uh.. There is no language in here uh.. that I think uh.. that was in
there previously regarding that, so I'm a little bit confused as to what
the federal issue is?[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Baskerville,
please state your purpose.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Briefly debate the
bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES] I've talked to several of my colleagues about the
bill, um.. they don't think its a violation of federal law. If it is, we
can look at page 2 section 1, subsection B line 13, that says, to the
extent otherwise allowable by federal law. So we're not violating
federal law. This bill specifically says we're only allowed do this to
the extent that it is allowable by federal law. Um.. I think that this
is a good start, um.. I agree with Representative Arp, Representative
Terry and Farmer-Butterfield about. We need to look and make sure all
these programs, eligible folks are the ones that getting uh.. getting
the benefit from these sort of programs. This is something we need to
look at statewide. I'm more than willing to do that. I commend your
support.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke please state your
purpose.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh..Speak very briefly on the bill. The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Speaker. Uh.. Members of the house, um.. this bill bothers me a lot
from the perspective of what Representative Farmer-Butterfield and
Representative Terry have said today in terms of the kind of uh..
responsibilities we are placing on D.S.S to D.S.S. workers who I think
all of know in our own counties or are already pretty badly overworked
and now we are asking them to do this. I um..I've also heard from my
county in terms of the cost of undertaking this uh..this program, and
I've also been asked by my constituents why we are doing this? Uh.. In
the sense of uh.. To whom .... Mr Chairman...Speaker.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentleman...[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm just saying
there is a lot of chatter around, If you'd be kind.[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Are we hurting by this bill? And my y constituents said that it seemed
to them that a lot of children's whose parents have not very much money
and who are relying on assistance so that they can eat well. Basically
there the ones that are being hurt by it. So i just have a lot of
concerns about it, I certainly cant support it but I also wanna mention
but I'm gonna object the third reading speaker because I have an
amendment that I wanted to run and due to the deadlines with bill
preparations and all I was unable to work on today so we'll be objecting
the third [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Leubke because the amendment
change the title the bill will be rolled over til tomorrow anyway. To

rise.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Members
recognize to debate the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr speaker
ladies and gentlemen, I'm pretty fortunate I suspect. As fortunate as
everyone in this general assembly. I've never had to be on public
assistance. I've never had to collect a check from the government in
order to put food on my table and pay my rent. I'm a very lucky guy.
We're all lucky in that sense. But I have for a lot of friends that have
not been as fortunate as I or as we. And i can tell you how aggravated
they get when they stand in line to apply for or pick up a check and
they look around and listen to the chatter. They know whats happening.
Those were my neighbors. When i lived on the other side of the other
side of the tracks. And they took great exception. They felt they were
significantly diminished. Because they felt they were being whomped in
by society with these people that were there and did not deserve to be
there. You know it. They know it. I know it. And this is good start
towards solving an obvious problem. I have a sign  in my office that I
picked up in the mountains. A simple little sign that says bring back
common sense. This is a common sense bill. This is a bill that makes
reasonable common sense that those receiving public assistant fearly
properly they don't necessarily want to be. This is a common sense bill.
And i strongly urge you to support this bill. Thank you Mr Speaker.

Presnell rise.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill, second time. [SPEAKER

CHANGES] I have in my hand the food and nutrition service police the
federal policy section 130.01i, the agency must make available upon
written request by any law enforcement officer, the address, social
security number, photograph if available, of any active or inactive food
stamp recipient if the officer furnishes the recipients name and
notifies the agency that the recipient fleeing, the recipients violating
condition of parole. So I think the issue is that there's an
inconsistency between the policy of the food nutrition service and what
you're trying to do in this law.. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr Speaker what
purpose does the general union represent of our prize [SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the general lady would yield for a question [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does

representative Presnell I'm confused as to what do you see in the bill
thats transgressing the very thing that you're talking about.[SPEAKER

again and look. Its in the same section that representative Baskerville
was referring to. So tell me when a PSS worker discovers that they have
somebody violating this who has a warrant out or has a parole what are
they suppose to do?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to answer

Just so everybody doesn’t get lost in the weeds here. The federal law
that governs the dispensing, if that’s a word, of this aid, says that it
cannot go o fleeing felons or parole or probation violator.  If the DSS
agent is made aware that the applicant is a parole or probation
violator, they simply deny the aid. That’s what this bill says.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And who does the.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady wish to ?? an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Where a DSS worker discovers that they have someone in their office and
before them that’s violating this, what are they supposed to do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Deny the aid. What we have to do is already for food stamp recipients
there are several eliminating convictions, disqualifying convictions.
DSS agents already check for disqualifying previous convictions.  For
instance, drug and certain drug charges prevents you from receiving aid.
They currently check that. What this bill does is extend to comply with
federal so that the entire block grant is not in jeopardized for the
very folks that its’ entitled.  We don’t want to jeopardize the aid to
the law abiding citizen by giving aid to the parole and probation
violators. It’s just that simple.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady from Orange wish to debate the bill further?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to ask the sponsor another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize that I closed the bill down and so I didn’t have the section
of the bill but in the title it says to require DSS to share information
with the law enforcement officer regarding an applicant and that is the
issue that I’m concerned about. I don’t have any problem with what
you’re trying to achieve in this bill, I think the intent is fine it’s
within federal law, we ought to be doing it. I just, don’t want to put.
Excuse me, I’m debating the bill.  I just don’t want to put our DSS
Department and Health and Human Services in the position of having to
get into some kind of legal discussion with the federal government or
with the law enforcement officer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The member from Orange has exhausted her time on the second time of
debate. For what person does the lady from Wilson, Representative
Farmer-Butterfield rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Arp, do you yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My friend, Representative Arp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tell me how will we finance this since the local Departments of Social
Services would not be required to cover the cost?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What we are talking about and we’ve got a fiscal note for your review
and its on the website as well. There would be$144 thousand dollars to
try and incorporate the computer changes, to incorporate the checks
that’s in here.  There are no costs beyond that to the state and there
are no local costs and that’s in the fiscal note.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Rockingham, Representative
Jones rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Member is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I know we’ve had a lot of speakers and I’ll
be brief.  Just to maybe bring a little bit more balance to the debate
here.  We did hear this bill in Health and Human Services and I was a
bit astounded then and still remain so I guess, but I wonder sometimes
when I listen to a few of these debates what the people out across North
Carolina listening on the audio, over the internet might think.  But
frankly I think it needs to be said that, to me anyway, it’s just
outrageous that an agency of the state would hold to a belief that they
are somehow prohibited from reporting a fleeing felon to law
enforcement.  Now maybe that doesn’t strike everybody here as
outrageous, but at least it does to me. Just wanted to comment on a
couple of the arguments that we’ve heard and with all due respect to my
friends that raised those arguments. First to the safety of DSS workers,
it just seems to me that by having a law that requires them to report
that, it takes that decision making process out of their hands.  Am I
going.</p>

You’re going to be judged on how many people you refer and how many
arrests result from that. How does that affect the performance of your
workers? What additional expense, training, and effort has to go into
that? And how does that get incorporated by the commission when they
evaluate what regulations to enforce? And so, I think, if we’re going to
go down this road, we need to be comprehensive about it. Again, let’s be
consistent. Let’s don’t have folks getting certain assistance from North
Carolina without having a clean record and not being under some type of
service or process or avoiding or evading that, and target individuals.
And, second of all, we need to make sure we understand the costs that
are inherent with what we’re doing, because we’re, in effect, saying
you’re going to do more work, but it doesn't cost anybody anything. We
know that is fiction. We know that’s not going to happen. So, let’s be
real with ourselves. Let’s be true to ourselves about this. If this is,
in fact, something we need to pursue, let’s actually look at what the
costs are, and let’s go ahead and have that discussion and put it into
context it needs to be in. So, I understand beyond third. I’ll stop
there, Mr. Speaker. If there’s a questions, but I’ll be voting against
it. Thank you.

Representative Arp, on page two, line 20A, there’s a statement that
nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the disclosure
of any information otherwise protected by state or federal law or

indicates that they may not release the information, your bill doesn’t
require that you release that.

House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 91: A bill to be entitled an
act to clarify the law pertaining to administrative action that may be
taken by an occupational licensing board as a result of expunged charges
or convictions under G.S. 15A-145.4 and G.S. 15A-145.5 and to prohibit
an employer or educational institution or state or local government
agency from requesting that an applicant provide information regarding
an arrest, criminal charge, or criminal conviction of the applicant that
has been expunged. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Daughtry please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, many of you may remember last year we has some
expunged bill and this bill comes from the Senate and it makes technical
corrections to the expunged bill that was passed last year. The first
correction has to do where the Occupational Licensing Board I think is
came from the real estate brokers where if your license is revoked or
taken away or vacated because of a felony and then it expunged that
taking away of the license is vacated and the licensing board does not
simply give you your license back but they start from when they have
revoked your licensing come forward to make sure you qualify both
educationally and any other requirements they have. The second technical
correction has to do with mostly colleges and universities and schools
would ask you whether or not do you ever have an expungement? If you ask
someone whether or not you ever had an expungement it just defeats the
purpose of the bill of the expungement bill to start with. So, it just
prohibits them from doing that. It’s simply all of these are technical
corrections to the original bill and I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have never seen a bill that was so far ranging with technical
corrections bill. This bill does a lot, a majority of the house is
either a freshman or sophomore I’m gonna go in the ancient history maybe
five or six years to tell that we got where we are. Every year there are
all sorts of bills to raise the penalties for various crimes. You will
see that in all of the judiciaries were doing, it doesn’t crimes the
more, we have passed lots of raising to crimes, on the other hand we are
also passing lots of bills to reduce the effects of those higher Senates
and they began a process a few years ago of expungement, they have began
with juveniles, their kids, give them a second chance then justice
reinvestment for example with drug possession basically you don’t get a
conviction the first time, the parole and then last year we had a bill
to expunge lots of records and on the house of people who had been 15
years and I mentioned at the time I said, “Look at the words of the bill
because what it is—is a license to lie.” You have the explicit
permission in the State of North Carolina to lie to your employer and
say, “No, I have never been convicted when you have.” Well, this bill
goes a lot a big step further. This is a shutting the mouth of the
employer who wants to ask that you can still lie and say, “No, I have
not been convicted.” But this is saying he can’t even ask and I think
it’s a little first amendment problem there, the freedom of speech and
frankly I’m…

... favor of giving people second chances. I just want to know when I'm
giving them second chances that I’m doing that. So, for example, a
person… I’m in a law firm. I have a trust account. I have a bookkeeper.
I’d sort of like to know if the person applying to work with me has been
guilty of stealing, even if it was ten or fifteen, twenty years ago.
Like Jean Valjean, I might say, “Oh, it was quite justified that you
stole, and come in. I’m going to give you a second chance.” But I would
like to know that. But this bill says I’ve got to shut up, and I can’t
even ask. And then, I get punished by a civil fine by the commissioner
of insurance. I don’t even get a jury on whether I actually did it. I’m
thinking that… and then…
For those of you that haven’t been here longer than one session, every
year the House passes this stuff, and every year I complain about it.
Next year, they’re going to forbid me from doing an internet Google
search to find out on my own if that person who’s applying to work for
me has actually been guilty of things, and probably the next year,
they’re going to file a bill to prevent me from even thinking about it.
We’ve gone far enough. We know that prior convictions are important. How
do we know that? Well, if you look on page two, lines 34 to 48, the law
enforcement agencies? They insist on knowing about it. If it’s so
important that we forget about all this stuff that happened in the past,
why do we let law enforcement know about it? I hope somebody will vote
“no” with me on this. We’ve gone way too far.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. When I was in
school, used to… if you do something wrong, teacher would always say,
“if you’re not careful, I’m going to put that in your permanent record”.
It always scared us to death. I never saw that permanent record, but we
always knew there was one out there somewhere. I don’t know if they have
permanent records anymore or not. But your criminal history is a
permanent record. What you do and how you behave is a matter of interest
to the state of North Carolina, whether you’re honest or whether you’re
dishonest, whether you break the law or whether you keep the law.
Now, I’m one of the people who was on the losing side of the vote last
session who said we should not be expunging these records because we
have a vested interest in knowing who behaves and who doesn’t behave.
Now I certainly believe in the, in forgiveness, and I believe that a
person deserves a second chance. But this is about what you’re doing
legally or illegally and what we’ve said is, “yes, you can commit
certain crimes, and then we’ll erase it from the record, and then we’ll
pretend like it never happened”. That’s what, that’s what an expungement
is. It’s erasing from the record as if it never happened. Well, that
doesn’t mean that employers or potential employers want to know who it
is that they’re interviewing for a job. They want to know if you’re
honest. They want to know if you’re an embezzler. They want to know if
you can be depended upon to obey the laws of the state. So now, because
of what we did the last session, they’ve figured out, “well, I’ll just
put on the question on the questionnaire ‘have you ever had your record
expunged?’’.
We’re traveling down a road that has no end in sight. Now we’re saying,
“no, you can’t even ask a question, and if you asked a question, you’re
guilty of a crime. You’re the criminal all of a sudden.” Folks, we’re
getting this all turned around. We’re trying to make crooks out of
honest people who are trying to hire good people to do a job. I don’t
see any end in sight if we don’t stop this. Really, what we ought to be
doing is eliminate the expungement bill that -</p>

Billed in. This body said that if you have gone fifteen years after you
have committed certain crime like you stole money or something when you
were a young person, you've gone fifteen years, and during that fifteen
years you have not done anything wrong, you have three people that are
not related to you that are in the community of good standing who are
willing to say that this person has turned his or her life around, and
that they ought to have a second chance. And maybe you know somebody who
has done something stupid when they were twenty two years old and
fifteen years later, they still carry around the title felon. Well, it
was thought that perhaps after fifteen years, someone could possibly
change their life, and that's why we had the bill two years ago. All
this bill does is say if you have your record expunged, then you can't
ask them, well do you, have you had your record expunged because then
that would serve no purpose. These are simple changes that are correct
that are technical in nature to the original bill. If you didn't like
the bill, then obviously Skip Stam, my good friend and very intelligent
person has never seen an expungement bill that he liked. He has got
something in his head about expungement, but this bill simply corrects
some of the, some of the things that the first bill makes correction. So
whether we like it or not, we have an expungement bill. If you want to
have that repealed you need to file another bill. This does not repeal
it. It simply makes some corrections. I hope you'll vote for it.

Thank you mister Speaker. Members of the House, I'm going to do
something I don't like to do very often which is to speak in support of
a Senate bill. But it is, which, which however in this case is a good
idea. Members, I just, I don't want to repeat what Representative
Daughtry said, but here's the deal. Whether you do or don't like
expunctions, this is not the bill to air that grievance or air that
support. This is a technical bill simply stating in cases where an
expunction has been granted, that in that case, it has the full force in
effect in the law that was intended. That is that it, that the person
doesn't have to answer about that. That's, that was the intent of the
bill. Now if members don't like that expunction bill, you've still got a
few hours to file a bill I guess to do something about that. But that's,
that, that's another topic for another day. So I would simply encourage
members to vote in support of the bill because it is, as Representative
Daughtry said it is technical in nature. It simply gives the force in
effect to what we've already passed. If you wanna argue about expunction
we can do that on another day when, when there's a true expunction bill
before us. Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Duane Hall, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think one point that everybody has possibly lost here is we're all
assuming that this is a person that has been convicted, that definitely
did it, but if you read the bill closely, it says arrest. It says
criminal charges. It's a big, big difference. Representative Stam said
he wants to know if someone's committed a crime, and I agree, I feel the
same way. I've got a business. I'd like to know before I hire them. But
a lot of you know, the way it works, I could step outside this chamber
right now and call the police and say Representative Stam slapped me.
Which I, I hope he wouldn't do. He's been nicer to me, probably, than
anyone since I've came to this chamber. He certainly wouldn't. But I
could progress beyond that. I could actually get a criminal charge
before they've had a chance to investigate and see that in fact,
Representative Stam didn't slap me outside of this chamber. So those are
on my record, and again that's debating whether or not you believe in
expungements and there's some levels I think anyone here would agree
that where expungements are in order, but if, if we allow people to ask
for any reason like this, I definitely agree with Representative
Daughtry that if we don't vote for this bill we might as well just
eliminate all expungement rules. So I hope you'll vote in support of
this bill.

technical bill, but it seems like to me in Section C, in these five,

It prohibits me as an employer from asking the question. Here’s my
problem with that, and I’ll speak from my own personal experience. 90%
of my business is with the federal government, as a prime contractor. I
am required, in order to win those contracts and be compliant with those
contracts, to notify them of any employee that I’ve got that’s ever been
arrested or convicted of a crime. If I’m not allowed to ask the question
under North Carolina law, I lose 90% of my business based on the
contracts that I currently have. That’s a real problem, if I can’t ask
that question. And for that reason, I have to vote no on this bill
today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak in support of the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I was the one of Representative Stam
mentioned that last time voted in support of this bill. When I arrived
back to Cumberland County, I had a lot of individuals ask me why would I
sign onto a Republican bill? Not understanding the fact that the bill
has a large affect on the population that the state handles on a regular
basis which is between 35 and 40,000 inmates a year or person that is in
custody of whichever law enforcement agency. This bill provides an
opportunity for individuals who have made a mistake, we did that. Now
we’re just doing some technical amendments to correct that. And I think
that it’s a bill that will provide for us what we need in this great
state. We have just about stripped individuals of this state of their
rights. It’s just the ones that say if, it’s only if you can do, and we
will restore, and we just make some technical ??. I strongly support
this bill and every respondent bill that comes before this body, I will
continue to support it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time on the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a
second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen of the House, you can make your own decision up on this bill.
Understand one thing. This is not just a technical bill. This is a
substantive bill and it is rising out of the fact that now people who’ve
had their records expunged, they don’t like the fact that they’re having
to ask the question, or being asked the question on an employment
application have you had your record expunged before. They don’t want to
answer the question so now they just figure they’ll come to the General
Assembly and get us to take the question off the list. But you know,
when we filed for public office, you had to sign a statement have you
been convicted of a felony? I guess if you have, you can get it expunged
and then you can answer it as if it’s no. Then you can, maybe we can get
the Board of Elections to take that off, so it’d violate our rights to
ask the question have you been convicted of a felony? People have a
right to know who they’re hiring. They have a right to know who they’re
electing. So this is, you can call the bill what you want to, but it is
not a technical bill. This is a very substantive bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Alexander, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to

myself between some people that I really respect the opinions of. On the
one hand we have Representative Jeter, who has told us that if the bill
were to pass, it would imperil his business. On the other hand, we have
Representatives Daughtry and Moore who eruditely and eloquently have
explained to us the limits of the measure before us. And on balance, I
must agree with them. There’s a whole lot that we’ve been talking about
here that is a déjà vu all over again if you were here when the
expungement measure was originally discussed. That’s not what we’re
talking about. What we’re talking about is whether or not you can
subvert a piece of legislation that we’ve already agreed to by asking
what in my neck of the woods they call a left handed</p>

Question, so that you can tip toe around something. On balance I think
its right for us to be toe dancing around this issue. In fact, I think
Representatives Daughtry and Moore must of been present around 1864,
when a young Abraham Lincoln said, the power of hope upon human exertion
and happiness is wonderful. It indeed is wonderful, as is the power of
redemption, and is the power of this great and aggiss body to keep us
from having folks ask questions they're going to subvert the intent of
legislation, that we've already agreed to. Which is to allow sleeping
dogs to lay and to allow people who have, for an extended period been
without blemish to allow their past to slip where it belongs into the
past. I'm going to be voting for this measure.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I hope that everybody understands where a lot of people come from on
this. Sometimes it bothers me when people say, we gotta know who we are
hiring, as if who is that person. The whole purpose of this bill is who
we are, and we are as people. We don't hold people accountable for
things that they do for the rest of their lives. It's not biblical, God,
if you look at the Bible, the Bible was created in the Old Testament and
we lived under curse. Then, we got Jesus and now we live under grace,
and because of that nobody has to be responsible for something they did
for the rest of their life. It is the basic principle of who we are as
people. When you're looking at people and saying, I want to know if I'm
hiring a thief. That person is not just generally a thief, he might of
stolen when he was 19, but at 36, through grace, through whatever, he's
not a thief. You can't label people like that. You can't say, I want to
know who it is, that's not who they are. We have a whole book that says,
that's not who they are. Thank God, a lot of us just didn't have to have
the police around the corner when we did the same things that they did.
Are you a thief? Are you a drug addict? No, none of us are. You have to
be able to look past a person's, what is on their record or what is
perceived what is on their record. You can't just stop there and start
labeling people. I would hate for someone to label me with something in
19 . . . When I was 20 years old, I'm 30 years old right now. That's
most of the people that we are trying to effect, 15 years out. If you're
willing to say I want to know if I'm hiring a thief, well you can always
search for that person. But, don't ever think that that's just who
somebody is, their record is not who they are. I hope that we can change
our mindset when we're talking about who somebody is. Nobody's going to
judge you and cast you. You don't want that to happen to you, its a
basic principle, judge you not and you be not judged. But, don't cast
somebody because they have a record and that's who they are for the rest
of their life. You're not a thief for the rest of your life, you're not
a drug addict for the rest of your life. You can change, people change
everyday and I welcome the change and I hope this body welcomes the
change and supports the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Samuelson please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Ask Representative Daughtry a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Daughtry, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Daughtry, I had some concerns about what Representative
Jeter said. I was wondering if there's anything about this bill that
would prevent him from being able to meet the qualifications for these
federal contracts that he's trying to get.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No, none whatsoever. He can ask anyone who has proposed employee whether
or not he's ever been arrested or has ever been convicted of a crime.
This bill says, you can not ask him whether or not he's ever had a crime
expunged. That's the only thing. We already have . . . The law is now
that if you expunge a crime that has been committed then that's an
expungement, it didn't exist. You've given the guy a second chance. You
can ask them whether or not they've been arrested, whether or not
they've ever had a conviction, and that's perfectly all right.</p>

How does that play into this? Or does it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It does not.
It does not play into this. This is only in those cases, particularly in
universities, where you ask the question either as part of the interview
or on the sheet itself whether or not you’ve ever had an expungement,
and we have passed a law saying an expungement, when you have an
expungement, you’re giving a person a second chance, and you can ask him
whether he’s been arrested, whether he’s had any kind of felony, and he
can answer no because it’s been expunged. We’ve given him that right.
This is simply codifying the fact that you can’t have a sheet that says
whether or not you’ve ever had an expungement. It’s simply all it does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
is recognized to debate the bill a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you
look at page 2, line 15 to 18, I think we’re talking at cross-purposes
because we’re reading the bill the wrong… in different ways. The words
“that has been expunged”, that’s called a restrictive modifier, and it
applies to any arrest, criminal charge or criminal conviction, so if an
employer just says “Have you been arrested?”, if in fact that has been
expunged, you’ve violated the law. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Will the gentleman from Wake yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, so in
other words if you’re filling out the application and it says “Have you
ever been convicted or a crime?” and you’ve had your record expunged,
you can say “No, I’ve never been convicted of a crime.” Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s in current law without this bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I understand, but that’s correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, you
have a license to lie already. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So when Representative
Jeter – [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to ask a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Would the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] So when Representative Jeter says
he has concerns about asking these questions of potential employers so
he doesn’t lose his contracts, and he asks an employee “Have you ever
been convicted of a felony?” and they’ve had it expunged and they say
“No, I’ve never been convicted,” that doesn’t get him to where he needs
to be as far as knowing about his potential employee. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that’s correct, although I don’t know federal law. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before
the House is the passage of the House Committee Substitute to Senate
Bill 91 on its second reading. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote
no. The Clerk will open the vote. All members wishing to record, please
do so at this time. The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.
70 having voted in the affirmative, 47 in the negative, The House
Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 91 has passed its second reading and
without objection – [SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection having been raised, the bill remains on the calendar. Last
bill on the calendar – I look forward to the debate tomorrow on that
bill – will be Senate bill 175. The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 175, a bill to be entitled ‘An Act
to Make Technical Corrections and Clarifications to Chapter 53C of the
General Statutes’. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Dockham, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
In the 2012 session, Senate Bill 816 rewrote the banking laws of North
Carolina. It was the first comprehensive revision in about 80 years.
Senate Bill 175 makes some technical corrections and clarifying changes
to the 2012 revisions. All stake holders have had input into these
changes and I really know of no opposition. I commend the bill to you.
I’d be happy to answer any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] further
discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the House is the
passage of the Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 175 on its
second reading. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk
