very honored and humbled today to bring before you a resolution honoring
the Girl Scout week and the 101st birthday of girl scouting. I hope that
won’t come as a surprise to you that I’ve been a Girl Scout for 44
years. Exactly. I’ve been profoundly influenced by my girls scout
leaders  Bonny Price, Ruth Lee, Lucille Holland, Jane Muney, Norma
Steves and Jane. All of those ladies were my girl scout leaders and
they’re Senator Daniels constituents. I am who I am today in great part
because of the girl scout organization. I learned in girl scouting that
if you can lead a brownie troop you can lead a corporate meeting. If you
can manage a girl scout cookie sale, you can run a marketing and sales
program in any major corporation. And finally, because I am a Mariner
girl scout, I know that if you can captain a sailboat you can run and be
a CEO and maybe even run a small country. I for my adult have been
trying to pay forward this debt to the girl scouts. On my 18th birthday
I did two things. I registered to vote and I registered to be a girl
scout leader so that I could start repaying that debt that to this day I
cannot pay. And so at this time I’d like</p>

...present the resolution.  Whereas on March 12th, marks the 101st
birthday of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., founded by Juliet Gordon Lowe in
1912 in Savannah, Georgia, whereas throughout its distinguished history,
girl scouting has inspired millions of girls and women to the highest
ideals of courage, confidence, and character, whereas through the girl
scout leadership experience girls develop skills and lessons that will
serve them a lifetime so that they may contribute to their communities,
whereas girl scouting takes an active roll in increasing girl awareness
and opportunities available to them today in math, science, sports,
technology, and other fields that can expand their horizons, and whereas
girl scouts has shaped the lives of 53% of female senior executives and
business owners, 60% of women in Congress, and virtually every female
astronaut, and this one, very humble senator, whereas nearly 3 million
current girl scout members nationwide will celebrate 101 years of this
American tradition with 50 million women who are former girl scouts, the
living proof of the impact of this amazing movement, and whereas in
partnership with tens of thousands of adult volunteers, Girl Scouts of
North Carolina serves more than 67,000 girls in all 100 North Carolina
counties, be it resolved that the Senate honors the memory of Juliet
Gordon Lowe for her role in founding the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. and
expresses appreciation to the members of the girl scouts for their
commitment to building girls of courage, confidence, and character who
make the world a better place.  Finally, I would like to recognize that
there's a group of girl scouts here today, celebrating with us, and they
will be serving us milk and cookies after session and those are the Girl
Scouts, girls and volunteers, who are members of the North Carolina
Coastal Pines organization of which I am affiliated.  I appreciate this

Speaker: Senators, moving on to the local bill. Second roll call senate
bill 81, the clerk will read.
Clerk: Senate bill 81, charlotte regional airport authority.
Speaker: Senator Rucho is recognized to explain the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and gentleman of the
senate, senate bill 81 establishes a regional, a Charlotte regional
airport authority, is a local bill that tries to bring in some regional
buying to what is a very key asset to not only the city of Charlotte or
the region, but the state. Senator Apodaka, that airport is the 6th
busiest airport in the world. Yes sir, not McClemburgh County – the
world. That being said, t is a very key component to the economic
success of not only that region, but the entire state. People in NC,
both people on vacation or on business, can go to Charlotte and then
anywhere in the world, because of the fact that we are fortunate to have
the Charlotte Douglas airport in NC. The only reason it is there,
because we really do not have the population density to support an
airport of that size, between 7/800 flights across the world, but
because of the fact that it is a very low cost airport hub for airlines
to utilize. That is why U.S. Air and the combination U.S. American have
used it as a hub and will continue to do so, but the key component to it
is to be sure that the proper leadership is in place to allow forth that
continuation of that low cost hub. If we loose that, not only do we lose
an economic driver, not only for Charlotte, the region, but for the
entire state, and that would be a real tragedy. I will say to you that
this purpose of this bill is to establish an authority made up of
selections of business people with experience in aviation and logistics
and business law and bonds, and other areas that will</p>

<p id="20:00">
firm leadership with experience and dedication to make not only the
Charlotte Douglas Regional Airport an international airport, and allow
it to reach its full economic potential, but ladies and gentlemen of the
Senate, if you haven’t learned, the intermodal park, that is part of
that airport, is a critical economic component because it will add tens
of thousands of new jobs to the state, it will add millions of dollars
to the economy, because that will be the Eastern internal port for the
East Coast. That being said, it is critical the right leadership be put
into place to allow for the full implementation of a plan, so that we
can take full advantage of its economic opportunities. There were some
questions discussed during the two committee meetings that were had, one
was in Finance and the other was in Commerce. We’ve made every effort to
try to explain all of the concerns and you have a bond letter before you
that explains the questions that we’re dealing with, talking about the
fact that this is an explanation of those concerns, and the conclusion
says that for the reasons stated above, it is our view that the creation
of the authority as a successor, which is allowed under the bond
documents, of the city with the respect to airport pursuant to
percentable 81, will not impair contractual obligations owed to the
bondholders of the airport revenue bonds, and therefore should not
require even bondholder approval. There was a lot of discussion about
the bondholders. This letter explains the fact that they really don’t
need to do that, because it’s not the city of Charlotte that guarantees
that airport revenue bonds, it is the airport itself, and it is
subsequently the airlines that use it because they are the last source
of collateral for those bonds. It is well supported, it is well
financed, and if it’s well managed, the sky is the limit both in the
airport and the intermodal park. There were other discussions regarding
the question of whether the city deserves some form of compensation for
it. If you look back during World War II, the city was given 600 acres
by the federal government to allow them to exclusively use that land for
an airport. It was given to them, so there was no cost to that. There
was some expansion. Initially, revenue bonds were all paid for by that
airport and, very candidly ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, the city
of Charlotte cannot use its taxing authority to pay for the principal,
the interest, or premiums of any of those bonds, so the airport stands
on its own merit both rating and elsewise. Like in anything, what we’ve
learned in the legislature over the last few years, and whenever there
is something being done, anybody can sue anytime they want. If the city
of Charlotte decided to sue for something of compensation, I’m sure the
airport would manage it, but if the city of Charlotte was actually
interested in the well-being and the continued growth of that asset, why
would you want to undermine it? Therefore, I can’t even imagine they’d
be willing to consider something like that, even if they have the legal
authority to do so. Mr. President, I have one amendment that I’d like to
submit now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, do the members have a copy of the
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forward your amendment, Senator. The clerk will

First i`d like to ask senator padaca a question that arose in here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca is not in the room, Senator Apodaca? Is there a Senator
Apodaca?   Senator Apodaca, will you yield to a question. He yields,
senator you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sentor Apodaca for the last two weeks we were waiting on a opinion from
a bond counselor, i was under the oppression that we were waiting to
hear from the state treasure office. Today we received this memo from
Jones Walker, we dont know who aligns for a better law it is, it is a
amenadon not a a legal opinion, besides no case law. should we wait to
hear from the state treasure who ultimatily has the management
responsibilites before we respond and head down this rode?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator its my understanding that, they all go to outside console to get
this opinion. Thats one reason we are waiting, the treasure is still
waiting, for outside console that has not been involved in this bond.
so, you know we can argue that one console is better than the other. in
my experience there are particular attornies i dont care for,either
side, but SO I think with that being said this has got a long course to
run, the house can take it up if something comes back differently, but i
think it time to move it on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Senator do you have follow up, that yields..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
this letter is not to the general assembly, its not to any of the bond
holder, its not to those who have any particular interest in this matter
other than to the bill sponsor, so im a little considered in reference
to thy independence of the letter.
[Speaker changes]
I understand that senator, i think we have to defer the bill sponsor
that he is comfortable to what what he received, then it would rest on
him.

Senator you have he floor speak to the bill.

Ladies and gentle of the senate i raise today on behave of the citizens
of scarlet. I raise today as a former member of the scarlet city
console, that had a fifty share responsibility of the airport. Along
with my college Senator Clark Felter, and i raise on behave of the
citizens of district 40, many of whom live and reside in the city of
scarlet. former scarlet major Ben Douglas, back in the thirties was
considered a visionary. The airport today Scarlet Douglas international
airport was named after him. Back in the thirties in the mist of the
depression, he encourage the citizens of Scarlet and its leadership at
the time to buy bonds for what he consider to build a modern airport. He
believed to that grow and development of the city of scarlet depended
was directly related to air travel. And that airport was just as
important as the  natural resource of water. the city of scarlet and its
citizens took that leap of faith with Major Douglas at that time. And by
the mid-thirties Scarlet had a number of air traffic in terms of number
of cargo and passengers. Majors and city console after Major Douglas,
and contemporary times, major  belt, major Venroot, Major Gant, Major

takes a different perspective on it. And, not only does it, takes a
different perspective on the issue relating to the bonds to the airport,
people look at the third paragraph which I think is extremely important,
and I quote from the letter, we also wanted to raise the issue for you
about the affect of this legislation on the city's other enterprise debt
financing including water and sewer, storm water and transit. The city
should consider whether it needs to include specific disclosures in it's
official statement related to the General Assembly's ability to transfer
a city enterprise to an authority without the city's consent or
approval. Since the city does not know what impact the General
Assembly's actions will have on bond holders, it cannot predict if
something ?? might happen in the future. I mean, well, every member in
this room would have to worry about your water, and your, your regional
airport and your authorities because the state may come in and take it
away from you. So there's too many unanswered questions, too many
concerns in reference to these bonds to move forward in this fashion. I
tried to ask, why are we doing this? And that's something the bill
sponsor in his preamble never said. He said he wants the, he wants
regional buy in. We've always had regional buy in. No municipality.
Charlotte regional partnership. Mecklenburg County, York County, Union
County, Lincoln County. No one has offered a different opinion in
reference to the operation of the airport. He states that we want to
maintain that as a low-cost airport hub. It is. And it will be in the
future. It's in the best interest of the enterprise and the best
interest of US Airways, American Airlines. He talks about proper
leadership. Talks about proper leadership for the airport. Well for the
last 77 years, under the direction of the city and council members, and
our advisory board, and our advisory board reads like a who's who of
Charlotte businesses leaders past and present. Their extension goes well
beyond the city limits. These are men and women who have ?? and
expertise in a wide variety of companies and businesses that bring those
expertise to the airport. There isn't leadership at the airport. Again
he talks about the inter-modal park. Well this is something that ??
Senator Clodfelter has been talking about for years. Planning and
strategy, making sure that we all are investing in the airport. And the
talks about the letter. The General's ?? letter. The letter that we
waited two weeks for. The letter that is an opinion not a memorandum,
it's a memorandum, I'm sorry, not an opinion. No case law of it. I guess
it fits the purpose.</p>

<p id="40:00">
Gentlemen of the Senate, I, you may be asking yourself right now, well
all this is so good now. The airport is so effective, so efficient. The
airport is doing its job. The management structure is there. Why are we
discussing this legislation, why the change? I don’t know. You may be
asking me, Malcolm, does the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce support this?
They’ve  taken no position. Does the Charlotte Regional Partnership
supports this? They’ve taken no position. Does the Mecklenburg County
Board of County Commissioners which represents the towns and cities
support this? They’ve taken no position. They’ve all ask why are we
doing this? Why are we intentionally breaking something that’s effective
and efficient , that’s not broken, why are we doing it on purpose? Why
are we about to destabilize the region? So I went back and did some
research. And I said well, let me read what the bill’s sponsor has been
saying in the papers. Let me listen to past interviews he has on the
radio and come up with what I think this is all about. What he talks
about the Charlotte Airport and low cost and how that somehow the
intervention of the police department at the airport has driven up the
costs of the airport and that’s why we need an authority. What he does’t
say is tell the story about Mr. Tisdale. He doesn’t tell you that a
16-year-old high school student found himself at the airport. By all
standards, he was a good student, ROTC student. He climbed over the
fence which was supposed to be a secured perimeter undetected, makes his
way across the tarmac undetected. Finds himself in the wheel well of a
plane, U.S. Airwest Flight 1176 bound to Boston. That plane takes off
from Charlotte to Boston. They don’t know whether or not young Mr.
Tisdale died because he froze to death at the high altitude. They don’t
know whether he was crushed to death of being in the wheel well. Or he,
they don’t know whether or not he died because he fell from the sky upon
landing in Boston. The Charlotte City Council fulfilled its fiduciary
responsibility and ordered a comprehensive study of airport security.
Two weeks later, someone else was able to penetrate this, the airport.
That study done by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department, TSA, all
those agencies that have touchpoints at the airport concluded that
changes were needed. And in fact,
before that incident occurred there was only 42 full-time officers at
the airport, the sixth busiest airport in the world. So yes we saved
some money, but every passenger was in danger. Instead of Mr. Tisdale
jumping that fence, it could have easily been a terrorist jumping that
fence. The City of Charlotte fulfilled its fiduciary responsibility and
took the necessary actions to make sure that every visitor at that
airport, every boy, girl, man, and child, woman, all were safe and
secured. And the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department added that
level of security. That’s why some of the opponents said that well, we
don’t want Charlotte intervening with security at the airport. I say
that they fulfilled their fiduciary responsibility. And then they were
saying that well, we don’t want the City of Charlotte taking money from
the airport and utilizing it for other city services. Well, you just
can’t do that. That is against the law. It’s against FAA regulations. In
short, the city attorney has said, simply put, airport revenues cannot
be used to fund non-airport municipal server programs such as public
transit or city-wide police services. Just not happening. You can’t do
it. False analogy, simply cannot do it. So that part of the</p>

Simply does not add up for a whole lot of folks. And then they said that
the airport was only being managed by city managers sitting in the
corner doing something. I'm paraphrasing. If fact, the airport is backed
by the seventeenth largest city in the country. A professional staff
under the direction of the city manager instructed by the city council
and mayor. It has always taken its fiduciary responsibilities serious in
terms of growing the airport and the proof point is the airport's
effectiveness, it's efficiency, it's ability to create jobs for the
region. A regional asset.
So to say that somehow the city is not doing it's oversight
responsibilities simply is not true. Then they said well, the airport
director is near retirement so we've got to do something. I have a whole
lot of respect for Jerry Orr, our airport director. He was there when I
was a member of the city council. But I have a funny feeling that if he
should leave today or tomorrow, retire today or tomorrow, is terminated
today or tomorrow, that the seventeenth largest city in the country with
the backing of a major stakeholder like US Airways, can identify and
find someone can run the Charlotte Douglas International Airport.There
was a time when it was said that the two chairs that Senator Berger and
Senator Apodaca sit in today that what's going to happen when Senator
Rand and Senator Basnight leaves? We didn't skip a beat. We just kept
moving. And if Mister Orr leaves today or tomorrow, the city of
Charlotte will not skip a beat. We will keep moving.
And this was the one that really kind of surprised me a little bit.
Well, we've got to change the Governor's structure of the airport today
before something bad happens tomorrow, and I'm paraphrasing. The airport
is effectively run, very efficient, very well managed, is healthy. It's
vital to the economy. Everything is working great but we want to change
that just in case something happens tomorrow. That's like you're going
to the doctor and the doctor says all your tests are fine: your urine
sample, your blood pressure, your heart rate, stress test, everything.
You're fine; you're fit; you're a specimen of health but wait. Just in
case something happens tomorrow I'm going down to order you to the ER
room because we're going to take out your heart and give you a
pacemaker. Each and every one of you would look at your doctor as though
he was crazy. I'm fine, I'm healthy, I'm fit. You're about to make
matters worse not better.
I am standing before you today urging you not to rip out the heart of
the region by transferring the airport that has been everything, a model
of success to an authority. We don't know the full impact of the bonds.
Senator Rucho has a letter, City of Charlotte has a letter. The proper
thing to do is to wait for the State Treasurer's Office but we're not
doing that. The proper thing to do was to study this issue to see if a
change is warranted. And with that Mister President, I'd like to send
forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator, do the members have copies?

get some facts and some data so that I can make the best decision. I
will tell you this, based upon my word as a gentlemen, if the facts come
back and support an authority, I will support and authority. But the
fact of the matter is no one in this chamber right now knows. Not even
the bill sponsor. So I would just ask for your strong consideration to
study this issue so we can get the facts and so we can see what's in the
best interest of the city of Charlotte and in the entire region. Thank
you Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES} Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
you have the floor to speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. I join Senator Grayham and Senator Ford in commending the amendment
to you. If this bill is a good idea today, it will be a good idea
tomorrow. If it's a good idea with some tweaks and some conditions and
some adjustments today, then it will still be the good idea with those
tweaks, conditions, and adjustments tomorrow but we will have had a
chance to get those done on the front end first before we launch out
into an adventure. If on the other hand this bill is a bad idea today I
sure would like to know it before I do jump over the cliff. And I think
most of your probably approach the business of this chamber the same
way. There's a cautionary tale that I want to tell in just a second but
let me make reference to the logistics of the study that Senator Rich
alluded to you and let me read to you precisely what they recommended.
These are there words, not mine. It's pertinent to the amendment that's
been offered. Further investigation and legal expertise is needed to
formulate the appropriate governance and financing models for these
proposed regional assets and the model may differ from region to region.
However, these models should be developed and questions answered before
embarking on subsitive actions related to their creations and the
expenditure of funds for the inland ports and infrastructure related
thereto. That's the task force recommendation. Case by case, each on its
own, they may differ from time to time and area to area and asset to
asset and I think that's a very good recommendation for us and the
amendment speaks to that. And finally Mr. President I want to offer a
caution to us. Some of you who were here in the last session will
realize that we tried that already. We tried it with the airport owned
by the city of Ashville. And today, over a year after that legislation
was passed, things are still in Limbo with respect to the status of that
airport. Legislation has no yet been implemented because of objections
lodged against the legislation by the federal aviation administration.
Objections that have not yet been answered or fully resolved. So that
airport sits in Limbo stature which is not good for economic development
of western North Carolina regions in any way. And how long that limbo
will continue? I don't know. That log jam could break tomorrow, or it
could take a long period of time for it to ever be resolved. In the
meantime, uncertainty reigns and that's not a responsible way to proceed
with a decision of this magnitude and for that reason, I think the
amendment is worthy of your consideration and deserves your support. The
city has heard the bill sponsor and that's why they have agreed to a May
1st deadline so that the results of all of the questions that you have
and that they have and that everyone has can be answered in time for
them to be back in front of this session of the General Assembly. I
don't think anyone would say that's foot dragging. They've agreed to pay
for it themselves and they've secured the cooperation already of U.S.
Airways. They should be given that opportunity, I ask you to vote yes on
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator you have the floor the speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Members, Tim Cloudfelter brings up an
excellent point about the actual airport. The FAA still hasn't ruled.
They're still kicking it down the road. But it also defeats the first
point of the argument that you should study this. The bottom line is you
won't get the FAA to do anything until you present what has to be done
to them. So if you study this some more and a year from now you send it
to the FAA, you're going to wait a couple more years</p>

years before you get a decision back so you should go ahead and move
forward, send it to the FAA and let them deal with it at their pace

support this amendment so we can get the ball rolling and get this over
to the House; I mean defeat the amendment.  I am so sorry, I may vote
for it but I think I'll vote against it.

Senator Klodfelter what is the purpose for your ???
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]

amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Apodoca they do move at a glacial pace but having read the
materials that they presented and the questions they posed, every one of
them could have been anticipated in advance, they are all laid out in
FFA regulations and they could have been considered and dealt with on
the front end and we would not have had the delay we are currently
experiencing with that legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Any further question or debate?  Hearing none, the question for the body
is the passage of amendment 2.  All in favor will vote aye, opposed will
vote no.  Five seconds will be allowed for the voting, the Clerk will
record the vote.  17 having voted in the affirmative and 32 in the
negative, amendment 2 fails and now the bill as amended is back before

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
So do the members have copies of the amendment?

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Senator.  You can send forward your amendment.  The Clerk

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Graham moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Graham is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. President.  Ladies and gentleman of the Senate, if indeed
this is to be a regional authority, then in fact, the members who are
appointed to the authority should be appointed by individuals coming
from the region.  The bill as it is outlined gives an appointment to the
authority to the Governor, gives an appointment to the Speaker of the
House as well as President Pro Tem of the Senate.  This amendment amends
the bill that would give an additional appointment to the Mayor of the
City of Charlotte, an appointment to the Chair of the Mecklenburg Board
of County Commissioners which represents the panels around the city of
Charlotte and Charlotte and it gives an appointment to this chief
executive officer of the Charlotte Regional Partnership which is a non
profit organization that deals in regional partnership, regional
cooperation; this group has been working together for some time now and
I think that if we are true to the sense of the authority then there is
no need to give power brokers in Raleigh an opportunity to appointment
members to a regional board where they have little or no governing
structure. I hope you will accept the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Any further discussion or debate?  Hearing none,
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Richards??, for what purpose is your ??
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Under the authority of the chair, I just want to make sure I have the
correct amendment here.  What is the number of that, sir?  Excuse me, I
need to ask the question to make sure I have the right amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Go ahead, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
It is SR S81ARW and it should include the Mecklenburg Board of County
Commissioners and Charlotte Regional Partnership.  14.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I don't have 14 in front of me.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Richards ??, do you have further comments?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes sir, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, I was reading the number 13 portion, I
assume that was the one he was talking about but needless to say, in
this situation, the people that are selected, each county commissioner,
each of the surrounding counties get a chance to select somebody that
will represent the interest of the entire region coming from those
counties; the Mecklenburg County does already have a vote as does the
mayor and the city council and then there were two or three</p>

Because the way we do business, with credit in this state, is, We don't
walk away from debt, and we don't take chances with municipal debt or
state debt. We're sound [LAUGH] excuse me, wrong, sounder than the
dollar. In terms of the debt issue ??? the state of North Carolina and
its subdivisions. I don't monkey around with that. I don't want to
monkey around with that. I want to know what the treasurer says, and I
think that's the responsible thing for us to do here. Um, I want to say
something else about a topic that Senator Graham didn't address. I don't
want to repeat what he's already said. I want to talk about the general
assembly's power and ability in the circumstances we're in with this
particular piece of legislation. It troubles me that, [SIGH]
Well let me back up. Constitution of this state gives us authority in
this body to provide for the governance of local government. Counties
and cities. Article 7 section 2 says: we shall provide for the
government of local-- of localities in the state. We can do it however
we want to do it. We can do whatever we want to do with respect to the
government of cities and counties in this state, and so, I've heard it
said that this is well within the General Assembly's power to act, and
therefore lets just go ahead and do this. This is what we think is
right. We have the power to do this. Lets just go ahead and do it.
I don't want to caution you that that is not very clear, but that's the
correct answer, about whether the General Assembly has power to act in
these circumstances, to do this. The, um, the municipalities in this
state are really two headed creatures. The courts[?] have a dual
function. They act as governments, but they also act as private
corporations. They act with the powers of government in some cases, but
they also act the same as a proprietary corporation would act. That's
what the difference between governmental action by a local government
and proprietary action by a local government means. Again, those of you
who have been in local government know exactly what I'm talking about:
The difference between the governmental role of a city and the
proprietary role of a city. I'm going to to read you what our Supreme
Court says about that. I'm not going to interperet, 'cause I don't want
you to take my interpretation. I'm going to read their words of what
they say.
They say, &quot;Municipal corporations posess a double character. One
govenmental, legislative, or public. The other in a sense proprietary or
private, In their private character the theory is that their powers are
supposed to be confered not from considerations of government of the
state at large but the private advantage of the community that is
incorporated as a distinct legal person. And as to such powers, and to
property aquired there under, and contracts with reference there to, the
municipal corporation is to be regarded as a private corporation. Or at
least not public in the sense that the power of The Legislature over it
or the rights represented by The Legislature are omnipotent. In matters
govenmental in character, it is conceded that the municipal--
municipality is under the absolute control of The Legislature. But as to
its proprietary or private functions, The Legislature is under the same
constitutional restraints that are placed on it with respect to private
corporations.&quot; That's a statement directly from our state Supreme
Court.
Now what is an Airport? That question has been in the courts twice
already in North Carolina. One is coming out of Rahleigh-Durham, the
other coming out of Ashville. Both times the Supreme Court said
unanimously: an airport is a proprietary or private operation of the
city, not a governmental operation. It belongs to the city in the same
respect as any other private property. And so what are the
constitutional limits on what the legislature can do about that private
property? And again, the Supreme Court of this state in a case against
the city of Albermarlough [SP?] has told us the answer to that question
already. We don't have to guess. Not my words. Not my interpretation.
These are their words:
It may be admitted that corporations such as cities may in some respects
be subject to legislative control, but it will</p>

Partly be contended that the legislative power is so transcendent that
it may at its will take away the property of the corporation or change
the usage of its funds acquired under the ?? period. Full stop. Can’t be
done. City of Albemarle took the General Assembly to the Supreme Court
on that question and that’s exactly what the Supreme Court said. The
United States Supreme Court has also said the same thing. It has long
been accepted that the sovereign may not take the property of A for the
sole purpose of transferring it to party B. Period. That’s exactly
what’s happening in this legislation. That’s exactly what’s happening in
this legislation. And this is an experiment, you know? The city may
choose not to contest this if we take this action, but they may choose
to contest it as Albemarle contested the action of the General Assembly
with respect to its water system. But why do we want to put this airport
at that risk? Why do we want to create that kind of turmoil? Why do we
want to take that chance of disrupting a first-class, well-run,
world-class airport? I’ve heard no good reason for doing that. All I’ve
heard are guesses about what might happen in some future, unknown world,
under conditions no one can describe. That’s not a sufficient reason for
taking the property of the City of Charlotte, without compensation by
the way. And beyond the power of the General Assembly to do so. I would
ask you to vote against the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further
discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak
briefly on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, you have the floor
to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President and ladies and
gentlemen of the Senate, I was going to remain quiet but I’ve seen three
developments here today that cause me great concern. First let me say
that my whole orientation toward the takings clause of the North
Carolina and the United States Constitutions I guess was shaped by
Republican views on it. I was one of the rare early sponsors of the
limitation of governments of this state in exercising eminent domain,
and what they needed to do so that they clearly when they took property,
they were using it for a public purpose, and public use. I also in
looking at these amendments that have been turned down, believed the
rhetoric that I heard, that the people who decide whether they’re going
to take your property or impose conditions on it, are people that you
ought to have some opportunity to vote out of office or keep in office.
First thing this legislation that you’re preparing to pass has done is
violate both of those principles. You know, flight paths are very
important concepts. I remember the fights we had at Raleigh Durham, as
it became a bigger airport and some of the quieter planes started coming
in. Especially 20 years ago when the area was developing rapidly under
the flight path. A lot of the people who appointed the airport
authority, either Raleigh City Councils, the Wake County Commissioners,
the Durham County Commissioners, or the Durham City Councillors, came
under extreme pressure to pressure the FAA and other folk, to make sure
that those planes came in quiet, that stage 3 aircraft was used quicker
than it ordinarily would have been. That is quieter aircraft. Yet you
vote for an amendment that says somebody can determine all those things
about the Charlotte airport, who lives 50, 75 miles away in another
county and not going to feel any of the heat for the decisions that they
make. On eminent domain. You talk about somebody who lives 75, 80, 90
miles away being able to condemn residences in the City of Charlotte,
because that’s who’s around the airport now, and the people who are
condemned have no choice but to go along with it. They can’t vote the
rascals out of office who did it to them, and they can’t vote the
rascals out of office who appointed those who did it to them. That’s not
the case with the Raleigh Durham Airport Authority, it’s not the case of
the Triad Airport Authority, I don’t believe. Because I think that all
of the counties have skin in the game. These counties here don’t have
any skin in the game because there’s no price they pay when they make
decisions direct</p>

&lt;h3&gt;affecting the citizens around that airport. The other thing
that I've come to appreciate very much is the certain conservative
nature of a lot of republicans that have befriended and followed. And I
read these two, well, I read one opinion, from a law firm in North
Carolina that does bond work in North Carolina, and I happen to do some,
but does extensive bond work. One of the most highly recognized and I
think revered lawyers who does bond work in the state, says that if we
believe that the legislation will create several issues. However note
that it would require much more diligence to complete a full review of
all the potential impacts. Who says that in bonds that the city might
issue in the future that you will have to put a disclaimer in it that
the general assembly might come back and somewhere or other, undo what
this bond has said it was doing. Not just with Charlotte, but for
Raleigh, for any government in the state. And, lastly, the letter voices
the opinion. My firm also does some securities work, and some class
actions associated with violating securities laws of misrepresenting
issues to both shareholders, bondholders, and various others who act on
the information that you've disclosed for them. And, the lawyers in this
chamber, every single lawyer will certainly remember a lesson I learned
my first night at law school when my law school Dean said, you know, you
folk are headed to a different experience. And you've got to remember
invested in you starting today is a knowledge of the Constitution, a
knowledge of the law, that nobody else in this society will have. And
part of your obligation will be to use that knowledge because you are
the unique possessors of it. But use it as such a way that it benefits
everybody and use it cautiously. So, when you look at this thing from
this law firm down in Louisiana and you realize that there's no action
that anyone can take based on the representations in this memorandum.
First, there's no privy between the person that it's sent to and anybody
who's bought bonds, whether it’s the city who issued them or anybody who
may have purchased them. So there's nothing you can do if this fellow is
giving you bad advice. You can't go sue him for the 800 million, or
billion dollars that the airport is worth. On the other hand you get an
opinion, and that's why they carefully choose the words in this
memorandum from Louisiana. It doesn't say it's our opinion. He says I
have this view of it. He doesn't say that this is a fact, or this is a
fact, or this is a fact. Opinion letters have to take a hard position on
the issue. We issue them all of the time, whether it's in this area, or
in real property or anything else. You take a hard position saying that
I'm going to stand by this opinion because it's official. This thing
from Jones Walker is like a first year legal memorandum. Every first
year law student knows how to make one. The law can be this, the law
could be that, we've reviewed this, reviewed that, but I'm not taking a
hard position on what the law is, and you can't hold me accountable for
it.  That's what you got going on here. And so I say to the lawyers in
here, all of them, that you all know what the implication of this thing
is. We're playing with fire, we're really playing with real money here.
And if it adversely affects the airport at Charlotte then it adversely
affects the airport at Raleigh, and it adversely affects every
governmental unit in the state. And we ought to be a little more careful
before we march down that road. You said that this is a local bill. The
only thing that's local about it is that the sponsor says that I'm from
Mecklenburg and this airport's in Mecklenburg everything else you've
made it state wide. It's the only reason I got an extra senate. You make
the appointments state wide, you make its implications at least region
wide. And you do everything except make it local. You say that if it
fails it affects the rest of the state and it affects the region. So
it's not just a local bill. All of us have an interest in it, and all of
us ought to vote based on those interests, rather than unfortunately as
happens to us sometimes we get marched down the road like lemmings, and
we feel we can't do anything about it. At some point, my friends, we
have to stand up for what we believe, especially when we know in our
heart of hearts-&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

That we're making the wrong decision, and we're being driven to that
decision for no good reason. I hope you'll wait until we can get an
opinion form the treasurer so that her office or the lawyer that she has
hired can tell us what the real law is and we can then make informed
decisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Nesbitt for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt you have the floor to speak on the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President and members of the senate.
Welcome to the new face of politics in North Carolina. I've been
experiencing this for over a year and it's given me a lot of time to
think about it, and I'm gonna tell you something, we're all sitting
here, we know that the city of Charlotte built this airport. I've always
- and it's interesting to me, I've always considered the folks from
[AUDIO DROPS], they'll walk back over there and sit down. They're no
worse off. The people of Charlotte are out an airport. And that's what
you're gambling here. Actually in some of our instances my concern is
that those people locally will never control the asset again. This is
being set up so the folks of Charlotte can't [AUDIO DROPS] a little bit.
But because one guy decides he's bigger than everybody there, he goes
and gets him a posse and they get legislation and off we go. Empire
building, [??]. You end up with an appointed board that nobody elects to
hold them accountable. When they start off the cliff you can't stop
them. If their city employees you can call your city council and you can
have input and they can put a stop to it. But in this case they won't
stop until it hits the bottom off the other side.
And for those of us that this happens to along the way we can see that
and it's usually done by members who are either from other counties or
don't represent the city. It's a great deal in terms of where their
districts come from. So the city can't even get back to the people that
are doing this to them. And the people that voted [AUDIO DROPS] in those
cities cannot do anything about it. Surely we're not gonna run the state
of North Carolina this way, where we're all under threat of our neighbor
deciding he likes what we've got and come and taking it. Because he's a
democrat and you're a republican.
And let me tell you something that's really really serious in this bill,
if you read that letter from that bond attorney he says that down at the
bottom of page four I think it is, he said it's unlikely that the
transfers contemplated in this bill would cause there to be [AUDIO
DROPS] a re-issuance of the airport revenue bonds. Well he may be right
about that. The people that are going [AUDIO DROPS] to cause it to be
reissued and they're gonna cause it have trouble are the bond holders.
Do you think that you can go in and do a hostile take over [AUDIO DROPS]
and take these people's airports and they're [AUDION DROPS], predict if
something like this would happen in the future like taking their water
system or taking their sewer system. And it may be a material disclosure
for the city to tell the bond holders that the general assembly has
introduced legislation to remove an enterprise form the city's control.
And potential bond holders should be aware if such were to happen to
the...</p>

But enterprise system, another one in the future, that it could
adversely affect the bond holders. Now you put that in a bond issue and
try to sell it. Say we’re going to build some water lines out here and
we need to borrow about a billion dollars and oh by the way they may
come and take it away from us and we won’t own it tomorrow but somebody
will pay you. Senator Clodfelter pointed out to you what a great
standing we have in the financial community in this country. We’re
fixing to get in serious trouble if we dump off and split and I would
ask you the best thing to do is vote against this bill and let’s stop
and we can come back later if we see some wisdom in it and do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? Hear none. Question
for the senate. Is the passage of the committee substitute number two to
senate bill 81 as amended on its second reading? All in favor will vote
aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting
and the clerk will record the vote.
Thirty three having voted the affirmative and 16 in the negative. The
committee substitute number two to senate bill 81 as amended passes its
second reading and will remain on the calendar. Do we have any notices
or announcements today? Senator Brown for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Announcement
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator you have [break in recording]…all for your
announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a reminder republicans will caucus immediately
after session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? caucus will meet at 7:30 in the morning in Room
414. We’re having Commissioner Tauter come over and encourage all of you
to come that will. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other notices or announcements? Any further
business to come before the senate? If not, the Chair recognizes Senator
Apodaca for motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. I have two motions, first one
is I move that senate bill 187 currently in the rules committee, studies
on humans unlawful, be removed from rules and re affirmed committee on
healthcare.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection so ordered
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President I move…[break in recording] … that the

resolutions, the receipt and referral of committee reports and the
receipt of messages from the house and the governor to reconvene
