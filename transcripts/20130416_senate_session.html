To speak on the bill.

Senator Davis, you have the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Mr. President and members. This was a bill that came through
committee. I now have some just questions and concerns and more so
sought clarity after the committee meeting. But I want to be clear as to
what this does. This is a local bill but I think they're as a remnant of
something that could have a far reach and implication. In the bill what
it does, it eliminates the ETJ outside of Asheville the city. And, after
it eliminates the ETJ, it then allows the county to continue making
appointments to the city's Planning Board and Board of Adjustment. For
those municipal government you realize that the ETJ itself is set-up for
management planning purposes and the representation of the ETJ is to
forge residents who are in the…</p>

...county, but not city residents, an opportunity to weigh in to the
planning decisions of the municipality.  Well what happens in this case,
it eliminates the ETJ, but yet there's a continuation of the
representation tied to the ETJ.  What I would like to do is send forth
an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, do the members have copies of your amendment?
Senator Davis, do the members have copies?
Senator Davis.  Do the members have copies of the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.  I'm sorry.  They're coming for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clodfelter, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If it's not out of order, while we're distributing the
amendment I'd like to make a motion under Rule 29 that I be recused from
voting on the amendment or any other matters relating to this bill.  I
have sent forward my statement of reasons.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator D. Davis moves to amend a bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President.  As I said earlier,
typically representation of the ETJ comes with the ETJ.  When we
eliminate the ETJ, what this amendment would do, instead of continuing
to make appointments to the town's or a city's Planning and Board of
Adjustment, this simply says that until such time the county and the
city works out the elimination of the ETJ, that the county will continue
to make the appointments to the City Plan-- Municipal Planning Board and
Board of Adjustment.  However, once the ETJ is eliminated, then what
would happen is the city would have the option of continuing to make the
appointments.  And speaking with staff, and I want to be clear as to
what's before us here, when we eliminate the ETJ, the Planning Board and
the Board of Adjustment-- this is not-- Senator Davis ?? staff clearly
says that the only action, only decisions that a municipality can make
are surrounding the jurisdiction itself.  So the question then is why
would we continue to have county representation?  At least what this
does, it would allow the municipality to continue to make the
appointment at their discretion, so they would continue until, until--
in terms of the county would continue to make their appointments until
which time the ETJ is eliminated, and then the city would have the
option if they would like to continue to make those appointments.  And
what I would really emphasize here, especially those that have a
municipal background, is you understand even the Board of Adjustment--
the Board of Adjustment for example is a quasi-judicial branch and
they're making decisions that not even the elected folk are actually
weighing in.  So I do ask for your consideration and support on the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  Members, I have a question for Senator
Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis, you are managing the bill, this House
bill, you're the floor manager of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, I was not, Senator Tillman.  I'm not clear as
to who that member is right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well anyway, you've offered the amendment, and a
follow-up question is that I suppose you've covered this amendment with
the Asheville folks, since Asheville people are here today in
representatives...</p>

...just wondered, before I know what to do with this amendment, if
there's an agreement that this is a good amendment? Can somebody please
clear that up for me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if I can clear this up for Senator Tillman, and
speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr President. Members, I was going to speak
on the bill, but didn't have a chance before Senator Davis jumped up.
I'm going to ask you to vote against this amendment, and we'll talk more
on the bill here in a moment. When we get to that I'll be happy to
explain it. But the bottom line is, when ETJ was put in, Buncombe County
did not zone. Buncombe County now has zoning, so ETJ is really, in my
opinion, not necessary. I don't think the city has any business zoning
in the county. So with that being said, now the members are keeping the
same structure on the Board and it's for a period of 12 years. They'll
leave two appointments from the County. The Board itself, Board of
Adjustment has 11 members, Planning Board has seven. So it is the
minority on both Boards and I ask for you to vote against this
amendment, and then I'll explain the Bill at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? Senator Nesbitt, for
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr President, to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr President, and I thank Senator Davis for
recognizing the problem in this bill. I had labored over whether to
offer and amendment or just vote against it; it's a good excuse to vote
against it. Read this bill closely, because one will be coming your way
shortly. And to be honest with you, if you're going to do away with any
growth of any city, it kind of makes sense that they don't have any
business looking across their border at their neighbors. But this part
about the County continuing to appoint people to the Planning Zoning
Board and the Board of Adjustment of the city, when the city has
absolutely no jurisdiction outside their boundaries, is nothing but
meanness. There's a persecution of the City of Asheville going on by the
Republican members of the House and the Senate. An airport was taken,
our water system's going to be taken, this bill comes along? Fine. But
to continue to have the county appoint people outside the city to the
city's boards is nothing but just pure, unadulterated meanness. And at
some point, this has got to stop. Nobody sent us down here to destroy
anybody, or to persecute anybody. At some point, there's got to be some
good government around here, because that's what we're supposed to be
doing. And nobody's made the case – Moffitt was asked in the Committee
why he did it, and he didn't have a good reason. He just said he thought
it'd be good for the city if they had some county representation on the
Boards. Well, how about if the city appoints some people to the county
Boards? Want to do that? Of course not. And you need to vote for this
amendment and clean this bill up, and then you'll be doing something
that makes some sense in line with the prohibition on annexation.
Although there may be voluntary annexation in the future, and some
planning outside might be worthwhile, if you don't want any out there,
that's fine. But you need to vote for this amendment and get this mess
out of here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just have a question for the proponent of the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis. The proponent, Senator Davis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis, I'm trying to understand this a little
bit, and it's a little confusing to me. I look in the bill, and Section
Two of the bill must be the part that says Buncombe County can continue
to appoint members to the City Board. Is that the section?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, that is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And what your amendment does is say, they can continue
to appoint members who will serve, so long as the 120 day transition
period lasts. Is that what you are...?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. In this one addition, it says if they
would like to continue serving, which the current bill allows, that then
it shifts from the county to the city to basically acknowledge that
appointment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask a follow-up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So in Section One of the bill, they talk about of, is
it a hundred [RECORDING ENDS]</p>

...in 20 days that the county has to adopt regulations and at the end of
that period it just shift the ETJs even if they don’t. Is that the
period your amendment is addressing? Plus the who makes the appointment
issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, what happens under this bill, the community has this
time period to 120 days to effectively shift the planning from the city
to the county to eliminate the ETJ. What the amendment says is the
county would continue to make appointments during that period. However,
after that period, the city may, which is not a mandate because the way
it stands right now, it would be actually mandatory, statutorily, for
the county, after the ETJ is eliminated, to continue making
appointments.

Senator Apodaca is recognized to further explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members, and I think Senator Nesbitt will join
with me on this. I want to ask for your forgiveness for the next week,
because you’re probably going to hear more about Ashful and Henderson
county than you’ve ever wanted to know. Although, it is the two finest
places in North Carolina to live without a doubt, but we do have our
battles, I think they go back quite a few years. You’re going to hear
about so and so taking this from so and so. A lot of that is true and
the taking started 10 or 15 years ago. It didn’t start here, now. We’re
going to go have a history as we go forward, but this is just the
beginning, as Senator Nesbitt alluded to, and I ask for your support on
this bill because, basically, Buncombe zone’s now, ETJs worthless, and I
do agree something Senator Nesbitt said, I think ETJ should be gotten
rid of in the whole state and I hope we can get to that. I think that’s
where we need to go. That being said, I ask for your support on this
bill, thank you.

before…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, you have the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The thing that gives me the most concern about this bill is this last
point that was referenced, and that’s the fact that there’s a trend to
do away with the extra territorial zoning ?? they control cities and
towns in this state. I think most of you that have served in local
government, if you’ve been a city council member, town council member,
if you’ve been a mayor, you understand that your areas of concern exceed
those areas that are completely defined by your existing borders. It’s
logical and reasonable and that town and community has a vested interest
in what takes place within its immediately adjoining periphery. In doing
so, to have some control over the zoning within those areas is a good
thing to do. It’s healthy for our cities and towns and cities throughout
this state, regardless of what size you are, it’s the only thing that
takes place when there’s extraterritorial jurisdiction that’s provided
for. And likewise, allows for a reasonable transition or buffer between,
perhaps, a rural area and a more urban area. For that reason, even
though this is a local bill and most of the time there’s a local bill
and there’s consent among the delegation, I support it. I do not see
consent on this bill in terms of a unanimity of opinion. Not only that,
I think it’s a bad policy direction for us to move in as a state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you, mister president.
Prescription drug abuse is the fastest growing cause of teen death. On a
national level, unintentional prescription drug abuse is overtaking
motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of injury and death for all
ages. This proposal is designed to curb the problem by making a variety
of changes to the controlled substances reporting system to improve its
use.
Reporting time has been reduced from seven days to a maximum of three
days. This bill reflects the input of the North Carolina medical board,
the child fatality task force, the college of emergency physicians,
community care of North Carolina, the controlled substance reporting
system itself, the injury and violence prevention branch, at DPH, the
North Carolina medical society, project Lazarus, the state bureau of
investigation, the pharmacists, the retail merchants, and the dental
society.

let them know how I feel about it.  Thank you.

Mr. President. Ladies and gentleman of the Senate. I got a chance to go
downstairs during lunch, if you call what we had for lunch lunch, the
time we get but, and took five minutes out to do the driving and
testing, texting. Needless to say, you don't wanna even need to have a
cell phone in my vehicle while I'm going down the road. Let's see, I hit
two pedestrians, three cars and I think I only won a [quarter?] of them
out. So and, had to do a text. But they were telling me down there, and
I commend the young folks too in Johnston county because they were one
of the few schools, there are several schools in Johnston county that
got chosen by AT&amp;T to do this pile-up project, project so I commend
them as well. But I was learning that it's not only a teen problem. But
it's become an adult problem to parents texting while driving. This is a
very serious concern to everyone, and I commend them for what they're
doing. And I think we need to commend ourselves to keep our cell phones
in our pockets when we're on the road. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator. Any further notices or
announcements? Is there any other business to come before the Senate? If
not, the chair recognizes Senator Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, I move that the Senate be now
adjourned, subject to the receipt of messages from the House and the
governor, to reconvene on Wednesday, April 17, 2013 at 2:00 PM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion is the Senate do now adjourn, subject to
the stipulations stated by Senator Berger, to reconvene Wednesday, April
17, at 2:00 PM, seconded by Senator Apodaca. All in favor say aye,
