come to order. The gentleman is attempting to explain the bill. The
gentleman has the floor to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker, I think I can sum it up fairly quickly. When House Bill 1181
left this chamber, it left with a united vote. It was a united vote in
the Appropriations Committee and it was a united vote on the floor of
this House, and Mr. Speaker, with all due humility, it was a united vote
among stakeholders, patients, advocates all across this state, to move
forward and make the changes that are necessary to achieve the goals
that this state needs to achieve in its Medicaid program, which are very
serious and that we’ve taken very seriously. Mr. Speaker, that bill has
been changed I would say dramatically. Obviously it is not in any
position with which the values of this chamber would be in concurrence,
and so I would ask – be happy to answer any questions – and I would ask
you to vote green. Vote green not to concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Bladen, Representative Brisson rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman has the floor to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies
and gentlemen, Representative Dollar is absolutely right. We sent it
over there with 100% support; we need to send it back with 100% support.
Appreciate your support for this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the House is
Representative Dollar’s motion not to concur to the Senate Committee
Substitute to House Bill 1181. So many favoring the motion not to concur
will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. The Clerk will open the vote.
The Clerk will lock the machine and records the vote. 106 having voted
in the affirmative and none in the negative, the motion to concur is
adopted. Strike that. The motion not to concur is adopted. The Senate
will be so notified. House bill 1194. The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill 1194, a bill to be
entitled ‘An Act to Make Changes to the Administration of the State
Retirement Systems’. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Nash, Representative Collins rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
make a motion and then debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m going to
make a motion that we concur with the Senate on this bill. If you
remember, this is a bill that we had, one of three retirement system
bills we passed out of this House just a few weeks ago. We passed it
unanimously. Senate made a few changes and then passed their version
unanimously. There are four changes. Two of them are technical changes
to get wording lined up. The third change is a change in date to back up
the effective date from July 1st to September 1st, I guess because of
today’s date, and the fourth change, the only one that’s really
substantive, is originally the QEBA, the Q-E-B-A, which is excess
benefit arrangement that only affects people who are so highly paid that
they more than top out on the 401k plan and so forth, that plan was
originally set to expire next year in 2015. This original bill would
have extended it to 2017. They took that paragraph out, so we’re just
going back to what would have been the normal expiration in 2015. That’s
the only substantive change in the bill. I have no issue with that and
would ask that we concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate? If not, the question before the House is Representative Collin’s
motion to concur with the Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill
1194. So many favoring the motion will vote aye. Those opposed will vote
no. The Clerk will open the vote. Representative Hall, does the
gentleman wish to record on this vote? Representative Lucas?
Representative Brandon’s… The Clerk will lock the machine and record the
vote. 106 having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative, the
motion to concur is adopted. The bill is ordered enrolled and sent to
the Governor. Senate Bill 883. The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Committee substitute for Senate Bill 883, a bill to be entitled

and Maintenance of Riparian Buffers Rule Adopted by the Environmental
Management Commission, Direct the Environmental Management Commission to

Carolina
Change speaker: members of the chair neglected to raise our nurse of the
day is saved in a vacuum chamber Susan Robertson is nervous right place
for me is that him and him and
what was that the gentleman tender presented that was rise as the
gluteal newsreader.
Change speaker: the gentleman has limited availability of the
Change speaker: Mister Speaker, members of the house. not today. before
you is a suitability three sponsored by Senator Brock. this is a request
by the Department and Department meetings either. this is how the
process in terms of our rule making where there was rules were put in
place of Bobby ENC. there were stimulators of injection and losing
letters of objection that you're actually formed the stakeholder group,
a tax receipt of what may be the problem with VMC put forth. they came
out with us some instances, revisions, and while this is a disapproval
bill. this is a disapproval bill that I see takes a good of the actual
rules were promulgated by the ENC NIC Verizon the bathroom a temporary
standpoint, but allows the NCD come back and actually put in place.
these rules are proposed out one thing I want to note is that this
doesn't have anything to do whatsoever with the actual regulations
associated with other consolidation are shipping associated with stream
mitigation. I once asked to do with the actual achieving the actual
regulation by way of mitigating Austrians by way of riparian buffers and
things of that nature is also highly technical last part of the building
has to do with bringing on innovation in suitable wastewater strategies
are over some time. there's been some aspects of our statues maybe
little archaic behind in terms of what the current debate as always,
water, salt, the statute does bring innovation back into the picture.
this figure three. three. Donna more than happy to answer any questions.
members may have
Change speaker: walked Travis Leslie Jonathan White. furthermore, Darius
is examined, has afforded away the veil.
Change speaker: thank you very much disfigurement is a small background
as the concerns are wetlands mitigation, which in the past and the
vehicle by which our state has sought to balance the needs to develop
our state to build, create jobs and move forward while the same time
preserving our water quality, and many others also contribute to move in
our straightforward, I think I would agree that there's an inherent
tensions there is a process that we've had in place has been perfect,
but it's one that's work, which means if you're not, and this is a
simplified version, but if you can deliver some wetlands, there's a
process by which we could mitigate that damage by creating or
maintaining preserving wetlands elsewhere in the state of Nevada process
by which the private sector can actually financially benefit from doing
that and create jobs to do it again. I don't think anyone on any side of
the issue would say that's an appropriate process is one that, in
general, has worked with some freshly happen here, though, that there's
has been a behind-the-scenes quick process to absolutely rewrite those
rules and it's been essentially the bid by the proverbial smoke-filled
rooms. the Jennifer Weiner mentioned that ten letters of objections were
received all several those who received from active folks that work in
the inner as opposed granted in their private capacity as opposed to
just general citizens, so it's something that, in general, the public
has not been aware of in a way, regardless of the present cons of the
direction that this may be taken us this will be another step in eroding
public confidence in what state government does in the him them him and
him is to be more customer friendly. the public is very concerned about
exactly who he means is customer well in the end, it looks like he means
the private sector out there when the end is all citizens of North
Carolina. now all citizens of North Carolina as customers benefit
regulatory gene that creates and preserve jobs for them. without a
doubt, but in the end we need to recognize the day the citizens of North
Carolina. our constituents are the customers and in this video is
absolutely against the interests of our customers</p>

For what purpose does the gentleman from Henderson Representative
McGrady rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
to initially ask the gentleman from Pender a question
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
does the gentleman from Pender yield to the gentleman from Henderson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes sir he yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
as I understand the bill it requires that the EMC adopt a role
significantly identical to the recommended role contained in a
shareholder a stakeholder report. My question to you is were all parties
of interests to this matter members of the stakeholder group?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative McGrady in terms of the stakeholder group that was formed
the stakeholder group that was formed was actually looking at the way to
achieve the actual the mitigation credits therefore in terms of the
actual private side by way of land holders by way of the DOT stand point
from the public stand point of actually having to mitigate for these
credits as well as the environmental consultants that actually have to
achieve the mitigation aspects from a technical stand point and receive
regulatory approval from Deener so in my view it was a full fledged full
circle stake holder group that's actually achieved the technical stand
points of the mitigation achievement were not talking about the
regulatory stand point were only talking about how to actually achieve
the mitigation credits within stream mitigation. It's been said here
that's its wetlands it is not its about the actual mitigation of our
streams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
does the gentleman from Pender yield to an additional question from the
gentleman from Henderson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
yes I do
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
he yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
perhaps I wasn't clear enough the question I have is were there groups
particularly groups that had been involved in the EMC process for
example environmental organizations and other groups not involved in the
stake holder group that were now requiring the EMC to adopt its report
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative McGrady Deener was a sitting member of the stake holder
group they are the body what actually oversees the regulations that are
put forth and therefore it's my understanding that you had all aspects
represented but if you want to name specific groups I'll be happy to
comment the report is out there and it's well known to the public the
actual stakeholder group that met for over 4 to 5 months to actually
take out the bad that was in these rules and actually achieve the good
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
to speak on the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
the gentleman from Henderson has the floor to debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I think I respect the gentleman from Pender but he obviously doesn't
want to answer my question cause he knows the answer to the question the
answer is no we had one group of people groups of people come together
and work with the EMC to come up with its rule the department didn't
like its rule there are economic interests that didn't like the rule so
what does Deener do? He goes back and pulls together a stake holder
group to come up with a different rule surprise surprise that it
happened this is another example of our process just not being followed
and I dont have any dog in this race I don't actually really have much
of an opinion on the underlying issues here but this is not how we ought
to be doing this the department doesn't get the answer that it wants so
it pulls together a new stake holder group now we get the answer the
department wants and gee were going to mandate that the new stake holder
group involving essentially all of the people that have a financial
interest in this are going to get what they want. I say no just vote no
on this bill it's a bad bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
for what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland Representative
Glazier rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr Speaker to speak to the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
gentleman has the floor to debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you very much Mr Speaker my comments are going to be in the same
vein but in a little different way than the previous two.  You know
about three weeks ago there was a bill in the judiciary committee run by
Representative Jordan and Representative Jordan courageously ran that
bill as I said at the time dealing with issues of workers compensation
and there was a group of people who opposed that bill as I recall home
builders and realtors and a number of business groups</p>

<p id="20:00">
and their argument which i agreed with despite my view that I thought
Representative Jordan was right on the substance was look there has been
for years a stake holders process that has been set out to deal with
workers comp issues and we've done Republicans and Democrats a really
good job of using that group because of the stakes that are involved in
it the idea that group came together and said when we do revisions to
workers comp we will do something for the plaintiffs side and something
for the defense side but we've got to work together less we get into
this huge pitched battle and we've avoided that and they said can you
please withdraw the bill which is essentially what Representative Jordan
than did so that we may get to where you want but so that the stake
holders the full stake holders group can actually meet to do that and a
number of us who as I said I think agreed with the policy Representative
Jordan wanted to do said you know that's process matters it really does
and you guys are working together we should affirm that kind of behavior
and so Representative Jordan at the request of a number of people and on
his own pulled his own Bill because of this exact issue and he was right
and he was setting out the right way to do this and that hopefully will
result in an eve better bill next year its exactly whats going on here
and what Representative McGrady and what Representative Martin talked
about a closed door meeting between the agency and several of its
self-selected industry representatives without participation by anyone
else is not a stake holders meeting it's a cabal and that's what took
place here we should stop calling it and giving it the nice title that
it was a stake holders meeting cause it wasn't it was a very selected
group the full stakeholders meeting had been in place for 5 years 5
years prior to that and came up with the rules that probably nobody
loved but everyone could live with in 2013 and because its a select
small group in combination with some people in the departments that we
don't like the result just as Representative McGrady said they meet
without everybody else and come up now with new rule that's wrong we may
end up in the same place and I'm not at all sure I understand fully the
science of whether this is a bad or a good environmental effect but I am
real clear that it is a horrible way to do business and we ought to stop
it we ought to follow the lead that Representative Jordan and the
judiciary committee did we ought to follow the lead of the five year
process bring everyone back together and if these same things result
great we can have the debate on whether their good or bad but we ought
not be doing this and particularly this late in the session and I would
encourage us on the matter of just trying to modify how we do business
here to make it the right way to encourage people to meet and work out
their problems and not in secret that we ought to vote no thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
for what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston Representative
Bumgardner rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
speak on the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
the gentleman has the floor to debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you Mr Speaker I was in the committee Friday late we debated this
bill no one voted against it in the committee automatically anytime
anybody has an economic interest in anything its bad and we cant have
that we cant allow that and I think that we need to think about that and
I would ask you to support this bill this bill modernizes something that
needs to be modernized the spokespeople from Deener were there they
explained what this is about and why they wanted to do it and I'd ask
for your support thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
what purpose does the lady from Surry Representative Stevens rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
to ask question of the bill sponsor
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
does the gentleman from Pender yield to the lady from Surry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I do Mr Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
he yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Millis I was also at the meeting on Friday afternoon late
when I didn't really want to be but the original rules that were being
objected to here were defined as being very unclear and really unable to
work with is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
that is exactly correct Representative Stevens as a matter of fact if
you go line by line through the actual modifications that the steak
holders made to what was actually proposed by the EMC there are mainly
clarifications to make sure that it can be implemented properly and
again remember now this is done by the department at request by the
department so they actually have to carry out what the statutes the
rules all are in terms of their policy</p>

do you serve your clarification. the vagueness of this was really one of
the ego enhancement program. there was a state agency was there to speak
on as well as I fear as a whole was there back to make sure that the
actual rules. I want to put in place were just clarified to make sure
that nothing vague about any other aspects of it. there is nothing I was
altered by way of regulation is this the way I see achievement of the
bombings of this intercourse more never got to follow.
Change speaker:you may have, that the lighting is the gentleman yield an
additional question is
Change speaker:Mister steels and leave the
Change speaker:information provided here was that this was all based on
the scientific research to make it clear about what we can and cannot do
it. it is
Change speaker:derived as a reason why be single or group was highly
technical in nature because actually viewed bio engineers as well as the
actual consultants involved in vaccine making sure that we can achieve
all of the regulations were so yes, again is I who which he said is
exactly right. this is highly technical nature and honest reason why was
brought forth like also listen to answer your question is that you have
similar subjects in this chamber can fully disprove what EMC did three
years ago and we have no good to know what was actually going down this
whole process of the chamber wants this review our rules out in a
surprise, but this is actually good. it's a figure that was actually
done it just provides some clarifications and things that were
misunderstandings. the dicey provide some a uncertainty about how she
had achieved what the NCIC promulgated. so while these objections of an
razor is truly false in nature.
Change speaker:the last all the
Change speaker:general field of our question is certain fields
Change speaker:and had anyone group person come to you about the
substance of the rules being bad or is it simply the process that they
felt like they were included and
Change speaker: no one company out whatsoever. now the amount rules
process as a matter fact, this process is something that I is and is
nothing new is nothing changes. as a matter fact on this is actually
chamber has unanimously and actually the same aspects of process allowed
Diener, all regulatory agencies establish the stakeholder group for
storm water so you will never sleep good the same as acting directly.
doing here is where having regular meetings. he doesn't charged the form
stakeholder groups. what would all enter Sarah is able to make sure that
were actually crafting proper policy again. remember you have statutes,
regulations, statutes give way to rules and roles give way to policy and
policy is what the departments actually carry out the state voted route
was to clarify the policy to make sure that it met the intent of the
General assembly in the lobby things were actually false. what was said
and I'll be happy for my son 's legal bill your later on with a few
questions for August as the lady from the effort represent Harrison,
Russ. did they know lady has afforded me the bill.
Change speaker: thank you, Mister stipulations on the cat on seeking
articulate off all process and adoption of these roles. I know my
colleagues represent the grading and is your end. more than half of the
sizes of the roles are problematic in office will understand the rules
and even… yes, I'm not sure how they are confusing in terms of
implementation, he's on it. I'm not sure that in general, similar to the
process of rewriting technical roles. I think that would make a lot more
sense for us to redirect via agency to conduct in whatever process
involving all stakeholder son the analysis is that it does a couple
things are problematic, at least the annual report that the medication
is working on there and so we don't even know initially what happened
after the product has been placed on Sarah eliminates the traditional on
the evening of the traditional mitigation reported that the judicial

question I do have is the rows of information through the sun July 18

statutory authority for regulation but often determine if there's any

rules to what’s actually in this stakeholder report, so I’m really
confused about how you’re saying that we went from a 3 to 1 to a 2 to 1
whenever by my study over the entire interim we were here last week,
that that is not the case whatsoever, and could you please clarify for
the body? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I just heard that that was what it was.
I think it’s gone from 3 to 2 in this provision. Am I not correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from
Haywood yield to an additional question from the gentleman from Pender?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My
question is is that would you consider that you may not be correct?
Because that is not the case. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s always… I’ll
certainly consider that I’m not correct if that’s not the case. Is it
not the case? Is it 3 to 2? I mean has it gone from 3 to 1 to 2 to 1 or
not? I’m asking somebody. I’m not on this committee, but… [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The member will suspend. Does the gentleman from Pender yield
to a question from the gentleman from Haywood? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman
require the member to restate his question? Or did he hear it? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I heard it, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has
the floor to answer the question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In all due respect,
Representative Queen, it does not change whatsoever from the actual
proposed stakeholder provisions to what was actually drafted by the EMC,
and in terms of the mitigation ratios, they stay exactly the same. The
only changes whatsoever is that taking it embedded within a statute and
actually breaking it out into tables so it’s actually very easy to
follow and read for those who actually have to comply with the
regulations. So no, that is not the case. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well thank
you for your clarification. To continue then? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor to continue debating the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I will say this. If we were, that would be a backwards step, but I
will say the point is that 80% of the pollution that have thwarted our
trout streams have been stream bank erosion. That is the biggest single
problem, so protecting the stream banks in the balance is what we have
gotten right in western North Carolina over the last couple of decades,
and we do not want to go backwards. So you’ve heard concerns about who
these stakeholders were. I have real concerns that we haven’t taken
these important considerations into account and I plan to vote against
this. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman
from Henderson, Representative McGrady rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on
the bill a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor
too debate the bill a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want to
clarify one or two things. Responding to the gentleman from Gaston, Mr.
Bumgardner, I have no problem whatsoever with having people involved in
understanding the costs and business and all of that. They have to be
part of this. My problem here is that they were a significantly larger
part, and we needed people that had perhaps a broader public interest.
Putting that aside, I would say to the body that part of my problem here
is just with the optics of things. The optics here is that this involves
the Department of Natural Resources, whose Secretary was in the business
of what the subject of this thing is. If there’s a time and a place for
us to be particularly aboveboard, it’s in matters like this. Why go down
this road? This rule, I’m not going to speak to it on substance – it
didn’t come through a committee that I was on – but it doesn’t feel
right at all, and I don’t see any problem with let’s pull together an
appropriate stakeholder group and let’s do this right as opposed to
potentially embarrassing ourselves by moving forward at this time. I
urge no vote on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Wake, Representative Martin rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak a second time on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the
floor to debate the bill a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Let me elaborate on the composition of the stakeholder group
that the gentleman from Henderson talked about. It’s my understanding
that there were seven members of it. Three of them were drawn from
companies who do this sort of work, with a financial interest but also
wit the expertise to talk about this kind of work; one was drawn from a
mining company; two were appointed by the Secretary of DENR from within
DENR I believe; and then one from DOT. And having chaired our
