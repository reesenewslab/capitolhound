  I’d like to have better participation, but we’d better get started.
We’re five minutes over time already. I’d like to introduce our
Sergeants-at-Arms and our pages. From the House we have Sergeant-at-Arms
Carlton Adams, ?? Addison and ?? Austin, and from the Senate, Steve
McCabe and ?? Jefferies. We have pages: ?? Jones from the city of
Enfield; Senator Angela Bryant. And we have a House page, Lauren
Tribbet… in the back, Brian Kennedy; Representative Will Brisson. And we
have one item on the agenda today, and we’re going to get started right
away. I hope we get a few more members present in just a few minutes. We
have Chief Deputy Secretary Nick Tennyson for DOT overview. This is one
of our ice and snow days presentations that we skipped, and we can make
it up today. Mr. Tennyson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
am Nick Tennyson, the Chief Deputy Secretary of NC DOT. I appreciate the
opportunity to speak, and we have got a previously scheduled
presentation that I am stepping in to fill. We have some ongoing
analysis that I think is going to be worth the time to complete it, as
opposed to bringing it to you partially, and so we appreciate the
opportunity to go ahead and have this presentation today. The order of
this of course is sort of as an overview, and so you’ve already embarked
on some of the detail, but I think there’s value to going back through
and looking at the broad sweep of the department’s responsibilities and
letting you make comments on what you see, and I understand the rule of
the committee is that any slide, any paragraph is fair game for
questions, and so I’ll just… I suppose I’ll pause if I happen to see one
that pops up. So the overview of the presentation, you can see talking
about major functions of the DOT, including touching on the Board of
Transportation, overview of the highway system, talking about the
road-building process, operations and maintenance, and then some
intermodal aspects of the department, which for this presentations
purpose includes the DMV. The NC DOT employs about 12 thousand people.
We have positions from the most basic aspect of maintaining the
highways, all the way up through ferry captains, and I would add
airplane pilots to that. It’s led by the Secretary of Transportation,
who’s a member of the Governor’s cabinet and oversees all aspects of
transportation in the state, which is an organizational structure that
isn’t universal in the country, but there are others who share our
breadth of involvement. Representative Torbett. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Nick. I wanted to just jump down… archaeologists? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you give me… what’s…? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have historic preservation requirements for historic properties to
make sure that we’re delineating properly and making sure that we are
responsible in our work on the state’s infrastructure, and so from time
to time it will require somebody who’s qualified in that capacity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you so much. I’d never heard about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There’ll be no additional charge for that. So in any
case… and I’m not a slide-reader, so I’m trying to avoid putting you
through that, but if I go to fast, please stop me. So the Board of
Transportation works with staff, is the policy-making body, and sets or
makes decisions about transportation priorities and funding allocations
within obviously the constraints of those funds furnished by the General
Assembly. 19 members, all appointed by the Governor, allocated 1 to a
division, and so you’ve heard about the 14 highway divisions, but then
there are 5 at large areas of focus that are represented to make up the
total of 19. At least
  </p>

  <p id="05:00">
  Members of the board must be registered in a different party than the
Governor. No more than two may be in the same highway divisions, so that
we don’t get a concentration, or an over concentration in any one
division, and the Governor submits proposed appointees for review for a
30 day period or a minimum of a 30 day period before their appointment.
So the highway system, as you’ve heard many, many times, 80,000 miles is
the way I shorthand it, obviously for maybe my ego’s purpose, but the
interstate makes up 1,300 miles of that, primary routes, 5,500 miles.
North Carolina routes 8,000 in the secondary system, the, the roads
that, that at least largely would be under county administration and a
lot of states 60,000 miles of that system. And then along that system,
again, as you’ve heard, 18,000 bridges, culverts, and pipes. It’s about
13,000 bridges isn’t it? I’m looking out for, 13, is that the right
number? 13,000 bridges? What I’m gonna be talking about is for the most
part related to the two portion of this slide that you’ve seen in the
past, although there will be, obviously, some parts at the bottom too
that we also touch on. So project development and, and this is a term of
ours that I suppose you need to pause to think about a little bit,
purpose and need of a project. So you have to identify the purpose and
need before you go to, to build the project, and that is used to analyze
the possible alternatives to that project. And always on the table is
the no build alternative, but as we look at various projects that may be
competing for, for the construction funding, we have to be aware of the
purpose and need, and let’s just say thinking about an improvement of a
route through our community versus a loop. They could both be for the
same purpose and need of moving traffic from one side of the town to
another. There may be an additional purpose that is served by the loop
road or by the one through the town that couldn’t be served by the other
kind of facilities, so again, identifying purpose and need is an
important step and comes back later in the process. Route alternatives
are evaluated to try to minimize the impact. The selection of a
preferred alternative is a step, and then the completion of the
environmental planning documents, which are either state level or what’s
called NEPA, national level. And then determining the construction
limits, and this is, this is a step that, that results in being able to
understand exactly what property is gonna be needed, what, what the
right of way limits will have to be is, is to determine what you need to
do on the construction. Using these, these current systems, we have got
extraordinarily long preconstruction times. This is a focus of, of work
that we’re doing to try to shorten those times, including evaluating
more carefully which of the projects go through national funding
through, which things are funded using federal money, which things are
funded using state money. And we think there’ll be some benefit from
that, but just to give you the general sense of if you’ve got a great
idea, this is the kind of lead time before that great idea moves into
the contract letting phase.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ford had a question I think, mister chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Can you touch just briefly on the project
delivery times on major 8 to 10, lining 5 to 8 and why the date, those
times, at least to me seems to be somewhat expanded.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that a lot of this has to do with setting time horizons that
recognize that some of the approval authorities, some of the review
authorities have got multiple jurisdictions that they’re trying to
serve, and so you’re not necessarily getting everybody’s attention right
when you’re done. So the, the step of moving through delineation of what
the wetlands are will take time, will take site visits, will take all
those kinds of, of activities, and then the question of when the
authority that’s gonna review those, the core engineers in this case, is
able to be responsive sometimes adds, adds time. It, it is just the, I
say, I say the reality of some of this has to do with which process we
choose to use, and we are going back and, and

  Asking harder questions about how many of the things that we take
through what&#39;s called the merger process and try to do with more
focused planning documentation and I think that that&#39;ll yield some
benefit, but right now as you add steps to make sure that you&#39;re
fully disclosing and fully reviewing and fully evaluating the effect of
the project and then you put the buffer in to make sure that it can be
accomplished in sequence that that&#39;s where it goes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In
the, for years I’ve heard about the possibility of parallel efforts or
efforts running simultaneously to reduce the qualifying time and the
paperwork, so to speak, that kind of thing. Have we taken any steps or
do you see steps that we could gift DOT with and something [??] collapse
that time to be more expeditious, I guess, or [??]? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
don’t want to identify any particular current issue, but an example of
where we have done something that subsequently caused us additional
review is the 485 project south of Charlotte where we identified that we
could build an extra lane of pavement in advance of having to move
forward to the next project and get it done under the current
documentation and save money, and at the end of that process the
question of whether or not that lane should be opened up or would be
opened up has become somewhat a matter of contention and at least from
my perspective that is reflective of the risk of doing things that are
not fully in sequence. So all of that is to say, and I apologize for the
long answer, that when we make a decisions to do things in parallel, we
run the risk of one of those parallel tracks blowing up on us and
perhaps invalidating the project or making it not possible to build and
then all that money spent on that other parallel track goes out the
window, and so I think that part of this question of 8-10 years is that
it’s a pretty risk-averse schedule. It is a schedule based upon not
wanting to have to explain to you and everybody else why the planning
that we put into this alternative is no longer useful and no longer
valuable. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Additional question? Representative
Bumgardner? [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have a
question and that you mentioned 485 south of Charlotte. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That was a real mistake and I apologize. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Tell
us about the resolution of the issue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The resolution
of the issue is that the 485 has been identified by the local planning
area, the metropolitan planning organization for that area is being, to
be eventually put into services as a managed or express lane, in this
case I think an express lane, and to preserve the possibility of that,
that limits the ways that we can treat that lane. In other words, we
can’t open it up as just a general purpose lane and then put it into
service as an express lane later. So the issue is back before the
metropolitan planning organization in the Charlotte area. they’re to
take a vote next month, well, no, actually this month on what their
preference is. From comments that I have heard, I would expect them to
be looking to try to put it in services as some sort of HOV lane, which
would preserve the opportunity later to have it used as they originally
intended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So what you’re saying is there is no resolution yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There is no resolution yet, but they’re, and there is
no resolution yet and we wouldn’t really be able to do a resolution of
the actual putting it in service until April anyway and then August is a
deadline when we have documentation that would allow us to open it up,
so we can’t act until August at least, and the resolution is on its way
through the various processes that have to be followed to do anything
different. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Additional follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Explain to me how the MPO had this project
on their STIP and how we got to the point where we are, we have a lane
that no one’s using. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The process that was followed was
to have a project that was a segment of an overall project between

  74 and 77 roughly is the outer limits of it. The middle segment which is
that portion which has this, what’s been described extra lane, was being
built and it was identified as a possibility of going ahead and doing
work in the shoulder, I’m sorry in the median area, that ultimately
would be part of this express lane project. And by doing so, we could
save something on the order of 12 to 15 million dollars in terms of
expected cost of remobilizing and just finishing the project and
starting over. Additionally, the project that was being done between 77
and Ray Road, I believe is one of the termini, was originally scheduled
not to be completed until December of 2016. In the process of developing
it, getting it done as a design build project, it was a design build
project, yes. The contractor managed to achieve time savings such that
we finished the project two years early. So the quote extra lane wasn’t
expected to be out there as an issue until 2016 at which time the next
adjacent project is scheduled and at least in the draft ?? the adjacent
project is scheduled to start during FY 2017. So that’s how we ended up
with the additional pavement, apparently abused and not used. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up one more time. I understand how it’s easier, or it’s
marginally harder to get mobilized and to add two lanes, if it costs X
number of dollars to add a lane to an interstate. To add two lanes, if
you have the room and all of the things being equal while you’re there
and mobilized and working, it’s only, it only might be another 10 or 20%
to add a whole nother lane. I understand that, but I’m trying to
understand how this project came about. We built the lane. I don’t
understand what if any input that local MPO had and now we have a lane
that’s no one is using and we don’t have a decision yet and we’re trying
to figure out what to do next. We have a lane and what are we going to
do with it? And some people want to toll it, of course. And some people
want to make it an HOV, of course. And some people just want to be able
to drive to get from point A to B. That’s what I’m trying to get
straight. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d be glad to talk to you additionally, at
a different time, and bring along folks that would be, that had been
present at the original decisions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like a briefing
on that particular project, would be good. ?? DOT at some point. And
just as a reminder, please use your red and green buttons. A thing to
remember. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So, moving on from that slide. The first
phase after we’ve decided we know we’re going to build it, is to survey
and design the highway. You have to go out and confirm with the ?? list,
to know what features you need to take into account for the design, what
the bridges are going to need to handle, those issues. This slide I
think just highlights the fact that there are a number of things that
aren’t on the road surface that have to be taken into account. Utilities
frequently end up being an issue for us, relocation of utilities or
making sure we can provide them. Issues related to drainage and
retaining walls are all questions that have to be determined and plans
made. We’re looking for a cost-efficient design, to meet schedule and
budget, and obviously minimizing the impacts to environment, homes and
businesses. Then we move to the contract award stage. The contract
information is prepared, we advertising project lettings. The lettings
to which I’m referring now are those conducted centrally, which we do on
a monthly basis. We advertise projects on a monthly basis. Projects
handled at the division level could be advertised at other times.
They’re on a different frequency. Bids are submitted by contractors, as
you see, and then reviewed. The note at the bottom, we are in a position
of accepting the lowest bidder that meets all the requirements. One of
the things to note is that contractors can lose the right to be bidders.

  <p id="20:00">
  For various issues that can arise in terms of their execution of
projects that they’ve got underway or other kinds of matters that can
move them off that list, so we do review those who are eligible to bid.
Only those eligible to bid can submit those then and it moves through
the process, and then again to sort of give you the laundry list of all
the things that are involved in the construction work starting out with
the surveying and then making sure that we’re, we got the construction
area prepared and preserved and then moving through the construction
finally ultimately digging through the marking signs and signals is the
last phase, so. Our construction section provides a part for the
contract administration. We’ve got about 600 highway, active
highway-related projects right now, all sorts of areas of projects that
we have under consideration or are actually actively involve, but the
innovation flexibility, I would say that the design build process about
which you’ll hear more if you haven’t heard plenty already is one of the
things that’s been very helpful in terms of delivering some innovation
externally in the department although I think our folks try to do their
best to be as innovative and flexible as they can be on projects as
well. So we talked about the preconstruction time, the new construction
or the actual construction for projects varies based on the type of
project and where it is and how we’re confronted with issues related to
the actual construction, then moving to field operations the highway or
the field operations are under the direction of the Chief Engineer, Mike
Holder. There are 14 divisions and you’ve seen and the divisions were
put in this configuration. Okay, now is it 20 years ago, 30 years ago,
we have been through several iterations of how many divisions there are
but we are now at 14. With construction, supervision of the construction
and monitoring of progress and specifications, operations traffic
management and maintenance. Obviously, our recent experience makes those
snow plow the logical illustration for this. We do primary and secondary
maintenance, again, that’s referring to the road systems that were
described earlier with the interstate and then the primary routes, the
about 7,000 miles and then the secondary being referred to here. We are
doing substantial contracting with people to maintain some of this,
mowing and other things, issues related to contracting and snow and ice
removal, the range of contractors available has declined over time and
we find that it’s harder to find people that are willing to submit to be
part of our snow and ice removal on a contracting basis. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
don’t know if you can specifically speak to this or if you can direct
me, is it a true statement that one of the divisions or some divisions
have snow and ice contracts and the contractors get paid whether snow
and ice events happen? Do we have contracts with contractors that get
paid irregardless of whether we have snow and ice events? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We do, and may I recognize Mr. Holder for any more detailed
answer to that or do you want to? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can get with Mr.
Holder, I just wanted to know if that’s a true statement. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Let me just say that one of the things about this reminds me of
my days in the fleet. When I was in the navy the ship on which I served
had 300 or so folks on board. If all we were required to do is stay in
that ship, we’d have had 20 and so in a sense the other 280 were being
paid just to be there whether or not we ever fought anybody. So the snow
and ice issue, one of the alternatives of being able to try to deal with
snow and ice is to have people on standby that you know you can call and
they’ve got an obligation that they’re committing on their side has some
value to it

  <p id="25:00">
  [SPEAKER CHANGES] We can talk about what value does and bring that point
to bear. We are opting to go with those contracts in lieu of perhaps
having the equipment or the personnel all the time to meet the need when
it arises irregularly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So you&#39;re saying there&#39;s a cost that&#39;s
associated with that and hypothetically if the contract was a million
dollars whether they are pro forma or not, but an analysis has been
done, for say that million dollars. We can not have the staff or trucks
on standby for that season. Is that-I mean I&#39;m using that as a
hypothetical number. There is a matrix that&#39;s being used to say-and
I get with Mr. Holder, I just want to make sure that that is part of the
equation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d be more than happy to follow up with him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that&#39;s certainly my expectation. I believe
that we could demonstrate that and that&#39;s something that Mr. Holder
would be better positioned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I appreciate Senator Meredith&#39;s
questions, but I would like for that answer to made available to the
committee. That&#39;s very intriguing to me and quite honestly it&#39;s
baffling when you&#39;ve got private sector companies that have peak and
slow seasons, and I just don&#39;t understand, unless there&#39;s
geographical constraints that why, that service could be contracted out
for a firm, that&#39;s going to be down during that time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I? If I keep this brief, but this is a topic on
which we are focusing a lot of attention having just gone through the
experience of not being able to get people to respond to our request for
contractors. And among the reasons furnished are the risk for them for
their equipment to operate in a more dangerous environment than they
ordinarily operate on something they do with less experience than they
might have. Let&#39;s just say they&#39;re putting a truck out there
that they put a plow on that ordinarily doesn&#39;t have a plow on it
and ordinarily the driver of that truck doesn&#39;t operate on snow. So
they are opting not to put at risk the eight months when they could use
that truck because somebody might wreck it during the one event that
happens in the four months when they&#39;re not using it. Same thing
with things like motor graders, they&#39;re expensive pieces of
equipment, put it out there for whatever the contract amount is, put it
out there at risk. Again some of this has to do with just a reduction in
the number of contractors out there that happen during the 2008 period
and some of it is all those risk factors. It is a topic on which we are
focused now as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So I understand Senator Ford you&#39;d like to have
that information available about either the magnitude or the number or
some information about the contractors we have with DOT?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Make it available to the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Here&#39;s another one for Senator Ford,
Representative Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I assume the same thing. I assume that the same thing
goes for mowing. We were told we have drought years and then we have a
couple of summers ago it was extremely wet and the mowers that I see mow
whether there&#39;s a foot of grass or no grass at all, they just mow
anyway. Is it the same way-contracts set up for that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just need to defer that to Highway Division, to let
you know how the contracts are set and what they triggers are for the
various times when people provide the service. I didn&#39;t even mention
a hot topic project on that one. Preservation of-let me just, at the
risk of starting this. This is a function that is not something that I
thought about much before I got in this position, but the pavement that
we have out there has to be preserved. That once you take it past of a
certain point of repair, you get into rebuilding it, and so the whole
exercise in pavement preservation is a critical part of maintaining the
road system that we have, and I say that as distinct from contract
resurfacing, which is a project or a treatment that can improve the road
surface and the customer satisfaction with that road, but does not fully
meet the pavement preservation goals that I think we need to achieve. So
again, at the risk of starting on another series, that&#39;s an
important part of what the divisions are responsible for. And then the
bridge

  Activities and you’ve heard a presentation or a presentation’s been made
recently on bridges and I’m sure will be again, so moving to the
intermodal section, the railroads of North Carolina operate 3,300 miles
of track, 3,834 at grade public crossings state wide. We do our very
best to try to keep people and/or vehicles out of those areas at times
they should not be there and unfortunately we don’t have that full
compliance with the warnings and the signage and all the requests that
we make, so it’s still a challenge and as far as I know there’s a
challenge everywhere. There are two class one and 21 short line railroad
operators. The short lines are a critical important part of the economic
development question for the state for those industries, services
looking for rail services, the short lines provide the kind of
connectivity that’s gonna deliver the sort of last mile services to
their facilities, and then for passenger rail we have two trains, or two
services that run under the name Piedmont, the two round trips between
Charlotte and Raliegh, and then the Carolinian which is an Amtrak
designated train which is also running on the same route, Charlotte,
Raleigh, but then runs on to New York City. One of the things that again
you find when you start to look at issues related to rail is the whole
question of how do you get more service if you need it. Our service to
New York City is very substantial ridership but the choke point that
exists on the rail, the actual capacity of the rail system, which from
the north of there limits what we can do. So even if we wanted to get
another service, it would be very difficult to get it squeezed in on the
current route that’s available, on the CXSA line. Aviation, interesting
illustration selection here and this is to point out that we use
aviation for photogrammatry so that when we have a disaster that we need
to identify the scope we have the aviation group. I’m reasonably certain
that in the not very distant future we’ll do this with unmanned aerial
systems. That is not on the slide. There is not a reference to that
because our aviation department doesn’t operate unmanned aerial systems.
We do have aircraft. We do have involvement in the UAS program through
our relationship with the next generation aviation technology project
endgap and beyond that and more importantly, we have state system
planning, airport aviation system development and non-state aircraft
that we operate. You can see on the slide that aviation commercial
airports and the general aviation airports add about $26 billion to the
economy and I have been impressed at the level of involvement and
activity that is around general aviation airports. They are significant
to the communities they serve, certainly, and I think as a group
significant for the state. We also under our transit Deputy Secretary,
we have our public transportation section which is involved in
administrating the state and federal grants to the various operators.
These are county, municipality owned, or the creation and authority in
some cases that are for multiple counties or multiple jurisdictions. You
can see that we’ve had a substantial increase in ridership and that
there are about 5,000 people that are employed in the operation of these
systems across the state. The ferries we are the largest state owned
system on the East Coast, second largest in the nation. I say that with
full awareness that the Washington state system is the largest and
provides service to something on the order of 14 million passengers a
year. We are doing well with our service with 2 million passengers and
we are looking for ways to provide better service all the time. It, I’m
sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Sir, if you could provide me with the budget size for the
ferry division. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, I will. It’s about $48
million on an annual budget for the operating cost of ferry system, but
I’ll

  As you can see, last year $7 million worth of stolen vehicles recovered.
I think that’s it. Yes, sir. I’m sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] Getting
back to the effects of pedestrian subsidizing or not subsidizing, as we
build roads, for example, and we incorporate sidewalks, is there any
kind of a set fee, code, charge to put up that sidewalk for pedestrian
use? Do we toll the people who walk on the sidewalk and do we somehow
manage those individuals who manage to walk on the sidewalk to recoup
some of those funds? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You can imagine that I’m trying
to be less expansive in my answers and so no is the answer that I would
offer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there other
questions from the committee? Okay. I believe that completes our agenda
for the day. Thank you, Mr. Tennison. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
