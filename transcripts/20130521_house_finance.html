To verify the immigration status with any person they stop or detain
that they have reasonable suspicion that they may be in the state
illegally and the bill also prohibits the award of state contracts to
any c=out of state contractor who is not complying with the states e
verify laws. That’s it pretty much in a nutshell. I’m going to introduce
representative Brian Brown to cover the first couple parts of the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Rep brown you have the floor
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. chairman members good morning, the first two sections of
the bill is what I will cover. The part 2 of the bill increase s
penalties for possession manufacturing or sell of false identify
documents of false identification essentially we are moving it form a
class 1 misdemeanor to a class I felony and those documents include
things like any type of identification card issued by a state that has a
pictured a military identify card a passport an alien registration card
containing a picture the second section of part 2 increases the
penalties for selling and manufacturing of drivers permits, drivers
license or the restricted drivers permit and the beef of that section
actually increases it to a class h felony from a class I felony so just
a little more teeth and we’re all there.  Section 3 of the bill deals
with rebuttable presumption to pre trail release the originally bill
that we filed made a few changes to it so basically two very important
changes related to the rebuttable assumption to pre trail release first
it changes to release cost to probably cause the standard that judge
must believe that an un documented alien has committed one of the listed
crimes and those crimes can be things like a sex offense assault things
like that.  And before the presumption before pre trial release becomes
operable. Second it would not require ice to guarantee that a detainer
will be issued against the offenders in all cases or to reimburse the
state for cost of incarceration before the pre trial release.
Essentially we just thought as though we could not guarantee that ice
would make those guarantees or that retribution to use.  With that I
will turn over to Jonathan Jordan to explain parts 4 and 5
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. chairman.  Colleagues I am goanna go over briefly sections
4 5 and 6. 4 is the one where we are goanna require that persons who are
unlawfully prisoned in the united states in the custody of the dept. of
corrections would reimburse the state for the actual cost of the
prisoners incarceration. The amount will be accessed and collected by
the division an d remitted to the general fund any un paid reimbursement
can be set off against any NC Income tax refund due to prisoner and the
department of revenue may pursuit collection of the debt through set off
for at least 10 years.  A portion of any funds earned through work
release could also be deducted to reimburse the state.  Section 5 is the
Arizona section that survived the constitutional review by the supreme
court and it would authorize law enforce officers agencies to make
reasonable attempts to verify the immigration status of any person
stopped detained or arrested where there is reasonable suspicion that
the person not lawfully present in the US. Verification would not be
necessary if the person provided certain valid of identification or if
it was not practical to verify the person’s immigration status or it
would hinder or obstruct an investigation. Verification would also not
be required for person contacting law enforcement to act as a witness to
a crime or a report criminal activity or to seek assistance as victim of
a crime. And the bill would require the implementation of the
requirement to verify the status must be consistent with any federal law
and protection of federal rights. Section 6 provides for the
verification of a persons immigration status in a manner consistent with
federal law and provides for the admissibility of any records pertaining
to the person’s immigration statues and it would also provide the
transport of persons unlawfully present in the us to a federal facility.
 It was in section 6 misc. sections. At this point I will turn it over
to representative Collins.
[Speaker Changes]
We will go briefly through sections 7 and 8. Section 7 is just what it
says. Prohibits the use of certain documents for identification
purposes. On page 10 section a deals with identifying yourself before
any judge justice law enforcement officer anybody else who’s a
government representative and basically says that the only foreign
document to accept is a foreign passport. Section 7c makes the same
statement for insures if persons trying to get automobile insurance.</p>

<p id="15:00">
And with out driving privileges. there is also a misconception, I think,
in what constitutes an illegal immigrant in NC its been estimate that
between 42% and 48% of the folks who are here in the country illegally,
came here legally to began with, and have simply over stay there work
visa or student visa. This are folks who are vetted in the work system.
This are folks who will eventually become citizens of the federal
government continue in the path that they are. This is NC opportunity to
set the requirements in place. To stay ahead of the curb, sort of speak.
As we learn from the Daka situation a couple of months ago. Once the
federal government confers legal presence on illegal folks. They by
determination by the attorney general will be able to walk into the DMV
right now and get a drivers license. Same as you or me or your son or
your daughter. Right now we have the opportunity to set in place. A
system that will give law enforcement a tool to use to determine who is
here legally and illegally and what their criminal history may be. It is
very unlikely that some one with there criminal history, who this bill
is targeting. That is harden criminal activity. That is human
trafficking, sex crime, drug related crimes, gang related crimes. Its
very unlikely that some one in that category is gonna take the time to,
and worry about having a legal restricted driving permit and subject
themselves to a criminal background check. The only part of this bill
the tenth part of this bill. Puts in place a system or procedure by
which the law enforcement can confiscate a car or vehicle that is being
driven by someone. Whether there legally or illegally present in the
state, who is driving without a restricted permit or driving with a
license that is been revoked do to DWIs, DUIs things of that nature who
we intend to be off the road in the first place.  It also has a
provision for the confiscation of a car, if an individual is driving
with there insurance lapse and the forfeiture of the car for sale. There
is provision to let an individual reclaim their car if they comeback
with proof of insurance. So we have looked at this bill with great
length, looked at every provision we fell is a very balance bill. It
must be because people across the bill support it but don't like it. I
commend the bill to, Mr. chairman we are prepared to answer questions
from the comity. At the appropriate time. As a member of the comity, I
like to be recognized to make a motion for favorable report on the PCS
and favorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes I see the policy parts of the bill, and the appropriation effects.
I'm looking for the. Were is the finance part of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
There is a fee in the bill of the drivers license.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Is it a different fee or just applies to a new class of people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
A new issue of a license.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
What section is that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That be section, I believe that be section nine representative Stam and
we live the determination of he amount of the fee, to the secretary of
the department of transportation, to the DMV because they are going to
be the issuing party behind this. This is design to be a one stop shop
here. They do the finger printing they do the background checks the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Jones is you give me just a minute. I'll recognize you.
For those of you who just come in at 9:45 we will be taking a vote on
this bill. I have 14 people from outside the comity that have sign up to
speak. I ask that you respect the opportunity to preach one, to be
heard. Representative Jones you recognize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you Mr. chairman, thank you representative Warren. This is a
question that you may wanna the staff to answered I don't know. On page
14 line 47. As the are you explain that the applicant has to be a
resident of NC of at least year. Prior to April first 2014. what is the
penalty if they produce a fraudulent document. In making that
determination.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That would be a class one felony, and I felony.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
And I am not an attorney but, and this is were the staff might be
helpful, what is the penalty. For a class I felony.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I will defer to staff on that

range, depending on how many prior convictions you have, but the
presumptive range that would reflect the maximum would be anywhere
between 8 to 10 months, with a maximum of 19 to 21 months.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
One more follow up, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
What would be the penalty for a Class H felony?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Give me one second I can let you know. Class H is one step about the
Class I, so a Class H with the fewest prior convictions, the presumptive
range is 5 to 6 months as your minimum. If you have the most prior
convictions then your minimum would be 16 to 20 months.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members. I have two questions. One dependent on
what the answer to the first one is. I'm still trying to make sure I
understand what happens if someone is here illegally and does not try to
get one of these cards?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
All the other provisions of the bill are applicable to them. There is no
financial penalty or anything of that nature. They would be in our state
illegally without any background information on them, and my assumption,
Representative Samuelson, is that we would start deportation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK. Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
On that same point that Representative Bert, Jones brought up. I'm
having name issues this week. If the applicant has to have been here for
a year prior to April 1, 2013, let's say that we're having this
Committee meeting 4 years from now, what about people who may have come
to this state because the Federal Government is slow doing whatever
they're doing or not, and they were not here the year before April 1,
2013? Would they still be ineligible to get one of these?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Well, you're asking me to answer a hypothetical situation, and right
now, what we're experiencing at the Federal level is the gang of 8 in
their throws and they're trying to push Senate Bill 744. It may be a
moot point is what I'm saying, that far down the line I'd hate to
project out on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
So, in essence, this date is here for now given the current
circumstance. Your assumption would be if we needed for some reason to
change that legislation later, we would?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That date is also there, Representative Samuelson, to help assist in any
influx of folks coming to the state specifically for a restricted
driver's permit. And because of the nature of the restricted permit, I
doubt that it's much of a draw anyway. This isn't like we can drive down
from New Jersey like we experienced 10 years ago and get a permit, or
get a driver's license and drive back out. You have to prove you've been
here, you have to subject yourself to a criminal background check. This
is very restrictive. In comparing this bill, and this provision of the
bill to the way this has been done in Illinois, the way it's being, and
has been done since 2005 in Utah, this is a very restrictive program.
Utah's been doing special driving privileges like this since 2005, and
it wasn't until 2011 that they passed a bill to require fingerprints. We
are years ahead of this, this is a very restricted measure for public
safety, to make sure these folks are on the road knowing how to drive,
what the rules of the road are, and that they are insured.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you. Let me address my questions to staff, and to understand the
changes in the law I need to understand the current law. Currently, if a
person is in this state driving, if they're in the state illegally and
they are caught for driving under the influence, can they be prosecuted
for DWI under the laws of North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes. Under criminal law it doesn't matter that they're illegal and they
would be subject to punishment for the crime they committed while they
were here. They could be incarcerated just like anyone who commits a
crime in North Carolina. If somebody comes in and commits murder, then
North Carolina's got jurisdiction to prosecute that person for murder,
or DUI.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK. So, follow up then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
So, I</p>

<p id="25:00">
under this proposed law what changes they can still be charged with DWI
and manslaughter or any thing else that happens while they operate a
motor vehicle.  They would just be subject to other DMV violations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Right, and the other item I was going to mention is
that they would have to reimburse the state for their incarcerations
cost.  But depending on the offense, for example there's a provision in
here that would provide for the seizure of the vehicle if it was one of
the offenses listed in that section.  There's a couple of different
provisions that would get to your question.  I'm not sure which
provision you want more information about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Alright, well let's say if a person is in state
illegally, and they're driving without a valid driver's license and
they're driving drunk, and they hit another car and they cause the death
of another person.  Under the current law they could be charged with DWI
and vehicular homicide.  Under this current law they would still be
charged with those same offenses and forfeit their vehicle.  Is that the
major change?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The forfeiture provision applies if a person is driving
without insurance, or they're driving without a license or one of these
restricted permits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]If I may, it would be the forfeiture of the vehicle
would be one of the additional contingencies, and also the costs of
incarceration would apply.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman.  First of all, I'd just ask
something in case we committee members are in discussion, can we, and I
heard the Chair's decision to vote at 9:45, and I respect that.  Can we
just listen to a couple of people on both sides rather than listening to
all 14?  That's just a suggestion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, I was a little concern I would have to cut you
off at 9:10, to give him a chance anyway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Right, well exactly, so I'd like more time as a
Vice-Chair of the committee, if I might.  Thank you.  I want to first
thank Representative Moore, because obviously you did a whole lot of
research on this issue and I appreciate how much you've worked on it.
It really shows in the bill, and I appreciate it.  I wanted to follow
up, first on Representative Stam's question on fiscal impact, and I
wondered if staff could point me to the fiscal impact.  In other words,
what makes this different from when you and I go to DMV to get a
renewal, I guess, on our license, what makes this different?  Or we were
just moving to the state and getting our license for the first time, can
staff explain that, just that little piece.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well Representative Luebke, I'll give it a try, and if
Rodney wants to follow up he can.  As was mentioned earlier, the
restricted permit piece is in section 9C of the bill, and it does allow,
as Representative Warren said, it gives the Secretary of Transportation
the authority to set the fee, so we don't know what that fee is going to
be, but it can't be any lower than the actual cost of processing the
application, which may include the cost of the criminal background
check.  And then, unlike a drivers license which, I think, is an 8 year
renewal, this would have to be renewed every year, and the cost of
renewal is $25.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, and just quickly on that, $4 I saw on the bill,
it was $4 for license A, license B, License C.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That's the existing law there, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Are you just saying that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman, just to follow up.
Representative Warren, I think my concerns, I want to summarize it, My
concerns are not about people who are making violations, or who are
engaged in violations of the law, just again, as you and I might.  so,
the reference to driving DUI, the reference to reckless driving,
etcetera, those are not my questions at all.  I understand that other
members have those concerns.  But mine are about people who are here,
they're undocumented, they don't have papers, we could have a long
debate about why the Federal Immigration Bill is wrong and restricts
immigration.</p>

is from Mexico which is why people have come here because employers have
asked them to come and work in various positions and we all know that I
hope, that people are here because North Carolina employers ask them to
come.  That's the first thing.  Now my question is really this. What
assurances does a person who's undocumented have in terms of protecting
him or her if he/she has this license that you're talking about and then
is stopped because the officer thinks well this person looks to me like
s/he is not here with papers, with a green card or the doc of legal
presence, etc.  What happens there in terms of my protections because
I've got one of the license plates that's a key part of your bill?
Drivers license, excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was reminded it's a permit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Permit. Thank you.  But you have the permit, now
what..
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To answer your question, we get down there into one of
the issues that has somewhat concerned us at this end of the bill too
and it is how do you protect an individual from let's say a rogue
individual who's maybe just looking for folks who appear to be illegal.
You can't stop, according to the provisions of the bill and particularly
I think it's Section 5 on the one that's referred to as the Arizona,
individuals can't be stopped just because they &quot;look&quot; like
they might be here illegally  which is one of the points I wanted to
make earlier which is such a large percentage, a high percentage of
folks came here from a variety of countries on legal visas, work visas
and I don't know how you look at somebody and determine that they look
like they're here illegally when they could be from India, they could be
here from England, they could be from anyplace else and look the same as
you or I.  As far as protections go the intent behind the drivers permit
is to allow law enforcement to stop an individual and without having to
go through all the steps and procedures to determine that person's legal
status will identify that right away.  Typically what's happening now
and again
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I interject just to the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How would you determine legal status?  The person has
the drivers permit
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How does that make the person here legal?  How does
that make it a document?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It doesn't sir. The driving permit clearly states that
they have no legal presence, no legal status, so that is the proof the
law officer needs there. The time consumption on law enforcement would
be saved dramatically because as soon as that is produced they know the
individual is here illegally. And what I've found in research, this has
been going on since July of last year what we're finding is that across
the board knowing that ICE is not giving us assistance in removing
people who are here illegally unless they're engaged in some of the
criminal activity that this bill seeks to address typically what's
happening in a lot of cases they're getting a ticket and they're sent on
their way. This will expedite the process.  Law enforcement will know
who they're dealing with.  As one of the sheriff's told me I can arrest
somebody today or stop somebody in my county, I'm not going to mention
the county, I can stop him today and get a name, two days later one of
my officers stops him and the same individual gets a different name and
this will establish identity which is a big help for law enforcement. So
typically, I guess bottom line, to answer your question is  that while
there is no guaranteed protection someone stopped with one of these
would not get treated in any special way because they may be involved in
some other type of criminal activity.  The thought across the board is
that once that permit is produced a citation can be given for whatever
the traffic offense or whatever the reason they were detained for and
they're sent on their way.  And again one of the provisions that relates
to is trying to free up law enforcement and our human and financial
resources to address more nefarious criminal activity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Then to follow up.  How can, I think you know,
Alamance County is being investigated by the Department of Justice. It's
a very very complicated situation. In Wake County there's plenty of
evidence that people are being stopped and 287G's being used against
them for sending on their way to deportation.  How is this different?
How is this going to save these people from these deportations which we
know the Obama Administration is supposed to not be doing but we also
know it has been doing.  How is a person with a permit</p>

<p id="35:00">
saved from that potential deportation road. And how is different from,
say, a man driving and his wife is next to him? is there any different
in the treatment of him, the driver with the permit, and his spouse, who
does not have that because she doesn't drive.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well the spouse first off has the opportunity to get the restricted
identification card. We have that in here for non drivers. So that kind
of eliminates that problem. You pointed out something, I didn't want to
mention county names, but it goes back to something I was saying. We
can't- we can pass a law and the intent of the law be there, but we
can't control individual behavior out in the field. And it not only
applies to this bill, but every bill that we pass up here, whether it's
about voting, or whether it's about entitlement programs, whether it's
about a restricted driver's permit. There will always be some individual
action that goes against the grain of the intent of the law, so in the
intent of this part of the law is that an individual come forth, submit
that they're not wanted for anything other than perhaps coming into the
country illegally, than understanding that we're not getting assistance
from the federal government to deport these and considering our
financial condition as a state, and the reduction of funds for law
enforcement, it's  our position that this will help deter incarcerating
folks meaninglessly at a cost of $45-50 a day to the county or to the
department when all they've got to do is write them a ticket and send
them on their way because now they know who they are, and where they
are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm going to interrupt you and let the outside speak. This bill does
not- while I'm sure it's going to affect on how some people vote on how
it affects the passengers, the bill itself does not address the
passengers. That's their responsibility to get their own permit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If i may, ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So I have 14 people from outside and I will recognize them, and we're
going to start with that. If they get through before 9:45, we'll come
back to the committee. Thank you very much. And I ask that the outside
will be giving you, since I had said 3 minutes and we've got so many
requests, I'm going to stick with 2 minutes, you'll be given a warning.
At 3 minutes, you will be cut off if you can't finish it up. And we will
start with the honorable Harry Payne. You will identify yourself and all
of that. Most of us know who you are. Identify yourself, who you
represent, and you'll be given 2 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Can y'all hear me? is this working? Good, thank you.
I'm Harry Payne with the North Carolina Justice Center, and we applaud
the sponsor's desire and what seems to be a common theme about granting
these people a pathway to the highway. We think it admirable, needed to
preserve- we want people riding down the highway who've been approved
and tested and driving. And who have insurance.  But it does not change
the fact that this bill goes well beyond that. It makes choices as to
who is good and who is bad. And this is new in our state. Only driving
related issues can take your driving privileges away. Murders,
pedophiles, rapists, thieves, are eligible in this state to get a
driving license. But simply having been born somewhere else is not a
fair measure. It excludes people who cannot get their birth certificate
from their whole country. It excludes people who have lived off of the
matricular consular for years and that has been their ID, all of a
sudden it's out the window. Our experience with ?? immigrants is that
they have underground for so long, and have consciously tried not to
have an apartment lease or a monthly cable bill, because it will get
them in trouble. And so that whole world is excluded, and that does not
mean they're good or bad people for making decisions that have nothing
to do with ID and nothing to do with the ability to drive. The cost of
this bill is extraordinary, you have to prepay 1 year of insurance.
Certainly it's not a crime to be poor and to thus be treated like a
hardened criminal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Rep. Payne. And based on the way you've signed up and
indicated on</p>

I'm a farmer in that county and have been a farmer since I married my
husband 31 years ago tomorrow we have raised or family on this farm and
we love our community. Our farm is 5200 acres of grain and 2 hog
facilities we love the way of life and we love where we are, however the
immigration system is broken that stabilizes our community So I am
asking you today to vote in favor of this bill. I know what it is like
to live in a community that is rich in agriculture and very dependent on
seasonal labor and I have seen the population of our community change as
the seasonal workers have become residents. We have issues that are
problems that have been around for a long time. Somehow we as a state to
to figure out a way to address our immigration problems so that our
communities will become stronger and . On our farm our present workforce
is 67% hispanic and has been as high as 90%. This statistic is reflected
all across the state and we have to have a system in place so our law
enforcement can support our communities and keep them safe. all of our
citizens even our immigrant people need to have some sort of security
and house bill 786 will give them that security to keep the roads and
their communities safe. My brother is also a detective in the Goldberg
cities police and he deals daily with trying to identify these citizens.
I believe that documenting the transient population will stabilize their
lives our communities and our industries giving everyone security and
confidence we all have a community that is providing a valuable service
for businesses like mine that would fail without them but I believe we
should be proactive and address this issue without waiting on the
federal government as a farmer and an employer and a citizen I urge you
to vote in favor of house bill 786. Thank You. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. Mr James Johnston and Mr. James HIcks will be up next and Mr. Bob
Cotton. Good morning my name is James Johnston, I'm with NC Fire North
Carolinians fr immigration reform and enforcement I am here on behalf of
our six thousand plus members and our thirty to forty thousand North
Carolina Residents that we are in daily contact with through social
media whoa are actually in favor of the enforcement measures of this
bill we are opposed to section 9 the issuance of licenses to illegal
aliens some of the unintended consequences that go along with this like
issuing permits and these to illegal aliens include. A report by CIAS
says issuing licences and I.D.'s to illegal aliens high levels of
identity theft go hand in hand. 8 of the 10 stares with the highest
percentage of illegal aliens are among the 10 states that are in the
highest rank of identity theft. The FTC put out a report about the cost
of I.D. theft. Victims of I.D. theft lose an estimated $10,200.00 per
year. Victim estimated the spend and estimated $1200.00 on average and
over six hundred hours resolving the problems associated with identity
theft. New Mexico is one state that currently issues licenses to illegal
aliens. Governor Martinez indicates that it has arrived with widespread
fraud They have brought charges against several crime syndicates These
were paid to support foreign documents from Poland China México Ecuador
Guatemala El Salvador Costa Rica and Uruguay in fact there are currently
11 such cases pending in the New Mexico court system. The latest two
that were caught reported and were indicated that the were responding to
a new york newspaper advertisement to obtain New mexicos licenses
licenses in New mexico there were also advertisements in a post
newspaper chicago and a spanish newspaper in and a chinese newspaper in
new york New Mexico is known as the place to go for Drivers licenses and
ID Cards. I'll be next if we follow through with this policy. So as all
of it is being touted as a la enforcement policy it seems that section 9
will only add to the workload of law enforcement and add to the
suffering of north carolina citizens it is for this reason that we ask
you to reject section 9 of this bill Thank you Mr Johnston Mr Bob ?? and

I became aware of basically this driver's license issue in December when
some of our employees were involved in an accident on 3-11 south of high
point. They are aliens and they were undocumented. The individual that
hit them also did not have a license and did not have a license plate. I
drove up about lunch time, got out of the car and became aware of the
situation. It was very unfortunate. Fortunately, we had a North Carolina
highway patrolman who handled it very well. The employees were
transported the the hospital. The individual who caused this accident
tried to change his license plate and did not have a driver's license.
We are very much in favor of this bill. It does help North Carolina. it
will help fair out nefarious individuals. This is a law enforcement
issue that needs to be dealt with for the safety of our roads, our
citizens and our state. Thank you very much.

[speaker changes]
Yes, my name is ?? ??. I'm with ambassador ??, my company. I've been
losing work to illegals. I was a custom supervisor for a company and I
paid top guy of every company, he would go out the the parking lot, pay
those people, pay his people cash up underneath the table. You keep em
around here, they're taking my jobs. If they stay here with driver's
licenses, you're gonna gut e-verify. I need that enforced and the
construction trade, they're taking over. They're pushing all of the
American citizens out of the construction trade where they can't make a
living and that's my situation here. I might be losing my home  because
I can't get enough jobs. I gotta give a free estimate to a general
contractor. They don't give an estimate, so I'm asking you to oppose
this on the driver's license and enforce e-verify. Thank you.

Thank you. Mr. Lou Ebert and next, Mrs. Kate Wilmer.
[speaker changes]
Good morning Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Lou
Ebert, I'm president and CEO of the North Carolina chamber of Commerce.
The chamber serves as the organized voice of the business community in
our state representing more than 35,000 members and employing over a
million North Carolinians. I want to thank this committee for attention
to this important issue that's critical to many employers in our state.
The North Carolina chamber applauds House Bill 786, the reclaim act and
is encouraged by the comprehensive approach it brings to immigration
reform in our state. House Bill 786 would take important steps, we
believe, to increase penalties for false identification documents. It
would limit the types of identification available for determining a
person's identity. It would make improvements to the current e-verify
statutes for seasonal workers. It would provide the issuance of a
restrictive driver's permit for the identification card of persons not
lawfully in the US. The chamber supports the efforts of Representative
Harry Warren and House leadership to promote legislation that we feel
would enact statewide middle of the road immigration reforms that ensure
a readily available workforce while addressing the immigration legality
issues. We stand in support of this legislation and look forward to
passing this. Thank you.
[speaker changes]
Thank you. Mrs. Kate Wilmer and next, Mr. Ron Cox.
[speaker changes]
Hello and Thank you to the committee. My name is Kate Wilmer-?? . I'm
with the North Carolina Justice Center. The North Carolina Justice
Center advocates for low income people across North Carolina and this
bill is a bad bill for taxpayers and it's a bad bill for low income
people across North Carolina. We believe the costs outlined in the
fiscal note here are grossly understating the cost of this bill. Almost
every section of this bill is gonna carry increased cost. Increased
incarceration time. The cost of administering the pay your way in prison
provision which may exceed the actual revenue we take in from low income
prisoners and ex prisoners. Increased arrests. Increased jail time when
people can't bond out under section 3. The phenomenal cost of impounding
every vehicle, not just for undocumented --</p>

Immigrants but for any person in this state stopped driving without
insurance. If your insurance lapses for two weeks, your car will be
impounded. It doesn't say it may be impounded, it says it shall be
impounded. So the cost under this bill are going  be exceptional we have
a lot of challenges in this state. We need to pay for educating our
children. We need to pay for providing health care and basic services to
our citizens. Paying for our roads and air and water quality. We don't
need need to be paying for this unnecessary provisions. Kentucky
considered a similar bill and found that the annual cost would be 40
million dollars. The legislature rejected this bill  because of the
cost. We ask you to reject this bill because of the unnecessary cost.
The unnecessary impact on low income immigrants but also on low income
citizens. Section five of the bill is going to affect people who are
here as citizens and lawfully present. Every body is going to be
required to show their papers to law enforcement, if law enforcement
believes that they might not be here lawfully. And they can be detain if
they can not show those papers. So we ask the comity to reject this bill
we believe that is going to be very expensive, and is unnecessary for
our state. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you. Mr. Roen Cox and next Mr. Danny Moor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
my name is Roan Cox, Jesus ministries. I think that in all bills we
would like to have the perfect bill. I don't think there is a perfect
one. I like to see both sides seem to be upset with  the bill. Because
it seems to be a little bit more fair and down the middle. We can state
thing from all around. Form people taking polls or taking studies to
shore up one side or the other  the basic thing is what do we have now.
Now and officer stops someone. There is no ID. He has to stop taken
downtown, finger print them tie up the states time, tie up there time
and cost us money. That time could be better spent solving or preventing
other crimes. The system trough A-verify we want E-verify we want to
know who is here. But jet this does help the state maintain some of the
Latino workers or some of the immigrant workers not only Latino. And
that they can hopefully seek employment. It will shield there employer a
little bit but jet it wont protect them against heiring undocumented. It
is not fair to just sit there and try to destroy the bill to protect one
side or the other. We appreciate the representatives work. We think
there is a time and a moment for North Carolina to step forward, and to
move into the future. And we feel is better for law enforcement. For
every one. Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you. Ms Dana Moor next Mr. Petter Daniel
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
hello and thank you to the community. I'm Danny Moor form the North
Carolina justice center. We continue to oppose this bill even though we
appreciate the hard work that legislator have put into it, to try to
make it better. We find that the bill still to punitive to both
immigrants and US citizens. And too costly for individual families and
for North Carolina as a whole. I wanna tell you about some real North
Carolina people who will be affected by this bill. I'm a US citizens I
grew up in Edgecombe county and now I live in Ryley. My neighbors across
the street are the Rodriguez family. They been US citizens for years. So
has my friend Jubencio who live in Pitt county and my friend who is a
grandfather Enrique form Mexico city he now lives in Hillsboro. And his
daughter Rebeca was my co-worker a few year ago. This are Mexican
American families more broadly this are Latino families. And more
broadly this are Latino families who are US citizens. They are a part of
North Carolina just like I am. All have been US citizens for years. With
the Arizona show me your papers provisions of this bill. Will they have
to carry not only ID but proof of their citizenship like a pass port, or
birth certificate. When walking the dog or pushing their children in a
stroller or when shopping for bread and milk. Will I with my skin color,
my accent be asked the same, when I go to the grocery store or when I'm
on the side walk. I'm also concerned about the cost and many immigrant
families will not be able to afford to comply with the permit, or ID
provision of this law. I have a steady job and I try my best to pay my
bills on time. But I would struggle mightily to be able to afford 12
months of insurance in advance. I have a clean driving record and I been
paying that insurance for a lot much higher. For those who are young and
those who are not US citizens who can show that long standing driving
record. The bill is two costly and two punitive for North Carolina.
Thank you.

Mr. Chairman, committee, thank you for the opportunity to meet before
the committee today. My name is Peter Daniel. I am here today as my
capacity as an officer of the North Carolina Farm Bureau Board of
Directors. We appreciate the willingness of the bill's sponsors to reach
out to many groups in order to improve this bill. While not perfect, we
stand here today in strong support. Our guest worker system is severely
broken. It cannot be fixed here at the State level without tremendous,
unintended, economic consequences. We saw this take place in Georgia,
Alabama, and Arizona. No one should want to go there. The bill
recognizes these facts, and is a bold attempt to bridge the gap between
Federal and State policy. On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of
farms, and rural families who live in this broken immigration system
every day, we see this bill as providing law enforcement the tools they
need to legally remove the criminal elements from our state. The bill
would create the needed structure to ensure that every driver on North
Carolina's roads is taught our law and regulations, and that the vehicle
that is driven is insured. The question before this body today: Will
this body provide law enforcement the tools they need to provide safer
communities, and safer roads, until congress acts and fixes the
situation. We urge your support of the bill, and thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. Ron Woodard, and then Mr. Jim Hobbs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, I'm Ron Woodard, Director of North Carolina Listen. H-786
has some good points however, part 8 section F through H makes
null-and-void earlier legislation H-36 which became law in 2001, that
was supposed to protect new jobs for citizens, not illegal aliens. H-786
as written, helps illegal hold jobs. Remember, 85% of illegals don't
work on farms. Isn't job number 1 in our State to make sure unemployed
citizens get jobs? Illegal immigration is costing our State over 1.1
billion net each year. We're paying social services and public benefits
to illegals and their dependents, and also providing dual social
services and unemployment compensation to citizens who's jobs illegals
have taken. Illegal cheap labor is very expensive to our State budget.
Every dollar going to illegals and their dependents is one less dollar
going to our own poor. Eight members of this committee co-sponsored
H-36, the e-Verify bill in 2011 to make sure new jobs went to citizens,
not illegals. Why would you undo this? 40% of the co-sponsors of 786
actually co-sponsored the H-36 bill. What are you afraid of, e-Verify is
going to work? We have nearly 9% unemployment in North Carolina, so
don't we want to make sure citizens get jobs? The legislative has cut
unemployment benefits, not added the poor to Medicaid and cut earned
income tax credits to encourage citizens to work. As H-786 is written,
you're turning on these very citizens when they need to look for work by
helping illegals get jobs and then drive to the job legally. If we have
time to deny welfare to citizens, don't we have time also to deny jobs
to illegal aliens? Part 9 of this bill gives impoundment - part 10 of
the bill gives impoundment of vehicles, and that fixes the problem of
people driving illegally. The sheriff's association is not in favor of
part 9 of this bill, and this part of the bill is also in violation of
Federal law. We did this eight years ago, and we had mass illegal
immigration because of it. We'd be the only State in the South East and
only one of five other States to do this, and New Mexico says they wish
they hadn't. So in conclusion, I ask you to - for part 8 and part 9
remove that, or else I urge you to vote against the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
