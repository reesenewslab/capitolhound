[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Rucho, what time do you have?
You’re early for you.
Members will be coming in. We don’t have to have a forum to begin with.
We will have to have if we vote the bill today. And we have one
technical PCS that we need approved, and Senator Soucek will present
that at this time.
Senator Soucek moves the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick PCS, its a resolution honoring Billy Graham and
Ruth Graham, its going to be heard today with theGraham family coming in
for this so we needed to make a technical amendment so that the house
and the senate versions are identical and that the honoring is correct,
so I move for to ?? the PCS, which changes two technical items.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, we move the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barefoot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Move for a favorable report to PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, we had a option already, but we’ll take that.
Thank you.
Favor of the adoption of the PCS. Aye? Any no’s? Done. Thank you.
Want to recognize quickly our pages for today in the Senate we have
Stephen Carmen from Hooker town, Don Davis is his Sponsor, Senator
Davis. Brett Chapford, Snow Hill, Senator Davis. Sandrea Borkin from
Winterville, Senator Davis, Ryan Warren, Snow Hill, Senator Davis. I
don’t believe he knows he’ll have to take those to lunch on Thursday.
Ruth Smith from Wilmington, Senator Goulsbey. And I don’t think I have
any other pages there. At this time, let me quickly give you our
Sergeants in Arms, and they are Ashley Mickens, Robert Young, Billy
Fritcher, Stephen Wilson, and Canton Lewis, and they always do a good
job for us, and we thank you. Members and guests we are going to hear
from Senator Burger today on his excellent schools act bill of 2013,
there is a lot of meaty and good material in this bill and I am going to
ask him to explain the bill. The process today will be that we will hear
the bill. We will take any questions from the members first. And then we
have a few speakers that are lined up and I don’t think I have the list,
but we said we’d take at least 3 from each side, with 3 minutes each,
excerpt for our national superintendent of the year and we have granted
him 3 minutes and 38 seconds. The following individuals are on my list:
Dr. Mark Edwards, Superintendent of the Year, Moorsville Grady School,
Jacky Cole, board of Education Alamance County, Rodney Ellis, President
of NCAE, and Tom Rhodes, I don’t know who he Represents, but those are
the ones who we have signed up, and those will be allowed the three
minutes to speak. And at this time I will call on Senator Burger to
present the bill. Senator Burger.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr Chairmen, members of the committee, I
believe there is a PCS, I don’t know if its been adopted by the
committee yet?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein moves in adoption of the PCS all in
favor aye, any opposed? Done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairmen, again members of the committee
I appreciate the opportunity to be here this morning. Senate Bill 361,
the excellent public schools act of 2013 is a bill that attempts to
build on some of the reforms that were passed in the budget last year
and builds on some of the reforms that were in the original bill, I
think it was Senate Bill 795 that was passed by the Senate last year. It
does a number of things. What I would like to do is to go through kind
of bullet point wise, what certain sections of the bill do, then would
be more than happy to answer questions and I know staff is available to
expound on things in a more detailed fashion if that becomes necessary.
Part one of the bill is a carryover of Senate Bill 795 that didn’t make
it into law, and what that does is it provides that state employees, the
office of state personnel will set up a policy that will allow state
employees to volunteer for community service leave time, for mentoring
at a school up to a maximum of one hour each week to a maximum of 36
hours for the weeks that schools are in session. So thats part one. Part
two is an effort to maximize instructional time, and basically it
provides that that end of course tests..</p>

though will be given in the last ten days of a full year course, in the
last five days of a semester-long course. Part 3 attempts to strengthen
teacher licensure. And it does a couple things. I've got three items in
particular that it does. It requires North Carolina teacher colleges to
include reading instruction, diagnosis, and interventions in the
curriculum for elementary education including special education general
curriculum teachers. It requires that all new K-6 teachers, including
special education general curriculum teachers, must achieve minimum
scores in reading and math on any Praxis Two or similar test required
for initial licensure. And it also requires that for all K-8 teachers,
that those teachers must receive at least three hours of continuing
education credits in literacy for licensure renewal. It is important
that we have highly qualified teachers at the head of the classroom, and
these measures will help ensure that is the case. The bill goes on in
Part 4 to make some changes in the school performance grades. As a
result of the reforms we passed last year, parents are able to clearly
identify high-performing, average, and struggling schools and overall
student achievement through a transparent system that grades schools on
a zero to one hundred numerical scale with a corresponding letter grade
of A through F. These grades will be given for the first time at the end
of this school year. For elementary and middle schools, our system
utilizes a scale extremely similar to the former ABC model but awards
easy-to-understand letter grades rather than ambiguous designations such
as honor school of excellence, school of distinction, school of
progress, and you probably know the rest. Senate bill 361 expands on
that by also evaluating schools on whether they exceed, meet, or fail to
meet student achievement growth goals. Together these two measures will
foster greater transparency, encourage struggling schools to improve,
and allow parents to determine the best options for their children. Then
Part 5 is intent language dealing with Pay for Excellence. We are
awaiting results from requests for input from local LEAs on their ideas
of pay for performance, and we expect to receive those. I believe April
the 15th is the date that we're scheduled to receive those. The bill
makes it clear that we intend to move forward with a pay for performance
program, and that in that pay for performance program we will utilize
the evaluation instrument that is being developed and will continue to
be refined. Part 6 deals with teacher contracts. It's probably the most
detailed part of the bill. And what it does is attempts to address the
continuing concerns that people have about how to ensure high quality
teachers in our classrooms. In many respects, people believe that tenure
or career status acts as an impediment, rather than an enhancement of
ensuring that we have high quality teachers in front of our kids. This
bill does several things with reference to that. For teachers who have
been teaching for less than three- for three years or less, as of May
the 1st, 2013, the bill would eliminate the prospect of career status
for new teachers. The bill would go on to take the teachers who have
three or more years of experience, would direct the superintendents
around the state to evaluate those teachers, and to offer the top 25,
the highest quality teachers in those systems, contracts of four years'
duration. As an incentive for those contracts it would provide that any
teacher who was offered and accepts a four year contract would receive
not only their normal salary but would also receive a salary supplement
or an increase in their salary of five hundred dollars per year,
beginning the first year and it would build for the four years.</p>

<p id="10:00">
In addition to that, the bill would call for the complete elimination of
tenure as of June 30, 2018. That is something that, because we put the
date out approximately five years from now, will give the systems and
the teachers the opportunity and the ability to deal with the changes
that we're talking about. Those are the primary provisions of the bill.
I think the important thing for us to realize is that we began last year
with an attempt to address school policy in a way that, in many
respects, is different than policy has been addressed in years past. We
wanted to emphasize the importance of reading as the essential tool for
kids to be successful in school. We wanted to emphasize that by making
sure that kids are able to read, to the extent that that child has the
ability by the end of the third grade. All of the studies show us that
those kids who are unable to read at grade level by the end of the third
grade are the kids that tend to struggle as they go through their
education careers. The other thing that we are trying to do is to make
sure that, to the greatest extent possible, we have high quality
teachers in our classrooms. This bill continues that effort and moves us
forward. It is not, in my view, the final say in what we will need to do
to improve student performance in our schools. We will need to
continually evaluate, reevaluate, and reassess where we are and make
changes and make improvements as those improvements become necessary.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions
people have. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Berger. I will see if
the members have any questions at this time. We'll take questions from
members. And after that we'll go to the guests and we'll do those. I
think we have now one or two who've asked to not speak. So we're down to
I believe three from the audience. But first, members. Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Berger, thank you.
Question about the section on school grades. You have specified in the
bill, on page 11, that, on lines 2 through 4, that the measure on
school, student growth shall not be used to alter or adjust school
performance scores or the school performance grade earned by the school.
So this go-round, compared to last time, you are having some recognition
of the value of school, the student growth that occurs over the year.
But it's still not in the grade. And I did some looking into it.
Actually, I had somebody do some looking into it. And there are only
about 12 states that use this grading system, this simplistic grading
system. And of the 12, we could find information on 10 of them. And all
10 of them have in the grade itself how the school does at helping
students perform over the year. If you are a school in a struggling
community, struggling neighborhood, it's very likely that the grades
that those kids get at the end of the school year's going to be lower
than a school with high-income kids. Whereas, that's not necessarily a
reflection om the quality of the school, quality of the teachers,
quality of the administrators of that school. Florida, for instance, two
to one of their assessment on grades is on how the kids did over the
year versus how they perform on a test. So two-thirds of their grade
comes from school improvement. Oklahoma, it's a third of the grade is
growth. Arizona, half the grade is growth. And ours, it's just going to
be an addendum to the grade. And I also ask to have the current schools
graded based on your scale were it to be law today, and 73% of high
schools in North Carolina would get a D or an F under your grading
system. And I just worry that it's too prescriptive on the one hand. ???
All page 10, one point for this, one point for this, one point for this.
I feel like we're interposing ourselves to do the work of the State
Board</p>

<p id="15:00">
Education, they are the education experts. Too prescriptive, and it does
not reflect how well school actually does at improving how kids perform
over that year. So, my question to you is, I appreciate that you have
recognized that student growth is an element that should be reflective,
but can we not somehow I just the formula so that it's more reflective
of Florida, which was the original basis of your legislation.
[speaker changes]
Last year we did indicate that student growth was an important component
of an assessment of any school. I think we had intent language last year
we would go forward with a separate score. The question really is, and
were not ignoring that we’re but basically having one score for how the
students perform. It's basically, it's very much the same as the score
that VPI originally had used, except that they used honor school
excellence, school of distinction. Always done, for the most part, is
translate that scale into A through F. so the question is, is it better
to have a system where you can take a growth factor and use that growth
factor to modify the A through F so that you could take a school where
most of the kids are not passing tests through a growth factor that is a
more subjective analysis than, I would say in many respects, modify a D
grade to a B grade. Move it up to grades to a B grade. I'm not sure that
conveys accurate information to public or the parents. Whereas if you
have two separate scores and you can clearly identify with those two
scores are. You have one score that assesses the student achievement and
you have another score that assesses the growth. You've got some more
accurate and a transparent way of conveying to the parents or the public
how well our schools are performing.
[speaker changes]
Follow up: I disagree that one is any more objective than the other.
Both of them are based on test scores. The growth model is a numerically
driven, statistically based number. The question is, we are grading the
school and the school is either a C school or a D school, and if you
have two schools that have exactly the same performance, where the kids
get the exact same grades, but one school has had a dramatic impact over
the course of the year in advancing a kid from where they started in
sixth grade up to an eighth-grade comprehension, but they have the same
as another school where they just stayed exactly the same. Why we would
have a system that says they are both C schools when one should get
credit for having actually done a really good job that year; objectively
having done a really good job that year. And then there isn't a grade,
under your bill the way it’s drafted, for school growth. It says they
have met, failed to me, or exceeded expected student growth. Your
purpose and going to A to F gives something clear comprehensible to
parents, that doesn't, to me, achieve your goal, as it relates to
student growth. And as I said, Florida, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Mexico,
Louisiana, Mississippi, they all incorporated into the formula that
creates the great in the first place, and I just encourage you to
consider that as you move this bill forward. The follow-up question is,
are you concerned under your model of the bill that 73% of high school…
do you think 73% of high schools in North Carolina are a D or an F
school today?
[speaker changes]
Sen. Stein, I think that the language has been modified, I'll ask staff
to confirm that, but I think the language of the grading assessment has
been modified. I don't think you'll find that that is what the result
will be under the language of the committee substitute.
[speaker changes]
If ??? Wants to come up, they may, at this time.
[speaker changes]
Yes, Sen. ??? Calculation methodology has been revised so that one of
the aspects that is different this time, the grades will reflect the
proportion of students who took the assessment back in 2012</p>

<p id="20:00">
There was equal waiting for things like the science assessment that is
only taken in 3rd and 5th grade, or 5th and 8th grade, now under the new
formula, it would be proportionally weighed so it wouldn’t have an equal
weighting to reading which is taken at the end of every grade, so that’s
one of the changes, another change is that the students in 8th grade who
take biology and algebra and English. There’s over 36000 students who
are taking those traditional high school level classes in the eighth
grade, those scores will now count so that will adjust the outcome.
Another adjustment that has been made is with the students who are
taking the ACT in the 11th grade, the original bill was looking at hoe
many students scored at the benchmark level at all four areas, reading,
English, math and science. The PCS says it will just be reading and math
so that will change the outcome, but we do not have the numbers, because
some of these adjustments were just made, as to how that would effect
the percentages of a, b, c, d, or f.
[speaker changes]
Senator stein, to your point, we’ve tried to listen to what folks have
to say about the bill, about issues relating to the bill and we’ve tried
to adjust. What we’ve found was, with reference to the high school
scores, the ACT test was really squing the results and was ending up
with numbers as you indicated, didn’t appear to us that that was an
accurate reflection of what was going on in the schools. Back to your
first question, it just seems to me that we need to understand that the
A through F is really telling us how well the students in the school are
doing on these test, and so we need to recognize that that is what that
score, that letter grade is for, that’s what it’s always been for, even
when we were again talking about honors school of excellence and school
of distinction and school of priority, it is important that we have
information and convey that information to the public on rather or not
schools are meeting growth goals and that’s the reason we have the
second measure, I actually think, and the bill reflect that a more
accurate delivery of information to the public would have those scores
separated, as opposed to having a situation where you have two schools
where all of the kids score on the test at a C average and yet because
they’ve met a growth goal, we say that that school, as opposed to
another school is an a or a b school where as the students’ scores are
the same at two separate schools where one met growth and one didn’t
meet growth. I think it’s more accurate to give information using two
measures as opposed to one where you combine that information and that’s
what the bill does.
[speaker changes]
For the sake of time, we are going to move on, I have senator berringer,
senator robinson and senator Bryant and then we will move to the public
comment and question session
[speaker changes]
My question has been addressed
[speaker changes]
Thank you senator berringer, I believe senator robinson, you’re next
[speaker changes]
Yes thank you Mr. Chair and thank you senator berriger as well for some
of the modifications. One of the concerns I have if you and I, you’ll
remember that several of us went to Finland a couple of years ago to
look at
[speaker changes]
I was not able to go on that trip
[speaker changes]
[laughter] you really should have gone, it was a good trip and it was a
bi partisan group, but one of the things, several of the things that we
found, led to the high performance, all the way from early intervention
and we have some discussion about that, but in terms of teacher
recruitment that happened early on in high school in terms of those
teachers who had pre-requisites those students who had pre-requisites to
become good teachers and they looked at several factors, not only the
tests, but recommendations and what those things are that would lead to
having good teachers as they moved into and they really are selected,
the end result they are selected to go into that teacher preparation
program, where they are constantly mentored, they go into the teacher
preparation curriculum, they go into schools they spend certain amount
of time etc.
[speaker changes]
May I have a question?
[speaker changes]
Yes, I want to get to my point, I’m getting to it, but the piece that
gets to me licensure, because and I see what you’re putting here.</p>

For the requirements.  If those are indicators, and I think you’re
getting around to some of it in this bill. But if those are indicators
for good teachers, which is an indicator, good student performance.  My
concern is about charter school.  And just the other week we took out
any language about certification and licensure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re on the, this bill--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know I know, I know I know.  But my question is, a lot of the kids
whose parents select out and say they’re not performing in these D-F
schools will go there to charter schools.  So if the licensure is a
requirement here, in this one, and you think that’s important, I do have
some concerns about it not being across the board.  I see the grading
across the board, but then the teacher requirements aren’t across the
board, so I’d like some feedback on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Senator Robinson, with reference to that, you know, charter
schools are in many respects schools of choice.  And so parents can make
decisions based on whether they want their child to attend a charter
school, or whether they want their child to stay in a charter school.
If they feel that the child is not receiving the kind of instruction,
and is not progressing as the child should, the parent can remove the
child from that charter school and go back to the traditional public
schools or to another school.  Children, parents who have no choices,
their children are in the public school based on where they live and no
other factor for the most part.  I think we have a particular
responsibility to look at some of the requirements under those
circumstances, where parents have less choice to make decisions about
where their kids go to school.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, we’re moving, I believe the last ?? we had ?? Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have two questions.  One was, my understanding is, that the ABCDF
system will take effect this, is it, when was it, is it this fall it
will take effect?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’ll take effect based on the scores for this year.  That modification
of the grading scale was based on law that was passed last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.  Thank you Mr. Chair.  Senator Berger, did you consider with
the changes in curriculum, et cetera., that schools are going through
this year, doing some kind of a test run/trial run this year, but having
it become sort of permanently in place, in the next, giving us one more
year to get ready for it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s been requested by a number of people to delay the implementation of
the A through F grading scale.  It was my feeling, and I think the
feeling of a lot of folks, that we need to go forward with that, with
the modifications that are in this bill to try to ameliorate some of the
concerns that you’ve expressed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But I have one more follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Two follow ups.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To Senator Berger and all the staff, I notice that there’s a provision
for, that these actions that will be taken on the teacher contracts and
renewals and non-renewals are to not be discriminatory or retaliatory,
there’s a list of criteria.  I was curious as to how that fits into the
hearing process, and is that what you would have a hearing on in that
process, or how will that be determined.  If I feel that for
discriminatory reasons or retaliatory reasons one of these actions is
taken against me, what are my steps?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, would you try to address that?  Unless Senator Berger wants that
one....??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m not sure I understand the question, because the bill actually
retains career status for all teachers who have career status, through,
I think it’s June 30, 2018.  So, from now until June 30, 2018, those
teachers who have attained career status and don’t opt for a four-year
contract, will retain all of the procedural safeguards that are in
current law.  With reference to any other decisions, I’m not sure that
the bill really addresses anything like that.  I’ll leave it up to
Staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, if you’re asking about teachers under the new system --
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They would be able to request a hearing, this is when the contract is

able to requesting it before the board, it’s in the board’s discretion
whether to grant it and there’s an existing procedure under 115C45 for
hearing before the board that they would be able go through to have the
hearing before the board over the contract. But it’s in the board’s
discretion whether to grant that at the end of a contract. During the
term of the contract, however, there is a formal hearing process under
which the teacher does have the opportunity to have an attorney present,
to have witnesses, etc, and if they go before the board and the board
decides to dismiss or demote them or give them a disciplinary
suspension, there’s a process which they can appeal that to a superior
court. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In fact, as an editorial comment, during the period of the contract, be
it one, two, three, or four years, you have all the protections you
would have in any other situation if you are a career teacher. At the
end of the contract period you may be renewed or not renew and those
protections are subject to review and are gone for the most part and
then you’re offered another contract. Senator Brown. That will be the
last one, I don’t see any other burning question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think where Senator Berger, maybe you can
help me answer this, but it’s hard to manage what you can’t measure. I
think this is a push to start measuring our schools more. I think
there’s pockets in the state, and I think all of us know where,
especially in low wealth areas, where there is some definite need for
help in some of our schools and I think what we’ll find with these
measurements, is we can identify where those needs are the greatest and
start allocating resources to help some of those areas more. I hope that
what will happen. I think that’s the ultimate place we want to be as we
move forward, but we’ve got to identify them before you can figure out
how to help them. I think this is a way where we can identify where the
biggest needs are and start allocating some dollars to bring those
schools up to the levels that are needed to get better across the state.
I always have had concerns that low wealth areas don’t have the same
opportunities as maybe a wealthier LEA would have. But I think this will
allow us to identify that and hopefully put dollars where they’re needed
to change that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Brown. We do have one more question, and this will be
the last one, and we’ll move to the audience. Our plan is today, with
the time as it is, I believe we’ll be able to vote this bill today.
Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize Mr. Pro Tempore for being
tardy, but I assume from reviews, that there is no grandfathering of
existing personnel in the tenure system. Is that…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now, in terms of the contracting side of this, at the conclusion of the
four year period or whatever, there still is an appeal process that’s
identified in the bill for someone who is not...it’s not a matter of not
renewing tenure, but there is a process whereby  someone who would be
tenured is not grandfathered, but can proceed to go through a process to
the board of education to renew their contract. Is that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is my understanding, Senator Hartsell, and I think that is what's
being referred to if a contract’s not renewed, I think there’s a notice
requirement and I think there’s an appeal process that the appeal is to
the school board, but I’ll leave that to staff for sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understood it a little differently, Senator Hartsell, and correct me
if I’m wrong, staff or any of these great legal minds that we’ve got out
there. I understood that when the contract period was up, you were at
will at that moment, whether you come back or not. Now, if I’m wrong,
somebody let me know. That’s the way my contract always worked.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Kara
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, you’re correct. They’d be at will. They do have, the
statute does provide that they can request the board to grant them a
hearing and the board in its discretion can do so and then they follow
under the general judicial process of the board to have hearings for
employment issues at that point for the process for that hearing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we were both wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then is the hearing on a contract renewal or...</p>

For a contract termination. That's, that's what I'm. Cara, do you want
to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The hearing would be on the recommendation to non-renew the contract.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that's at the end of the contract term. For contracts that are, if
there was a move to terminate the contract mid-contract for dismissal or
demotion, that is a different process then at the end of the contract.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Entirely. Thank you for the good questions, Senator, and the thoughtful
bill that we have before us. And at this time, we have, I believe now,
three people that have signed up, and I'm gonna go in order. Dr. Mark
Edwards, superintendent of the year, Mooresville Grade School. It's
Iredell in one part of the county and ?? in the other. You're from
Iredell, aren't you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm from Mooresville and Iredell County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's Iredell up there. Okay go right ahead, Dr. Edwards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. It's an honor to be with you, and I want to thank
chairman Tillman and also Senator Soucek. Senator Berger, I want to
thank you and I want to also call on our common experience from
Danville, Virginia, and some of our, what we've learned together. I also
want to thank Senator Rucho for visiting Mooresville earlier, and also
our hometown Senator, Senator Curtis, who is a Mooresville High School
graduate. So again it's an honor to be with you. I want to commend
Senator Berger for focusing attention from the state on education. And
the ID and understand that we can build the best education system in the
United States of America, one of the best in the world. I also want to
acknowledge and thank all parties in terms of fine tuning the bill, and
making the bill a bill that will work for all students, all schools, and
all communities. I really believe that we have the, we have the
ingredients in the state of North Carolina within our existing school
systems and within the infrastructure of our government to build the
best in the nation. Now I'd like to call to the attention, to the
committee that just this week, a national journal came out with an
article says the best district in America. And it's referencing
Mooresville, North Carolina. And the thing that I ?? here, and I know it
sounds self-serving, but I truly believe this. I believe that we can use
the same ingredients and build the best education system in the nation.
In fact, I am absolutely convinced. But I would suggest a few things.
One, I truly believe that building an infrastructure to make this work
requires time and requires fine tuning, and it's essential that we build
that fine tuning, and I believe that it's an, we're not there yet. I
really believe we need to fine tune it. I see the fine tuning taking
place, Senator Berger, right now, but we need some more time to build on
that to make it work so that we have the infrastructure for all schools
to be successful and build on current successes. And I would ask that we
continue to work on this, and I want to volunteer my services, Senator
Berger, to work directly with you to use the framework we've used in
Mooresville to build on this and to make it work. I truly believe that
we need to include a growth component. I truly believe that we are under
the most, the huge changes with our assessment program that we are not
prepared for yet, with all the changes with common core, the realignment
of the state. But I would plead to have the opportunity to work directly
with you, and I believe that we can build the best program in the
nation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dr. Edwards, if you'll just make sure that I or members of my staff have
your contact information, we'd be more than happy to set up an
appointment with you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, and next to speak would be Jackie Cole, who I met
earlier, from the Board of Education, and Board of Education member,
Alamance County.
,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. My name is Jackie Cole, and I'm a member of the
Alamance-Burlington Board of Education and a board member of the North
Carolina School Boards Association. As a lifelong Republican, I join and
applaud Senator Berger in his efforts to improve public education for
the 1.5 million children that are served by our public schools across
the state. We have seen growth in our school system, but there is much
left to be done. The intent of this legislation is good, however, there
are two pieces that while I agree with in concept, I think need to be
altered slightly. I believe that most of the 775 school board members
across the state would agree with me. First, while school board members
voted three years ago to add eliminating career status to the statewide
association's legislative agenda, it was with a caveat that all teachers
who had earned career status and those employed with the understanding
they would have the opportunity to earn it would be grandfathered.
Grandfathering does not mean that we could not get rid of poor teachers,
but merely that we would afford them the same due process that a teacher
would</p>

<p id="40:00">
that under this bill if terminated mid-contract. This is important for
two reasons. One, without grandfathering of those who have already
earned it, it has been shared with us that a lawsuit is likely to be
filed against either the state, a local school board, or both. Two, the
morale among teachers is already low, and elimination of career status
has the significant risk of continuing to demoralize the very
professionals we want to be excited about the coming year and coming to
school everyday to educate and nurture our students.
The second area of concern is the A through F grading of our schools.
State-wide, the majority of school board members do not oppose letter
grading. We want to be accountable and transparent to the public,
however the language in last year’s budget bill stated that it is the
intent of the General Assembly to add a student growth component to
school performance grades. The education community believe that this
meant it would be incorporated into the grade and not be a separate
measure.  I want to share two concerns with you about having it built
in. One, without a growth component, the letter grade, the goal of
schools, becomes trying to get children to a three. That means that your
high achieving students and your lowest performing students, those at a
level one, may receive less attention and effort due to limited
resources. The high achievers. Thank you, I appreciate your attention
and regret I couldn’t finish my statement, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’ll finish it with me right after the meeting. I got a start on it a
while ago. Very well. Sorry about the time folks, but we want to finish
the business today and the next and last comment from the audience would
be from Rodney Ellis, president of the NCAE.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, members of the Senate Education Committee, thank you for
the opportunity to address this committee. I’d also like to thank
Senator Berger for the opportunity he’s given NCAE to work with this
staff and offer detailed feedback on this important bill. As we have
shared with Senator Berger, NCAE is concerned about Senate Bill 361 and
we ask the Senate Committee to oppose it in its current form. We believe
that this legislation as currently drafted is not the most efficient way
to handle the dismissal of presumed ineffective teachers in our
classrooms. NCAE has a history of working with the General Assembly to
ensure that there is an efficient way to dismiss deemed ineffective
while protecting the best and brightest teachers from arbitrary
dismissal. Two years ago, NCAE stood before this committee and asked
that you support a bill by Senator Jerry Tillman that expedites the
dismissal of underachieving career status teachers in our classrooms. We
shared with you two years ago that enacting Senator Tillman’s bill would
give administrators every tool they needed to in dismissal cases. You
passed the legislation as did the house, but we have done nothing to
require administrators in our school system to actually use the law. Now
we stand before you and we are debating another career status reform
bill. A bill that fails to give due process rights to a teacher whose
contract expires without renewal. This proposed legislation fails to
grandfather teachers who currently have career status, a property right
we are confident will be protected by our courts. We submit that if the
North Carolina Senate concentrated on the implementation of the current
law, a law that the North Carolina school administrators endorses, that
the North Carolina School Board endorses, then true reform could occur.
Even with a grandfathering provision that makes the bill illegal, we are
disappointed that teachers would lose all rights to present witnesses,
use of counsel, or other other advocates, or provide appeals of
evaluations. Teachers believe after four years of service to the state,
they deserve the right to hear why they’re being dismissed and they
deserve the right to present evidence in their defense. NCAE does not
believe that teachers have the right to a job for life if they have
career status, but they do deserve a right to defend their performance.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Rodney. And on the bill you’re referring to, that was Senator
Hartsell and my bill and I regret to say that school systems did not do
a good job of implementing that or training their principals how to
carry out that bill. Had that happened, folks, we may not be needing the
legislation we’ve got now. However, I think they forgot about that law
as soon as it was passed. I didn’t see anybody do an inservice training
on that to implement the law and the intent of that law. But today we’re
talking about our bill in front of us. Senator Berger has done a good
job and Senator Parman we will take your comments since I know you’ve to
ask this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chairman, if I may, I would like to ask Mr. Ellis a question.
If I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m going permit that, but we’re going to stop that because we’ve had
the comment from the...but I’m going to permit this and this will be the
last one and then we’ll vote the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Ellis, if you could, could you explain to
us how poor performing teachers</p>

currently be dismissed today. Mr chair with your leave i would like to
yield to our in house internee Anne McCall, to respond to the question.
Go ahead we'll do this but folks make it brief we have a 3 minute time
again. Anne McCall. Thank you thank you for the opportunity to address
the committee. I would like to very briefly describe my background. I've
been in education law for twenty-two years began as a 24 school board
since my role has been in the process of assisting school systems in
working with teachers that are looking for dismissal so in terms of the
tools that are currently available we are currently available we
currently have a wide range of tools that we use we use an evaluation
system that has continued to improve over time we have a number of
different source of action plans that we can use and we have a refined
process that provides and opportunity for hearing. These are the things
that Lori finds with the excellent school scat then was refined again
two years ago. What i found as an attorney working with school systems
and dismiss teachers we can make those things happen we are looking for
a balance that also insures that teachers can be strong applicants for
kids, and that means having enough job protection. They feel like they
can speak out on the things that they seen in heir school system. Thank
you we will stop at that, i could ask a question on how many teachers
were actually dismissed. they had low career status and i know that's a
low figure. I do know there was more resignations for Angara that the
way you do it is that you get the resignations before going that route
so those statistics aren't really that reliable. you don't look at just
those numbers that were terminated, gone before they were terminated. So
at this point senator Burger do you want to rap up comment and were
going to take a motion at that time and i have one and ready here. Mr.
chairman i would like to think the committee again to present the bill
also i would like to thank the members who have made comments, and would
reiterate that at that time and i know that members of the senate,
members of my staff look forward to work with the public and public
school teachers, with their representatives and with other interested
parties. Trying to make North Carolina schools the best they can be and
i think that this bill moves them into the right direction i appreciate
the favor we will vote. At this time Senator Russo. Yes sir Mr.
chairman. I would like to make a motion for favor report. The pcs or 361
an unfavorable to the regular bill the motion is unfavorable to pcs and
is mended to before you. Any discussion all in favor I. any opposed no.
The I's have it the bill passes. I believe there will be a referral to
preparations to senator burger that's where we will go next Thank you.</p>
