<p id="00:00">
&lt;h3&gt;Seats. Audience will quiet down. Apologize for being five
minutes late, you know I don't like to do that but we had a little, few
things to take care of. Thank you. Today we have two pages. Let me find
out where they are over here. To our right MK Sap, appreciate you
coming, Representative Blust's sponsor. And Alan Whittifield, is that
right Alan? Appreciate you being here. Representative Tillis, Speaker
Tillis should say.  We have a pretty full agenda let me introduce our
Sergeant at Arms today, Reggie Lightnin Sios. Larry Boom Boom Elliot,
where's Larry at. And then I've got certainly last bit not least, Fred
The Hitman Hynes. Thank you Fred, thank you guys for being here. Got a
pretty full agenda today guys so we're going to get started pretty
quick. Going to keep everything tight. We're going to try to get the
whole agenda if possible. First up, actually I have Senator Newton, I
apologize, Senator Newton is up first. In a simple transmission line
ownership bill. Senator Newton do you have a PCS on that or is that
just? Good. Senator Newton, the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's see if we can get this on, everybody can hear me ok, thank you Mr.
Chairman. Members of the committee I appreciate being here today. This
is tongue in cheek a simple bill. as the chairman indicated it's not
really simple at all. But the idea is simple. What this bill does is
designed to keep things the way it is in North Carolina right now about
transmission line ownership and building. The federal energy regulatory
commission had a ruling for 1000 a couple of years back or a little
while back that essentially is changed the way the dynamic works here
and how it would affect North Carolina. It would allow third parties to
come in and build transmission and other transmission lines. When I
first looked at this I thought well this is a great idea…this will
inject some new competition, all that. Why would we want to change
anything? But when I examined it even further I could find no advantage
whatsoever to North Carolina or North Carolina rate payers. And so I
ended up doing a 180 and coming down in the direction of this bill which
is designed to keep things exactly the way it is which is to say that
our utilities, our utility commission controls and oversees and
regulates are the ones that would build an iron transmission line. I
think that's as simply as I can explain this bill, I'm happy to answer
questions, I understand that there is an amendment and not being a
member of the Committee I can't offer it. I understood that there was a
Representative who had agreed to run it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll recognize Representative Dockhand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman I do have an amendment but I'm sorry the staff…I
think they are going to give it out right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, let us go ahead and go to a question or two until they can get it
out. Any questions from the committee? Any debate? Representative
Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Give me an example of when someone that wasn't a
public utility authority would run a transmission line.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under the firk ruling, they're looking at regional transmission. And the
third party, somebody other than Duke, or Dominion or currently
progress, or one of our electrical coops or others who are not utilities
in North Carolina under federal regulations could be deemed the
appropriate party to build and own the transmission line. It may not
even directly serve the customers in North Carolina. It may be going
through North Carolina say from Virginia across North Carolina or
Tennessee for example. Depending on what the need was, and the sense
with that would be your example.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, thank you Senator for bringing this bill before us
today. Just a real short quick question here. In regards to the in the
short title where it says that only incumbent providers may construct a
new electricity transmission line, are there any aspects of this bill
that will prevent a new public utility being applied for and then to be
able to construct a transmission line or is this language basically that
anybody who currently is a public utility could only do that and does it
reserve any for those in the future?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p id="05:00">
Thank you Representative Mills (sic). That's an excellent question and I
appreciate that. That issue has been discussed quite a lot on the Senate
side of this. And it is not my intent in this bill and it's not my
understanding from all of the work that we've done with staff that this
bill would prevent any new company from becoming a public utility in
North Carolina and then being eligible to do that. But they would have
to go through the steps of becoming a public utility here and of course
subject themselves to the regulation of our utilities commission in
order to do that.
[Speaker change]
I'm going to Representative Dockham real quick. I think that everyone
has the amendment in front of them. Representative Dockham please
present the amendment and tell us a little bit about it.
[Speaker change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Actually Mr. Chairman's staff asked me to do
this. It just moves to amend the bill on page 1, line 27 by deleting the
word cooperative and substituting the word corporation. And on page 2,
line 7 deleting the word capability and substituting the compatibility.
So it's just purely technical in nature. I move for the adoption of the
amendment.
[Speaker change]
Thank you Representative Dockham. Senator Newton would you like to
comment on it?
[Speaker change]
I just concur with Representative Dockham. It is purely technical and
correcting some typos. And I hope the committee will adopt it.
[Speaker change]
Any questions on this purely technical amendment? ?? All in favor. All
opposed? Amendment is adopted. Representative Warren
[Speaker change]
Just a question for the bill sponsor. Right here sir, to your left.
[Speaker change]
To my left?
[Speaker change]
Right here. Further left
[Speaker change]
Right beside Representative Samuelson
[Speaker change]
You're like most of us here ??
[Speaker change]
I knew the voice but I just couldn't find you
[Speaker change]
I did(??) really have a question to you to give your example of a
utility maybe coming through the state to go to the other side. Would
that mean, under this bill that they would have to contract with a
state-based utility to run that line through?
[Speaker change]
They would not, if I understand it correctly, and I think that is a good
question. If staff, Heather, if I say something wrong, I don't know
where she went but I hope someone will correct me. I think that they
would, the building of the transmission lines in North Carolina would
have to be done by a North Carolina utility.
[Speaker change]
So if I were a utility in Tennessee and wanted to come through the
northwestern part of North Carolina to construct a line going up to
Virginia, I would have to, once I get to North Carolina state line, have
to contract with a North Carolina based utility?
[Speaker change]
Ms ??
[Speaker change]
I believe what the question may be, is why is the Tennessee Utility
trying to build a line in our state? But I do think you're correct. I
think that they couldn't build a line in the state. If they were going
to build a line in the state they would have to use a North Carolina
utility. However, they could transmit over lines in North Carolina now.
So the question would be, why would this out of state utility be
constructing and not using the current lines?
[Speaker change]
I really couldn't tell you. I was just building on his example
[Speaker change]
Thank you. Representative Samuelson
[Speaker change]
Thank you Mr. Chair. A couple questions, and then I guess a comment. It
goes back to the comment about the utility, and you may be able to
answer this: when you say that there is nothing that would stop anyone
from becoming a new utility, I thought that the rules were that you
could become a new utility, but because of the territorial piece (I'm
using the word 'territorial' but there may be some legal term for it)
but the territorial piece, or of the service area
may be a better way to say it, the service area piece of the utilities
that even if you could go through the all the process to become
licensed, if you were going to be in the service area of an existing
utility you couldn't operate as a, you couldn't become a utility?
[Speaker change]
Staff?
[Speaker change]
You're correct. I think that the way the utilities commission, they
refer to as a franchise area, and so the idea would be: you don't apply
to be a public utility, you are within the definition of public utility
or not. And it is true that the incumbent providers and their franchise
area would basically make it impossible for there to be a new public
utility. And so... But, however, I think what a lot of the confusion
about this bill is, is what is the definition of 'public utility?' And
what definition applies to which statute? And so I think that there is a
way to allow non-incumbent providers and to find them as a utility for a
very limited way. And that is not what this bill does. But there is a
way to draft in a way that would that, that doesn't affect the franchise
areas or the overall definition of public utility.
[Speaker change]
And part of my follow-up will be a procedural question for the Chair.
Because my understanding is House Bill 8-18, that originally was a study
of regulation of ?? has now been changed.</p>

<p id="10:00">
...this gets into a more comprehensive energy policy study; is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES-MALE] There hasn't been a change in anything yet,
Representative Samuelson.
Representative Samuelson: I'll make my comment. It seems to me that
while I agree with sort of what you're trying to do, there are a lot of
unanswered questions that go to the fact that we need to study our whole
energy policy in North Carolina. A lot has come up on some of the bills,
you know, picking winners and losers, is it free market or is it
regulated?; in this case, is it a utility, or is it not a utility? I
guess part of me, I guess I would like to ask if you would consider
rolling something like this either into that study that I think is
coming up, or another study, and allow us to look at it and really come
up with an idea that addresses, clearly addresses, the concerns that you
have, rather than taking a shot at it and not really being sure. Even
the bullet points on the summary about the risks that came from the
change in the FERC order are things that we can look at and bring it
back for the short session. I don't think it would be long between now
and then, particularly if they knew the study was under way. We could
include that as part of the study.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Representative Samuelson, I appreciate that,
and I really appreciate that this is a very complex area. It took me
quite a bit of study to feel like I got my mind wrapped around it,
mostly, [chuckles], and tried to look at it from every angle of the
positives and the negatives, and what concerns me is that right now,
with the FERC ruling, North Carolina, in my view, has no control over
this process going forward, unlike what we have had to this point, and
so I don't want to be in a position that I don't know what's out there
is a potential where the FERC approves building the transmission lines,
site selection, and so forth, that North Carolina then is stuck with it
and has no benefit from it.
There are certainly arguments to be made all the way around. I would
feel more comfortable going ahead and if I filed a bill now and felt
like we knew that we needed to do something. I'd rather pass the bill
now and continue to study it and change this law, if this is not serving
out needs.
What most concerns me is that we are looking out for the North Carolina
rate payer. And I think that while there's arguments that could be made
on both sides, we don't have a free-market energy market anyway. We all,
everybody on this committee, understands that very well, and so really
the best question is, how are we going to best manage that?
And I guess the simplest way I can put it is that know that what we had
working up to this point seemed to be working well, I thought there was
much greater risk to changing it and doing something else, until we had
a better handle on it. And so that's why I put this bill forward.
The Chairman: Thanks, and it is the Chair's intention to take a vote on
this today. Representative Dollar.
Representative Dollar: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I think this will be a quick question, but Senator, is it fair or
accurate to say that the base power generating companies, along with the
co-ops, the electric cities, as well as the major power groups,
everybody, in other words, is on board with this bill; is that correct?
[BILL SPONSOR] Yes, certainly the first groups that you said. The only
folks that I know are having problems with the bill are what we would
term as third-party companies who have expressed the potential of
wanting to come back and, I don't know when, possibly coming in here for
work, and they're not enthusiastic about the bill. I'm trying to be as
fair about it as I can [chuckles].
The Chairman: Representative West.
Representative West: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Following up on that question, there's a lot of TVA generation out in
the west. Would that mean that the TVA could not construct their own
lines out there anymore?
[BILL SPONSOR] Representative, I can't answer that specifically. I'm
hoping staff could. I would answer it in the simplest way of saying that
whatever they have been able to do, at this point, I believe that will
still be able to do under this bill. And if I'm wrong about that, I'm
hoping Loretta [??] will help me out.
Representative Samuelson: I do think you're correct. I would like to
follow up with Commission staff -- I know they're here -- to confirm the
answer, because I'd have to have a specific answer to that question.
[BILL SPONSOR] What staff did you say?</p>

<p id="20:00">
...a utility to do it is 161 megawatts, it should be in your summary.
It’s a pretty high amount of energy. A pretty large volume. Much larger,
I think, than anything that can possibly be done by a rooftop. There was
some initial concern raised by some of the wind farm type folks that
they might not be able to build their lines to where they need a
substation. Since that first came up, I’ve not heard from them again of
any issues. I can only, and I’m not speaking for them, but I surmise
from that that they determined the level was high enough it wasn't’
going to affect any of their projects. If I’m wrong about that, I really
would have thought I would have heard from them again. It’s not our
intent to prevent a solar or wind renewable energy type generation from
being able to build the line to hookup to the substation to put it on
the grid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A question for the sponsor. What are the
benefits in this bill, or concerns, to the North Carolina citizens
versus open market construction? That’s what I’m having trouble
understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Representative Catlin...is it Catlin or
Katlin, I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He’ll answer to about anything.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I’m trying to get it right. Thank you, Representative. Your
question goes to the heart of where I was on this first, when I first
became aware of this situation and started looking into it. Being that
we’re not in a free market, we’re in a controlled, regulated...the
utilities are in essences monopolies, regulated monopolies. My concern
was the ratepayer. The benefits of the current scenario of where we’re
currently regulated, which is what this bill would continue, is that the
Utilities Commission has control over the site selection and the manner.
It can also do things such as if the transmission lines are not being
maintained for reliability, for safety. They can enforce that and they
can force these companies to spend money to upgrade the these systems as
needed. Under the other scenario, if we don’t have it, they don’t have
that ability. We even potentially have the risk that lines can be built
and after a period of time, perhaps when investments have recouped, they
can been abandoned because they don’t want to pay the money to upgrade
it. That’s what I was getting at about I just couldn’t find any
advantages to the North Carolina ratepayer to allow the federal scheme
to go forward without North Carolina regulation. Everywhere, because I
started out where I think you are which is, why wouldn’t we want more
people? I just couldn’t...when I really, objectively analyzed it, I
couldn’t find that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions, comments? Anybody with a motion? Representative
Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is not a PCS, right? Just as amended? Is there a referral? I move
for a favorable report on Senate Bill 635 as amended.

Thank you, Representative Martin. You’ve heard the motion, all in favor
say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.

The opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. Thank you, Senator Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Thank you, committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next we’re going to hear Senate Bill 430, I think. Let me make sure I
get this right, Representative McElraft. Mac and cheese, I think, what’d
you say? Representative, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Reluctant to say this is a simple bill before this committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those darn engineers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those darn engineers. Senate Bill 430 is Senator Brown’s bill. He asked
me to carry this today. It just puts clarifying language in the statutes
that says no permits are needed to continue the electric load control
process. It’s been going on for forty years with our public utilities,
electric coops and electric cities. They’ve been doing this process for
putting in these electric load control devices for over forty years now
and this clarifies in the statutes that no permits are needed. I’ll be
happy to answer...</p>

the, the activity, and it just, there's no real rationale. And all the
companies that have lost this over the years have survived. I don't see
any company that's gone out of business because they did they're,
they're rebate was cut or eliminated. I just think it's bad public
policy to allow it and I just hope we would think about it, maybe on the
floor I'll even offer an amendment to think that through. So, thank you
members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Leubke. Representative
Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. For the bill sponsor, just to
make sure we're clear on this. The surcharge itself is set by the
commission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So the company doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But they would be able to retain 1% of that total,
whatever the amount would be for the number of customers, and the like.
They would simply be able to retain that as a, basically a processing
fee, the hold-back like they used to be able to do for sales tax. And I
guess my quest-. You're shaking your head yes. And just one more, sort
of, follow one question to that, and that is, you said this is similar
to what other providers are currently able to do. Because my only
question is, if you're gonna be able to do this it should be equitable
across the, you know, maybe a variety or a class of providers that are
doing similar. So that no one is particularly advantaged or
disadvantaged in one way or the other.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, and, and really what this bill does is make that
equitable across the entire plane, for the, for the surcharge fee as
well as the 1%. Wireless companies are the only companies that are
currently able to retain the 1% administrative fee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Brown. Any further questions,
comments from the committee? Representative Geeter you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to make a motion for a favorable report to
the PCS for House Bill 598, unfavorable to the original with a serial
referral to Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Geeter, you've all heard the
motion, those in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Those opposed. Thank you, thank you Representative
Brown, you uh.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. Thank you members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, we will now, we'll let Representative
Warren come up and chair and I'm, we're gonna move to House Bill 476.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe we have a PCS on this one, is [inaudible].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a motion from Representative West to accept a
PCS, all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed say no. We have the PCS before us.
Representative Hager, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Let me just give you a brief
history of how we got to where we are on this as, as you guys know the
current underground utility process, and I call it a process and use
that word loosely, has just kind of evolved over time. We've had several
issues with the, with folks database hurt and, and we've had several
deaths through the years because of a lack of a contained process. And
one that can be verified, one that can be approved on. What we did last
year is we put together a team of industry folks that came together for
about seven or eight months and developed a new process. We had buy in
from all the utilities. We had buy in from just about everybody that
uses the process that we could think of. And of the two simple
requirements out there, that we create a process that was documented and
safe. But we didn't create a process that was so huge, that was such a
huge beurocracy that it was gonna cost a lot of money and no one could
use it. So what you have, what you have before you is that product. Now
what I would like to do is recognized staff, Mr. Chairman, to explain
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff, you're recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What this bill does is, the first section is to repeal
the existing Underground Damage Protection Act, and the second section
is to introduce an entirely new act. The act builds on a lot of the work
that was done by the prior act, the current act. One of the things that
industry had done was to get together and form a notification center.
North Carolina 811. So what this does, is it codifies that to put that
into statute, to require that the utility owners join the notification
center to provide notice to the excavators when, when a project is
planned. The utility owners are required to join the notification
center. They're staggered based, based on the size of the utilities.
They are also required to provide a, uh, temporary markings as well as
any other information to the excavator within a set period of time,
based on when they received notification from the excavator that he
plans to dig. There are various provisions that would exempt some very
small storm water facilities, and, from joining the notification center.
The notif-, a new process would be that the notification center</p>

required to alert the utilities of a request from a design engineer,
such as an architect or engineer.  They would be required to either
provide the same markings as they would for an excavator, or to provide
the best available description of the facilities, or to allow the design
professional to inspect drawings or other records for the facilities in
the area where the design is occurring.  There are also responsibilities
for the excavators.  They're required to give between 3 and 12 working
days worth of notice before they dig, depending on the type of work that
is planned.  There are special procedures for emergency excavation, and
there are responsibilities for when damage occurs as an excavator digs.
As I mentioned, this allows for design professionals to request
information on the location of the facilities.  There are also some
exemptions that are similar to the ones in the current law.  Home
owners, who are under certain circumstances are not required to notify.
Agricultural uses, such as tilling, is not required to notify, and
certain governmental entities operating in areas that don't have any
utility right-of-ways would not be required to notify.  This also adds
an enforcement provision.  There are civil penalties, and the Office of
the State Fire Marshall is authorized to investigate violations, and
that about sums it up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman, we'll go straight to question.
 One thing I did want to say is I received a letter from the federal DOT
folks within the last few days, stating that if we didn't clean this
process up on their end, that they would do it for us, so this was kind
of preemptive, we didn't know the letter was coming, but it was kind of
timely, so with that, Mr. Chairman, I'd entertain any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Staff, thank you for presenting the bill.
Representative Hager will open up to committee members.  Any questions
of the bill's sponsor?  Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, yes, a question for the sponsor.  Does this
provide any higher level of protection for the contractor than before?
I'm mean, you'd get the information on where the utilities where, but if
it was wrong and you broke a gas line, you know, that was still your
fault.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I thing, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Go right ahead sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Catlin, thank you.  I think you'll
appreciate this.  It does, it standardizes the marking on the ground.
Here to for we had different markings according to what utility you were
working in, according to which part of the country you were in, so this
standardizes all those, so anybody who goes after anybody, whether it's
a surveyor, contractor, or just somebody wanting to know what's there as
you're digging, can find out exactly what's there by the markings.  So
it does standardize that.  And if something does happen, it includes a
root cause analysis process that the fire marshals already been trained
to do, so they'll be able to root cause analysis to determine who was at
fault, was it the markings, was it the contractor, what exactly was it.
But then it assesses penalties, it goes to a utility commission to be
able to assess penalties other than that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Luebke, did you have your hand up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  I wonder if staff would talk or meet with
us about the notification center.  It's not clear to me what role it
plays and how powerful it is in the whole process, or is it just a place
where one deposits information, but nothing happens to the information?
Can you talk about that. please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Staff?  Mr, Lipford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Certainly.  The notification center is a facility that
has been in existence for some time now.  Sometimes it's call NC-811
under the current system.  It is a depository of information, and it
also transmits information between the utility and the excavators.  What
the notification center is required to do is to take calls and
notifications from the excavators, it will then determine which
utilities need to be notified to go out and to provide the markings or
any other information.  They're also, under this bill, required to
provide a positive response system whereby the excavators can
essentially phone in to find out if the utilities have already been
marked at the locations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Luebke, Mr. Chairman, they're pretty
much the clearing house.  They are the central location where everything
goes.  And that was part of the deal, we wanted, actually everybody,
before this bill was adopted, everybody will have to go through 811.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up, Representative Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, follow up.  I'm not understanding why, I
appreciate the explanation for what it is, and why is it, and they
stated explicitly in here that this is not a government agency.  I'm not
finding the right place right now, but it seems to be out there, in
outer space, or limbo somehow.  It doesn't seems to be a state agency.
How can it be out there and not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Staff</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Part of Utilities Commission, state aid, etcetera.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The notification center’s already been established and
it’s a standing non-profit that is operated by utility owners. I believe
the intent was to continue to allow it to exist in it’s current state
but to require it to provide these, required by statute to provide these
services.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And a quick follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So who pays for the operation of the notification
center?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Currently the notification center is paid for by the
utility operators at the end of the year they assess a fee based on how
many location requests they got for every utility. Just for example,
Duke Energy will have much more requests than a small local water system
so they pay a larger share.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chair recognizes there are no other questions. Chair’s
open for a motion. From anyone. Representative Millis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I make a motion for a favorable
report of House Bill 476.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A favorable motion to the PCS on favorable to the
original, is that what I heard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is exactly what you’ve heard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Members, you have the motion before
you all. In favor please signify by saying “Aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Those opposed say “No”. The ayes have it and that
concludes the agenda for today. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, we don’t have time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.</p>
