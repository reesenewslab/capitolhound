<p id="00:00">
…those of you who were here last session may remember this bill. We
passed it in the Senate and didn’t get it in the House in time to act on
it before adjournment.  If you take your car or your truck in to have it
serviced or repaired the mechanic gets a lien on the car for the work
they do and until you have paid what they, what you owe them they can
hold onto your car or your truck. If you disagree with them about the
amount of money that you owe them or the work was not done that you
wanted to have done and they’re holding your car, you have a way to get
it back and that is to pay into the Clerk of Court the amount that’s in
dispute, the amount of the mechanic claims in dispute. So you can get
the car back and then you fight about the money, interesting enough, if
it’s an airplane there’s no way to get it back while you fight and
that’s a pretty expensive proposition to have an aircraft grounded and
just sitting out there for, well a lawsuit takes several months in
court, so what the bill does is it provides a similar procedure for
aircraft when there’s a mechanic’s lien asserted against an airplane and
the owner disputes the lien or disputes the amount of the lien they can
post a bond with the Clerk of Court and recover possession and then they
fight about the proceeds in front of the court. That’s what the bill
does. You might ask why did we do it with a bond rather than a cash
deposit, it’s because the amount, you think about it, the amount of
money that’s going to be in controversy for an aircraft is going to be
an awful lot larger than the amount of money for my car or your car so
we used a bonding requirement, a maturity bond, rather than a cash
deposit. That’s the only reason for the difference. Mr. Chairman there
is a technical amendment the staff identified about the effective date
that I also need to run.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does everyone have a copy of that technical amendment before you? OK.
Would you explain your technical amendment please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, staff tells me that’s correct, needed in order to get the correct
citation in reference to the general statutes of which this a part.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, questions about the amendment? Seeing none.
All in favor of the amendment please say “aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed nay. Ayes have it, amendment passes and then we have before
you Senate Bill 84 as amended. Questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I’ve owned an airplane and I also have seen Senator
Clodfelter’s car and his car is worth far more than my airplane so I
took offense to that statement but thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, they held my car one time and the only way I could get out
was with a payday loan. I move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, after that words of wisdom from Senator Tillman we move for a
favorable report on Senate Bill 84 as amended. Any further discussion?
Seeing none. All in favor please say “aye.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed nay. Ayes have it. Thank you, Senator Clodfelter. Alright,
let’s move forward to Senate Bill 97, Senator Goolsby, property tax
de-annexation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And you all thought we were done with annexation. This is actually one
of the results of annexation in my local city of Wilmington. Had the
mayor and the city council come to me a few weeks ago and say that…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, I’m sorry, I apologize, we have a proposed committee
substitute before us, Senator Brock makes a motion that we accept the
proposed committee substitute for Senate Bill 97 for discussion, sorry.
Senator Goolsby please move forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They simply said they did not wish to levy the tax on the annexed areas
during that short period of annexation. The bills have not been sent
out; there’s been no move to collect this. This is a bill that releases
the city from its obligation to collect that tax. Senator Newton? I’m
sorry. Senator Newton has a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Senator Goolsby. If I understand it
right, it’s six months back?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would this cover all of the municipalities, all the areas that were
de-annexed in our legislation last time or just your area? Just my area.
Some of those areas have collected taxes, some of them have billed,
there have been payments by some of them. My area has not and we are
trying to keep from spending the money to send out the bills. The city
doesn’t wish to do it; the city is the mover on this. The municipality
does not wish to collect this tax and they just are simply seeking a
release from their obligation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, would you be, as I get a chance to look at this more
closely, would you be willing to consider…</p>

For that airport to be the success that it is and actually go beyond
that. There is another component of this that requires additional
leadership and knowledge and expertise, because there is an
[inter-modal] park over there that has been established, that will
openly be the inland port for the [part] Eastern seaboard, especially in
the Southeast. Which means all cargo traffic will end up in and through
Charlotte, and out to the rest of the country. And that is going to be
very important for us, and it is very exciting news for North Carolina
to have that kind of facility in place. That being said, Miss Averet,
would you be kind enough to explain the bill briefly. I know it's been
discussed already. Sorry, Mister Chairman, if staff would help us with
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Cindy and I will proceed. I'll talk about
the general revisions. If there are any finance questions Cindy will
answer. The bill establishes the Charlotte regional airport authority,
under a constitutional provision article 6, section 1, that authorizes
the general assembly to give such powers and duties to county, cities,
towns and other governmental sub-divisions as it may deem it advisable.
Chapter 63 of the general statutes authorizes counties and cities to own
and operate airports or set up joint management agencies. However, most
of the larger airports in the state, and many of the smaller size, are
actually run by airport authorities established by a local act and then
given the powers, the general powers, to actually operate airports. This
bill sets up an appointment structure, gives the airport general powers
to operate the airport, and then has a catch-all authorizing all the
general powers to authorize airport. It directs the city of Charlotte to
convey all the airport property within 90 days of after an enactment of
the act, with some caveats there in section 7B. Section 7C is changed
from the prior version of the bill as explained, in terms of imminent
domain, to exercise that the authority will have to have the approval of
the majority of the eight local governments that appoint members. But
must be used only for airport purposes, not for hotels, motels,
restaurants, or industrial park. The authorities are directed to make
annual reports to the appointing authorities, and enter into contracts
with other political subdivision of the state to administer it. The
appointments are set out in the bill - on the bottom of page one and the
top of page two - as to how it's to be appointed. I'd like to answer any
questions, and Cindy will answer any that relate to the finance side.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The bill itself does not
address this issue, but the practical aspect of transferring the
ownership and management of the airport from the city to an authority,
is the fact that there are some outstanding revenue bonds - over $800
million of outstanding revenue bonds issued by the city of Charlotte.
From all the discussions that I have had - and there are people far
smarter than me in the room on this - it's not that it cannot be done.
It can be done. Practically how would it be accomplished? That decision
is subject to various judgements and opinions, and from a best-case
scenario of a bond counsel saying that this is an administrative change,
that there would be no harm to the bond holders, and that the consent of
the bond holders under the current covenant are not required-- that
would be the best-case scenario. To the absolute worse-case scenario
being that the current bonds needed to be recalled and new bonds issued.
That last worse-case scenario would be more expensive, a little over
$700 million of these bonds cannot be recalled until 2015, so they - as
I understand - the terminology would have to be advanced refunded.
Meaning the money would have to be put into some escrow for a period of
time. So, if you had the worse-case scenario it would involve a lot more
cost, but-- and to get a definitive answer on how it would be
accomplished I have not found one yet. But that goes from the best to
the worse case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, does the committee have copies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe they do sir. And I'll have...who's going to
explain the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. ?? would you like to speak to the amendment,
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll just ask that the amendment be explained by Miss
Averet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment just insures that in addition to the
assets and liabilities that would be transferred from the city to the
authority, that any other types of agreement.</p>

…May have entered into or in conferences regardless of whether or not
they have been recorded would be assumed by the authority so if there is
any outstanding development agreements that pertain to the Airport
Authority that the city of Charlotte has entered into someone that the
authority would have to honor those agreements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, is there any discussions on the amendment? If not we will
vote on the amendment, all those in favor please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All oppose no, amendment case…Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As you can see this provides a regional approach to this, there has to
be regional bind because it is an asset that exceeds two billion
dollars, it requires the attention of not a part time city manager but a
fulltime board that will provide the expertise and the fulltime
commitment to making sure that this asset has reaches it’s full economic
potential not only for the city and the region but for the state and
that being said Mr. Chairman I would hope that the committee would
support this with the favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Rucho, questions from the committee. Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, Senator Rucho one thing that interest me
somewhat is clearly that’s put over these bonds and I use to know
something about this not like now but it seems to me that number one,
what we are doing could affect the way that these various bond holders
now have in these bonds but secondly Cindy said there are two
possibilities worst case scenario and then best case scenario.
Typically, before you ___[01:56] you would find the lawyer who is
willing to put his bond and everything else up to give an opinion as to
what the impact would be of this. You have an opinion from Bond Council
or some Bond Council willing to say that this does not have aware of
these bonds and goes through this formal process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, Senator Blue the treasure is in the process of getting that
done presently.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The treasure is trying to find council who are…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Getting opinion on the bond but in reality you have to understand that
the value of the assets for the bond or how it’s paid back is based on
the revenue stream that comes from the airport and not from the city of
Charlotte. This is all strictly revenues based on what the airlines
right now US Air and other airlines there. So, the value of that airport
and the value of the bond so based on the revenue stream that the
airport has especially since the city of Charlotte cannot have a good
faith in creditors the city of Charlotte from what I have read in the
bond documents is not used for paying the bond principle interest or
premiums. So, the value of the airport stands on its own and it will do
simply.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But the city issue the bonds which added some credibility even if the
city that can ___[03:28] credit as opposed to an unknown, untested
authority that would be issuing the new bonds, is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It was all exclusively on the value of the bonds and revenue stream of
the airport. And that has what bond reading…A?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My understanding is the Airport Authority’s AA Bond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clodfelter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
___[03:53] Senator I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it’s important to know the answer has to whether we are in a
worst case or a best case before we vote. The city’s Bond Council has
issued an opinion and that opinion is that the consent of the bond
holders is required that otherwise there is a fall by the city if the
consent is not obtained and the given the way these bonds were held it
maybe impossible to get that consent. Now, I don’t know whether the
treasurer agrees with that or not but actually I wanna know the answer
before I vote. I think anybody does I wanna know that. We are not just
messing around with the credit of the city of Charlotte, the airport of
Charlotte if we mess this kind of thing up, it impacts the credit of
every local government of state of North Carolina and probably the
states credit too. They don’t take likely to messing around with these
kind of things, bond holders and ___[04:55] do not. So, I will be
interested…

<p id="30:00">
When are we gonna get the answer? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, the answer is
coming from the treasures office, and I spoke with the treasurer
yesterday and she is in the process of working through that. The talking
with some other bond attorneys, there are some other ways of
accomplishing that and that's the city of Charlotte just agree that this
be moved forward so that it can continue to reach its full economic
potential, under folks that are less qualified to continue moving both
the airport and the park. So in reality, we will have an answer
completely, but there are options there that can be met, and also
speaking with folks in the airport, there seems to feel that this can be
accomplished pretty simply. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford. Thank you
Mr. Chairman. Senator Rucho, I've done a great deal of study and
research on this, I've even visited out at the airport several times and
talked to aviation director, Mr. Orr and it wasn't the first time I've
talked to him. I have a tremendous amount of respect for what he's done
over the years that he's been there. But Senator Rucho, everything that
I've read, there seems to be sufficient enough questions that have not
been answered. In light of that, and taking that into consideration, the
city of Charlotte and the Mayor city counsil has asked for a delay to
allow us to study this issue. Would you allow the city of Charlotte to
take the time to study the issue, to bring back some factual
information, so that we could have a more informed decision on this
very, very important issue? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The study has been done,
at least it was done Lieutenant Governor Dalton regarding studying the
importance of both the airport and the intermodal yard and that was a
study on economics, I believe. The economic vitality of the state. And
secondly is we have a pretty clear picture as to what is expected and
the portentials are. But before we vote on the floor of the Senate, we
will have the answer to Senator Clodfelter's question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One of the things
that I have not heard discussed, Senator Rucho, is something that is
very important and dear to me, which are the employees at the airport.
And moving from the city of Charlotte, which are city employees, to an
authority. What kind of impact is that going to have on their benefits
and the quality of life that their gonna have as authority employees vs.
the city of Charlotte employees? [SPEAKER CHANGES] As best I can tell,
since they have done a wonderful job in operating the efficient airport,
I can't imagine it'll be changed. The authority pays for it anyhow, with
that revenue stream that comes from the revenue stream from the airlines
and the like of the airport, then I can't imagine it'll be any
different. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One more
follow up, yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One last follow up, thank you Mr.
Chairman. I keep hearing a lot about the revenue stream, and I'm greatly
concerned. Based upon my limited knowledge in history of the airline
industry, which is not stable. US Air just went through a merger, and if
we're gonna hang our hats on some revenue bonds on the airport, as it
relates to the hub carry at thier US Air, that concerns me. So, if you
look at the history of the airline industry, I think we all need to take
into consideration, having some other entity that would support the
revenue bonds, out at the airport. Do you have a response to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. First of all, the good faith and credit of the
city of Charlotte does not support these bonds. Ok, they're not allowed
to do so, with any kind of monies that they receive in taxation. Second
of all, they have a strong financial status with Mr. Orr. And thirdly,
it's just a matter of recognizing that there is going to be a transition
at some point when Mr. Orr retires and I think he celebrated his 72nd
birthday the other day. And what that means, is it would be a window of
opportunity to make a smooth transition to the authority. Authority will
pick the next individual that will lead, but it will act as a board of
directors to be sure that it will be full potential and part of that
comes from the fact that they need to be very concious of the fact that
the cost of that operation has to kept low. That's what makes this all
worth it, and that's what the intent will be. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Senator. We're going to have a question from Senator McKissick, and
then one from Senator Clodfelter and then open it up. Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, let me ask you this, Senator. It always gives me
some concern when there is a taking or transfer of assets by any
government or any unit and given to some other enemy. Without</p>

compensation. Now I understand that there's going to be a transfer the
debt. Has there been any sort of tabulation or some redone to understand
the extent to which the city of Charlotte has been investing in this
property? Not just the land, the billings, everything that's apart of it
to the extent to which they would be compensated or made whole if this
moves forward. And secondly unanimity among the delegation that's
affected by this type of a transfer or by the local government that's
being impacted. I'm wondering where this is coming from. If you could
share with me what the genesis of this is so I can understand it cause
it doesn't sound like there's a unanimity of opinion out there among
either members of the General Assembly that are impacted potentially or
among the local government entity. So where's it coming from? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] In the amount of money - everything that's paid for out of that
airport in all the additions, expansion, everything came from the
revenue stream that comes from the airlines. The US Air, American and
final entity wants to have certainty in making sure that they had
continued to have a low cost hub so that they can operate from and
hopefully expand which is something that I assume they will continue
since there's no overlap between the roots of the US Air and American.
So in reality, the city really has operated it by having an assistant
manager pretty much on a part time basis with 2 or 3 other things
provide the over site but Mr. Orr previous administrations in the city
have all pretty much had a hands off approach to operating what is a
very effective system and what we're trying to do is upgrade it as this
airport needs to expand as the inter motor park becomes more a play in
economics in dealing with the region in the state then very simply we're
trying to be sure that the very best board of directors will be put in
place. I don't think I've gotten any negative comments from the other
regional counties saying no to the fact that this is something that the
region should approach in and they have supported it. There are some
folks that might disagree but in reality it would seem that the value of
the airport and it's economic potential needs to be put first above any
type of politics. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One quick follow up - [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If it's quick. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's very quick. It would be
excellent, Senator Rucho, if you could just make sure that is the
totality. I mean I know it's the current debt but I'm not sure that
incorporates in any and all cost that might have been encouraged since
the inception of this airport from where it started to where it is today
in terms of compensation for what has been invested because it only
seems to be that's right if to make them whole if this matter moves
forward. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Sir. Senator Alpodaca then Senator
Clodfelter. Senator Clodfelter thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Chairman. I have several comments and observations I'll offer.
Senator Rucho I know you didn't do it intentionally but I think you did
misspeak when you said that there would be full time oversite here
because this committee - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not a full time authority.
What I meant to say is folks that are fully dedicated to the airport and
it's expansion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I think we've had that
historically since 1936. The proof is in the pudding. This airport
wouldn't be where it is today but for the commitment that has been
evidenced over those 70 some years and I have the highest regard for the
current tenant of the office out there but it's not a one man show.
Before him, some of us actually remember before him that there was Josh
Birmingham who was the airport director who really set that airport on a
good course and even before him his predecessors and there will be
successors and I think they have proved over the years that the current
operation structure is very committed to the growth of this airport. It
couldn't be otherwise. Some of the debt Senator McKissick over the years
was general obligation debt. There was a time when the city did fund
this airport with general obligation bonds. I remember voting on them as
a council member and as a voter. It's not all been revenue bonds that
have funded or supported or paid for this airport and there have been
general revenues as well as airport revenues gone into it from the city
of Charlotte. So that is an issue that probably needs to be considered
when we're going to do this. This is an asset that's been</p>

not through the work of Lincoln county, Cabarrus county, Union
county,with all respects to those folks, they have their own airports.
But it's been built largely through financial investments made up by the
citizens of Charlotte, supported by grants from the federal government.
 There is a factual difference I want to talk about, and think about,
and it's one of the reasons why I want to share and be deliberate about
doing this.  An authority may be the right way to go, ultimately, but
you've got to be really deliberate about it to get it right.  This
airport is different in an important respect from the Raleigh-Durham
airport, and the Greensboro Highpoint airport.  And in that respect,
it's different from the Dallas-Ft. Worth airport.  It does not sit at an
area that's predominately undeveloped, it sits right in the middle of
the city.  It's completely surrounded by the city and by developed
areas.  In that regard it's much more like Atlanta Hartsfield, or
Chicago O'Hare in terms of where it must operate functionally.  Those 2,
by the way are run as city departments, both the city of Atlanta, and
the city of Chicago.  But that's important for this reason.  The FAA
requires that the owner and sponsor of the airport must have authority
around the airport to control land uses around the airport, and insure
that no hazards are constructed, that development is compatible with the
airport.  I'm not talking about the airport property, but around the
airport.  And all around this airport, unlike Raleigh-Durham, unlike
Greensboro Highpoint, or Dallas-Ft. Worth is another good example, is
the city of Charlotte has heavily built up neighborhoods.  that has led
to a lot of conflict over the years.  A lot of conflict.  And it's been
managed very well, and very successfully, to enable the airport to
continue to grow, to grow very well, but to keep the communities around
that airport in balance.  the only agency that has the ability to
balance both those interests has been the city of Charlotte.  And this
new authority will not have that ability.  It will not have authority
outside of the airport property, to ensure that an incompatible tower is
not erected on property adjoining it.  That is one of the reasons by the
way that the FAA has so far refused to give approval to the action we
took last year transferring the Asheville airport to a regional
authority.  In a letter to the FAA, they point out that that is a
concern  not addressed.  Is who controls zoning, planning and building
around the airport.  And they require that as a condition of being a
recognized airport sponsor.  So a situational, perhaps we can address
it, Senator Rucho.  It may be something we can deal with, but we've got
to be more deliberate about approaching that, and arresting these
problems through.  Let them get an authority that's going to work, but
we need to take time to do it right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I agree with you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Do you want to respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, I agree with you in the sense that yes, we want
this.  I think the common goal for the state, the region, the city, and
the airport authority is to be sure that it continues to grow and
prosper.  The city of Charlotte has everything to gain by having this
airport expand, as far as sales tax revenues and other opportunities
that will come from that, plus the fact that the intermodal park will
lead to 10's of 1000's of new jobs for the region, in addition to some
economic pluses in that direction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Apodoca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I never thought I would say
this sentence, but Senator Rucho, you're somewhat of a  visionary with
this, and I don't know if I really hurt to say it, but you need to take
it to the next level, and the next level is a regional airport
authority.  Now Senator Clodfelter brings some pretty good points up,
but as most attorneys do, they leave out some very good points.  Us
folks who happen to change planes coming through Charlotte, help pay for
that airport.  The planes that land there pay a landing fee.  They help
pay for that airport.  The people who live in Lincoln county and fly out
of that airport, help pay for that airport.  So the city is having good
luck on having a large amount of folks from all over the United States,
land and maybe transfer planes through that airport, to help with that.
So, I think this is the place that it needs to grow in order to grow to
the next step.  And with all that being said, I move to unfavorable
report to the original bill, favorable to the proposed committee</p>

They are agnostic about whether we should go to an authority or not, but
they want to see what the advantages are of that structure. This past
Monday evening, the council director and the city manager put together a
framework for the study, to be done in just the next couple of months,
before the general assembly adjourns for the year, and to present it to
them on Monday night for approval. The study would be funded by the
city. We would get critical input from our stakeholders, such as the
airlines, the railways and members of the general assembly. In addition,
this study’s going to look at the financial ramifications of the
transfer of the airport, including the issues that brought forth the
letter from the Bond Council. The airport has benefited from the
synergies of being a part of the city. They take advantage of central
services like risk
management, information technology, employee health insurance programs.
It’ll take a look at all those issues as well, including the outstanding
bonds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. You have 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very good. I’ll just sum up this way. I’m glad Senator Rucho brought up
the Logistics Task Force because, at the end of the government
subchapter, after he said that, on page 90, they talk about how these
regional assets should be regionalized, on the very next page, the last
paragraph reads as follows: “Further investigation and legal expertise
is needed to formula the appropriate governing and financing models for
these proposed regional assets and the model may differ from region to
region; however, these models should be developed, and questions
answered, before embarking on subsequent actions related to their
creation in the expenditure of funds for the inland ports and
infrastructure related thereto.” I think that paragraph right there
justifies why a study is needed before embarking with this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think all of these questions are very simply answered. I know the bond
questions will be answered before it goes to the floor of the Senate
and, very simply, it does have to go through the House so there’ll be
additional opportunities to be sure that we’re perfect but, as Senator
Apodaca said, it is time to move forward and, Mr. Chairman, we do have a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, we do. Thank you, Senator Rucho. The motion on the floor to approve
the PCS as amended. Those in favor of the motion, please say aye.
Opposed, no. Motion carried. This meeting is adjourned.</p>
