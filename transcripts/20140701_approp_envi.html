We call the environment committee to order. I’d like to thank our
sergeant at arms today, Bill Bass, Charlie Goodman, David Collins, Bill
Morris, BH Pile and Carl Morello. Thank you for the job you do. We have
some pages with us today. We have Tristan Adams from Lincoln County,
Jason Saine is the sponsor. Please stand up when we call your name. Jay
Spires from Iredell County, Robert Brawley. Harrison Bryant from
Alexander County, Mark Hollo. Emily Callicutt from Montgomery County,
Justin Burr. Sam Ness from Nash County Jeff Collins. Emily Gage from
Polk County, Chris Whitmire. Morgan Warren from Rowan County,
Representative Harry Warren. Thank you for being here today. Today we’re
going to let staff go through the bill to start with. Then we’ll hear
from the sponsors and we’ll take comments from the committee. This is
going to be a discussion only bill. Okay would you like to make an
opening comment, Representative ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could, I was
just going to set the table. But I am going to do exactly what you’re
recommending. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, we’ll let you help set the table,
how’s that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And Mr. Chairman, while he’s coming up to
set the table may I make a comment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, you may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He may be setting the table, but I want everybody to
know that Representative McGrady helped plan all the utensils that are
going on the table. He’s done a ton of hard work on this and while we
are using and starting, we had the Governor’s blueprint, and we’ve had
the addition from the Senate. I want people to understand that McGrady
has put his heart and soul in this and we appreciate that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Hager, would you like to comment? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just want to echo what Representative Simmons said.
Representative McGrady has worked long and hard with Representative
Catlin on this issue, being the experts in the room. I understand it’s
Senator Apodaca’s bill. He preferred not to be here today, to allow
Representative McGrady to handle it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman,
thank you to my colleagues for their comments. I guess that means if it
all works out right, I get some credit and if it doesn’t, you know who
to blame. Seriously though, standing up here in the place of Senator
Apodaca is a tough act to follow. We may come from the same city and I
don’t know what our respective weight is, but I’m sure we’ve got some
other things in common although I’m not exactly sure what those are
right now. What I wanted to do is just set the table. I’m going to ask
staff, the bill that’s before us is not obviously a House bill. And we
were not involved in, intimately involved in its preparation. I can’t
really speak to all the reasons why the Senate made some set of
decisions they did. I can probably speculate as to some and may in some
places. I think the bottom line though is the goal for all of us were
the same. And as Representative Samuelson pointed out, I think you need
to look at this as a process. The Governor took the first good step, and
on top of that the Senate has built its bill and it’s the next step. And
I, from my perspective it exceeds my expectations, in terms of the
specificity that the Senate has given, and the timelines it set. The
goals are obvious here. We want to stop creating new coal ash ponds. And
that, the Governor and the Senate both do. We want to dewater the ponds
that are out there. That gets us a long way towards not continuing
pollution of ground water or surface water, potential surface water. We
want to set a timetable for evaluating what’s out there. We don’t know
everything yet. Duke power, Duke energy doesn’t know everything about
these ponds yet. There’s more study that needs to be done, and even if
we tried to immediately start moving tomorrow, it would take many years
to clean up the problem that has come about over many decades. We then
want to, having made an evaluation, we want to close the coal ash ponds
and pits down, and then we want to clean them up. The one piece of the
Senate bill that surprised me just</p>

...because of the way it was set up, but not surprise me in terms of
what it was trying to do, was the establishment of the Coal Ash
Management Commission. Again, I don't know what exactly the Senate was
thinking to here, but I think the expectation was that perhaps the
department didn't have the credibility to act on this and there needed
to be some independent entity that had responsibility for coal ash
management. Some independent entity that would stand behind DNR. DNR
would be making recommendations based on information provided by Duke
and others, but ultimately the responsibility for making these decisions
about when things were going to be cleaned up, how they were going to be
cleaned up. All the high level decisions would be made by an independent
body.
I think that's what the Senate had in mind. It's a creative solution to
the problem that I also perceived as to how we make sure that this gets
done in a timetable that the House and the Senate want to put in place.
I think right there I'm just going to stop and turn it over to Mr.
Hudson and Ms. McGinnis to take us through the respective parts of the
bill, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative McGrady. Before we do that I
want to make an announcement. We were going to be meeting this evening,
30 minutes after session in this same room. If you have amendments they
need to be in by staff by the end of session today.
And now we'll turn it over to staff to go through the bill.
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one other thing. There will be a PCS, I just
wanted to confer a PCS released before that meeting?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, there will. Jeff, if you'd like to go through the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Co-Chair. As you can see from the bill
before you, this is the third edition of Senate Bill 729. It's almost 50
pages. It has a 2 page long title. It's a complicated bill so me and my
colleagues, Jennifer McGinnis and Heather Finnelle will walk you through
the bill.
Ms. Finnelle will talk to you about the cost recovery provisions and the
regulatory fee in the bill. Ms. McGinnis will talk to you largely about
prioritization of the coal ash ponds and the different closure methods,
as well as new regulations for structural fill in those large structural
fill sites.
I'm going to talk to you about the Coal Ash Commission, ground water and
surface water protections, and dam safety provisions. So with that, I'll
get started.
You can skip over the first two pages, which are the long title of the
bill, to the second part of page 3. This is the provisions for
comprehensive measurement of coal combustion residuals. There's some
miscellaneous provisions in this new part. The most important probably
being the definitions. These terms are, some of them are new and will be
used throughout the discussion of this bill.
The most important one that I want to bring your attention to is over on
page 4. This is coal combustion residual surface impoundments. These are
the coal ash ponds, we'll probably be referring to them as impoundments
or ponds throughout a discussion, so we don't have to keep repeating
that mouthful. One thing I'd point out about the definition, if you look
down on line 16 it says &quot;coal combustion residual surface
impoundments shall only include impoundments owned by a public utility
as defined in the utility statute&quot; so essentially this is confining
most of the bill to the impoundments owned by Duke Energy. There are
other industrial facilities in the state that have impoundments that
might be otherwise caught under this definition, but that limitation on
the ownership of the impoundment should only include those owned by
Duke.
Over on the next page, you'll see the Coal Ash Management Commission.
This is the commission that Representative McGrady referred to. This is
a nine-member commission, three appointments by the President Pro
Tempore, three appointments upon recommendation of the President Pro
Tempore. The appointments made by the Senate. Three by the House upon
recommendation of the Speaker and three by the Governor.
The first three are upon recommendation of the President Pro Tempore.
The first one is a resident of the state, the second one is a person
having special training or scientific expertise...</p>

<p id="010:00">
In waste management, including solid waste disposal, hauling or
beneficial use, and the third is a licensed physician or a person with
experience in public health. The next three are upon recommendation of
the speaker. This is a member of a non-governmental conservation
interest. A person actively employed by or recently retired from an
industrial manufacturing facility and a person with expertise in
determining and evaluating the costs associated with electricity
generation and establishing the rates associated with electricity
consumption. The last three are the Governor’s appointments. A person
with experience in economic development, a member of an electric co-op
and a person with experience in science or engineering. If you’ll turn
over to the next page, you’ll see in the middle of that page the powers
and duties of this commission. Those are to review and approve the
classifications of the coal ash ponds as required in the provisions that
Miss McGinnis will discuss later. Also to review and approve the closure
plans for those ponds. Again, Miss McGinnis will discuss those in
detail. And also to review and make recommendations on all the
provisions of this new part and to report back to the General Assembly
on those recommendations. There’s a provision here for staffing this
commission. This commission will have five full time staff to help it
with its duties. Miss Fennell will talk about those in a little more
detail later. Over on the next page, page 7 on line 10, administrative
location of this commission. So this is where the commission would be
administratively housed. It is in the division of emergency management,
in the department of public safety but note that the last sentence of
that sub-section says the commission shall exercise all its powers and
duties independently and shall not be subject to the supervision,
direction or control of the division or department. So although the
commission is administratively housed in that department, it will be
acting independently. The next new section in this part, expedited
permit review, this closure process for the impoundments will require
new permitting of different types for different types of permits, be
they land fill permits, water quality permits, because of the deadlines
throughout the act, there’s some concern about all of this being
accomplished in a timely manner, so this provides for the department
doing expedited review of the permits necessary to conduct the
activities as required by this part. Over on the next page, page 8, is a
provision for preemption of certain local government ordinances that
might also regulate coal ash management. This language is similar to
language that’s already in the hazardous waste statutes as well as the
hydraulic fracturing statutes. Basically provides that local ordinances
can’t place restrictions on coal ash management that aren’t contained in
this part or that conflict or are inconsistent in any manner with the
provisions of this part. It also provides for reviewing local government
ordinances that may have general applicability that could impact coal
ash management and would direct the environmental management commission
to look at whether or not those types of general applicability
ordinances should also either be limited or preempted by this act. The
next sections are over on page 10. One provides for federal preemption.
This recognizes that the USEPA is currently working on rules for coal
ash management. They are under court order to issue those rules, adopt
those rules by the end of this year. So this recognizes that those rules
may be coming out and to the extent that this part conflicts with those
rules, those rules or any other federal law in this area would control.
The next new section provides for rule making, by the environmental
management commission to implement the provisions of this part. The next
new section, this is 138 309.208, this is an important section because
it starts setting out some of the deadlines for changing management of
coal ash in the state. The first deadline is today, July 1 2014, and it
would prohibit the construction or new or expansion of existing coal ash
ponds. The next is for October 1 of this year. This would prohibit the
disposal of coal ash into impoundments at facilities</p>

<p id="015:00">
that have been decommissioned. They’re no longer generating coal ash.
The next deadline, December 31st 2018, this is a prohibition on the
discharge of storm water into coal ash ponds at decommissioned
generating facilities, and December 31st 2019 is a prohibition on the
discharge of storm water into coal ash ponds at all facilities, whether
they’re generating coal ash or not. The next deadline, this is
subsection E. December 31st 2018; this is for electric generating
facilities, directing them to convert to disposal of dry fly ash or
retirement of the facility. So those facilities have to convert to dry
fly ash or retire the facility by December 31st 2018, and then by
December 31st 2019, similarly the disposal of dry bottom ash. There has
to be a conversion to the disposal of dry bottom ash or the facility has
to be retired. The next two sections deal with groundwater and surface
water protection and assessment to generate information to help in the
classification of the impoundments as to the risk that they pose to
water quality. The first one, groundwater assessment and corrective
action in drinking water well supply and provision of alternate water
supply, this is basically dealing with groundwater, as opposed to the
next section, which is surface water. This section begins by requiring
groundwater assessment at the coal ash ponds. If you turn over to the
top of page 11, it provides that no later than December 31st of this
year, the owner of the coal ash ponds, they have to submit a proposed
groundwater assessment plan to the department for the department’s
review and approval. Basically the assessment plan has to identify all
potential receptors around the pond, the contamination that already
exists; basically anything to help the owner of the coal ash pond and
the department determine if there are groundwater issues at the
impoundment. It provides again for review and approval by the department
and says that no later than 180 days from the approval of the assessment
plan, the owner has to implement the plan, and once the owner implements
the plan, they will report the results of that plan back to the
department so that they’ll be reporting on any groundwater exceedences
that are found. Once they do that, if you look at line 36 on page 11,
the legislation provides that no later than 90 days from the submission
of the assessment report, again, where there are exceedences, the
impoundment owner has to submit a proposed groundwater corrective action
plan to the department for its review and approval, and at the bottom of
page 11 you’ll see the provision that says the corrective action plan
has to provide for the methods of restoring groundwater in conformance
with the requirements of subchapter L of chamber 2 of the administrative
code. These are the current groundwater cleanup laws, and basically the
corrective action plan has to provide for cleaning up groundwater
exceedences in accordance with the current state law on groundwater, and
then once the plan is approved by the department, the impoundment owner
has to implement the plan within 30 days. Subsection C on the middle of
page 12; this is for drinking water wells. Basically the idea here is to
identify any drinking water wells within half a mile, downgrading of the
compliance boundary impoundment that has been contaminated by
constituents in the coal ash of the impoundment, and if that occurs, the
impoundment owner has to provide an alternate water supply – drinking
water supply – within 30 days of the department determining that there’s
been a groundwater exceedence in those wells. So again, this is designed
to identify and provide alternate drinking water for folks impacted by
constituents from the impoundment. Over on page 13, this new section is
similar to the one for groundwater, but this one is for surface water
discharges. It provides that no later than December 31st of this year,
the impoundment owner has to provide a map to the department that
identifies all outfalls and discharges from the impoundment, to the
department.</p>

<p id="020:00">
and it has to identify whether or not those discharges reached the
surface waters of the state. In subsection b of this new section, the
impoundment owner has to do an assessment of the discharges from the
coal ash pond to determine, again, if they’re reaching the surface
waters of the state and to determine if the discharges are causing any
violation of water quality standards. If it’s found that there are
discharges from the impoundments to the surface waters of the state, the
impoundment owner has to develop a corrective action plan and submit
that to the department. You’ll see this on the middle of page 14. If the
department determines that there is an unpermitted discharge from an
impoundment, and the discharge reaches the surface waters of the state,
the department notifies the impoundment owner and the impoundment owner
has to develop an unpermitted discharge corrective action plan. This
plan has to do one of two things to correct the discharge--this is at
the bottom of page 14--it either has to eliminate the unpermitted
discharge or it has to amend its water quality permit in order to
provide for the discharge so that it gets it under the water quality
regulations. Those are the two different methods for addressing
unpermitted discharges. Finally, over on page 15, for this surface water
protection statute there’s also a provision for identifying new
discharges, so not only does the impoundment owner have to identify
those that are existing, they have to have a plan for inspection so that
if any new discharges arise they will know about it and can report it to
the department. That basically covers the surface water and groundwater
protection provisions for the existing impoundments. I’m going to ask
you to flip over to page 36 of the bill. Another component of making
sure that these impoundments remain safe while they continue to be in
existence is related to their dams, so on page--actually I’m skipping
ahead of myself. One of the other things that we have related to
reporting of discharges is on page 36. This tightens up some of the
reporting requirements to make sure that there are reports of discharges
that have to be made to the department within 24 hours and the press
release requirements in existing law, those are decreased from 48 hours
from the discharge to 24 hours so, again, it’s tightening up some of
those reporting times. It’s over on page 38 that you’ll find the
provisions strengthening the dam safety laws, as they relate to these
impoundment dams. The first provision, section 7, in the middle of page
38, this basically says that if the impoundment owner is going to make
emergency repairs to the dam, it has to do so as soon as possible but no
later than 24 hours after first knowledge of the necessity of the
emergency repairs. Section 7.1 provides for a detailed closure process
for the dams of the impoundments. Many of these impoundments are going
to be closed, so their dams are no longer going to be operable or no
longer are going to be acting as dams. This new section provides a
detailed process for the division of energy, minerals and land resources
to decommission those dams so that they’re no longer regulated, since
they’ll no longer but operating as dams. Over on the top of page 40
these are requirements for the development of emergency action plans for
the dams. If any of these dams is classified by the department as
high-hazard or intermediate-hazard the dam owner has to develop an
emergency action plan and it provides details as to what the emergency
action plan has to include. Then, over on page 41 are new requirements
for inspections of dams at impoundments. If you look at lines eight and
nine on this page you’ll see that the current requirements for general
dam inspection is basically the department has to try to provide for
inspection of all dams at intervals of approximately five years. This
new language considerably tightens that up for dams at impoundments.
Basically, the department has to inspect each dam annually. The
impoundment owner has to provide for inspection weekly and after storms,
to detect any evidence of deterioration, and the impoundment owner also
has to hire an independent engineer to do an annual inspection of the
dam. That basically gets through the dam safety provisions. There’s some
miscellaneous provisions that I’ll go over quickly, towards the end of
the bill</p>

<p id="025:00">
Page 42 and several subsequent pages, there are a number of provisions
that transfer rule making for solid waste from the commission for public
health to the environmental management commission. Most of these are
conforming changes, that's why there are so many pages of this. Over on
page 46, are changes to compliance boundary provisions. As you may
recall from last year's House Bill 74, the journal simply made some
changes to the compliance boundary provisions that apply to coal ash
ponds as well as other types of facilities in the state. What this
provision does is it rolls back some of those changes that were made
while leaving some in place. It leaves in place the definitive statement
that all these types of facilities, regardless of when they were
permitted, have compliance boundaries. And that the compliance boundary
can be pushed out to the property boundary if there are multiple
continuous properties under common ownership. But, this falls under
rules adopted by the management commission, which limit those boundaries
to 500 feet or 250 feet depending on when the facility was permitted.
So, regardless of where the property boundary is, the compliance
boundary can never be pushed out beyond those rule limitations. It also
rolls back some limitations that were placed on the environmental
management commission as far as what type of corrective action they
could require for exceedances of groundwater standards under the
compliance boundary. So those are the changes that were made to the
compliance boundary, and there's a direction to the environmental
management commission to study it's compliance boundary and corrective
action rules to make sure that they are clear and internally consistent.
There's been some issue as to interpretations of these rules, so we're
hopeful that the environmental management commission will study this and
bring recommendations back to the journal assembly by the end of this
year. There are a couple of other studies that are on the top of page
47. The first is a study direction to the new coal ash management
commission. Basically, to study the low priority sites and determine if
under certain circumstances those sites might be better left in place
and they require no further action or natural attenuation. There's some
concerns that for some of these sites, there might actually be more
environmental damage if the sites are dug up and that type of
remediation is done, rather than just leave the sites in place. This
bill doesn't allow for that, but it does direct the coal ash management
commission to study that possibility and to see if that type of
treatment might also provide for environmental protection of public
health safety and welfare and natural resources. And then, the final
study is a direction to the department of transportation, and it's
basically telling the department to look at additional opportunities for
the use of coal ash in construction and maintenance of roads and bridges
in the state, and directs the department to report to the environmental
review commission by the end of this year. And my final section is over
on page 48, this is specifications for use of coal ash products in
public procurement. Basically, this provision directs the state
construction office, NDOT, to develop recommended technical
specifications for using coal ash in either state construction projects,
or road construction projects, and then directs them to report to the
journal assembly by February 1st of next year on the results of the
development on those recommended technical specifications. And I point
out at the end of the bill we have a severability clause, if there's a
problem with any particular provision and it's held invalid, it won't
affect the other provisions. And then the effective date is otherwise
provided throughout the act. The act is effective when it becomes law.
Now, turn it over to Ms. McGuiness.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, we will go back to page 15 of the bill, and as Mr. Hudson
indicated, I will review the prioritization and enclosure provisions of
the bill with you, and two moratoriums as well. So, at the bottom of
page 15, there's a new section in chapter 130a 309.211: Prioritization
of Coal Combustion and Surface Impoundment. This provision would require
the department of environmental and natural resources to prioritize all
coal ash ponds</p>

Were retired no later than August 1st, 2015 and assessed the risk as to
whether they’re high-risk, intermediate-risk or low-risk. They would be
looking at the site’s risk to public health safety and welfare, the
environment, natural resources and also would be looking at a number of
specific factors that are at the top of page 16, and I will run through
those quickly. These include any hazards to public health safety or
welfare resulting from an impoundment, structural condition or hazard
potential of an impoundment, the proximity to surface waters and whether
any surface waters are contaminated or threatened by contamination as a
result of a pond, information concerning the horizontal and vertical
extent of soil and groundwater contamination for all contaminants that
are confirmed to be present in groundwater in exceedance of groundwater
quality standards, all significant factors affecting contaminant
transport, the location and nature of all receptors and significant
exposure pathways, the geological and hydrogeological features
influencing the movement and chemical and physical character of the
contaminants, the amount and characteristics of the coal combustion
residuals in the impoundment, and any other factor that the department
deemed relevant to the establishment of risk. Again, the department
would be using these factors to establish a risk category for each
impoundment and give priority to the closure and remediation of
impoundments that pose the greatest risk. After the department has
evaluated this information, they are directed again by August 1st, 2015
to issue proposed classification for each coal ash pond and then, within
30 days after issuing a proposed classification, the department would be
required to public notice that classification and also hold public
hearings in each county for each coal ash pond for which risk is
assessed. Then, after holding the public hearings and receiving public
comment and taking that information into account, the department would
be required to submit a proposed classification to the coal ash
management commission that Mr. Hudson briefed you on. The commission
would then be directed to evaluate all the information that was
submitted and any other information they deem relevant, and they’re
directed to only approve proposed classification if the commission
determines that the classification was developed in accordance with the
provisions of this legislation and that the classification accurately
reflects level of risk posed by the pond. The commission would then be
directed to issue its determination in writing, including findings and
support of its determination, and then there would be an appeals process
for a final approval under Chapter 150b of the general statutes. After a
final classification had been issued for an impoundment, an owner of an
impoundment would be required to submit a proposed closure plan for each
impoundment and there are specific requirements under the legislation
for each level of risk assigned to an impoundment. If you go to the
bottom of page 17, you’ll see the requirements for high-risk
impoundments. The bill would require that high-risk impoundments be
closed as soon as practical, but no later than December 31st, 2019.
Those closure plans would need to be submitted by impoundment owners no
later than December 31st, 2016. The bill required that, at a minimum,
all these ponds be dewatered and then directs that the impoundment owner

have a [??] collection system a closure cap system a composite liner
system and otherwise comply with the construction siting and design
requirements for industrial landfills under the administrative code with
the exception of the buffer required for industrial landfills to surface
waters in that regard the bill would require an increased buffer of 300
feet between the converted landfill the waste disposal unit and surface
waters the impou or the new landfills would then also be required to
close and conforms all the closure requirements for industrial landfills
under the administrative code the legislation does however allow the
department to authorize disposal of additional coal combustion residuals
in addition to those that were originally included in the impoundment if
the department determines that the site is suitable for additional
capacity and that disposal of the additional coal ash would not pose an
unacceptable risk to public health safety welfare the environment
natural resources, in addition to that option of converting the
impoundment to an industrial landfill the owner of the impoundment could
also remove all coal combustion residuals from the impoundment return it
to a non erosive and stable condition and send the coal combustion
residuals that were removed for disposal into a coal combustion
residuals landfill an industrial landfill or [??] solid waste landfill
so these are landfills that would be not a former impoundment in
landfills located elsewhere in addition the coal combustion residuals
that were removed from the impoundment could be used as structure fill
or for other beneficial uses in compliance with the law and in a moment
I'm going to review for you some significant enhancements to the
structure fill requirements that the bill makes next the intermediate
risk impoundments these would be required to close in the same manner as
the high risk impoundments however they would be given an additional
five years to close and would be required to close no later than
December 31st 2024 the low risk impoundments would be required to close
by December 31st 2029 and those impoundments would allow be allowed to
what's known as cap in place so they would need to comply with closure
and post closure requirements for landfills and the bill specifies that
they would have to maintain install and maintain a cap system they would
have to have ground water monitoring they would have to have financial
assurance and have post closure maintenance for a period of 30 years
like landfills do the bill also currently references [??] collection
system and again these impoundments would need to be closed by December
31st 2029 and the departments in addition to these cap in place
requirements could also require other measures that would be designed to
protect public health safety welfare in the environment including in
position of institutional controls the next several pages beginning down
at the bottom of page 19 and continuing through page 23 are details that
are required to be included in the closure plans to be submitted by the
impoundment owners then at the bottom of page 23 the bill requires the
department to review these closure plans to insure that they are
protective of public health safety welfare in the environment and
otherwise comply with requirements of this legislation and then requires
the department to take the proposed or the preliminary approval of a
closure plan out for public notice and public hearing much like is
required for the departments of preliminary prioritization
classifications so after the department had taken the proposed closure
approved closure plan out to public notice the department would then
submit the proposed plan to the collash management commission and the

management commission is directed to only approve a closure plan if it
determines that the closure plan was developed in accordance with the
requirements that I just mentioned to you, and that implementation of
the closure plan is technologically feasible and that the benefits to
public health, safety and welfare, the environment and natural resources
outweigh the negative impacts on electricity costs and reliability. The
commission would then be instructed to issue its final determination in
writing, including findings in support of its determination, and within
60 days of a closure plan. The bill does authorize parties that are
aggrieved by a final decision of the commission to appeal that decision
under Chapter 150b of the general statutes. Then, finally, at mid page
25 there is a direction for impoundment owners to implement the plans
that are given final approval by the commission. The next provisions in
the bill, beginning at line 30 on page 25, are the provisions I
referenced a moment ago about structural fill. These provisions have
some components of the current rules that govern structural fill but
also bring in a host of new requirements. Primarily, the bill makes
enhanced requirements for large structural fill projects, and those are
projects that have used 10,000 tons per acre of coal combustion
residuals or 100,000 tons per project. At the bottom of page 25 it
describes permit requirements. Small projects, those projects under the
trigger I just mentioned, would operate under a general permit. They
would have to submit information for application but they would receive
a general permit. The large structural fill projects, however, would
have to have an individual permit. The next provisions are on the bottom
of page 26. These are the design, construction and citing requirements
for projects using coal ash. The first number of requirements, going
through line 30 on page 27, are requirements under the existing rule for
structural fill projects. The new requirements for large structural fill
projects are at the bottom of page 27. These include, in short, liners
for these large structural fill projects, leachate collection systems, a
cap and groundwater monitoring system. These projects, on page 29 at
line 20, would also be required to have financial assurance, much like
landfills do, to ensure that sufficient funds are available for facility
closure, post-closure care, post-closure maintenance and monitoring, and
any corrective action that the department may require, and to satisfy
any potential liability for sudden and non-sudden accidental occurrences
and subsequent costs incurred by the department in response to an
incident of a project. There is direction that these projects have to
have post-closure care and monitoring for a period of 30 years. Again,
this is the same time period required for landfills. On page 30 there is
a description of additional closure requirements for structural fill
projects. Again, there would be requirements that they maintain the
integrity and effectiveness of their cap system, maintain and operate
their leachate collection system and their groundwater monitoring system
during the 30-year post-closure care period. On line 31, page 31 there
is a requirement for recordation of projects using coal combustion
products. These are all projects that use more than 1,000 cubic yards
per project. This is a current requirement under the rules and has not
been changed by the bill. Beginning at the bottom of page 31 there is an
exemption for the Department of Transportation projects. It does allow
the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Department
of Transportation to agree on specific design construction citing
operating and closure criteria. This exemption for DoT projects is
included in the</p>

Current rule full suite governing structural fill projects. On page 32
at the top, there is a requirement for the department to inventory and
inspect certain structural fill projects. This requires DENR to no later
than July 1 2015, inventory all structural fill projects with a volume
of 10,000 cubic yards or more. And inspect those at least annually. And
then report on those findings. There’s a specific direction in the
structural fill provisions that would require the environmental
management commission to amend their rules to reflect these enhanced
requirements and make changes accordingly. At mid-page 32, beginning at
line 19, these are the provisions that require closure of specific coal
ash ponds. They are the impoundments located at Dan River Steam Station,
River Bend Steam Station, Ashville Steam Electric Generating Plant, and
the Sutton Plant. These impoundments would all be required to close by
August 1, 2019 and they would be required to close by removing all the
coal ash from the impoundments, and transfer that coal ash for disposal
in industrial land fill, coal combustion residuals landfill or municipal
solid waste landfill, or the coal combustion products could be used in
structural fill or other beneficial use in accordance with requirements
of the act. Next, on page 33 are a series of definitions. The most
notable here is a change to the definition of solid waste, which would
bring in wet coal ash, which is historically not been included in the
definition of solid waste, and it would be wet coal ash that would be
destined for disposal. Wet coal ash that is destined for beneficial use
would not be brought into the definition of solid waste, and that would
be termed coal combustion products. Next, some moratoriums. Mid-page 34,
first there would be a moratorium on projects using coal ash as
structural fill, until August 1, 2015, in order to allow DENR and the
ENC to study this issue. There are however two significant exemptions to
this moratorium, projects where the structural fill would have a
baseliner, a leach aid collection system, a cap liner, ground water
monitoring system, and where the operator establishes financial
assurance would be allowed to move forward despite the moratorium. Also,
structural fill projects where the coal ash is used as the base or
sub-base of a concrete or asphalt paved road constructed under the
authority of a public entity. Again, there’s instruction that any use of
structural fill that would be allowed under these exemptions of the
moratorium would have to proceed in a manner that complied with the
provisions of this legislation and during the period of the moratorium,
again, DENR and the ENC would be required to review both the rule suites
that govern structural fill and beneficial use. Also the changes that
are made by this legislation, as far as structural fill for large
projects and all projects generally, and to evaluate whether those rules
and the statutory changes are sufficiently protective of public health,
safety, welfare, the environment and natural resources. They would also
be looking at additional opportunities for the use of coal ash as
structural fill, that would reduce the volume of disposal to land fills,
monitor any actions of the USEPA regarding the use of coal ash as
structural fill, and then they would be directed to jointly report to
the ERC no later than January 15, 2015 with their findings and
recommendations. Section 4E on page 35, line 32 would require all
electric generating facilities owned by a public utility that produce
coal ash</p>

To issue a request for proposals, on or before December 31, 2014, that
RFP would be for the conduct of a market analysis for the concrete
industry and other industries that might beneficially use coal ash. Also
an examination of all innovative technologies that might be applied to
diminish, recycle, reuse or mitigate the impact of existing and newly
generated coal ash. And also the feasibility and advisability of
installation of technology to convert existing and newly generated coal
ash to commercial grade coal ash. The electric generating facilities
would be required to present the materials and information received in
response to the RFP, and assess the materials and information and
include a forecast of specific actions to be taken in response to these
materials to the ENC and the coal ash management commission no later
than August 1, 2016. Next there is at the bottom of page 35, section 5A,
is another moratorium. This is on the construction of new or expansion
of existing coal combustion residual landfills. These are the landfills
that were authorized in 2007 that some people refer to as stack
landfills or nested landfills. These are landfills for the disposal of
coal ash that are sited on top of former impoundments. Again, the
expansion of these landfills or construction of new landfills of this
type would be prohibited until August 1, 2015 to allow DENR to evaluate
these landfills, to assess their risk to public health, safety and
welfare, and the environment and natural resources, and particularly the
impoundments located beneath the landfills. DENR would be required to
report to the ERC no later than January 15, 2015 on its findings and
recommendations on this study. And now Miss Fennell will describe the
last provisions of the legislation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I’m
going to briefly go through the cost recovery, the fee and the
appropriations in the bill. If you’ll turn back to page 3, section 1,
this prohibits certain cost recovery. This prohibits cost recovery
related to unlawful discharges from the impoundments into the service
waters of the state. Section 2 is a moratorium on future cost recovery
for any cost related to coal combustion residuals that were not included
in the utilities last rate case. This moratorium is effective until
January 15, 2015, and this does not include the fuel rider. The yearly
proceeding that is just the fuel clause. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman,
over here. Miss Fennell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Could Miss Fennell give the page numbers as she goes through?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you’d give? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Page 3. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, page 3. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So the purpose of the moratorium is to
study the disposition of the coal combustion residual impoundments,
including any finer rules adopted by the USEPA. And now I’m going to
flip to page 47, which is section 15A of the bill. And this is the new
regulatory fee. This is very similar to the regulatory fee that the
General Assembly adopts each year in its budget. But this regulatory fee
is only imposed on the North Carolina jurisdictional revenues of each
public utility with a coal combustion impoundment. This fee will go to
defer the cost of coal ash management and it will be appropriated as
provided in sections 15C and 15D. Section 15C provides that DENR will
have 25 positions to carry out the duties that Mr. Hudson and Miss
McGinnes described. And section 15D provides that the coal ash
management commission will be granted 5 positions, and executive
director, 2 analysts, a technician, and 1 administrative position.
Section 15E also provides that the fee for the coal ash management
commission as well as the commission itself will actually have a sunset.
The fee will expire for quarters beginning April 1, 2030 and the
commission itself actually expires July 1, 2030. And that is all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions and comments from the committee?
Representative Brisson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. In I
guess this is our introduction day officially for coal ash ponds. But I
know there’s a lot of information that was given here in this 50 page</p>

Bill, but one thing that I was trying to understand and I kept, not sure
if the coal ash ponds were operating with the permits, the issued
permits in the past and if there was any kind of monitoring system. And
it just basically, listening to the staff present the bill as more of a
study guideline for the upcoming appointed commission. Is that right or?
I know some of it is stated as the laws that’s got to be determined
particularly on the floor coal ash pond that be cleaned up and removed
by 2019. But I don’t know how we can set dates and not knowing yet what
we’re going to do with it when we get it loaded up, and where we’re
going to [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you like staff to? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I’ll admit I’m not sure I understand the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s because there was a lot of questions into one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brisson, do you want to try that
question again? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will. I guess the first part of the
question was the coal ash ponds operating permits issued for the coal
ash ponds in the past? Was there any kind of monitoring required by
whoever issued the permits? Then basically, another part of the question
is, is this basically study guidelines for the upcoming appointed
commission that we’re asking to report back to us within the next nine
months, and then how are we setting close down dates and removal dates?
At the end of this section by requiring that all coal ash be removed and
not knowing or having any kind of recommendations what we’re going to do
with it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I think most would be something that DENR could answer,
particularly on the first part about the permits and the monitoring. In
terms of study guide for the commission, I would say I think it’s more
than that, I think it’s got far more direction than that. And then on
the third one about the plans, I think that’s also something DENR could
answer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Jeff’s got an answer for the first
part. Jeff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was actually going to defer to the
department as well. Just to say that there are permits for the
facilities and there is some monitoring in place for them as well but
the department can speak to that in more detail. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay
could someone from the department address that? State your name.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, Mr. Chair. I’m Tom Reeder, the director of
the division of water resources. We basically have an NPDS permit on
these facilities right now that covers the actual discharge. We do have
some basic monitoring around the ponds, ground water monitoring, to give
us some idea of the level of contamination, but nothing to the extent
that would be required in this legislation and I mean we would need to
have this information that would be gleaned from the studies and the
assessment required in this legislation to make informed, thoughtful,
scientifically based decisions on the actual threat of these facilities
to the public health and the environment, and to develop a list that
would allow us to prioritize their removal. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up,
Representative Brisson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So I guess if I understood Mr.
Reeder, is that right? That we really don’t know what it contains and,
the toxic acids or anything else. We haven’t had, I guess we’re just
caught everybody by surprise. Evidently we’re not monitoring to make
sure overflows or whatever when this occurred, over on the ?? River. So
I’m not sure but I hadn’t really heard about coal ash a lot until this
breakdown at ?? River so I’m not sure how we’re going to get it
corrected and clean it all up in four years, when we don’t have</p>

...evidently we hadn't been monitoring. It hadn't been on them
important, real important issue to us. Kind of on the back burner until
the misfortune happened. Now we're going to correct it very quickly and
panic type mode. Make panic decisions. And my experience with making
decisions with a panic most of the time comes out with a not good
decision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager, do you want to make a comment on
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask Tom Reiter a
question, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Reiter, we have NPDS permits on all the ponds, I
understand. Can you tell the committee what NPDS stands for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly, yes sir. NPDS is National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System. And basically, all these ponds have a
discharge to surface waters of the state because they fill up and
overflow and there has to be some discharge. So those permits are
primarily concerned with regulating that discharge that goes into
surface waters of the state and making sure it does not impact our water
quality standards.
I'd also just like to address something Representative Brisson said. I
mean there's no panic here. The timelines that we have to do these
assessments, I think, are pretty reasonable that are contained in this
legislation. Andy they will. I mean, we have an idea of what the
constituents of these ponds are and what the level...a rudimentary idea
of what the level of ground water contamination is right now. But, I
mean, these assessments that we have in this legislation that were
originally in the Governor's proposal will allow us to get this very
detailed scientific information that we need to make really well
informed decisions about the future of these ponds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Reiter. I think that some things that
Representative Brisson brought forth were really true. We've been in
this business in North Carolina, as far as I know, for getting close to
100 years now. I know River Bend Station was built in the '20's and
we're getting close to that into 2000 right now.
I think that we've been in this situation for almost a century now and
we've progressed to where we are. We're at the point where we're going
to handle this situation. We're at the point where we have a bill before
you that I think goes a long way in handling that situation better than
any other legislatures have done in the previous century. This sets the
precedence for the national issue that we know are coming in other
states.
At the end of the day, if you looked through it, it puts restrictions on
future ash disposal. It puts restrictions on wet disposals. It puts
restrictions on what you can and can't do with ash. How do you dispose
of the four you're going to dispose of? It's a pretty encompassing bill.
So, Mr. Reiter, I'd say that I think this is the start of a national
issue. This legislature is the one that has started this conversation
and I'm proud of the bill that Representative McGrady's brought forth
and Senator Apodaca has authored in the Senate and I think moving
forward you'll see a slightly better bill coming out of the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess this is for the bill
handlers, but it may be for the staff. The biggest overall concern is
I've seen one of these plants in detail near where I live, but I haven't
seen all 33. I'm aware there's a prioritization feature in the bill. But
one size obviously doesn't fit all and prioritization will be key, I
think.
Two things I'd like to ask if we are now satisfied or going to be
satisfied once we have the final legislation. Are we going to be
satisfied that the permitting, if you got to close one of these in five
years, will the permitting take two years, four years, how much time
will they have to actually do the work once all the permits are
obtained? Are we going to be satisfied that's going to be workable?
And secondly, I understand 100 different companies and individuals have
come forward with different solutions, chemical mitigation, to some of
the heavy metals and arsenic and so forth that's in this. They can
chemically mitigate some of this. Is anything in this bill, can we be
satisfied there's nothing in this bill that's going to prevent whoever
comes up with the plans from utilizing all solutions? Not just moving
and will it preclude chemical solutions and other solutions that may
come forward as part of the plan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank Representative Iler.
Thank you for your question. What we tried to do in this bill and what
Representative McGrady has done an excellent job of is putting these
ponds in risk levels. High risk, medium risk, low risk. In looking at
those and seeing...</p>

?? River. We know that’s an issue we’ve got to fix. We know River Bend
is an issue of high risk. So we’ve tried to categorize these things, and
realize that it can’t be one solution for everything. There’s medium
risk and low risk that will go too. So as we move forward in working
with the department, I think we’ll determine those as we move forward.
But we wanted to get the more higher risk ones in the bill. So we can
start working towards that way. And I think there’s an expedited DENR
permitting process in here too that will help that situation, to keep
using up a lot of that time for permitting, and to allow the actual work
to get done. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. There’s one other part of his question on the
timeline, if I may. One thing that we recognized when it came over from
the Senate is that same question of are these timelines workable? And so
we hope, and I’ll clarify on the PCS. The PCS, part of the reason we
wanted to go ahead and go over this bill is because the PCS is solidly
based on what’s before you and you have to understand what’s before you
to understand some of the changes that will come out in the PCS. And one
of them has to do with making sure that the timelines are workable. So
we have looked at that, and hopefully our suggestion will work. If not,
we’re open to others. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That satisfies me, Senator Graham, on the first part. The second part,
as far as the solutions that may be out there, of all kinds, was
relocation or chemicals or something that we may not have even heard
about yet. Does this preclude any of those possible solutions from those
plants? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, part of that in there, one of the things I did sit in with
the Senate’s presentation and they’re big on the reuse. The beneficial
reuse, so they have put provisions in there. They also as I recall and
staff correct me if I’m wrong, there’s a study in there and part of
addressing the timelines is also acknowledging what’s the impact of new
developments that come out as a result of the fact that for the first
time in the history of the country, people are actually really seriously
looking at this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry, Representative Harrison,
you’ve got the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have a
couple of questions if I could be recognized for a series of questions.
Thanks to Representative McGrady and Representative Hager for their work
on this. I have a lot of concerns about this bill. I think it can be
tightened up so I’m glad to hear we’ll have a PCS in the afternoon that
hopefully will address a lot of my concerns but I have some specific
questions that the staff or perhaps DENR, so if I understand it, DENR is
going to prepare that prioritization list that will be presented on
August 1, 2015. I hope I’ve read that right. I’m wondering if in the
closure plans that are proposed by DENR, does the proposed commission
get to veto a plan based on the fact that it may cost too much? I don’t
know if that’s a staff, legislative staff or DENR staff question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can staff answer that question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
Cost is a factor that they’ll be looking at on the closure plans. If you
go to page 25, again it says the commission will only approve the
closure plan if it determines that the closure plan was developed in
accordance with the legislation, implementation of the plan, according
to the closure plan schedule is technologically feasible and that the
benefits to the public health, safety and welfare, the environment and
natural resources outweigh the negative impacts on electricity costs and
reliability. So it is a factor in their evaluation of the plan. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. I am trying to
understand, we had a proposed bill that would as of I think August 1,
immediately ban any future disposal of coal ash, and I’m trying to
understand this timeline that’s in the bill. Do I read that correctly,
that I guess Duke has until December 31, 2019 for disposition of coal
ash? I saw there’s an earlier timeline on storm water but I’m just
trying to understand that one. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Jeff, can you answer
that one? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You are looking at the correct series of
dates. Unlike the legislation that you introduced, it had just a single
date for all forms of coal ash. This recognizes that there’s certain
different types of ash and other things that would be disposed of in the
impoundments, and gives them different dates at a later time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Do I understand that the

may allow for the continued seepage of some of these potential toxins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under the surface water discharge identification, assessment and
corrective action statute, it provides for two methods of corrective
action. You have to either eliminate the discharge or you have to bring
it under the NPDES permit that Mr. Reader referenced earlier. If they
brought it under the permit, and the discharge was allowed to continue
and reach surface waters, that would be in violation of the federal
Clean Water Act so I don’t think the scenario you’re describing would be
allowed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could follow-up on that. On the groundwater testing, and this is
just really a reflection of my ignorance on this, I was reading an
article in the Salisbury Post about Buck Steam Station issues and the
different methodology for testing. The fact that the EPA has a newer
model that’s showing that some are exceeding safe levels. What is the
standard for the groundwater testing, it might be for Mr. Reader, and is
it the industry that’s doing this testing or is DENR going to be doing
the monitoring and the testing on the ground water?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Reader.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks sir. We do all of our testing based on our groundwater 2L
standards, which were approved and designed to be protective of the
consumption of the water for human health, so that’s what we compare all
the samples we take for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could follow-up. What I’m reading is something called EPA 218.7
testing that might reveal a higher level. Does that make any sense to
you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Reader.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are you talking about for mercury?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thought it’s talking about chromium-6 but it might be mercury.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It might be for chromium. I’d have to take a look at that to be sure,
but our 2L standards, our groundwater standards, are completely
protective of human health so that’s what we measure everything against.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m not going to dwell on this too much but I have another follow-up
please, Mr. Chair. I’m concerned about the structural fill section, and
I think I’m confused, because it looks like there’s a moratorium but
then it seems like there’s an exemption if it’s less than 10,000 tons or
100,000 tons per site. I think I’m trying to get an understanding of
that because it seems that if we’re exempting it from any liner
requirement, because I believe Jennifer said that those less than 10,000
would be given a general permit, which I think means no liner, no
monitoring. Clarify that for me please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jennifer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, that’s not correct. There’s a moratorium but the only projects that
would be exempt from the moratorium are the large structural fill
projects, or small structural fill projects if they want to put in a
liner, a leachate collection system, a cap and financial assurance, and
then also the base of the paved roads by a public entity. So only those
projects that have a liner, a cap, a leachate collection system and
financial assurance, other than the paved roads, can move forward under
the moratorium.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could follow-up on that. Is the small structural the 1,000 ton
figure that I saw in there? What’s considered small, I guess?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that you’re thinking of the recordation requirement. That’s just
a recordation requirement for everything and it’s current law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. There was a lot of discussion in the Senate on the using ?? to
dispose of and there was some concern about that, so is that in this
proposal and do those mines have to have lining?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it is in this proposal and I would note that the Senate, on the
floor, made a change to the definition of mines so that only open-pit
mines that are included in the definition for structural fill.
Structural fill does allow mines to be reclaimed, coal ash to be used to
reclaim mines, but those are only open-pit or surface mines. Just like
any other large structural project, if you’re using more than 10,000
tons per acre or 100,000 tons per project, you’re going to have to have
a liner, a cap, a leachate collection system, groundwater monitoring and
financial assurance so, yes, they’re using over 100,000 tons, which
sounds like a lot but really isn’t.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you have less than 10,000 tons or 100,000 tons per area you don’t
need to have a liner? Is that what you’re saying?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you’re less than 10,000 tons per acre then you don’t have to have a
liner.</p>

Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My first question is probably one for you, for
point of order, just for my clarification maybe. This is a Senate bill
before us. We know there's a House bill out there. We have House members
presenting the Senate bill, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So is there, is the PCS a combination now? Are we going to be dealing
with a combination of a House bill and a Senate bill? This is not just
for me but other people that are probably listening in, the confusion of
what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think I'll let Mr. McGrady answer that. Representative McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, the reason we wanted to go through the Senate bill was just as the
Senate bill biult on the Governor's plan, the House bill will build upon
the Senate plan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House PCS-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House PCS will build upon the Senate bill and so to understand the House
PCS many, I would say most, of the provisions that we anticipate in the
House PCS are reflected right here in this Senate bill themselves. It's
the same process trying to deal with the same issues, some changes in
some numbers but it's really built on what you've got here. So if you
understand the Senate bill, Representative Carney, you're going to have
a very good base to understand the House PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And thank you for that. So we're getting an overview of a Senate bill,
we're going to get a House PCS bill this afternoon when we come back,
you have stated that if we want amendments, Mr. Chairman, to this bill
and then we're going to vote this afternoon on this bill or the House
bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a, Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You make, I thought that's what he was trying to clarify. The PCS, it
will be a House PCS, to this Senate bill. It will be mostly like what
you have in front of you with some tweaks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And follow-up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand that. So, but you said, Mr. Chairman, that amendments have
to be in for this part, we're going to get a PCS this afternoon and we
can't do amendments to that before the end of session is my question? If
we're going to vote this afternoon will there be an opportunity for
amendments to the PCS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The PCS will go out as soon as this is over so that you'll have time and
then, I know the notice said 15 minutes after session it was, we were
actually intending 30 minutes after to give people a little extra time
to work on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you will see the PCS when this meeting's over.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right. May I ask one more question-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
-then about the one before us. Is there, and maybe to the PCS sponsors,
is there, in this bill, a clarification of who will pay for these four
plants that are closing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is not a decision as to who will pay. There is a moratorium in
terms of Duke Energy being able to recoup it's cost related to the four
sites and anything else. But no, that decision is not in the Senate bill
nor in the anticipated House PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One follow-up. Well that is the number one question, that I think the
public has very simplified drilled down, of who is paying for this. So
when will that determination be made, at what point in time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the Senate bill were to become law, or the House PCS, that question
would be left to the Public Utility Commission if and when Duke sought
to recoup the costs of any of the things that were mandated in this
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I add to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And, as you mentioned, there's a moratorium on new rate cases for this
for a while and, as we understand and as we've seen with Utilities
Commission rate cases, it's going to be a while before the costs are
actually incurred for them to need to. So there will be other sessions
and other opportunities for people to look at that. I just remind
everybody we're the first state in the nation to do this and we're
trying to make sure</p>

we do it as responsibly as possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. The question that came up several times as I
worked through this bill was, is there anything in this bill, or are
there other bills that exist or other plans that exist, that deal with
the environmental impact now. We’re going to not do the first cleanup
for five years and finally at the end it’ll be 20 years I think, so are
there provisions for responses to the environmental impacts that go on
meanwhile?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Representative, thank you very much and if staff
would cover the well piece in here, the water identification piece, Mr.
Hudson would be fine doing it if that’s okay with you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was actually going to reference that and also the groundwater and
surface water protection pieces. Those are for the impoundments as they
are now, so they have to do assessment plans, they have to be approved
by the department. They have to give the information generated from
those plans to the department and then they have to take corrective
action, whether it be eliminating the surface water discharges, cleaning
up groundwater under the 2L rules or providing alternative drinking
water supply for drinking water wells that have experienced
contamination.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up Representative Insko?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, thanks. I’m just reviewing those sections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I want to say first that I’d agree with
Representative Carney that, for people statewide, the number one
question is whether they as consumers of Duke Energy are going to be
asked to pay for the cleanup of the four sites. My question is, and I
believe it’s for Representative Samuelson who spoke a moment ago, you
said that, before we decide whether the consumer should pay for the
cleanup or not, we have to see how expensive it is to do the cleanup and
I’m wondering if I heard you wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe you did hear me wrong. I was simply trying to say that, in
order to determine what a cost would be, that’s part of the whole
process. I personally have felt like the utilities commission and the
public staff need to be able to look at this. I’m not personally
convinced that it’s something right now we need to step in and make that
decision on, but I won’t be here next year in the long session. I’m sure
there will be others who will discuss it, but I did not say that it was
based on what the cost was. I was simply implying that process is one
that takes that long.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My observation on all of this is that we can, as the general assembly
right now, make a decision that says the public shall not bear the cost
of the cleanup of these four sites. That is something that we can do
before there’s any of the detailed studies that have been mentioned and
I just urge the committee to do just that, to require that Duke Energy
not be able to recover from consumers the cost of cleanup. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions for the committee? If not, we have some public
speakers wanting to address the committee. We’ll call them in the order
that they signed up. You’ll have three minutes. The first one’s Molly
Diggins with the Sierra Club. State your name.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I’m Molly Diggins, the
state director of the North Carolina chapter of the Sierra Club. Sierra
Club has over 55,000 members and supporters in North Carolina and we
appreciate the opportunity to speak today. Addressing our state’s coal
ash crisis is undoubtedly a great challenge. As you know, North Carolina
has 33 coal ash ponds at 14 sites across the state. These are little
more than unlined pits in close proximity to our state’s waterways.
Earlier this year, the governor started the conversation by putting
forward the administration’s plan. The Senate has moved us substantially
forward with a comprehensive measure that includes many important and
positive components. We thank the Senate for their leadership in
bringing us to this point, and especially for the aggressive timelines
in the bill, and we thank Representative Samuelson, Hager and McGrady.</p>

<p id="085:00">
for listening to our concerns about the bill as we headed into this
morning’s committee meeting. The House now has before it a tremendous
opportunity to get the job done, to finish the work that the Governor
and the Senate have begun. The single most important challenge before
the House is to make changes to ensure that the coal ash at all of the
coal ash sites is permanently isolated from surface and groundwater. As
currently written, the Senate bill only offers that written assurance
for four sites. The Senate bill lacks clear standards to ensure that the
outcome at the other sites meets that goal, which I think everyone
supports, but we also know there is a difference between good intentions
and statutes, and so today we call upon the House Environment Committee
to add standards to the Senate Bill to ensure the closure of so-called
low risk sites will accomplish what the bill is represented and intended
to do, to remove the threat from our waterways. All methods of closures
must be demonstrated to be as effective as removing the ash from the
site. Without this change, there is a real danger that the bill before
you will not live up to its promise and that it will not remove the
threat of coal ash to our waters and communities. Again, the House now
has before it and today the opportunity to in fact make this bill a
model for the nation. We look forward to working with you to achieve
that outcome. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Next we have Donna
Lisenby – am I saying that right? – with the Waterkeepers Alliance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Good morning. My name is Donna Lisenby and I
am the Global Coal Campaign Coordinator for Waterkeeper Alliance. I am
also the Watauga Riverkeeper from Watauga County, North Carolina, and
prior to that I was the Catawba River keeper and worked throughout the
Catawba river basin for ten years. My goal is to work with all North
Carolina river keepers on coal issue, and we began in 2010 working with
our French Broad River keeper to address coal ash issues at the
Asheville plant and brought litigation there. We continued, and our
Catawba River keeper addressed coal ash leaking contamination problems
at the river bin facility and brought litigation there, and then thirdly
we brought litigation on the Sutton plant in partnership with our Cape
Fear River keeper. Those three plants are the ones named in this Senate
bill, and the only other one named for immediate cleanup and guaranteed
cleanup is Dan River, where the pipe failed and there was a spill. This
bill, from the perspective of the Waterkeepers, is not adequate to
address the challenge of cleaning up coal ahs ponds in North Carolina. I
have been on these sites and investigated most of them. I have collected
well water samples, seep samples and surface water samples since 2010. I
have tested fish, sediment and water across North Carolina since 2010 at
these sites. I know firsthand that they are leaking and polluting water
in this state with arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium and many other
pollutants. It needs to be addressed immediately. My colleague Lisa
Evans called the Senate bill the tallest midget at the circus. We are
relying on the House of Representatives to increase the stature of this
bill, to make sure that it adequately addresses the leaking, polluting,
contaminated coal ash ponds across the state of North Carolina. Let me
say to you this: Based on my direct experience with all our
Waterkeepers, there is no low-risk coal ash pond in the state of North
Carolina. Not one. Specifically, the most recent investigations I’ve
conducted in partnership with our Yadkin River keeper and our Cape Fear
River keeper are at the Cape Fear plant and at the Buck plant. We tested
wells at the Buck facility and residences within a thousand feet of the
coal ash ponds there, and we found hexavalent chromium in those wells
using the most current EPA method, EPA method 218.7, for determining the
amount of hexavalent chromium in water, a test that is not required in
North Carolina or used in North Carolina currently to determine
compliance with groundwater standards.</p>

to make it a much taller and more robust that will fix the problem,

everything that house is doing on this bill and it’s great to see such
interest in this important bill, it’s wonderful to see so many extra
members in the meeting and to see so many members of the public. I’m
sure there had been more people here if they had been more access to
this fast schedule. We really thank the house for studying this issue,
investigating this issue and for listening to the citizens of North
Carolina on this issue. I thank the bill drafters for doing those three
things. But now, are you really gonna rush this bill through in a couple
of hours why? You can do this right and earn the thanks and respect of
your constituents, the people who drink from below all of these sides or
you can drop this ball in here from them the rest of the year or the
rest of the decade. I urge you to make this bill stronger and more
protective of North Carolina citizens and water and it’s simple as
mistaken to Miss. Lissome suggest. You can simply require that all of
these 33 sides must achieve isolation from ground water and surface
water. Please protect North Carolina citizens and drinking water, thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Next we have Henry Baton with the ___[02:28] County. State
your name and refer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman I’m Henry Baton with ___[02:35] root supply
company in Charlotte. I’m a consumer of Coal-Ash. Representative McGrady
said is four objectives will stop creating new ponds, do water existing
ponds establish a timetable, close ponds and clean them up and I think
that’s a value and effort but unfortunately in my opinion the bill
doesn’t go far enough. It adequately adjust the whole issue and it’s
entirety that promotes capping in place in which I need fly ash and I
don’t wanna kept in place that I can’t get through it, it promote
structural fill and the challenge with structural fill for me is we are
going from one hole to another and that’s not reused, it promotes the
study of reuse of beneficiation, the technology exist I’m not exactly
sure what we need to study and it promotes the study by the DOT the user
consumer ash frankly there is 3% of the roads are concrete now, we have
built them or I haven’t that other companies have my firm doesn’t do
that, that we do may concrete going vertically and it’s the same thing,
you can consume this ash from a DOT standpoint the bill should stipulate
the DOT implemented two payment system and reflect that the payment,
that the investment in those payments are the lowest cost option, it’s
already been proven over the last four years concretes are lower cost
option but apparently economics within the DOT or not consideration and
many states have already done this successfully, very successfully and
North Carolina be in the ninth largest coal producing state, we have to
consume it rather than bury it. And it represents the single largest new
market for this ash that exist today, Duke is come on the newspaper
saying that they are looking for new ash markets, you drive on it
everyday, it exist in the state from the beneficial reuse the technology
exist, I notices I came in there is two marketers in the room both of
them have technology that exist today to beneficially reuse it. I would
encourage you to ask them to come up and talk to you about it. And the
bill has to require…

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Next we’ll have George Everett from Duke Energy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would quickly acknowledge that reuse of coal ash is critical. We don’t
have enough places to put it if we wanted to. I would recommend actually
the senate bill to you on that, in that regard. If you go back, for
example, there are numerous areas in the senate bill that touch on the
reuse issue, aside from its use as structural fill, but specifically on
pages 48 and 49 and so I would urge you to look at the bill. It’s got
pretty good, strong, new provisions that were added by the Senate
related to the use of coal ash in concrete, in roads and in other ways
and really is strongly supportive of new technology, if it becomes
available, to deal with the coal ash issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative McGrady. Go ahead George, you’ve got the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee, my name is George
Everett. I work for Duke Energy. We appreciate the chance to be here
today to talk to you about coal ash. This is not something new to the
company, of course. The spill on February 2nd certainly focused
everybody’s attention on material that we’ve stored on our sites for 80
years, so to think that we’ve not paid attention to coal ash, and the
department has not paid attention to coal ash, is a misnomer. We
certainly understand the focus today and we want to help address this
issue in a responsible way. We have permits on these sites to manage
this coal ash in ponds. The water from those ponds is discharged, under
permit, to the waters of the state. We sample those waters to detect any
problems, as does the state. In 2006, Duke and Progress Energy first
volunteered to put monitoring wells around these ponds to determine
what’s happening to the ground water, voluntarily. One of the first
utilities in the country to do that. Eventually, those requirements were
added to our permits, so we have good data on what’s happening to the
ground water. In addition, we in the agency have tested wells, drinking
water wells, around these facilities and certainly where we think we’ve
impacted anybody’s water supply we take action to correct that, so I
just wanted to get those remarks on the record. Let me say one other
thing: Since the merger with Progress Energy, Duke and Progress together
have 14 sites where we have coal plants in the state. In the last five
years we’ve retired half of those sites. We have no ash being produced
there, so we have a record of moving forward to eliminate the generation
of ash period. The ash that we do continue to generate, we’ve changed
the process to handle it dry and put it in lined landfills permitted by
the state. In terms of this legislation, I would just say to you we’re
looking for two things: a rational approach to prioritizing the site and
doing the right cleanup at each site. As others have mentioned, every
site is different but we have a lot to do. We’ve got to do the studies
outlined in the bill to determine any impacts on the site. We’ve got to
rank those sites. Not only does the department rank those sites, they
then pass that to the new commission. The commission has to hold
hearings. After they’re ranked, we have to submit a closure plan to the
department, who moves it to the commission, who has hearings on the
closure plan. We then have to get a permit for that activity. We just
need time to do it. We’ll do it right. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you Mr. Chairman. My name is Jay Rouse. I work on behalf of the 26
electrical cooperatives of North Carolina. Most of you saw my members
when they came through town last week and I think most of them sincerely
expressed their concern about the cost of the cleanup. I applaud the
efforts of the Senate and the House in drilling down in this effort and
focusing on the cost because, ultimately, it is going to flow to the
consumer. We are wholesale customers of Duke Energy and those costs will
flow to us, so everything that is done that is based on science and fact
is good. The choices that will be made can help minimize and keep the
cost as low as possible. I just want to say thank you on behalf of the

Governor McCrory. Two statements by way of background: I don’t do this
very often, so I hope the fact that I am here today will suggest to you
the seriousness that the governor views the one comment that I want to
put before you for your consideration. Second statement by way of
background is, I’m not here to talk about the substance of the bill. I
believe the governor believes that this does build on his platform
properly, there’s perhaps some technical changes that need to be made,
but here’s what I want to talk to you about: this bill creates a coal
commission. That commission, in our view, performs an executive branch
function and let me tell you, I know everybody knows this but it’s
important for me to say it for the record, we have in our state
constitution the premise of separation of powers and, very simply, what
that means is the legislature, you folks, pass the laws, the executive
branch carries out the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the
laws. This coal commission performs an executive branch function. It is
appointed, unfortunately, six by the legislature and only three by the
governor. That, in our opinion, and based on our research, violates the
provisions of separation of powers and I would encourage you to look at
that again, to look at how the appointment process. I have no problem
with the commission. I have no problem with the commission at all. I
simply would encourage you and ask you to look again at the appointment
process for this commission. The appointments need to be made by the
executive branch to a body that will carry out the executive branch
function. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Hager, do you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do. Mr. Stephens, I happened to take a picture of section eight
of our constitution about appointments in the executive branch. Let me
read it to you, see where I may be confused at. It says the governor
shall nominate and, by with all advice and consent of the majority of
Senate, appoint all officers whose appointment are not otherwise
provided for. Is that the section you’re talking about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I’m not. I’m talking about separation of powers, which is in article
I. There’s no question that the legislature creates commissions all the
time, the legislature makes appointments to commissions all the time.
Representative, that’s not a problem. You have to look at what the body
does that has been created. What does it do? Is it an advisory
committee? If so, I think the legislature makes the appointments, can
decide how the appointments ought to be made, under the section you just
read. On the other hand, if it is a body that performs, that actually
carries out the law, in this case the coal ash commission will review</p>

…Classification of the ___[00:04] and then it will review and approve
closer plans. Now, that’s carrying out the law that is carrying out the
law and ballots.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Representative Harris.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Steve that I guess you probably figure out and respectively
disagree. We does things all the time like the Mine and Energy
Commission, Utility Commission, the Board of Governors will point all
these votes. Mine and Energy Commission…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And the Governor…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, and we approve it, Mine and Energy Commissions are the one we have
done here recently, would you consider that a violation of separate
powers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do consider that and by the Utility Commission as you mentioned does
all the Government employments, the confirmation we are not I don’t have
an issue with confirmation. That’s clearly said out in the constitution
that if this body decides that appointments need to be confirmed and
that is certainly you are right, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman just a re-follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Steve I think, yeah I would pull this body and I think it’s probably
the responsibility this budget continue to do as we have done before, I
think we have all rights to be point on Mine and Energy Commission as we
do in Ash-Management Commission and I thank that we will have the
further discussions on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I understand this and thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Steve, if the questions from the committee comments, if
not we will adjourn the committee we will see you 15 minutes after
session today. Okay, I forward you the notice 01:15 we will make it to
30, 45 anyway.
