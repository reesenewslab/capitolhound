Scouts, Scouters and all citizens would endeavor to do just that, and we

your son and my savior. Amen.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House resolution 57, Representatives Jones, Dollar, Iler, and J. Bell.
The House resolution honoring the boy scouts of America and the Order of
the Arrow. Whereas, the boy scouts of America was founded February 8,
1910 upon the promises of the scout oath to do one&#39;s duty to God and
country, to others, and to one&#39;s self upon the principles of the
scout law. And whereas, five years after the founding of the boy scouts,
scout leaders recognized the need for a special recognition of those
scouts who truly committed themselves to living by both the scout oath
and the scout law. And whereas, in response, the boy scouts of America,
created the law of, the order of the arrow, scouting national honor
society. And whereas the order of the arrow recognizes those scouts and
scouters who exemplify the character qualities of scouting, practice
responsible camping methods, encourage growth in scouting ideals for
their peers and leading service to others. And whereas since 1915, North
Carolina has benefited from the multitude of the Order of the Arrows
service projects and the leadership skills the Order of the Arrow
produces in its members&#39; personal and professional lives. And
whereas, North Carolina is currently home to nearly 6,000 Order of the
Arrow members, and the Order of the Arrow provides annually more than
30,000 hours of service to local communities. And whereas, in
celebration of the Order of the Arrows&#39; centennial anniversary,
North Carolina orders the, Order of the Arrows chapters have together
committed to perform at least one service project in each of our 100
counties. Now therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives,
section one, the House of Representatives honors the rich character of
the boy scouts of America and the Order of the Arrow and expresses its
appreciation to the members of these organizations for their committed
to improving the lives of the citizens of this state. Section two, the
principle clerk should submit a certified copy of this resolution to the
National Council of boy scouts of America. Section three, this
resolution is effective upon adoption.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, it is an
honor to rise and stand and speak briefly about the Boy Scouts of
America and the Order of the Arrow. There is no doubt that countless
thousands of North Carolina citizens over the years have been positively
impacted by these organizations

  I hope you were listening earlier as the scouts recited the scout oath
and the scout law. On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to my God
and my country, to obey the scout law, to help other people, and to keep
myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight. What a
better place this world would be if everyone committed to the scout
oath. Or the scout law. A scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful,
friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and
reverent. You know, those are the kinds of traits that we want to see in
our leaders. Those are the kind of traits that we want to see in all of
our citizens. As I stand here today and speak of the Boy Scouts of
America, I trust that those ideals are those that we would aspire to. I
do want to recognize members of this body that have been directly
impacted. We have several Eagle Scouts. We have members of the Order of
the Arrow, and we have the parents of some Eagle Scouts as well and
I&#39;m going to ask you if you will to stand as I call your name. Eagle
Scouts in this chamber, Representative Frank Iler, Representative Steve
Ross, Representative Carl Ford, Representative Ken Waddell,
Representative Don Zoca, Representative Nelson Dollar, our speaker
today, Representative Justin Burr, and Representative John Bell. And
also members of the Order of the Arrow include Representative Gary
Pendleton and Representative Dean Arp. Now we have some proud parents
here today too of Eagle Scouts. Some multiple Eagle Scouts by the way.
Representative Jay Adams, Representative John Zoca, Representative Gary
Pendleton, Representative Hugh Blackwell – three sons, Representative
Susan Fischer, and Representative Jimmy Dixon. And if I&#39;ve left out
anyone, those were all the emails that I received, but I would advise
you and ask you to stand and recognize yourself when I&#39;m completed.
But just to close, I want to thank the Boy Scouts of America and the
Order of the Arrow for the high ideals on which they were founded, for
the many, many lives that have been positively impacting, including
mine. And I would say that many of us learned many of our early skills
in leadership and many of the ways of life even camping and things like
that, that it&#39;s a good thing for boys to know. And so proud to be a
scout, proud to be an Eagle Scout, and it&#39;s wonderful to see all
these scouts and scouters from across the state today. God bless you.
God bless the mission of the Boy Scouts of America and the Order of the
Arrow. Thank you Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Wayne
County, Representative Bell, is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, as a
young man growing up, I had the well, it starts off in first grade I
remember when I was sitting in the classroom and a guy came in and said
you can do this, you can go camping, you can do all these sorts of
things and I said well I gotta be a part of that. And that was when my
journey in scouting started and led to me growing up in Pack 34 in Mt.
Olive, North Carolina and then growing into Troop 200 in Mt. Olive. I
then of course, they call it the fumes in scouting, perfume and
gasoline, I got away from scouting for a little bit but when I got out
of college I didn&#39;t know what I was going to do. And the Boy Scouts
of America offered me my first job. And I look int eh gallery and I
actually see John Ackerman who was my area director when I first got
hired by the scouts, and then being a single young man, about 25 years
old, they offered me a promotion to move to Panama City Beach, Florida,
which I had to think about for all of two minutes, and ended up down in
the Gulf Coast Council and served there for two years. You know as many
of you have volunteered and been a part of scouting, they say it&#39;s
only one hour a week. And we all kind of laugh as we know it&#39;s a lot
more than that. And it seems just as I thought I was getting away from
scouting not only did I find myself as a charter rep for my home troop
but I just joined the Tuscarora Council Board. And so it&#39;s become a
way of life for my family. I was a member of the Order of the Arrow
brotherhood member, I&#39;m an Eagle Scout, and my grandmother who
passed away two years ago was very honored because all of her grandsons
were Eagle Scouts. So it&#39;s a family tradition in my family, I think
of what it&#39;s done for my career professionally but also what
it&#39;s done for me personally. So, I commend the resolution.

  The gentleman from Alamance County, Representative Ross, is recognized
to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen of the chamber, I too have a long tradition, much
maybe longer than my esteemed colleague in scouting and I&#39;ve stayed
involved in scouting over the years because of what scouting did for me
and I never miss an opportunity to go back to my district and
participate in an Eagle Scout ceremony and I know Justice Newby has been
in my district for Eagle Scout ceremonies and I thank you for that.
It&#39;s that important for those of us who want to see young people
come along now and receive the values and the service and leadership
that we got out of scouting when we came through. One of the first
things that a lot of scouts will ask me when I do participate in one of
the Eagle ceremonies or an [??] ceremony for that matter, is why you do
what you do now in Raleigh and the answer that I always come back with
is that it goes all the way back to my first days in scouting and all
the way through scouting up to the point where I got my Eagle and the
things that were instilled in me, leadership, service, love for God and
country, and it sticks with you and that&#39;s why they say and I have a
medallion on my desk in my office, once an Eagle, always an Eagle. And I
think scouting for me is one of the reasons why I&#39;ve done some of
the things I&#39;ve done and hope to do more in the future, but it has
certainly blessed me in my life. One of the things that I had hoped for
when I was younger was that at one point I would have a son and I could
put him through scouts and make an Eagle out of him, but God blessed me
with four wonderful daughters, and no boys, so I&#39;m working on a
grandson right now trying to get him through. But scouting is a
tremendous opportunity for our youth and as Representative Jones said,
what a great world we could have if we could get every young person to
go through the things that we went through and one of the things that we
went through when we went through scouting. I commend the resolution to
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ross, if you had maybe one more
you would be ready for Adventure Crew, so there&#39;s an option there
for you. The gentleman from Orange County, Representative Meyer is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen I am not a Boy Scout and don&#39;t have a family affiliation
but one of the things that I try to do to contribute to society in a way
that&#39;s more productive than being a member of the North Carolina
House is I train adults to work with youth, people mentoring programs,
afterschool programs, all kinds of things. One of the holy grails for
youth work is developing a program that teaches young people to be
self-motivated, to improve themselves and improve their communities, to
go beyond just providing them a structure and some time and some
activities, but actually get them to take over responsibility for their
own growth, and as far as I can tell there is no better program for than
than the Boy Scouts of America, and I know how much work it takes from
all the adults who volunteer and give their time to work with these
young men and I know how much it takes from these young men to improve
themselves and the world around them. I commend them and I commend the
resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman
from Cabarrus County, Representative Pittman wish to be recognized. The
Gentleman from Brunswick County, Representative Iler is recognized to
debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
We&#39;re gonna have to work on the length of this cord here. I
can&#39;t say it any more eloquently than my colleagues have said about
scouting. I will talk about the north generational aspects. My father
was a life scout. He always regretted not being Eagle and he was very
active as an adult scouter [??]. I was an Eagle scout. My son

  Determine that he was gonna be an eagle and when, if he had sons, they
were gonna be eagles. And so that has come to pass. My son lives in
Representative Fraley&#39;s district. I believe ya&#39;ll had met, and
he had three boys, and as of last December, the first of December, his
third son got his eagle scout. So we have a whole nest of eagles when we
all get together at my son&#39;s house. And so he&#39;s got three sons
that are eagles and himself and myself, so. I want to talk about the
multigenerational aspects, how you pass along the best that you can pass
along, and scouting&#39;s a big part of that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative from Cumberland County, the gentleman from Cumberland
County, Representative Lucas is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister Speaker. I was somewhat reluctant to stand and speak
on the scouting record, resolution because I am a lesser known scout.
It&#39;s really, really intimidating to be among these, this number of
eagle scouts. I only ascribed to star. But nonetheless, I am proud to
support this resolution. I entered scouting at an early age down in
Fayetteville, North Carolina and served in troop 180 of the Occoneechee
council, and one of the highlights of my early career was the annual
trek to, at that time, Reedy Creek State Park, where we stayed for two
weeks at a time. That&#39;s now known as the town of Cary. So I date
myself, but the experience of enjoying scouting still stands with me,
and I commend this resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas, you will be pleased to know that probably the
place you camped at, although it&#39;s not on the map anymore, the,
actually remains of it still there. So we&#39;ll have, we need to go
over there and check that out sometime. Further discussion, further
debate. Hearing none, the gentleman from Wake County, Representative
Pendleton is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I just want to say some words about my career in scouting. It
meant so much to me. I&#39;m an army brat so when we get transferred
from Fort Bragg to Germany, we went on the, we were there for the
fiftieth anniversary of scouting, and we went to England on the ferry
and camped out, and it rained every day for eleven days in sunny old
England. Then when I got back, and I had a son, I decided I was gonna
teach merit badges, so I taught eagle specific merit badges that
don&#39;t involve going out into the woods. Yes I did go out in the
woods, and I camped once a month, and I&#39;d get up in the morning and
said oh, my word, I&#39;ve got to go sleep on the ground tonight. But I
got motivated as I went out with the boys and I had a great time. I took
my troop to Philmont scout ranch in New Mexico for and, and Philmont
scout ranch is 174 thousand acres, and you backpack , and you carry
everything on your back, and 53 years old. It was tough, but I really
enjoyed it, And I was present at the Occoneechee boy scouts twice. I
love the boy scouts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. Hearing none, the question before
the House is the adoption of House Resolution 57. All those in favor

[pause]
Speaker: Stephen, let me say no one, not even the Governor, has had that
distinguished of an escort committee. The gentleman has the floor.
Speaker Change: Members of the North Carolina house of representatives,
it is my honor and privilege to be able to present to you this year’s
Boy scouts report to the state. The year 2015 holds special significance
for us as it marks the centennial year of the Boy scouts Honor Society
Order of the Air. The Order of Air are most commonly known as OA was
founded in 1915 on the principles of brotherhood, cheerfulness, and
service. These principles have led us to the place we are today 100
years later. The founders sought for a way to recognize Honor campers
who went above and beyond commitment to outdoor merit and participation
in service to the community. Members are elected by their peers and
continue to service, both in their troop and the community, and in the
OA for life. The Order of the Air of North Carolina are special as it
contributes service not only with the boy scouts of America but also
throughout in the community. Only five percent of Boy scout members are
in the Order of the Air. In North Carolina that equates to around five
thousand, six thousand members. Currently this year these Air men have
contributed over five thousand hours of service in projects throughout
North Carolina. Examples of these include working in Swannanoa North
Carolina for a Toys for Tots event, providing Chili and service in
setting up and taking down. Another example is in Winston Salem, working
to promote awareness for Cystic Fibrosis and raise money for the cause.
This year in North Carolina there are a total of 71,618 youth members.
The Order of the Air makes up 5,837 of that. It is a great honor to be
able to speak in front of you today and represent hose members. In
addition to the service that the OA has provided in the past year, we
are committing ourselves to service throughout the next year through
providing a service project in all 100 counties throughout North
Carolina.

  We hope that this will allow us to continue in cheerful service to all
the districts that you represent, including to be able to make the bond
for the next 100 years that will propel us forward. We thank you for
your support and look forward to continuing our service to the community
during this historic year. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We thank you for
that report. If we could have a couple of individuals, House members,
come up to escort Mr. ?? out of the, or to the back of the Chamber. I
would mention as sort of a personal note, I had the privilege or holding
his job back in 1981/82, some many, many years ago, and I’m glad to see
that the section has since recovered and it’s doing… seems to be doing
reasonably well these days, but I think that it’s wonderful to note that
the Delaware… the Order of the Arrow in the Delaware is ??, which means
“The Brotherhood of Cheerful Service”, and these young men that you see
in the back wearing these arrows, they are truly young men who will be
leaders in our future, and they are learning leadership skills and they
are learning service and they are learning to serve in a way that is
cheerful and that builds character and that will be with them throughout
their lives, and we thank you for your commitment as young men to the
Order of the Arrow; we than you for your commitment to your units, to
your troops and those who you serve there; and we also extend on behalf
of the House tanks to all of those scout leaders who are here this
evening for all the volunteer work that you do. These young men could
not do it without your help and your guidance and your assistance, and
we thank all of the professionals, and I believe Representative Bell
mentioned that he had been a professional at one point and he’s a
recovering professional scouter, but these professionals, having known
many of them, some up in the gallery, they work long and hard.
Legislators, you can relate to them. They work unusual hours sometimes,
and all for the good of preparing our next generation of leaders and
next generation of citizens to carry our state and nation forward, so we
thank you. We very much thank you for that. Clerk will read changes to

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Justice Newby, raise your hand.  Who recognizes Paul?
About ten years ago Paul was down at the beach and there was a riptide
and there were two people drowning and he put his life at risk and went
into the sea and saved those two peoples’ lives and he received the
highest medal in the Boy Scouts of America for saving those two peoples’
lives.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purposes does the representative from Surry
County, representative Stevens, wish to be recognized?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To a point of order, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I didn’t want to interrupt
the young boycott as he was giving us his story, and I wanted to comment
on their respect and humility that they’ve treated this body with.
That’s been absolutely amazing and I appreciate that. One thing I’m very
disappointed about is that we’ve got the protesters back now, to the
point that I could hear them up here and they were distracting me from
that speech.  I certainly hope it’s something we can work toward
resolution and that these boys recognize that as disrespectful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Noted.  The gentleman from Rockingham County,
Representative Jones is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may make his announcement.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentleman of the
house, I know that we all have opportunities in life to enjoy many
things.  I recount a story, I used to be an 81 millimeter mortar platoon
commander at camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  Used to be a forward air
controller, and we had a lot of communities around the base where people
resided, both retired marines as well as regular citizens.  We would
always get phone calls, though, whenever we would be out shooting,
whether it was artillery or naval gunfire or even close air support, the
loud sounds that people would hear, people would call back to the base
and complain.  And what we would always tell them would be, “That’s the
sound of freedom.  That’s the sound of freedom.”  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston County
wish to be recognized?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Everyone else was calling
notices and announcements to their appropriations meeting, I thought I
would add, if anyone doesn’t have anything to do tomorrow at 8:30, for
some real fun and excitement, they could check in to the transportation
appropriations.  It’s 8:30, 1228.  There will be a little bit of math,
but there is no test tomorrow. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Are you offering coffee and donuts as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Coffee, Mr. Speaker.

Representative Torbid is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I move that the house now
adjourns to reconvene Tuesday, February 10th, at 3 o’clock pm.
