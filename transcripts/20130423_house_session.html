[SPEAKER CHANGES] Whereas on December the twenty-first 1846 the general
assembly enacted legislation creating Gaston County from the southern
portion of Lincoln County, and whereas the town of Dallas was laid out
in the geographic center of Gaston County to serve as the county seat.
And whereas the town consisted of seventy-five acres of
partially-forested farmland purchased from Jesse Holland...</p>

the town was named in honor of George Mifflin Dallas of Pennsylvania,
who served as vice president of the United States under President James
K. Polk. Whereas the court house was built in the simple square
surrounded by a jail, law offices, hotels, stores, and restaurants. And
whereas in the early 1870s leaders of the town supposedly declined an
opportunity to have a railroad come through the town and establish a
depot. And whereas in the early 1900s a majority of the people in Gaston
County voted to move the seat of the county government from Dallas to
Gastonia. And whereas Dallas has a well preserved historic district that
is registered with the national register of historic places and contains
more historic buildings than any other place in Gaston County. And
whereas, as part of the towns 150th birthday the residents of Dallas
have pledged to restore the towns historic courthouse. And whereas the
towns residents are very proud of their heritage and small town friendly
atmosphere. And whereas the towns 150 anniversary  is worthy of
recognition and celebration and should be supported by all North
Carolinians, now be it resolved by the house of representatives. Section
1, the house of representatives honors the founders of the town of
Dallas and extends congratulations to the town on its 150th anniversary.
Section 2, the principal clerk shall transmit a certified copy of this
resolution to the mayor of the town of Dallas. Section 3, This
resolution is effected upon adoption. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Hastings is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker, first of all I wanted to say that it is an honor to represent
Cleveland and Gaston counties. Both of those counties are of historical
significance, but today I wanted to focus on Dallas North Carolina and
its 150th anniversary. And Dallas is in Gaston County. I think the
reading of the resolution and recent events embody the historical nature
of Dallas. Recently those of you who follow Dallas will remember that
President Friday passed away, and also recently our former longtime
senator and secretary of revenue David Hoyle retired from public
service. It's a lot of fun representing so many influential people. In
fact, last year, or in the last bienium, in general government
appropriation when secretary Hoyle came to our committee I jokingly
reminded him that he was one of my constituitents. In closing, Mr.
Speaker, I just want to say what an honor it is to represent Dallas  and
the whole 110th house district of North Carolina, and on behalf of the
Gaston delegation I commend the resolution and would ask for your
support. Thank  you sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate? If not the question before the house is the passage of house
resolution 668, or the adoption of the resolution. All in favor vote
aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will
let the machine record the vote. 114 having voted in the affirmative and
none in the negative the house resolution 668 has been adopted and will

of the gallery to another group of students that have entered the
chamber. It's a group of students from Cheryl's Ford Elementary. I would
like to welcome the students, the teachers, and the parent chaperone.
Please stand and let us welcome you. The clerk will read the resolution

the public school will celebrate its 100th anniversary on June 6th,
2013. Whereas the school was originally named Fayetteville High School
and was renamed Terry Sanford Senior High School in 1968 in honor of

And whereas in later years the school became Terry Sanford High School,

whereas Terry Sanford High School offers honors level classes in most
academic areas, offers most AP advanced placement in Cumberland County
and opened its Global Studies program in 1999, and whereas all alumni
are appreciated and respected for their contributions to their community

athletes, chancellors, an NFL owner, rappers, producers, a Pulitzer
Prize winning photographer and game show contestants. And whereas in
2006, Terry Sanford High School was recognized by US News and World
Report for receiving the silver medal in the annual list of America’s
Best High Schools, and whereas for 100 years, Terry Sanford High School
has provided an outstanding education to its student. Now therefore, be
it resolved by the House of Representatives.
Section one, the House of Representatives honors of the memory of former
governor and United States Senator Terry Sanford and extends the
congratulations to the public high school that bears his name on the
school’s 100th anniversary.

this resolution to the principal of Terry Sanford High School and to the
chair of the Cumberland County board of education.
Section four, this resolution is effective upon adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Szoka is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s my distinct pleasure today to talk about
Terry Sanford High School. Terry Sanford High School has been committed
to civic education since its very beginning. The school was among the
first high schools in North Carolina to have a student government and it
continues that strong tradition of leadership and service today. In
2011, the campaign for the civic mission of the schools listed Terry
Sanford High School as one of 11 model schools in the entire United
States for civic instruction because of its commitment to help create
citizens who have the knowledge skills and virtues to sustain and
strengthen democracy with an ever more diverse population. During its
history, numerous organizations within the school have been recognized
for outstanding public service and community activism.To name just a
few, The National Honor Society has twice been named of the National
Service Award which is given to only ten high schools and middle schools
in the United States each year. The Technology Student Association, a
new group in Terry Sanford, won the North Carolina chapter of the year
in only its second year of existence. I could go on and on, but I won’t
because every student organization in there has made significant
contributions not only to the school but to the community. From it’s
first state football championship in 1921, undefeated and unscored on
then to the very present. The Terry Sanford Bulldogs have filled their
trophy cases with conference titles in regional and state championship
in 20 varsity sports. The school centennial motto of celebrating our
past and embracing our future is most appropriate in capturing the
positive attributes of its students and staff. I ask you for your
support on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
please state your purpose.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Member, Terry Sanford High School holds a
special place for me for a number of reasons. Both of my children
attended and graduated from this high school. It is in the heart of what
used to be my school board district and now my house district. I
have...both Lisa and I have spent probably more time at Terry Sanford
than some days at our house. It is an exceptional high school. An
exceptional public high school with an enormously diverse student body
and an extremely rich and rigorous curriculum. It is a school of about
1500 students, and although that has moved a little bit either way,
that’s about what it’s been for quite some time. Over the years,
particularly the last...</p>

20. It has sent hundreds of students to the North Carolina School of the
Arts, to the North Carolina School of Science and Math and to the
Governor's School. It has won state competitions and competed for the
state as a state representative in national competitions and science
olympiad, in Princeton Model Congress and in the Moot and mock trial
competitions, having won several
state championships. It is a school that has started, as Representative
Szoka said, before most schools in the state were even talking about
international and global studies.
It has had a global studies academy that now has somewhere between four
and five hundred students in it each year. And it is a school that has
deep roots in recognition that extracurricular and community experiences
are critical aspects of going to school in the arts, in athletics, in
cooperative, in clerkships and internships. And all I can tell you is
from my perspective and it's what every parent hopes that they can say:
the teachers, the faculty and the staff at Terry Sanford made my
children kinder and wiser and better human beings and for that I will be
forever grateful. I commend the
resolution to you.

[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. You've heard
Representatives Szoka and Glazier share with you the academic exports
and the additional extraterritorial exports of Terry Sanford High
School. Back when I was a youngster I remember this school by the name
of Fayetteville Senior High School and Fayetteville Senior High School
was known throughout the state and indeed many parts of the country as
being a leading institution in academics and extracurricular activities,
including sports.
That tradition continued to the extent that the former governor whose
name now bears that namesake, Terry Sanford, the former governor of the
state of North Carolina. Terry Sanford continued it's tradition of
excellence and rich heritage along the way and they've produced many,
many favorite sons. Among them, you many recognize some of them. Surgeon
Rusty Clark, from the University of North Carolina and also a basketball
player who helped them win the ACC Championship. Vann Williford, not to
be outdone, helped them win an ACC Championship with NC State. They
continued on in those traditions with academics and with sports.
Shea Ralph helped them win a national championship at the University of
Connecticut and she still serves there as an assistant coach and they
just won another national championship. They make us proud here in North
Carolina. We could go on to mention others. You might recall that
someone mentioned that they've had graduates who have gone on to be
professional owners. Our current Carolina Panthers, owned by Jerry
Richardson who is a graduate of Terry Sanford High School.  So, I
commend the resolution too.

[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Mister Speaker. All has been said about this great institution. I just
simply want to say that when I arrived in Fayetteville as a youth
attending Fayetteville State University, there was a clock that sit at
Terry Sanford. That clock was taken down and today it is placed in
another location. But when we look at, if we just take time to look at a
hundred years of anything, it has to be great. A hundred years of
anything being in existence and those students that walk through the
door, I simply want to commend this resolution to you today.

Association, and to initiate mediation to try to resolve the dispute
prior to filing a civil action.” General Assembly of North Carolina

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a
bill to try to have more Homeowners' Association disputes settled
through mediation rather than through litigation. I had a constituent
bring this idea to me, and we worked it out with all the different
levels of mediators including the Federal mediators, and with the
Homeowners' Association lobbyists and with the Bar Association, and
everybody has come to agreement that this would be a better way to go
for folks. We're not making it mandatory, but we're encouraging people
to do it, providing regular notices to members of Homeowners'
Associations of how they can do it, and I commend the bill to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Duane Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As I disclosed in committee, this is what I do for a
living, I'm a Real Estate attorney, but if anything I think this will
hurt my business because the goal is to reduce costly litigation. The
bill does not address money, as far as disputes over fees or
assessments. It's simply the other type things you were probably
thinking, like when there's a dispute over a barking dog, the type of
fence or shrub you can plant, and the color you can paint your house,
height of a fence, where you can put it. Or in the case of some of my
redneck family, how many TVs you can have on the front porch or
recliners out there. I've talked to quite a few realtors and everyone I
work with in the business, they all seem to be extremely in favor of
this. I hope you'll support this bill.
