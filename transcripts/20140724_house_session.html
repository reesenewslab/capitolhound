board of Directors for the Charter School, to Amend the Date by which
the Board of Education Shall make Decisions on Charter School,
Applications, to Allow a Charter School to Expand One Grade Higher than

Years’. The Senate and House agreed to the following amendment to the
House committee substitute, favorable 6/23/14, fifth edition engrossed
June 26th 2014. The Senate concurs and the House committee substitute is
amended. Delete the entire House committee substitute favorable June
23rd 2014 for the edition engrossed June 26th 2014 and substitute the
attached proposed conference committee substitute, Senate Bill 793 PCS
45224RQ3. The conferees recommend that the Senate and the House of

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Calendar without objection for today’s – [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Objection. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection having been raised,
Representative Moore is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker, we move that the rules be suspended so that the conference
report can be added to today’s calendar and would ask to be recognized
for that purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, members, and I respect my good
friend from Mecklenburg who objected to the bill being added to today’s
calendar but would ask that if there’s objection, the bill voted up,
voted down, but we’re trying to move bills along so that we can get out
of here, and we’re trying to deal with a schedule and we’re trying to
have a short week. Next week we don’t know what days precisely at this
point we’ll be back, and so the more we can dispose of today and not
have to be here for example tomorrow would probably be beneficial, so I
would ask the body to vote affirmatively to allow the bill to be added
to today’s calendar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate on the motion? The motion by Representative Moore is to suspend
the rules so that Senate Bill 793 could be added to today’s calendar.
All in favor vote aye. Representative Cotham, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair
has already called the vote but will extend the courtesy after having
called the vote. The lady has the floor. The lady will be the only
member recognized for that purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker and members, and I certainly do understand wanting to get rid of
bills and move forward, but we did have a whole week and weeks and weeks
that we could have looked at this issue, and my reason for objecting to
this conference report as a conferee and someone who was in the
conferences, simply that my caucus has not seen this conference report.
This just came up. There are some changes, I think there are some public
issues that we should discuss, and so I would request that my caucus and
really everyone have the opportunity to read this conference report, to
see it because we all to have something at stake here, and so I would
ask you to vote no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before the House is
the motion to suspend the rules so that Senate Bill 793 may e added to
today’s calendar. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk
will open the vote. The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.
69 having voted in the affirmative, 36 in the negative, the motion
passes. I’m sorry, the Chair stands corrected. The motion… Chair stands
corrected. I had the calendar wrong. The motion fails. It required
two-third majority. Ladies and gentlemen, it is the intent of the Chair
– and the lady’s points well-taken in terms of the additional time. It
is the intent of the Chair to dispose of this conference report the
week, which may be, and there may be other matters that will necessitate
that anyway, but most</p>

For all of us. And we can always take that example, put it in our
hearts, put it in our lives and let it help us live out our days so that
one day when we pass, folks can look at us and say – that’s the type of
life god intends for us to live. He exemplified that in all ways and I
commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, Jim
Fulghum was an overnight success in politics. At least that’s the way it
looked to the outside world. He ran for office, he won and he came to
sit in this seat to my left. But, for those of us in Wake County, we
know that Jim Fulghum spent a lot of time in politics. It was in the
background. He was a very strong supporter and he was someone you could
count on. And even through those years when he built up those
connections and those bases of power, if you wanna refer to him that
way, I don’t know that I have ever met a more humble, self-effacing man.
He worked for his state and cared so much for the people that he came
here to legislate for and he spent 35 years of his life healing in a
literal sense. And, we’ll speak a lot of [flowy], glowing words here but
none of them can really capture the essence of who the man was and what
he leaves behind with his family and with all the people’s lives that he
touched in the years that he served as a healer, a legislator, a
supporter of the art and I would just ask that we would all in some
small way try to emulate the life that Jim Fulghum lived. I recommend
that resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Grier Martin is recognized to debate
the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members, like some
of the folks here, I had an opportunity to know Jim before his overnight
success in politics. I came to know him as Emily’s dad. Emily and
Patrick are good friends of Louise and mine and was pleased to see that
Jim sought to represent which, before ?? was a portion of ?? district.
And it’s a portion of ?? district that I think was much happier having
Jim represent them than they were with my representation. But Jim, as
you may already have known or have learnt since his passing as we do
with people who have passed, we review their accomplishments and their
lives. Jim was a soldier who volunteered to serve in desert storm;
clearly he had the heart of a soldier. What you may not know is that he
also had the kidney of a soldier. His son-in-law, Patrick Roberson was a
dentist with 82nd airborne division and gave his kidney to Jim. So you
can see that Jim’s legacy is perpetuating itself in the kind of a person
that his daughter married. Heart of a soldier, kidney of a soldier; but
in the end the reason we love Jim and what made him such an effective
legislator was that he had a heart full of compassion. Whether you
viewed him as a compassionate conservative, I don’t know but his
compassion is an example that those of us on the left and on the right
should seek to emulate. Mr. Speaker, I almost regret that we’re doing
this resolution now. I enjoy these resolutions many times when they’re a
year after the passing of a dear one because we can look back and cry a
little bit more but also laugh and I’m just not in a mood to laugh about
Jim’s passing right now at all. But I can tell you that in the end even
after all his work in the community as a doctor, as a volunteer, as a
soldier and here in the General Assembly; in the end, Jim’s legacy is
gonna live on in his family and if you haven’t already, I’d like to
encourage you to meet his granddaughter, Margret Roberson who is a force
of nature in her own right and may very well end up here in a few
decades and I think she could possibly be just as good as her granddaddy
was. As the speaker protem, my friend from Wake County said it would be
nice if we could have 73 or 120 Jim Fulghums. Regretfully, that’s an
impossibility but if all 120 of us can seek in some small way to emulate
Jim’s compassion, this would be a lot better place. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Millis is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is a tremendous honor.</p>

<p id="025:00">
Privileged that I get a chance to rise up and speak a little bit about
Dr. Fulghum. As a fellow freshman legislator, it's very unfortunate that
I've only been able to spend two years with Dr. Fulghum, and really all
the stories and all the actual perspective, all the insight in his
character and integrity, I've only had the ability to actually
experience that over this last twenty four months or less. But I do want
to share with you one story that is really ingrained in my mind and it's
kinda burned in my heart that really represents a lot of Dr. Fulghum's
character. I don’t know if you all remember, but there was a bill that
came before us, it may be one of the first bills that Dr. Fulghum had
the opportunity to bring before the rest of the body, and that was House
bill 105. Which had a Senate companion, Senate bill 98 that actually
made it into session law, but Dr. Fulghum brought before us Senate bill
105, which had to do with the actual screening of newborns to be able to
reveal aspects of some possible heart issues. And I don't know if you
recall or not, but the bill was actually heard on a Thursday, and
because of the nature of the bill, it was only able to be heard a, for a
second reading, a third was not allowed on that very same day. And Dr.
Fulghum stood up and asked the speaker, why is there not a third
reading? And I think it was basically kinda put out there from
Representative Moore that it had to be heard separately on a third day,
by the rules. And Dr. Fulghum stood up and asked for a suspension of the
rules. And there were some murmurs, some clamoring, well it might not be
good to suspend the rules for this one bill, just kinda be patient,
kinda wait on that aspect, but I really think it shows a lot about Dr.
Fulghum's character, and the fact that he had a tremendous sense of
urgency of the lives that that bill would have protected. The infants
that were being born that could have had that screening and the ability
for doctors to be able to realize there may be initial, an actual
initial heart defect and for them to be able to save that child's life.
And the ironic thing about it is that Dr. Fulghum stood here asking for
a suspension of rules because of those children and their lives, that
who would have known that his very life was in question at that time. I
think it shows a tremendous aspect about his character and integrity,
and I'm very humbled to have the opportunity to serve with him. He was
a, a tremendous, and an actual great man. I commend the resolution to
you mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. As the
bible says in Ecclesiastes, there's a time for everything under the
earth, a season for every purpose, a time to be born, and a time to die.
Dr. Fulghum, you've heard from the testimonies here, certainly taught us
how to live, but he certainly taught us how to die. Rarely have I seen a
man touch as many people in the way that he died. And the beautiful
service that he had yesterday at his funeral was just a living testimony
to the type of person he, he was. We have, we have all benefited from
his life, and I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. I got to know Dr. Fulghum before I was in
politics, I, I'm sure, I'm very confident he was politically active, but
I got to know him as a prescriber. And, and got to know his patients,
mutual patients that we shared. I'm gonna miss him as a, as a physician,
in this body. We don't have, we don't have another physician that's
gonna serve, that's running to serve. We're not gonna have that in the
entire general assembly for the next three years. Mark Hollo's physician
assistant, he's retiring this year. I don't like being the only guy that
knows stuff about medicine in this body. It's nice to have someone else
we can rely on. And we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna miss that in
the next, throughout the rest of this session and the next biennium. But
I got to know Dr. Fulghum through mutual patients, and not every patient
likes their doctor. Everybody liked Dr. Fulghum. Everybody. And he was a
real entrepreneur but a real caregiver, and he gave care to us. How
many, I, I won't ask you to raise your hand, but how many, how many of
you folks got a prescription written by Dr. Fulghum while we were in
session? He took care of us. He took care of us. Okay. And I think we
need to lift his family up in our prayers on a continual basis as they
deal with this and the state of North Carolina lost a caregiver this,
this past, in the past seven days. And we celebrate his life, and I
commend the resolution.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Farmer-Butterfield is recognized to debate the
Resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I served on Health and
Human Services, the full Appropriations Committee, and Regulatory Reform
with Dr. Fulghum. He and I often spoke about issues of importance. We
talked about issues for Medicaid to infant screening to people
intellectual disabilities, and indeed tanning beds. We compared notes
and we often respected each other’s opinion regardless of party. To me,
he was a kind spirit who felt good about himself and within himself and
the state of North Carolina is far better off because of his services to
this body and to his patients. Everyone who was at his visitation, this
week, can attest to the fact that he was a very special and important
gentleman. How many people would stay in line for one or two hours at a
visitation to acknowledge the family and express honor and appreciation
for such a gentleman as Dr. Jim Fulgham. I am so honored and pleased
that I had an opportunity to get to know him and become a colleague and
a friend. Thank you. I commend the Resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is indeed an honor and a privilege to be able
to just stand and say a word about our friend, Jim Fulghum. I primarily
got to know, of course, during the past term. We did work together a lot
primarily on health issues and that’s mainly what he would be remembered
for, but he also had a passion and the knowledge on a wide array of
issues and we worked on some other things as well. I may be a bit biased
about it, but I tend to think that doctors make good legislators. We’re
not really trained in rhetoric, but we are trained in fact and look at
facts and try to make good determinations. Unfortunately we don’t have
very many healthcare providers in the General Assembly, we are greatly
outnumbered by the attorneys. All joking aside, Dr. Fulghum and I talked
about that at times and as I said, it was a pleasure to get to know him
and to work with him. I will say that I had the opportunity to have an
extended conversation with him just after he had his last procedure done
and the diagnosis at that point was apparent, it was...he knew what that
meant and I knew what that meant and we had a conversation together
about our faith and I would say that Dr. Jim Fulgham is remembered as a
great physician, small g, small p, but he knew the Great Physician,
large g, large p. He knew his lord and has been said earlier, was
certain an example to us in his life and I think he was an example to us
in his death and the way that he approached that and, Mr. Speaker, I do
commend the resolution,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. About a couple weeks ago I came in and I had a
toothache and I called Dr. Fulgham’s son-in-law, and of course I
couldn’t get him and I was hurting so bad, and I said, lord let me go
over here and find out who can help me. I went over to Dr. Fulghum and
asked him to write me a prescription and he looked at me and asked me
all the things that you ask about the allergies and things like that,
and he went ahead and wrote and told me what to do. I looked at him and
I said, Dr. Fulghum, did you support my resolution on the suicide
prevention and he said, yes, I did, Representative Cunningham and I said
thank you very much. But I noticed he was a little slow getting this
prescription. I didn’t how bad his condition was, but anyway, I went on
and I did what I needed to do and then I found out that he had gotten
sick and lo and behold, on the same day his service was, I was unable to
get down here because that same tooth I had to go have it pulled. I
thought it was such a coincident that there he was to service me and he
did just that, and that’s what people do that are in health care. That’s
the compassion that comes about. They never stop caring. They don’t care
where you come from, they don’t care where you end up, and he was that
type of person because, people may not know, but we did have
conversations...</p>

was the man that I knew as a young man in high school. What a tribute to
say that he lived the life that he ended with, that he started with. He
changed lives; life didn’t change him. What a man. I was moved yesterday
by several speeches that were made by the witnesses, and I hope those of
you that were there were too. They were all three different. They all
three gave a different perspective of the life of Representative Dr. Jim
Fulghum, but I want to tell you he was in my office a couple of times,
sharing with me ?? who also attended ??. Several of the stories from
back then jog my memory. We had several good laughs, several good laughs
from those days there, but I will say that on this Earth when we live,
we encounter a bright star among us, and when there’s a bright star on
this Earth, you can be assured that they’re an even brighter star in the
heavens. I commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Steve Ross is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You hear the term “go-to guy”
a lot, and I’ve heard that said about Jim. Jim sat right behind me and
became my go-to guy because I always valued his opinion. He was one of
the smartest individuals that I knew. He also became my friend, and Jim
was one of the most sincere, compassionate, sincere individuals that
I’ve ever known, and the other night when I was at the church and stood
in that line that was mentioned a few moments ago, I had a lot of time
to talk to a lot of different people. I talked to friends, I talked to
colleagues, I talked to patients, I talked to people that had gone to
school with Jim, and the description that each and every person would
give of Dr. Fulghum was exactly the same. People that went to school
with him loved him. Patients loved him. Just a tremendous, tremendous
outpouring of how people felt about what this man really was. I had my
opinion that I had formed and as I said earlier, sincere, dedicated. He
was just a great guy, but that was confirmed many, many times over the
other night by so many people from so many different parts of Jim’s
life, and walking away from it, walking back to the building the other
night, I was thinking what a man, what a doctor, what a father and what
a Representative and true public servant. I commend the resolution to
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hollo is recognized to debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As we hear in a
read about the many accomplishments of Jim, reminds me of some words
from the book of Matthew: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant.” I
commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wells is
recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Jim Fulghum was a healer, but he was more than that. He was
also a warrior. A lot of us are here today because of work he did over
the last 20 and 30 plus years, in Wake County or across the state. Some
of you might not agree with his philosophical inclinations; I for one
was glad we agreed most of the time. I certainly didn’t want to be on
the other side of Jim Fulghum in a debate or any kind of fight. He was
the kind of guy you could go to. Years ago before there was a Fox News
or an internet or any other way for a diverse media, some groups here,
some folks here decided we needed to diversify our local media a little
bit, so they looked at buying a local radio station, a pretty powerful
local radio station. You needed money to do that. You needed commitment.
You needed folks with a backbone because this was not a community</p>

And you are making modifications. You would have to go back through the
entire industrial area, environmental process. And let me see there's
one more I want to touch base on. Yes. I was just asked, actually about
part four. This was another one added by Senate. And this, I've seen
this too. And this is prevalent in a lot of counties in North Carolina
that are close to metropolitan hubs. It's close to... it actually
happens in a metropolitan center of large scales that we have blotted
areas or areas that suffer. Even though they're somewhat close to
metropolitan, but they're not that close. You might be out more rural
settings.
I'll give ya, ?? for example. My guess is if you drive to southwest
corner of Wake County, it won't look like uptown Raleigh here. It's
probably more rural. It's probably more agricultural in nature. And the
Senate said, well for those areas, we'd like to be able to do is provide
opportunities for them also. And so this allows the economically
disadvantaged in rural areas to access the red building reuse funds. All
of this is an attempt to go out throughout North Carolina from one end
to the other. Provide opportunity to re-access existing structures.
Which we all have in our areas. I don't think it singles out one part of
the state over another. I don't think it singles out one city over
another.
It doesn't single out one county of over. It puts us all in the same
boat. And I appreciate your vote of concurrence. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What
purpose does the gentleman from Durum, Representative Glubki, rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Torbald would yield for a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Gaston yield to the
gentleman from Durum? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker it would be a
pleasure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. Thank you Representative. Torbald. Do you remember when we
passed this bill in 2013. How long the bill was? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
think it was about half of a page of the front page. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to an
additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well do you not think it's a problem that we have a
half page bill that comes form the Senate. I mean that goes over to the
Senate and comes back as a five page bill. Is that not really
undermining our House process in terms of knowing what's in a bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I understand the question in it's entirely
and Representative Bilukie, I think there's a lot of problems with our
process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
gentleman yield to an additional question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, sir, since we're on the motion to concur on House Bill 201, my
question is are there not many items here that are added to the bill
that you've talked about that really none of us has ever seen in the
House? [SPEAKER CHANGES] As far as seen in the House, I don't, I can't
speak on that behalf. If you were watching bill come out of the Senate
then there was, not months and months of opportunity, but there was
enough opportunity to get in there and actually make some corrections of
other items that were removed from the bill. But all the items that are
in the bill are still Germain to the usefulness of existing structures
without putting an additional capital burden for impact onto those
people that might use those buildings. If that makes any sense what so
ever. Thank you for the question, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I speak on the motion? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman from Durum has the floor to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, Representative
Torbald has acknowledged the bill has really grown a great deal. And a
lot of items here that while he attempted to explain them to us, really
we've not seen those items to be able to read them and study them. And
as I understand the rewrite, and have just gotten a summary of the bill
today. As I understand the rewrite, it really hurts us in a number of
ways, perks of state, in a number of ways.
Number one being that the energy efficiency codes are weakened in one
part of the bill, which simply means that we've got buildings that will
not reach the standards of energy efficiency that we otherwise have.
That's not good for us to weaken energy efficiency codes in our state.
Those codes that are set out by the North Carolina building council.
That's one area. Secondary is that, the storm water requirements are
weakened.</p>

He found out that I ran against a doctor in my primary and I beat him.
That was our first long conversation and he was really interested in
that. I knew if he’d have been the opponent, there’s no way I would have
won. But this particular doctor I did win, and that was our first long
conversation. We talked about politics and we talked about our careers
and he seemed as interested in mine as I was in his even though I didn’t
know half of what he was talking about. When we get in here on certain
bills, especially anything that had to do with medicine, I would weigh,
man I would listen to anything this guy said because I knew I knew
nothing. I was a, let’s see, I got a first aid merit badge and that was
about it. But he would look at me and ask me when it come to local
government and local bills. I don’t think he really needed my help, but
I was glad to tell him how to vote. We had a great time with that and
joked about it and everything. It was a joy, last summer, to go down to
his farm and he cooked some awesome barbecue, I can tell you that. We
had a great time there and it’s been a joy to serve with him here.
Sorry. I’d have sworn to say one more thing if I could get it out.
Sorry. The last thing he said to me was something he said to me several

Chair. Representative [Terry?] please state your purpose.
[Representative [Terry?]: Yes. For a motion Mr. Speaker. To speak on the
motion.
[Speaker]: The gentleman’s recognized for a motion and to debate the
motion.
[Representative [Terry?]: Although I wasn’t impressed with the
lengthiness of the title, the motion is to concur.
[Speaker]: The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[Representative [Terry?]: Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, about a year
ago or so, the original 201 Bill came from me to you guys and y’all
supported wholeheartedly and it went across the Senate, but when you
supported it, it was different. What was different about it, it actually
incorporated new structures.
During the interim I was speaking with some different groups. Some were
architects, some were environmental enthusiasts, whatever, and they came
in there and expressed some concerns. We arrived at a mid point. The mid
point was, is that this Bill would not address new structures, but it
could address existing structures.
The reason I say that is I’ve had an opportunity to go around the state
like many, many of you all have and there’s one thing that’s blatantly
clear in every city, town, hamlet, county, rural, urban, it doesn’t
matter. It’s that this state has an abundance of available empty
properties. Pretty much up and down, not just mainstreet but your
street. What this Bill attempted to do and attempts to do and now does
after it’s come back from the Senate, is provide better opportunity to
put these building back into economic development usefulness for every
one of our towns.
The first part of the Bill pretty much, actually it just does, it allows
the existing structures to go back to the code that was in effect in
2009. Now let me make sure y’all understand. It doesn’t mandate them to
go back. They can still go by the newer codes. If they want to apply
more stringent practices in their structure and when they’re rehabbing
it, they can.
We’re just not mandating them to do that. Some of the reasons for that
was, the strength of the ceilings that might have been in the buildings
could not support the additional weight of the new energy codes,
specified HVAC systems which leaves the building pretty much
structurally uninhabitable. We were just trying to address some of these
issues and to make it more economically viable for growth in every city,
town and hamlet.
The other parts that the Senate added, and I’ve asked staff to be here
if that’s possible Mr. Speaker, if needed, is to help me with some of
the explanations on them. What they did is they looked at the different
things that affect a building. They said if a company went in through an
existing building what if they wanted to say expand that building. Now
where does it say the building met purpose they had but they might need
another 30 square feet this or 50 square feet or something.
We started talking about, and it came back as a happy medium to give
them the flexibility to expand up to 50 percent of the original
footprint. So in other words if you bought a 100 square foot building,
I’m just keeping the numbers simple. Then you can add on 50 square feet.
In the language it says 150 percent, which is exactly a 50 percent
addition.
That could also go under the ’09 rules. Anything that pertains to the
storm water runoff of that building and that expansion would still fall
under the original building. So you don’t have to go all the way back
through the environmental process. If it was on a, in an industrial</p>

Speaker. Thank you Representative. Torbald. Do you remember when we
passed this bill in 2013. How long the bill was? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
think it was about half of a page of the front page. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to an
additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well do you not think it's a problem that we have a
half page bill that comes form the Senate. I mean that goes over to the
Senate and comes back as a five page bill. Is that not really
undermining our House process in terms of knowing what's in a bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I understand the question in it's entirely
and Representative Bilukie, I think there's a lot of problems with our
process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
gentleman yield to an additional question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, sir, since we're on the motion to concur on House Bill 201, my
question is are there not many items here that are added to the bill
that you've talked about that really none of us has ever seen in the
House? [SPEAKER CHANGES] As far as seen in the House, I don't, I can't
speak on that behalf. If you were watching bill come out of the Senate
then there was, not months and months of opportunity, but there was
enough opportunity to get in there and actually make some corrections of
other items that were removed from the bill. But all the items that are
in the bill are still Germain to the usefulness of existing structures
without putting an additional capital burden for impact onto those
people that might use those buildings. If that makes any sense what so
ever. Thank you for the question, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I speak on the motion? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman from Durum has the floor to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, Representative
Torbald has acknowledged the bill has really grown a great deal. And a
lot of items here that while he attempted to explain them to us, really
we've not seen those items to be able to read them and study them. And
as I understand the rewrite, and have just gotten a summary of the bill
today. As I understand the rewrite, it really hurts us in a number of
ways, perks of state, in a number of ways.
Number one being that the energy efficiency codes are weakened in one
part of the bill, which simply means that we've got buildings that will
not reach the standards of energy efficiency that we otherwise have.
That's not good for us to weaken energy efficiency codes in our state.
Those codes that are set out by the North Carolina building council.
That's one area. Secondary is that, the storm water requirements are
weakened.</p>

Protections are important so that we keep our rivers clean. When we
weaken the storm water protections, we have costs that go to overall
clean up because the storm waters going into the rivers rather than in
creeks and rivers, rather than being stopped at, at source, at site, on,
at the building level. For these reasons, substantive reasons, but also
more importantly because we really didn't know about this bill until
it's been summarized, the content of this bill until it's been
summarized, by Representative Torbett, I think we should not, and would
urge you to join me in not concurring on this conference report. Thank
you. I'm sorry, the confer, to concur on the bill. Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Martin
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, mister Speaker. Members, couple of problems I have
with this motion. One, the gentleman from Durham has already
articulated, I, I think, I'm not sure, but I think it's a bad bill. I
haven't had time to look at it and I don't have the brain power to
absorb something this long and this complicated and understand if it is
good or bad. But, but more importantly, procedurally. In the end, the
House of Representatives does not exist to be a rubber stamp for the
Senate. This bill was changed significantly and has many complicated
provisions in it, as evidenced by the fact that the gentleman from
Gaston needed the presence of staff on the floor to potentially answer
questions about this complicated bill. In the end, if it is something
that I think is a bad bill, my guess is that the vast majority of folks
on the other side of the aisle are gonna disagree with me, and ya'll
would have the votes in the end to pass whatever you want. But I think
it's more important though, not so much worried about the damage that
ya'll intend to do with this bill, but that we prevent any unintentional
damage that's done because we didn't give it a thorough vetting, the
sort of vetting that I think we, as a coequal body with the Senate need
to give the bill. And so I really think it's important that we get a
House to look at this, and that a group of House members who have some
experience with environmental issues give it a look before we ask the
House as a whole to vote upon it. And for that reason, mister Speaker, I
ask to be recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. I move that this bill be, or rather that this
motion be moved to the House committee on the environment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Wake has made a motion to rerefer the bill from the
floor to the committee on environment. Does the gentleman from Gaston,
Representative Torbett wish to debate the motion to rerefer the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Briefly, mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion to rerefer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My friend from Wake is wrong. I'd appreciate that we defeat this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Henderson, Representative McGrady wish to debate
the motion to rerefer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I rise to support the motion of the gentleman from Wake. This bill has a
lot in it. I think most people would recognize that I've got somewhat
little expertise in the subject, but we're being asked to do committee
work here. The provisions that have been added to this bill may be
appropriate to the bill, but we don't know that. This bill has, these
portions of the bill have never been looked at by anybody with any
expertise on this side. They were just added to the bill. That's a
mistake, and the motion that the gentleman from Wake has made will fix
that mistake if we send this to committee and  look at it and actually
determine what these provisions mean. And so I would urge you to vote
for the motion to send this bill back to committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the Lady from Davie, Representative Howard rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the motion of rereferral.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. Members of the House, I know we try to do
everything as correct here as we can, but I will tell you that in my
district, many of you helped me with a provision for, actually furniture
company. And as I stood on the House floor and told you that it was
gonna be six hundred, sixteen hundred new jobs in Davie county that has
materialized, but they have waited almost a year and a half. They have
twelve, pristine storage buildings that's on their property. They are
waiting to create</p>

600 additional jobs that have waited over a year they need to have a

upholstery material that has to be on side for them to produce the jobs
and get the furniture pieces built in Senate. I appreciation the
opportunity of trying to do things right because you have heard me say
that many many times but I am telling you there comes a time when we can
overdue and as we sit here you are hampering 600 jobs that are stake and
Dave academy today because these people cannot put climate control?? in
these 12 storage buildings it becomes rather foolish at sometimes that
we try to overdue and try to be over protective I can just assure you
that I am one of many counties that have these buildings that industry
is waiting to occupy and the most important thing we have tried to do in
last two years four years when these ?? say talk about jobs. I am
telling you we are hampering the job opportunities if you send this bill
back with the time frame that we are on it won't come back there is not
enough time to a deem to a committee back out of a committee to make the
agreements with the Senate. Actually it's the kiss of death if we send
it back to the committee so I ask you please do not vote to send it back
to any committee and less move these jobs forth as we should.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Henderson
representative McGrady rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the Lady a question if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the Lady from Davie yields to the gentleman from
Henderson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Am I correct in understanding does the provisions that
you are particularly interested in are the provisions that are in the
what I call the representative Torbett portion to that bill that have
been fully graded and is that true?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that's correct. Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to prepare additional
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the Lady yells to additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Am I also correct that the other provision that have
added to the Senate have nothing to do with the project you are
particularly concerned with?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do believe that's correct but let me make a
additional statement after being ranged here for as many years since I
have been and many of you we have to have an agreement. I wish that it
was a one chamber that we can do everything that we want to do but we
have to come to an agreement with the Senate and that's the issue here
there is part of the part bill that Senate has requested I don't have a
in depth concern about that but I own way concerned about the other part
and I don't believe they are gonna get part one without part two and it
will be the kiss of death If we don't do that Mr. Speaker for motion
please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady from Davie may state her motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I would move that we table the motion.

does the gentleman from Dare, Representative Tine, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Torbett would yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Gaston yield to the gentleman from Dare?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It'd be an absolute pleasure, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Torbett. I spoke to you just a few minutes ago
with a question as I ran through this bill in regarding to Part 4, which
is the portion which would now allow tier 3 counties with census areas
with less than 500 people per square mile to be included in it, and we
discussed sort of a little bit about policy on it in regards to some
areas don't have the resources and that's why we put it in there. I've
got a county that has nine people per square mile in it, and so
obviously they raise about $78,000 with one property tax. They're not
making choices to not invest in that area, they have issues. What I'm
wondering is, in some of these counties that can make choices with their
assets, how many counties might there be--and I see that you have staff
now and I was hoping that maybe they might know--how many census tracts
would include 500 people per square--less than 500 people per square
mile in tier 3s.  I'm trying to get a sense of how big are we cutting
the pie now, or how many slices are we divvying up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll first state my pleasure that the gentleman
didn't quote me on our previous conversation. But I also mentioned that
I honestly have no earthly idea, but this may be a result of some other
language that was floating through in past months, if you pay attention
to economic development and jobs for opportunities more than the
environmental side--or at least try to balance that out somehow. Which
is more important--is the jobs more important than what some believe
that environmental impact might be. We were looking at counties that,
even though a county may be thriving on one part of the county, it may
have parts of the county that--you've heard the term &quot;economically
distressed,&quot; and some way to attach some opportunity, because just
because they're in a county that the county in its whole may be
considered a wealthy tier 3 type of county doesn't necessarily mean that
a municipality, for example, sitting off in a corner of that area is
equally financially solvent, if you would think. So if there's pockets
anywhere in North Carolina that are economically distressed, should they
not also be given what, pretty much the Senate folks decided was an
equal opportunity to excel and be successful? And that's pretty much why
I was very supportive of this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? request.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, absolutely Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Gaston yield to a second question from the
gentleman from Dare?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It'd be an absolute honor, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I didn't quote you because I didn't want to ambush you, but I was
wondering if staff might, since they were brought in for assistance, if
staff might--because if it's three or four, and we're trying to solve a
small problem for rural areas, then I don't contemplate an issue. But if
all of a sudden we've opened it up to 50, 60, 100 different communities
throughout, then maybe we need to have a broader policy discussion about
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, and I--while you were asking-- Mr. Speaker--while you were asking
I looked at staff and staff said that we don't have answers, so
obviously it's not a bazillion of them. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

provision that passed the House. Is that correct?

Yes. That was added on the Senate side. Yes sir, that's correct. That
was not in the original bill. I think the answer to your question.

but this dog is a mongrel. We don't even know who his parents are. A
portion of the bill, which Rep. Torbett has done a good job on and has
improved, we've got a pretty good idea about, and that relates back to
Rep. Howard's particular concerns. We didn't have enough time to send
this to committee. Do we have enough time to send it to a conference
committee at least? Have somebody from the House figure out what all of
this does? I hope my colleagues understand what's happening here. We're
getting bullied. Getting bullied right. And there have been things added
to this bill that are very difficult subjects. We don't have enough time

have enough time to have a conference on this thing, assuming we could
get a fair conference committee put together that would ask the right
questions? I ask you to vote no on the motion to concur, and if the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I think this bill is an attempt to make it easier to reoccupy empty
buildings which are all over Gaston county, and I've spoken to a lot of
people that redevelop these buildings, some of them are quite large,
some of them have been torn down lately, it's a nightmare to tear them
down. They're old, they have all kinds of what's been termed
&quot;hazardous material&quot; which cost a fortune to dispose of, get
rid of, can't reuse it. Anything that we can do that we can enable these
buildings to be utilized and reoccupied and put to a productive use
rather than just be a drain on the taxpayers is a good idea. And yes, I
have issues with some parts of this bill, I'm not at all enamored with
using taxpayer money to give certain people breaks so that they can use
it for their own economic benefit, then we're picking winners and losers
and I don't want to do that but this bill is an attempt which can be
rectified later if it turns out that this is not what needs to be done,
or if there's some issue with this bill that really needs to be handled,
we have next year, which is going to be here very soon to handle it. But
for now, let's make an attempt to alleviate an issue that is very bad
all over the state and some of the issues with this bill and some of the
arguments I've heard are really quite specious, especially concerning
the length of the bill all of a sudden is an issue, it was a half page
and now it's 4 pages and so for that reason we can't pass it? I find
that difficult to comprehend. I've asked for you to support the bill.

from the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, this is
the, the bill regarding temporary healthcare structures. The changes
made in the Senate were all prompted by staff. There were three of them.
The first one was a, a general statute citation correction. The second
one was regarding the effective day, the original effective date we had
was July 1, 2013 date, and we've changed that to October one of 2014,
and the third change was strictly a technical phrasing change
recommended by staff. I, I'm prepared to answer any questions and I
appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 1145, a bill to be entitled an act to require mopeds to be

responsibility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Onslow, Representative Shepard
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Speaker, to make a motion to concur and also speak on that
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion to concur and now has the floor
to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I ask this afternoon respectfully
that you vote to concur with this. It did come back a little differently
then we sent it. We had put the insurance part in the steady. After
going over to the Senate, I attended all the committee meetings they had
on insurance and also in finance. People from the Department of
Insurance came and gave testimony as well as Rate Bureau individuals,
and after hearing the testimony and the discussion in the insurance
committee and the Senate, they assured us that they were already rating
and insuring mopeds. As a matter of fact, many are being done all over
the state. They also said that there was not any problems as far as
doing that. They assured us that would be fine. The indication they gave
to us was that if you had a clean driving record and had never had a
ticket, your insurance would be ninety dollars a year for liability
insurance on a moped. If in fact you'd had a driving record that
included tickets, a DWI, something like that, it possibly could be three
hundred dollars a year. With that being said and done, there have been
many incidents and accidents in our state involving mopeds, and at the
current time, if there's not insurance on the moped, then the person
that's responsible doesn't always pay for it. The person that's the
innocent party has to pay for the insurance and also pay for the damage
done to their vehicle whether it be bodily insurance or whatever. So I
ask that you concur with a motion to include the insurance today. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, the chair understands the gentleman wishes to
change his vote on the last vote from a no to a yes, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes mister Chair. I worked hard with the gentleman on the deal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Vote will, vote will be so changed. For what purpose does the lady from
Wake, Representative Avila arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. The bill as it comes back to us from the
Senate is the bill that was filed. It was not however the bill that we
voted on and passed here in the House. When we passed it from the House,
the insurance section had been removed, and I think what happened here
speaks directly to how we legislate and how we make decisions, and what
we have to have before us before we make those decisions. In speaking
with the sponsors of the bill, they admitted that there is no

Of any state bordering us. And then I have other concerns, what's next?
It all has good intentions, there's no one in here that says that they
wanna do it for the wrong purposes. But what's next? The rules and
regulations that oversee these say that 30 miles an hour less. What else
does 30 miles and hour and less? Or are we gonna say you have to get a
license and tags, and insurance for? It's just a fact. So at a time when
people are really trying to get up and move and we thought we were gonna
study it and come back with some great information next year which was
all the intentions the house had. Which is a great I thought, we're
actually gonna get it somewhere in the right direction. We come back and
now we're gonna tell everyone you gotta put insurance on these, and
you're just gonna really cripple a part of our community that this is
all they have. This is the only way they have to get back and forth to
work, and there again I know there's good intentions but I think we
could actually study the bill and come back with a solution. Look at
what our surrounding states have done to help aid these individuals
that's trying to get back and forth to work. There's options out there,
we haven't looked at anything and we're just going to ram this through
today because the Senate, which is the other chamber says it's a great
idea, you know. Either way I hope you won't vote to support this and
maybe we can find a solution, thank you.
[Speaker Change]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Crave Representative Speciale
rise?
[Speaker Change]
To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Shepard if you have a good driving record your insurance
that you won't pay that much, if you don't you'll pay 300. I think most
of us without any hard concrete data in front of us understand that
people driving mopeds obviously don't have good driving records, that's
why they're driving the mopeds. So their all gonna pay $300 or whatever
the insurance is. So this is good for the insurance companies if that's
our goal, then we need to vote to concur. But if our goal is to you
know, make the right decision, well then I think we made the right
decision when we sent that bill outta here. I thought it was a good
bill. For $15 we're gonna find out who owns these things by making sure
they're registered. But we were going to study what the repercussions
were on the insurance, and I think that makes sense. I think we do need
to look at it, we need to figure it out. But what's gonna happen if we
implement this and these people have to pay $300? How many of them are
not gonna be able to get to work? And I love the explanation well you
know, there was an accident here where you know, or the people had to
pay for it themself because the moped, the driver of the moped didn't
have insurance. Well heck I got a bicycle I ride and sometimes I you
know, I'm not as awake as I should be when I'm riding it and I've bumped
the curb, fell off it. What if I fell into a car? Are we gonna start
insuring bicycles? What if I'm chasing my son, we're playing around or
something and I run right into the back of the car, somebody's car and
break and window with my hard head? I mean you know, there's a point
where we've gotta stop and we gotta say you know, enough's enough. What
should we do here? I think it was an excellent bill that we sent out of
here. Let's register these things for $15, we'll know you know, who's
involved in the accidents. But let's look at what the repercussions are.
I think you know, I'd like to ask you to vote not to concur with this,
and let's battle it out with the Senate on it. We had a good bill, let's
send it back to them.

Sorry, I'd like to debate the motion please.

The lady has the floor to debate the motion.
[Speaker Change]
I think this is the most interesting thing. I think I’m about as
conservative as anybody in this chamber and yet, some of our uber
conservatives are most against this bill. And those that consider
themselves pretty much the same are for it. You know, I hate empty
regulation as much as anyone in this chamber, but I'm also really big on
people being responsible for what they do. And I don't understand why
that doesn't come down to that. We have people, I am going to side with
the hard-working people of North Carolina who are just simply driving
their cars when you know, when damage to their own private property
occurs and yet they are supposed to you know, just turn the other cheek
and let their insurance go up you know, pay the repair bills. Why are we
not holding folks the majority of whom are driving mopeds because they
have committed an act of irresponsibility? And we are just, we are just
continuing to you know, facilitate that kind of irresponsibility. And
this is the chamber that, this is just the strangest thing to me that
this would be such an issue.</p>

To ask Rep. Shepard a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Onslow yield to the gentleman from Caberras?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, sure do Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Shepard  I was just wondering if we passed this bill with just the
registration portion and not the insurance, then you have the moped
registered, you know who it belongs to and that sort of thing, it helps
law enforcement and all that. Say there is an accident and they don't
have insurance, can they not be taken to court to recover damages, that
sort of thing instead of insurance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Pittman, I'm sure that you can do that if you could get anything,
I'm not sure. From all the conversations that's been said, it sounds
like most of the people driving mopeds are DWI drivers or they've lost
their license and so forth, I'm not sure they could afford $200 a year
for liability insurance, they probably couldn't afford to pay you for
the damage that they do to your car. So that is a possibility, but I'm
not so sure that if you took them to court you'd get anything.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Onslow yield to a second question from the
gentleman from Caberras?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I sure do, ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, what you say there makes a lot of sense, but if they can't afford
insurance, who's going to pay it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I answer that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All of us that are driving and paying our taxes and paying for insurance
to have on our cars like the young man that I just talked with this past
week that pays $1200 for every 6 months, he's 19 years old, never had a
ticket, he's a good driver. But he's paying $1200 for liability
insurance to drive a car. All of us, including him, are going to pay for
those people that get in accidents with us that have not had tickets and
are driving safe and have not lost our driver's license. We're
ultimately all going to pay for it, and it's all about accountability
and responsibility and we Conservatives talk about being responsible and
accountable, but yet when we discuss this, all of a sudden we want to
give somebody a free ride, and say &quot;You don't have to be
accountable and responsible, let somebody else pay the bill.&quot;

Thank you Mr. Speaker, just to speak briefly.

The lady has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've heard so much and it just appears to me that we do need to study
this. But I do want to say that we don't need to make assumptions to
people who may ride mopeds, don't have a driver's lic- I mean that they
can't get a driver's license. Many of them can afford a car. And I think
we need to be thinking about that, and when we say &quot;It's only going
to cost 300&quot;, that's a whole lot of money to some people. It may
not be a lot of money to those of us here,

lost their driver's license. I believe what you heard was other people
have said that from both sides of this debate, but I have never said
that and I just want to clear that up.

Well thank you for clearing that up, but I never said that you said it
in the first place. It's okay. Whoever said

to take a recess at this time. It is roughly 4, almost 4:20. My
understanding is the Democratic caucus was planning on caucusing for
about 20 minutes, therefore, if Representative Hoff, the gentleman
believes we will be ready, we could probably come back at 4:40. Will
that give the gentleman enough time to discuss the business?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it will, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Notices and announcements. For what purpose does
the lady from Guilford, Representative Adams rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of personal privilege. An announcement, Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady may make her announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. It is a point of personal privilege, too.
But I just wanted to announce to the members that on next Wednesday we
will be having Bows and Brims. We had some previous members here, some
gentlemen who helped us on the Bows side, and so because Representative
Dockham and Representative Hare have moved on, Representative
Baskerville will be helping the gentlemen with your bows. He'll, say you
had a tie, he'll bring some other ties as well, so we'd love for you to
participate, and it's probably going to be my last hat Bows and Brims
day here, but we want to have a little fun with it. So next Wednesday,
July 30. We'll see you with your Bows and Brims. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, I know there's a couple more announcements,
but I want to give the members an idea of what we're looking at doing
for the remainder of the day. There were three bills that came out of
rules that have already been read in that the Chair will be intending to
add to the calendar. One is Senate Bill 788, which is a local bill for
the town of Duck. I believe Representative Tine is handling that. Senate
Bill 376, having to do with Montgomery County, that's Representative
Burr's bill. He's not here, but he'd probably be fine if we proceeded on
that. Senate Bill 877, which is an act to exempt certain real-estate
time shares from the rule against perpetuity. I believe Representative
Tine is handling that one also. And then, from the Finance Committee,
House Bill 27, which was an act to deal with unclaimed savings bonds as
cheating. The Chair also intends to read in some additional bills that
came out of committee and add those to today's calendar, but those will
have to be read in first. So the Chair will not ask for objection or
anything on those other bills just yet. Just giving you all a heads up
that that's what we're looking at doing. Further notices and
announcements? Representative Starnes, the gentleman from Caldwell is
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. The Republicans will try to have a brief
caucus immediately upon recess and I'm hoping the room downstairs, 1228,
is available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe it will be. Representative Hall, does the
Democratic caucus want to be in its usual room upon recess?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Alamance,
Representative Ross, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A moment of confusion on that
last vote. I'd like to be recorded as voting aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will be recorded as voting aye for the
last vote. For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Glazier, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A question of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. I know you're going to be reading
these in, but this is just for amendment preparation. Is one of the
bills that there is an intent by the Chair to add for discussion tonight
House Bill 1133, the Tech Correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair has not- I want to confer with Speaker
Tillis. It's possible, but we're trying to look at the clock and see
where we're going. So I'll- If it is it would be after those other
bills. But if the member does have amendments, it would probably be a
good idea to go ahead and at least have those ready. But I'll speak
directly with you and I will announce that later when we come back from
recess.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Further notices and announcements? If not,
Members, we will stand in recess until 4:40 pm, subject to introductions
of bills and resolutions, re-referral bills and resolutions, receipt of
committee reports, receipt of conference reports... Re-referral bills
and resolutions, appointments of conferees, and modifications to the
calendar. We are in recess.
Conferees on House Bill 1145 will be Shepard, chair, Representative
Rayne Brown, Representative Carney, Representative Millis. It will be so
notified. Representatives Burr and Stam, vice-chairs of the Committee on
Rules, Calendar and Operations, are recognized to send forth a
conference report, the court will read. Excuse- Strike that. Recognized
to send forth a committee report, the clerk will read.

The gentleman from Hornet, Representative Lewis is recognized for
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Speaker, I would move that House Bill 1133 be added to tonights
calendar.

Gentlemen from Hornet, Representative Lewis moves that the House Bill
1133 be added to tonights calendar. Submitting in favor of adopting the
motion will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open
the vote. The clerk will strike the vote. The chair is going to re put
the question. The chair had told the other members who were off the
floor that he will do that. The vote will be stricken the machine will
be cleared. We have a couple of folks who are off floor, who had 100%
voting records and they want to maintain that. I would hate to see them
. . . Some of them have been here several terms, so I want to honor
that, I hope the body will bear the indulgence. For the purpose . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Question, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Although we are, technically the question being put to chair we will
yield to a question from the gentlemen from Durham.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just want to know the procedure we go through
for that, so we can make sure we all avail ourselves of maintaining our
voting records.

Always a great thing.

Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Michaux
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Inquiry the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The last motion that was raised, that was the motion to suspend the
rules to add that bill to tonights calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
It was not that. Earlier vote was a motion, there had to be a motion to
suspend the rules, because that was a conference report. However, a
committee report only requires leave of the house, that would only
require simple majority vote in that instance.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Same thing ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The question before the house is the motion to add the house committee
substitute for House Bill 1133 to tonights calendar. Submitting in favor
of adopting the motion will aye, those opposed will vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and close the vote.
65 voting in the affirmative and 37 in the negative the bill is added to
tonights calendar. Members the other bill to be added to tonights
calendar is House Bill 101, an act to reauthorize expired special
registration plates as a conditional title. Is there an objection to
this bill being added to tonight bills. Hearing none, so ordered. House
will be at ease for just a moment. Members the House is going to go into
recess until 5:30.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The House will come to order. Members after having an opportunity to
speak with the Speaker and many others, based on the one bill that needs
to be carried over until tomorrow. Chair has determined we're going to
let all the bills go over until tomorrow and we'll be taking no further
votes this evening. Notices and announcements. And, for planning
