  <p id="00:00">
  Good afternoon and welcome to the senate finance committee. We are
looking forward to presentation today so want to go ahead and get
started. I&#39;m sure there will be lots of questions we want to have
time for that at the end. So while others trickle in let me first extend
appreciation to sergeant at arms staff Dale Hall and Matt Urban. Dale
but I don&#39;t see Matt he&#39;s around. Standing by the door. And to
our pages Regina Weikert Spring Lake, Senator Ron Rabin. Someone from
Charlotte who&#39;s handwriting looks like mine who&#39;s with Senator
Michaux, would you like to tell me is it Gish Bore? Okay I was close
thank you. Calin Mcraw from Greensboro Senator Robison. And Nicholas
Odo, did I pronounce that right? Adam, thank you from Wake Forest
Senator Barefoot. Nicholas I suggest you spell your name that way if
your going to pronounce it that way. If that&#39;s okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now having done that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I just think we ought to point out that two of our pages
are from Germany and
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh that why you did spell it, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d like to welcome us. Welkommen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Presenting today is going to be our secretary of commerce, secretary
John Scavala, secretary Scavala when you are ready the floor is yours.
And welcome sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for having me and for those senators who remembered to wear a
green tie today especially Senator Apodaca very Irish name I forgot
completely. Well I&#39;m glad to hear it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What about you state senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Listen when both our names end in a vowel we got trouble. Well I&#39;m
going to start with a curse word. Incentives. It tends to engender
feelings on both sides of everything. And I am here today specifically
to talk about the JDIG program which is our most important tool for
recruitment and retainment. And there&#39;s not question there is a wide
array of understanding on how the JDIG program works. I was getting
calls last night up until ten thirty from people who I thought had a
profound understanding of the program and they really did not. And
I&#39;m also here at the request of your president who suggested I meet
with you. And this was probably a very good forum to discuss this issue
with the finance committee. So thank you for having me. JDIG stands for
job investment development grant, JDIG. And the name itself puts us into
a hole right out of the shoot. And I&#39;ll tell you why. Everybody
assumes that a JDIG award is like a college scholarship. And let&#39;s
just assume that you have recruited the greatest high school basketball
player in the state to your school. And he or she is going to transform
that program. And the scholarship or grant in aid that that student
athlete receives is effectively guaranteed in advance. You get tuition,
you get room, you get board, you get books, you get meals. And let&#39;s
presume that athlete never gets off the bench in four years of college.
Did not deliver or produce as expected. That probably wasn&#39;t a very
good investment by the institution and if it&#39;s a states
  </p>

  <h4><a href="https://requester.mturk.com/bulk/workers/A2OWKNH3FGF84A">Worker</a> | <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/mturk/manageHIT?HITId=32ZCLEW0BYJMCJOXHK8QE471F8VJPF&amp;viewableEditPane=manageHIT_downloadResults">HIT</a></h4>
  
  <p id="05:00">
  So you can make the argument that every taxpayer in the state
contributed toward that grant and aid and that&#39;s what everybody
assumes the JDIG program is. It&#39;s the way it&#39;s reported, the way
it&#39;s understood and especially in the last several weeks I&#39;ve
had numerous conversations with people who basically believe that. They
also believe that all 100 counties contribute to the welfare of the few
counties where JDIG awards reside and they also believe that the small
towns are disadvantaged over the big cities. That&#39;s the assumption.
Let&#39;s go through how the program really works. We are attempting to
change the name of the program to the Jobs Growth Reimbursement
Opportunity because in reality every JDIG award is nothing more than a
reimbursement plan after the fact. It is paid to companies bringing new
jobs to the state or creating new jobs that could exit the state that we
otherwise would not have and only under that criteria is any award even
considered. So we&#39;re getting something we never had. Now everyone
hears, and here&#39;s the real misnomer in the program, everyone hears
this 75/25% number. A JDIG award is calculated based on an estimate of
the new tax revenue created by the new employees in the state. They pay
state income tax. So an estimate is made of the amount of income tax
that they are going to pay. A JDIG is an award for a period of 12 years,
so when you see the original announcement of the award it looks large
but you have to divide that number by 12 so the best and largest example
is Metropolitan Life. $125 million award for 26,000 employees spread
between Wake and Mecklenberg Counties, roughly $10 million a year for 12
years. Happens. In order to garner that $10 million award the economic
model must show that more than $10 million will be paid by those 26,000
new employees into the treasury of the state of North Carolina. Now the
award can range from 10% to 75% and in this particular case it was a 75%
award so everyone presumes that that consumes 100% of the money we
receive and in fact that&#39;s not the case because here is the second
75% that nobody seems to be aware of, that in calculating the award from
10 to 75% the 75% awarded is 75% of 75% and I know that sounds confusing
but let me put some math around it. In order to get a $10 million JDIG,
you&#39;ve got to produce $13.5 million in revenue to the state. So
everybody presumes that we give 75% to the company and 25% goes into the
utility fund which can be used only, not used in the top 20 counties
only in the bottom 80 but nobody understands that it&#39;s a percentage
of an already diminished percentage. There is always net dollars to the
state. So let&#39;s take our Metropolitan Life example
  </p>

  <h4><a href="https://requester.mturk.com/bulk/workers/A3VJY2IKOZ17GJ">Worker</a> | <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/mturk/manageHIT?HITId=3T8DUCXY0M5VYZ4VCPQXUKUV863T9Y&amp;viewableEditPane=manageHIT_downloadResults">HIT</a></h4>
  
  <p id="10:00">
  In order to get a $10 million JDIG award for 12 years, the company had
to produce $13.5 million in revenue to the state of North Carolina. 75%
of 13.5 is $10 million. The second 75% is divided between a refund to
the company, a reimbursement to the company, and to the utility fund. So
if you boil the numbers down, it&#39;s 13.5 million gross revenue to the
state, 7.5 million revenue to metropolitan life, and $2.5 million in
revenue to the utilities fund. So effectively, of the $13.5 million,
only seven and a half is refunded or reimbursed to the company based on
the 2,600 jobs actually created, because other component of the program
is that the money is only paid in arrears. The company does not receive
the money for 12 to 18 months after the jobs are actually created. So we
get the money in, a portion of it is reimbursed to the company. Every
program stands on its own. I have heard that small towns support big
towns. In this program, it is not the case. Every program stands on its
own and is a net contributor to the state treasury. If it&#39;s not a
net contributor, they do not get the awards. The awards range in size
from 10 to 75% with the expectation that the closer to the 75% range is
for more rural and small towns versus the big cities. There&#39;s a
concerted effort to try to generate more opportunity in the small towns.
Doesn&#39;t always work that way, but any thought of taking a
disproportionate proceed or a disproportionate allocation to the small
communities doesn&#39;t work, because the money will not force companies
to make a decision to go where they don&#39;t wanna go. Our big cities
are competing with Atlanta and Memphis and Nashville and Richmond and
Dallas. The market is gonna decide where companies go. But the
market&#39;s also going to decide if we are able to lure an original
equipment manufacturer, aerospace, automobile. They are gonna go tot he
small towns, because it&#39;s the nature of the market. That&#39;s where
they are going to want to go. If you look at the total data since 2003,
since the beginning of the program, this program has taken in $500
million. It&#39;s returned $150 million to the companies participating,
and it&#39;s put $50 million into the utility fund to the benefit of 80
counties in the state. So in all cases, it&#39;s money we did not have.
In all cases, it must meet the economic test of returning net dollars to
the treasury. Apply the dual 75% test. One is 75% of the total dollars
received by the treasury, and that 75% get rewards, part to the utility
fund and part back to the company. So at the end of the day, the actual
amount recovered by metropolitan life was more in the 57% to 60% range,
not 100% of the award. It is not scholarship. It returns dollars to the
treasury.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d like to ask the secretary a question if I could. Mister
Secretary, I think most of us in this room understand the JDIG

  <p id="15:00">
  program and I do appreciate you explaining it. And I guess the reason I
wanted to stop you there is because of the reference I guess to most of
the money going to a couple of counties and how you can&#39;t control
that. I think the problem, I think everyone understands how the program
works but I think the problem most of us are trying to wrap our arms
around is when you help create and I&#39;ll just choose, I&#39;ll just
pick a number. When you help a JDIG project in Wake or in Mcklenberg
county that may create a hundred fifty, two hundred jobs. Okay? And I
would compare that to a JDIG program in Halifax county that creates
fifty jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The impact of that fifty job program in Halifax would be much more
dynamic than the one hundred fifty two hundred job program you would
create in Wake or Mcklenberg county just because of the environment of
the counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Agree.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And yet we continuously see the money going to these couple counties.
And it&#39;s not how the money is allocated that&#39;s the problem.
It&#39;s the job creation that&#39;s the problem throughout the state.
And I think most of us understand that most companies would like to be
in the metropolitan areas I don&#39;t think anyone can argue that. But I
look at maybe what South Carolina has done bringing industry all across
their state. They&#39;ve done a great job of that and yet we continue to
have our concentration in two particular areas. And I guess my argument
to you will be if you can find a way to bring me fifty jobs in Jones
county that is a huge economic impact to that county. A whole lot more
so than a two hundred job company here in Wake county. Plus the other
piece is some of these other counties are having to, because they&#39;re
smaller project because that&#39;s what they can attract are having to
pretty much on a local basis come up with plans to create a fifteen or
twenty or thirty job industry coming into their areas. They don&#39;t
get any tax advantages. They don&#39;t get any kind of help from the
state. And the counties are out there on their own in a lot of sense
fighting for those jobs. So I think the argument most of us has on the
two county piece it&#39;s not that their not good programs, they are. I
think the argument is that we&#39;re not getting out there trying to
locate some companies maybe even smaller in some of these rural areas
where it makes a huge impact. A fifty job company in this rural area is
huge in those areas. It can change the dynamics in those counties
considerably. And that&#39;s the argument it&#39;s not about how the
money I think we understand it&#39;s new money. We understand that. But
what we&#39;ve got to change I think concentration is how do we get into
these distressed areas that truly need help.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator I agree with you fully. Let&#39;s if can remember I should have
jotted it down, let&#39;s take it one at a time. Let&#39;s start with
South Carolina. Calling itself the beast of the southeast in
manufacturing. What has South Carolina done for the last twenty, twenty
five years? It&#39;s gone after original equipment manufacturers.
They&#39;re more small town jobs with lots of people that tend to grow
on themselves. We are the only state as you know senator in the
southeast that does not have an automobile manufacturer. We now have
four mega sites in the state that are capable of accommodating a
manufacturer. That would transform small town North Carolina. Fifty jobs
is huge. The JDIG program is probably not the most conducive to those
kinds of jobs it&#39;s probably the program we want to call job grow
capital. Which is the one North Carolina program. Smaller amounts of
money targeted at smaller opportunities to help them invest in the
infrastructure, the equipment, the people they need paid in over a one
to five year period. There are programs for that. That&#39;s funded at
about twenty eight million dollars over the biennium

  <p id="20:00">
  eighteen million a year and that program has been invaluable. We just
saw Sanderson farms in Robison county, eleven hundred jobs that was a
one North Carolina award of about a million dollars. Now, to really
focus on your question, what can we do to try to get more jobs in these
areas. The bifurcation of the partnership in October has given us a new
set of tools to be a little bit different in the way we market the
state. Tourism national marketing international marketing is now in the
public private partnership.  I have had numerous meetings already about
the fact that as the marketing arm of the department of commerce we need
to start being proactive in the kind of jobs we seek out. My sense is
the department of commerce has always been reactive when the telephone
rang. And we need to start being proactive especially targeting those
kinds of industries that can create large numbers of jobs in our smaller
communities. The one that most obviously comes to mind is food
packaging. We are a huge agricultural state and we need to start going
at, Ohio owns that market and as commissioner Trackler says we have no
shame in stealing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman if I could just follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the statute says a JDIG program in a tier one county is ten jobs
or above. Now I know the department might be considering more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have about a hundred fifty cut off.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But I think a hundred and fifty
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m sorry a hundred and fifty in a tier three. Right, tier three
it&#39;s much much smaller for the tier one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tier one is ten and I guess my argument would be is the scenario I
mentioned to you about thirty jobs or whatever according to the statute
qualifies for JDIG. And so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Here&#39;s the other problem. Here&#39;s the other problem. In addition
to the dual seventy five percent rule we also have a sixty five hundred
dollar cut off rule. And basically that says if your in a high paying
area only sixty five percent of your taxes paid to the state of North
Carolina count toward the calculation of the program. Which means that
if someone is paying fifty thousand a year in the state treasury as a
employee that excess doesn&#39;t count and is also a net contributor to
the coffers. The problem is as you get into more rural areas the jobs
don&#39;t pay enough to create a return on investment to the state.
Cause if your making thirty thousand dollars a year there&#39;s a real
chance you not paying state income tax. So if we want to have a program
candidly like film and I don&#39;t want to get into another dirty word
topic. But the film incentive program is a net loser to the state. We
collect four we pay out five. The arbitrage isn&#39;t good. The
arbitrage on JDIG always creates a net win to the state. And that&#39;s
why one North Carolina where jobs grow capital is the program to use in
those situations. We try to award JDIG every time we possibly can in
order to make it at least break even to the state. So it&#39;s all a
function of compensation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Senator Apodaca did I see your hand up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure Mr. Chairman thank you. ?? you mentioned the PPP refresh my memory
in how they participate in this process. Are they strictly marketing or
do they hand out any incentive money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, the PPP is the marketing arm center and then once the way I
articulate it is they are like the starry eyed young world beater
who&#39;s supposed to find all these deals out there and every deal is a
good deal. And they&#39;re supposed to bring them back to the department
of commerce to evaluate and see what the economic merits of the
opportunity happens to be. So they do not, they simply are the marketing
arm and they prepare the project to be approved number one by commerce
and two by the EIC the economic investment commission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How would you grade it so far? How is that working?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So far? Since it started in October and effectively in January since
Chris Chung arrived. A+

  Mr. Secretary, I was reading in a newspaper the other day, and I
can&#39;t remember which paper it was, about a PPP not releasing their
records and I thought we were pretty specific in our legislation that
records would be public. Can you comment on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Only having been here two months, I can tell you what I know. The idea
was to make sure that appropriate records were released but not to
impair the ability of the state to recruit future companies. Because two
things happen, number one if all the proposed awards are made public, it
sets a new bar for other people looking for awards, and then number two
it also has people who have received awards coming back questioning,
&quot;Why didn&#39;t I get that or why did he get that and I
didn&#39;t?&quot; So it creates an awful lot of confusion in the
recruiting world to give that information out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will follow the statute, whatever, my broad-based understanding is
that it does create a lot of noise out there that, &quot;You got this
and he didn&#39;t,&quot; and people are very upset, or-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m used to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, well I understand, but also because companies coming to the state
say, &quot;I want, minimally, this,&quot; and there&#39;s a lot of
factors that go in to making the determination.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But following up on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, following up on the follow-up, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is sunshine week and I&#39;d certainly like to get out in the
sunshine but, that being said, we need to, you know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We are following the statute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, your presentation on the JDIG
was very favorable in your thoughts. I have a couple of points, I think
one being is that each of those people, let&#39;s look at MetLife, 2,300
people in the state of-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
2,600, I think, 2,600 and $125 million.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very good, out of those, how many were North Carolinians that got that
job that the state of North Carolina invested $125 million into? If that
is indeed one of the metrics in us trying to use incentives to create
jobs to put North Carolinians back to work.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The way I look at that is if it was a North Carolina job, obviously it
was a new job. I don&#39;t have any idea how many were imported from
out-of-state, but they all become tax payers. Anybody coming to the
state who wasn&#39;t here before paying taxes at least contributes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, so therefore we&#39;re paying incentive money to create
taxpayers, or rather than hiring North Carolinians-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I don&#39;t know the numbers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, follow-up question, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under the circumstances, there are a lot of other insurance companies in
the state of North Carolina that are good corporate citizens, they pay
their taxes, their employees pay their personal income taxes, how do you
justify, whether it be the insurance company competitor or any other
person, that you bring a company in from out of the state of North
Carolina, you offer them incentive money, JDIG money or whatever, and
you ask the other businesses that exist here to pay for those different
companies coming in, sometimes their own competitor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, the jobs created by Metropolitan coming to North Carolina
created net dollars to the treasury, the other companies aren&#39;t
paying for that. MetLife contributed more to the treasury than it
received in incentives.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Secretary, there is also a need for new roads,
there&#39;s also a need for new prisons, there are also need for new
educational facilities. Let me assure you, the amount of money that
you&#39;re talking about coming in from the withholding is minuscule
compared to the capital expenses that come forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And those 2,600 people also pay property tax and they buy things and
they pay sales tax. They are citizens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. Okay, now let&#39;s look for a second-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, you two have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We&#39;re going to do it that way. Okay. It&#39;s sunshine week. Go
ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Secretary, we had what I would consider an excellent presentation by
Brent Lane the other day describing the incentive programs and talking
about the different options, JDIG being one of them, and he talked about
a couple of issues, specifically return on investment as far as the
money that we give for the withholding in those cases. And as a matter
of fact, when you talk between 10 and 75, how many times have you ever
given anything, and not you, the Department of Commerce, giving

  <p id="30:00">
  Anything less than 75% of the withholding knowing that that&#39;s the
top limit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The average is 57%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Then let&#39;s talk about the success of the JDIG program if we
may. In 19, excuse me, in 2014, North Carolina created roughly 114,500
jobs. They projected with the JDIG 5,776 and they actually got 1,950.
How can you spend all of that JDIG money to create 1950 jobs when
114,000 of them were created without any of that incentive money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You don&#39;t, you don&#39;t spend all that money, because it&#39;s a
look back. Every year, you only reimburse based on the actual number of
jobs created. Every year for 12 years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If they only create 1,000 jobs, they only get reimbursed for 1,000 jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister secretary, under the circumstances, we didn&#39;t spend any money
and we got 100% of the taxpayers&#39; money on the 114,000 jobs that we
created. Actually supporting organic growth, for example, any, we have
had 450,000 small businesses in the state of North Carolina. If 10% of
them create one new job, that&#39;s 45,000 brand new jobs without
spending one penny of incentive money. It comes from the fact that
we&#39;ve lowered taxes and we&#39;ve made it a better business
environment. Wouldn&#39;t you think that&#39;s a better way than going
with, without incentives?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it&#39;s one of the ways I think the incentive program is
absolutely necessary because we have to have it to be competitive. Every
other state in the Southeast is using taxes, regulatory facility, and
incentives. If we don&#39;t want to be competitive, we shouldn&#39;t
have an incentive program. If we want to be competitive, we need to have
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a last, just a last point. And I&#39;ll, and I&#39;ll just talk to
you. One of the factors that kind of makes me scratch my head, the but
for criteria. And I think what that really means is that you say, Bob
Rucho, you come here, or  you&#39;re already here in North Carolina, in
Charlotte, and if you sign this contract with me that says but for, I
would be going to South Carolina unless you give me some incentive money
to keep me here, how effective is that but for in really determining
whether that company was going to be here to begin with, or are they
just sandbagging us and taking our money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My sense after two months, Senator, is it is effective. We have three
opportunities right now that are looking for JDIG awards in the next
seven days, maybe sooner, and I will tell you assuredly I am convinced
they will not come to North Carolina if we don&#39;t make an award. One
of the cases is a but for, but for this award, I&#39;m gonna take 175
jobs and move them to another location that I already have out of state,
or if I receive the award, I&#39;m gonna bring 100 jobs to town. So I am
very convinced that the but for test is real and it works.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just that the evidence really doesn&#39;t show that, mister secretary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe Senator Rucho had a girlfriend one time that said, yes I will,
but, but for. I got a bus to catch. But for, I&#39;ve had that promise,
I know what you&#39;re talking about. Who is your Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I just wanna get that clear before we go any further.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have a follow up, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ve got a question. I&#39;ve got a real question, now. Mister
secretary, I know you and you know me. Now that may be good, it may not
be, but I&#39;ve got a simple question. Rucho was walking all over this
question that I&#39;ve been wanting, wanting to ask you for a long time.
We have tax structures and we&#39;ve done a lot to reform our tax
structures, which make our business climate go up to the top tier in the
nation now, and I think that&#39;s gonna attract a lot of jobs. And
we&#39;ve done some other reform with unemployment and so forth.
That&#39;s helped. But if you had a choice, and I don&#39;t want a both
on this one, JDIG grants or tax reform and lowering the rate, spreading
the base, that type of thing. As you know, I had a constituent that made
$40 million last year. Now, he told me it took him 41 to make it. No,
no, it wasn&#39;t you, and it wasn&#39;t even in Pinehurst. It was up in
Level Cross. But anyway, if we cut him from, if we cut him 2 percentage
points on his personal income tax on $40 million, that&#39;s a bunch of
jobs, and he&#39;s doing that very thing right now, expanding a
business. You got a choice between JDIG grants and tax reform that
affects everybody

  There&#39;s no--there&#39;s no gimmicks in that. You just pay what the
rate is. Which would you, which would you favor?
SPEAKER CHANGES
We are getting to a very favorable tax structure in this state. There is
no question. But today,  maybe long-term the answer is tax, but today,
because of the competitive environment in the Southeast, I have to go
with the incentive program.
SPEAKER CHANGES
One follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I&#39;m hoping that one of them&#39;s in Randolph County. I&#39;ll say
no more. You don&#39;t have to answer that!
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Wells.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you for being here, Secretary. You miss dinner yet? No, that
wasn&#39;t the question. We&#39;ve talked about--we have talked about,
and you and previous Secretaries of Commerce have given us elaborate
financial models of what kind of return we get on our incentive dollars.
But every time I&#39;ve heard those, they&#39;re in a vacuum, and
it&#39;s assuming we don&#39;t do anything else with the dollars. So
following up some of the conversation, do you have specific modeling to
compare JDIG, JMAC, whatever, whatever incentives programs, versus
specific tax reform. For instance, manufacturers in this state are being
double-taxed on labor, and double-taxed on investment. And they&#39;re
just going along with it, there&#39;s no politicians cutting ribbons
there, they just plug along creating jobs, and have been for 30 or 50 or
100 years. Do we know, can we--do you have a hard comparison on
incentives versus moving to, say, a single-sales apportionment factor?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator, my understanding of single sales is everybody wants it, and my
answer is that everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
to get there. I think the House, the Senate, and the governor all
support single-sales apportionment. But the problem is the revenue loss
between the time you flip the switch and the time you fully implement it
is significant. And I don&#39;t have a hard number. I&#39;ve heard
between $100 and $180 million. So if we can figure out a way to get to
heaven without dying, I think everybody&#39;s in favor of that. But
remember, you articulated a group of people who are paying twice. If you
switch it the other way, there&#39;s a different group of people who are
going to be paying more. It doesn&#39;t simply lower the tax for all the
taxpayers. Those that benefit--there are others, significant players in
the state, who will be hurt by it. So unfortunately, it&#39;s not an
easy answer. I think everybody would love to get there, but it&#39;s
going to take some time to figure out how.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Senator ??, following up.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Secretary, on the single sales factor. It appears--it&#39;s only
$103 million if was done immediately over three or four years it would
be significantly less to accomplish that. But if you look at the map and
all of the states in the Southeast that presently have it--South
Carolina, Georgia, I think Virginia has some modified version of it--are
we not at a competitive disadvantage to those states? I think we just
lost a plant to South Carolina, a corporate entity that would have
benefitted from sales tax--a single sales-factor apportionment--because
of the fact that we didn&#39;t have it and they did. And that was a
manufacturing facility.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I don&#39;t know about manufacturing. I know a jobs--a corporate
headquarters we lost to Georgia that would have benefitted by it. I
don&#39;t know about the manufacturing one.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES
But to answer your question, I don&#39;t think anybody disagrees. I had
a meeting with Senator Berger and Speaker Moore and the governor this
week, and we all agreed, we&#39;d love to get there. The question is
how. It&#39;s going to take time to vet that process.
SPEAKER CHANGES
To use your own words, as far as during the transition period, you need
to have JDIG. Well, this transition period means that we really need to
have single sales factor if we&#39;re going to be a competitive
environment. Wouldn&#39;t we?
SPEAKER CHANGES
In the long term. Not in the short term. Not anything that is currently
pending is going to be impaired because House Bill 17 suggests that we
continue the billion-dollar investment for single source.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I&#39;m not the only person--I&#39;m sure other people have had a number
of large corporations come into my office that have been making large
investments in the state. A lot of other businesses just like--and not
one of them--?? came in, and a couple of others--but we have put our
large businesses that have invested in employees and invested

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you mentioned RJR. I think the current statute was done because
RJR wanted it that way in 1984. Well, my research indicates that it was
for RJR.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Daniel?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman and mister secretary. I wanted to follow up a
bit on Senator Brown&#39;s thinking about rural areas, and when I&#39;m
in forums at home with the chamber of commerce, one of the questions
they always bring up is how do we keep our kids from going to Carolina
and NC State and staying in Raleigh, how do we get people to come back?
And, and when you concentrate 83% of your, your economic development
investment in the Triangle in Mecklenberg, I think you&#39;re only
exacerbating that problem. And I know the argument is that wlel,
we&#39;re gonna send all the money to Wake, Mecklenberg, and Durham, and
then we&#39;re gonna slice off a little bit of it and put it in the
utility account, and that&#39;s supposed to be enough to create economic
development in rural areas. So my question is, do you have any evidence
that the utility account is actually being transformative in any real
way, in any, in rural areas? If so, what are some examples of that,
because in my district at least I haven&#39;t seen that that has been
the case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know it&#39;s being used. I know $39 million of it has been spent
around the state of the 50 that&#39;s in there. The general assembly
took $11 million of it back last year for whatever purposes, but it is
absolutely being deployed, and there&#39;s another question that needs
to be asked about the utility account and the JDIG program. And I&#39;ve
had people say to me, I&#39;ve never had a JDIG awarded in my county,
but the question is, were any JDIG awards offered? And the company chose
not to come for whatever reason. I think there&#39;s a significant
number of those. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve tracked them
historically. I do know of a number of counties that have had offers but
not acceptances, which also is an additional indicator of the fact that
we need these incentive programs, because they left anyway. How are we
gonna solve this with the kids going off, every state, every city, every
place in the United States has the same problem. If you look at the
state of Missouri, I had the opportunity to talk to Chris Chung about
it, 80% of the people in Missouri live in St. Louis and Kansas City.
They too are trying to figure out how to get people back into the
smaller towns. The market is speaking, and we&#39;ve got to listen to
the market, because as long as we are not having the small towns support
the big towns the way the program works, the market is speaking. There
is one thing that I&#39;m very bullish on that can help the rural
communities, and that is broadband coast to coast. We need to get
broadband into the rural areas in this state, and I&#39;ve got a plan
for it, I&#39;ve got a program for it. I am doing everything I can,
because that, along with, NC competes package is another provision that
historically has been known as crowdfunding that we&#39;ve changed to
PACES, providing access to capital for entrepreneurs and small
businesses. If we can create a PACES program to allow small businesses
of any variety, not just technology, and entrepreneurs to stay home and
have broadband access including the capital and the I2J, there will be
great reason to start your business in small towns because it&#39;s
cheaper.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister secretary. So I guess to follow up on my question, does
the department, if you give $100 million award to a Wake county company,
20 million over time should go into the utility account. Has the
department tracked utility account job creation in rural counties, or is
it just?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s a good question. I don&#39;t know if Stewart Dickenson is
here from my department. He might be able to answer that. I&#39;m not
sure they have ever tracked it, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are, are you requesting that Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I think if we are spending money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I might have an answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. It might be nice to know if we&#39;re getting anything for our
money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We, we have an answer in the back of the room. Thank you, we, we do have
an, we ask for you to identify yourself please, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

We do track that, and we can get you that report. The utility fund is a
very flexible fund. It&#39;s also used in counties that are getting
ready for economic development and doesn&#39;t require jobs. To bring
water and sewer and basic infrastructure to areas in those counties so
that they can attract jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. I have Senator Apodaca, then Senator Brock, and then
Senator McInnis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister secretary, in all fairness, though, neglected to thank you at the
beginning for what you and the Governor and the rest of the folks did
for the new company coming into Henderson County the week before last.
We do appreciate that. I believe we did that with one North Carolina
money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We did that with flexibility, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Flexibility to make it happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m all about flexibility, mister secretary, look at me. Mr.
Flexibility here, but we&#39;ve had a long break since last August, I
believe, when we took up the famous 1224 which I remind you was passed
easily out of the Senate and died an ugly death somewhere else. We
don&#39;t know where it went. Somewhere in South America, I think. But
anyway, could you tell us the difference between that bill and, is it,
House bill 17, 117. Do you know the difference between those two bills?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not. I understand there were a lot of ornaments added to the
Christmas tree in 1224. This bill is fairly simple. This has three, four
key components relative to incentives. One is right now we&#39;re out of
business. The world knows it. There is nobody in the world that
doesn&#39;t realize that North Carolina doesn&#39;t have a program. The
first is to add $15 million this year to the program so people will
understand we&#39;re seriously back in business. Two, extend the sunset
date to 2020 so people don&#39;t have to think in terms of what&#39;s
coming next year, because we already had the 1224 experience last
session, and we need to get back into the game in a big way. Three, we
want to extend single source sales to tier three counties because if
anybody coming into a tier three county and making a billion dollar
investment we probably want in the state. And four, there was a $20
million catalyst fund that was appropriated last time around, and there
seemed to be some issue with that that it was a little too free wheeling
at the discretion of the secretary, so we&#39;ve asked to put that into
the site infrastructure fund which has some rules around it to give us a
little bit of flexibility. Now, there have been two addition. The fuel
tax in Charlotte and the data centers, but that&#39;s it. It&#39;s very
simple.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s what passed the House.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McInnis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister secretary, and I appreciate you being with us today. I
know you live down in Moore County and that of course ?? two of my
counties, both of those being in the super tier one of the bottom of the
barrel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sanderson Farms just came, of course, to Rutherford County and those are
lower paying jobs than the rules require. Is that correct in my
understanding that that&#39;s the reason there was no JDIG money put in
that and it was all one North Carolina fund?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, there was no JDIG money. We couldn&#39;t have given them a JDIG if
they wanted it, because we don&#39;t have any money, but back to Senator
Brown&#39;s question, those were jobs in the $30,000 range. Those jobs
probably wouldn&#39;t have contributed net dollars to the state coffers,
because probably most of those people don&#39;t pay state tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that, mister secretary, is the point of my question. We would love
to have some 10 or 11 or $12  an hour jobs in Scotland county and
Richmond and Anson county because that would give us a start, because we
got 10% unemployment and of course Scotland county now has the
distinction of being the poorest county in North Carolina. Richmond and
Anson right in there with us. So is there any program or any arrow in
your bag, in your quiver, if you will, that would help us get some 9 or
10 or $11 an hour starter jobs for a workforce that&#39;s not
necessarily technically astute. That&#39;s, that&#39;s what we need and
we really need it sooner than later.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me, let me expand on that a little bit. Just before the announcement
in Rutherford County, there was also an announcement in Polk county for
about 400 jobs with Butterball Turkey. They too, were low paying jobs.
  </p>

  <p id="50:00">
  And there was some concern that oh, everybody&#39;s gonna get upset
because these are only $30,000 jobs. The number one asked question from
the 150 people that were there was how soon can I apply? And there were
two remarkable examples at that, at that announcement. Two gentlemen
were introduced. One was the new plant manager of the, of the program in
Polk County, and the other was his boss, who was the plant manager of
three Butterball plants. All three of them had started as hourly
employees in the plant. So simply because they start there doesn&#39;t
mean they&#39;re gonna end up there, and Senator, I&#39;m with you all
the way, but I can say 1,100 jobs in Rutherford County is a good start.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, thank you, Senator. Senator Brock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I just wanted a product placement shot for a
good North Carolina company here, Chair One, but John, Happy Anniversary
of two months. But we know the, the problems in the past with the
Department of Commerce with giving incentives to companies that did not
want incentives, and we also look at the data of the JDIG program, and
the success rate is just not there as far as what was promised to the
legislative body. What I&#39;m looking at is what will you do in the
Department of Commerce to make sure that we have those victories? What
changes will you make as far as look at the data, recruit the companies
that will have the biggest impact in our areas that need help, as
Senator McInnis just said. And also which ones will stay here, because
that&#39;s the full implementation of the JDIG program was to make sure
they&#39;re here, full employment, and stay here and not be wooed by
another state. They can give an incentive package and they&#39;ll be up
and gone in a few years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you&#39;re exactly correct. The problem we face is that people
are smart. They understand that they can play one against the other, and
at what point do you take the risk that they&#39;re serious or not
serious? It&#39;s a tough call, and remember 50% of these companies are
using third party consultants who really know what&#39;s going on and
are also compensated by the amount of the incentive package that they
can get. So the odds are kind of stacked against us. At what point in
time do you say, go ahead and move on out. I don&#39;t believe
you&#39;re gonna do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Do you have a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you, Senator McKissick, and ladies and gentlemen, we will
take Senator McKissick&#39;s and one more question, and I will say but
for session, we would stay here and hear all of the questions. Senator
McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister secretary, two questions. First, if you look at overall, the
performance of the JDIG program, it looks as if historically, the state
has not been very good at times in really identifying what I call the
winners and losers in terms of deciding which firms to make JDIG awards
to because not all the jobs that were anticipated have come to fruition.
Do you have any ideas about the way criteria could be improved so that
we see a higher success rate in terms of the jobs being projected and
jobs that are promised versus jobs that are actually created within the
window of time that&#39;s specified?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I think we always win. If someone forecast 1000 job creation,
and they get $1 million JDIG, and they only create 400 jobs, they
don&#39;t get $1 million JDIG. They get something considerably less
based on actual jobs created, so in my mind, they&#39;re giving us five
dollars, we&#39;re giving them three back for a period of time, but
there&#39;s always two left in the treasury. So I&#39;m not sure that it
isn&#39;t an infinite return on investment if we didn&#39;t otherwise
have the job. Now, I&#39;ll agree with Senator Rucho, organic growth is
the cheapest. If you have a company getting more business out of current
client is the cheapest thing to do rather than spending marketing
dollars. But it&#39;s always not the case. But, to your question, we are
always creating net wealth to the treasury based on the way the award is
calculated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow up, if I could, mister chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quickly please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess the thing which I&#39;m trying to get a better grip over is
we&#39;ve seen so many projections of job growth, and I agree that
ultimately we don&#39;t pay out money that does not come in,
theoretically, but what can we do to make sure that the projections
which are being made by these firms, and obviously there are firms that
are qualified for JDIG and get the benefit, but others that apparently
do not. And

  <p id="55:00">
  I don&#39;t know what that ratio is because that information never
becomes truly available as far as I&#39;m concerned, and I have not seen
that. But I&#39;m trying to see what we can do to make certain that when
those projections are made, the forecasts are made, the announcements
are made that not, ultimately we don&#39;t become a net loser because
the way the program works you can&#39;t, but that we actually achieve
the success which is articulated. And then there&#39;s a second phase to
this, all these jobs we&#39;re talking about now are based upon
anticipated revenues that are coming in from employees and, as you
acknowledged, those employees may be coming from out of state. What can
we do to incentivize or create opportunities for people to actually hire
current North Carolinians that may be out there unemployed or
underemployed, to take those jobs, as opposed to simply relying upon
importing people, not that we don&#39;t want them, we do, but I also
want to see those that are unemployed or underemployed get jobs first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I guess the only thing that comes to mind, until we become
central planners, which I don&#39;t believe in, I&#39;m not sure anyone
can answer the question because the market is going to decide. An
employer can estimate 1,000 jobs and a recession could occur. There are
a lot of reasons that they don&#39;t hit their forecast. The number, by
the way, is about 40%, we pay about 40%. Just because we pay out 40%
doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a failure. As far as I&#39;m concerned,
that&#39;s 40% new jobs we did not have, so it&#39;s always a net
winner. At some point in time the market is ultimately going to tell us
how they run their company.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Rucho, if you would please make an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, just an announcement, Wednesday&#39;s meeting, [??] Asset Sales,
will be discussed only in the Finance tomorrow and there may be an
additional bill on the calendar. You can pay close attention to it but
we meet tomorrow at 1:00.

questions. Committee members, thank you and, again, but for session we
