  <p>House Bill 122, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To the press, to the Senate, the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, the Conferees appointed to resolve the difference
between the Senate and House of Representatives on their House Bill 122,
a bill ?? to be the laws pertaining to interlocutory fields, as related
to family of law, and modified the law regarding discipline for judges,
the Conferees recommend the Senate and the House of Representatives

Senators Newton, Barringer, and Daniel. Conferees for the House of
Representatives; Representative Glazier, Chair, Representatives Stevens,

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To move an option to the conference report and speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman is recognized for the motion and to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members, this is a conference report
that&#39;s unanimous. This bill passed the House 115-0 many decades ago,
I believe. And it amends the rules of procedure to allow interlocutory
family appeals. I know of no opposition, and urge at the option of the
conference report. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Further discussion, further debate.
If not, the motion before the House is to adopt the conference report
for House Bill 122. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The
clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will let the machine record the vote, 89 having voted in the
affirmative, and none in the negative. The House has adopted the
conference report for House Bill 122. The Senate will be so notified.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, we&#39;re about to begin the debate
on the motion for concurrence for House Bill 589. In light of other
matters that we need to account time for, the Chair will provide 90
minutes of debate for the minority caucus, and 30 minutes of debate for
the majority caucus, for a total of 2 hours. In the process of the
debate, if any member requests to interrupt someone speaking, the time
allocated to respond to that question will be allocated to the side who
asked the question.
Before we begin on that motion Representative Stam please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To make a motion with respect to Senate Bill 182, limit Superior Court
appeals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman may state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The motion is, having voted on the prevailing side, I move to reconsider
that vote by which it prevailed, and I&#39;ll explain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Right before the recess we adopted a conference report. The Senate has
not yet adopted it. Staff found an error, and they&#39;re preparing a
new conference report, so if we could, if you would vote with us on
that, recall that, so we could then withdraw that conference report.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Ladies and gentleman, the motion is the motion to reconsider the vote on

  <p>In consultation with the Senate my rules chair and other leaders we are
trying to determine the amount of time we have left for the evening and
there are other matters that we have to take up. We anticipate possibly
one other rules meeting before we are done. We have technical
corrections for the budget to take up. We have at least one or maybe two
or three more conference reports and the chair is trying to manage the
time in order we may get out of here. So we may be able to complete the
business before the mid night hour.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well Mr. Speaker it&#39;s traditionally being l been
the practice of the house that the minority leader is involved in the
discussion before we put in time when we are in debate just wanna be
clear that we didn&#39;t agree to any limitation on debate was not our
plan to be limited on debate and so we are on the opinion this in
impotent enough deal to have unlimited wait for our side.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman&#39;s pint is taken. The chair would
point out that the speaker has or the chair has limited the debate to
3/4th to the minority carcass 1/4th to majority carcass as has been in
the practice and number of other cases and every case in minority
carcass has got the majority often times here overwhelming majority and
the chair is trying to show respect at the same time manage the limited
time we have between now and mid night and the gentleman is quite aware
that the obligation at the outside of 6 minutes for moving the previous
question goes far beyond when we are taking about 2 hours of debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is it intension of the majority carcass to limit the
debate if the time is what is considered is approximately 2 hours is
that what we have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. If the opinion in the chair the other
matters that the chair is trying to reserve time for that time can be
freed up then we would provide any additional time to the minority
carcass if the time is available and if the time is needed. It&#39;s
also the observation of the chair there been a couple of instances where
we had the time allotment and all the time was not taken.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If the majority carcass is wanting the time to be
limited 2 hours had requested the minority carcass be given 2 full
hours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Noted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would leave the house of the house to be committed to
go past 9 o clock pm this evening for session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection. Sir Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up question Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will yield without objection rule 12H
suspended. The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker this is a concurrence vote on this bill is
it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We can vote this bill tomorrow as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. The vote will be taken tonight. House
bill 589 three clerk will read.
Senate committee substitute for house bill 589. A bill to be entitled.
An act to restore confidence in government by establishing the voter
information verification act to promote the electoral process through
education and increased registration of voters and by requiring voters
to provide photo identification before voting to protect the right of
each registered voter to cast a secure vote with reasonable security
measures that confirm voter identity as accurately as possible without
restriction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker inquiry check.
[SPEAKER CHANGES The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I would like to raise a motion and I would
to hear what my motion is of you don&#39;t mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his intend.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It&#39;s my intend to make the motion persuade to rule

  <p>[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This has come back as a fifty seven page bill including many, many, many
other things that have not been vetted in conference and in order to be
fair, I&#39;m just asking that you allow my motion, that this house go
into committee as a whole to vet the bill and bring it out of that
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To respond to the gentlemen&#39;s request for a motion under rule
thirty. I don&#39;t know if the motion is actually proper before the
house but I would rise an opposition to the motion and simply point out
the redundancy. I can&#39;t think of the last time that a, that the
House has met as the committee of the whole. It is, it would be
pointless to do so because the committee of the whole would be the
entire House setting as a committee and then later simply sitting as the
House. It&#39;s a complete waste of time. And so the, it is standard
under our rules for this bill to come back for a concurrence vote in the
matter it is. It has gone through the proper committee hearings. It has
gone through the proper hearings, both in this House, both in the Senate
committees, both in the, in the Senate and its properly before us. It
would be unnecessary and simply a waste of time to do so and I would
encourage the body, should the gentlemen proffer the motion to reject
the motion to go into the committee of the whole.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, in the opinion of the chair, the gentlemen&#39;s
intent is in order. It requires a simple majority vote. We will take a
vote on this to, to,  the gentlemen&#39;s motion is to convene as the
committee of the whole.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I move that we go into committee of a whole in order to discuss
the committee substitute for the House bill, five eighty nine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To, to speak to, to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen&#39;s recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker again, Mr. Speaker and members, I would urge the body to
vote against the motion. It is, it is with all due respect to the
gentlemen from Durham, I would submit it is simply a waste of time that
the committee of the whole is the same as the full House in terms of
party&#39;s who are here to hear the bill. The bill is properly before
us and we should act as the House to do this. In fact I can&#39;t think
of the last time the House has met as the committee of the whole. I
don&#39;t even know if its met since madame clerk has been, since shes
been our clerk. So its been many years since most of us were ever here.
I would ask the members to vote no on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentelmens recoginized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I know that this may be the first time in a long time that
we have met as the committee of the whole but certainly we spent a lot
of time and put in a lot of effort in the rules at the start of session.
And our rules provide for us to go into the committee of the whole. It
also provides for further discussion on this bill that has had all of
these provisions added. So I&#39;d ask that you support the motion to go
into the committee of whole so all of the members can have participation
on all the things that got added to the bill that we sent to the Senate
that was about fourteen pages and is now well in excess three times that
size.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All members will yield. It is the intent of the Chair to take the vote
on this motion now. The question before the House is the motion to meet
as the committee of the whole. All in favor vote &quot;Aye&quot;. All
opposed vote &quot;No&quot;. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk
[???] machine will record the vote. Forty one have voted affirmative and
sixty nine in the negative. The motion fails. Representative Lewis is
recognized to, for a motion. Are both amendments read? Both amendments
need to be properly read. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Stand up. By Senator Rucho moves to amend the bill on page. Rucho moves
to [???] the bill on page two, lines thirty eight through forty three by
rewriting those lines to read.

  <p>The clerk will read the Second Ammendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Blue moves to ammend the bill on page 53, line 12, by deleting
September 15 and substituting September 7 on that line.
[Speaker Changes]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion and to debate the motion.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. Speaker, I move that the house do concur with the senate ammendments
as read by the clerk.
[Speaker Changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, the ammendments that you have
before you.  The first one sends forth Senator Rucho is labeled
H589AST-150 version five.  It moves to ammend the bill in several ways.
I&#39;ll be as brief as I can.  The first it expands and better defines
the type and number of identifications that may be presented at the
polling site to vote.  It then, on line 18 makes a techincal correction,
it does the same thing on line 21.  Beginning on page 21, on line 23 and
then continuing to the second page, it defines that the county boards of
elections will maintain the same hours of early voting in the
presidential years that they maintained in 2012 at a minimum, and they
will maintain, at a minimum, the same number of hours for a
non-presidential year that they maintained during the 2010 election
cycle.  The intent of that, obviously, is to make sure that the
important tool of early voting is maintained and that our citizens have
the opportunity to acces it.  Continuing on page two of the second
ammendment, you will find again on line 11, this ammendment will further
contemplate that by a unanimous board.  Excuse me, Mr. Speaker, by a
vote, unanimously of the board of elections in the county, which would
include of course, two members of the party of the governor, and one
member, who is not a member of the party of the governor.  A unanimous
vote, of the county board, may submit a request to the state board, to
reduce the number of hours that I just spoke of.  We&#39;ll find at the
bottom of that page, the bottom of that page is also a technical change
to the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I now will speak on the second ammendment,
which is H589AST-153 version one, was submitted by Senator Blue.   This
ammendment purely is a date change, it has to do with the amount of time
allowed for electioneering.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I would commend to
the house that this house does adopt both of these ammendments sent to
us from the senate.
[Speaker Changes]
Ladies and gentlemen of the house, I am going to use the cue that is
available to me up here to call in turn to the minority leader and
others which do have recognized members out of turn, please let me know.
 Does the gentleman wish to be recognized first?
[Speaker Changes]
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I have a listing of the order for members from our
side.  I have these two ammendments, have been voted for the actual
concurrence vote itself.
[Speaker Changes]
Members, just to be clear on this vote, this vote is the passage of the
two senate ammendments that were read in by the clerk.  After we do
that, we will be debating the bill, as ammended. The question before the
house is... I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;re behind two members.
[Speaker Changes]
Um, why can&#39;t we see the ammendments, why does it say block vote?
[Speaker Changes]
The ammendments, Representative McManus, the ammendments are there are
being voted together.  We can have staff back there to help you.

  <p>[LONG PAUSE] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The, Representative Brawley,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just for a question of the
Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I have discovered that if I go to calendar and then click on
the amendments individually, I can read them. I didn’t know if that was
unique to me or[CROSSTALK] [SPEAKER CHANGES]?? on time for
Representative McManus to get to the proper place on the dashboard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve got it, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The question
before the House is concurrence in Senate amendments 11 and 13. All in
favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
[PAUSE] The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 109 having
voted the affirmative, none in the negative, the House has concurred in

Aye on the last [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recorded as having
voted Aye on the concurrence vote. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [LONG
PAUSE] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the conference report. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, the conference report before us, the
first portion of that is a voter information verification act that we
voted out of here this past April with a bipartisan vote of 81 [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Warren, just as a correction. The Speaker
misspoke. You are speaking on the concurrence motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct sir, thank you. We voted out of here in April on a
bipartisan vote of 81-36, and it comes back to us with a few changes.
You may, just for recollection, this bill was crafted, taking into
consideration that every person has a right to vote, and that right to
vote has to be protected. The bill was crafted in such a manner as to
provide for the integrity of the voting process. And it took into
consideration in the formation of this bill, the consideration of the
viewpoints of people who were opposed to the concept of voter ID. But it
is essential, just as essential, that every person who has the right to
vote gets to vote, that that vote be protected and not negated by fraud.
The Senate, working on the bill, made very few substantive changes to
the VIVA act and I’d like to go over those with you. First of all, the
VIVA board on the state level was deleted. The educational provisions
were consolidated under just one section of the bill, and modified just
to eliminate those that had significant expense associated primarily
with VIVA program. There were several categories of acceptable IDs that
we had listed in the House. We had a total of 13. They’ve cut that back
to 7. But what we lost in that was not really substantial. One of those
IDs was college IDs, and if you’ll check out actually the, some of the
websites for the state college

  <p>system, you&#39;ll see like for UNC Chapel Hill and UNC Charlotte in
order to get a student ID you have to have a photo ID, so we&#39;re
practicing redundancy if we&#39;re having the student ID&#39;s on there.
 So it&#39;s not a loss in that respect.  They maintained that expired
ID&#39;s could be used for folks who are 70 years of ago who had a valid
ID when they turned 70 and they may continue to use that ID after
it&#39;s expired.  A technical change was the provision on folks who
have lost their ID&#39;s due to a disaster. That was clarified on how to
get disaster declaration forms.  That was a change that was actually
requested by the local Board of Elections.  Another technical change was
one that allowed criminal penalty language that the House had required
on the envelope to be actually printed on a separate piece of paper and
again that was at the request of the BOE.  One of the provisions I
noticed had been changed was the recognition of Indian tribes as
Representative Lewis pointed out on the first amendment offered by
Senator Rucho that was taken care of.  They had actually maintained
recognition of the seven state Indian tribes but failed to include the
provisions to validate those to bring them in compliance and they
brought those in with that amendment there. Other than that I don&#39;t
believe there were anything else that was possible to point out.
Everything else is fine.  Just for the sake of review I&#39;ll go
through the different parts of the VIVA bill itself starting with voting
in person which is going to require a photo ID and that list now
consists of a North Carolina drivers license, North Carolina special
identification card, a U.S. Passport, U.S. military ID card, a veterans
identification card containing a photo and produced by the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs, the Tribal Enrollment Card issued by a
federally recognized tribe which in our case is the Cherokee Tribe, and
then the seven state recognized tribes, and then a drivers license or
special ID card issued by another state, District of Columbia, or a
territory or Commonwealth of the United States but only if that
voter&#39;s registration is within 90 days of the election and then as I
mentioned the over 70 years of age expired cards would still be accepted
too.  There were exceptions.  They maintained our exceptions to the
photo requirement which included the religious objectors.  That should
be on page 1, lines 26-29, Section 2.3 of the Conference Report,
curbside voting was maintained, the natural disaster affadavit was
maintained and the reasonable resemblance determinations provisional
balloting for those without photo ID, all those provisions in the bill
that we passed on an 81 to 36 vote have been maintained in the bill. The
request for absentee ballot, that process was maintained as well.  The
voting by mail request, where if you&#39;re voting absentee ballot you
simply can go online and request an absentee ballot request form or you
can stop by BOE Office to pick one up in person, so all those provisions
were kept in place.  They changed nothing there in the remainder of the
bill. The provisions for creating a VIVA team in each county that we had
in our bill is simply referred to in here as a multi-partisan team.  It
would still be formed by the BOE in the county and that&#39;s designed
to help folks who are shut-in or have a physical need for assistance in
getting an ID, that provision in the 2-year phase-in is still in place
so the intent to educate and increase voter registration and education
is still in the

  <p>Bill. They have assistance for voters who are patients and have actually
have incorporated a study in this bill for further research on how we,
further study on how we can further help folks who need assistance and
special conditions.  At that point, the bill goes into Part 7 of the
bill which is outside of the veto, the VIVA realm and goes into a
addition to the VIVA bill, or expansion of the bill, which is a study on
filling  vacancies in the General Assembly.  This requires that a Joint
Legislative Elections Oversight  Committee would study and recommend a
method of filling vacancies in the general assembly. Part 8 of the bill
is in reference to filling vacancies in the United States Senate.  And
this would require that the Governor would appoint a person affiliated
with the same political party if a ??  Senator had been elected as the
nominee of a political party.  So in other words if, in our case right
now if Richard Burr was, if his position became available the Governor
would be appointing a Republican in that position, in Kay, Senator Kay
Hagan’s case it would be a Democrat.  Part 9 of the bill is about
filling vacancies in the U.S. House of Representatives and this
requires, again, that the Joint Legislative Elections Oversight
Committee study and recommend a method of filling vacancies in the U.S.
House by special election. Part 10 of the bill incorporates a bill that
we voted out of here last session. I think the vote then two years ago
was 115 to 0, and we voted it out of here this year on a vote of 117 to
0 and that is a special elections bill. As you may recall, that was a
bill that simply required that all special elections and referendums had
to be held during a county or a municipal general election or an even
year primary. And there were no changes at all that bill was just lifted
and stuck right into this.  Part 11 of the bill is, pertains to poll
observers. This would allow the chair of each political party in the
county to designate up to 10 additional at-large observers to attend any
voting place in that county and allow that list to be amended between
the one stop period and election day.  In addition to the two observers
assigned to the polling place, one of the at-large observers may also be
in the building enclosure with add that the poll observers are
authorized to be present and to move about the polling, voting place
prior to, during and following the closing of the polls until the chief
judging judges have completed all their duties.  Part 11 of the bill is
the elimination of preregistration.  This would eliminate
preregistration and make the necessary conforming changes to the law.
The ?? would become effective on September 1, 2013.  Voter
preregistration completed and received prior to that date would be
processed and registered as appropriate.  Part 13 of the bill is what
they referred to as a ?? ink on voter registration forms. And what that
would do is modify the current requirement to provide that only those
electronically captured signatures that are on electronic voter
registration form offered by a state agency are considered valid. Other
electronically captured signatures including those generated by computer
programs of third-party groups are not valid, except those provided in
the Uniform Military and Overseas Voter Act.  Part 14 of the bill covers
compensation for voter registration limitations, and basically in a
nutshell what that says is, it provides that anyone who is compensated
based on the number of forms submitted for assisting persons in
registering to vote would be guilty of a Class II misdemeanor. Part 16
of the bill eliminates same day voter registration. This part of the
bill would repeal general statue 163-82.6A and make conforming changes
throughout the statues to remove that provision related to same day
voter registration. At this point ladies and gentlemen colleagues, I’d
like to ask Representative Lewis to continue covering the other
provisions of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To what purpose does the gentlemen ?? Representative Lewis, rise
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I debate the bill Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

  <p>Debate the motion of ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, I’d like to
continue with the explanation of the bill and then offer some remarks,
if I could at the conclusion.  Part 17 of the bill it deals with
empowering our militaries and overseas voters.  It directs stronger
language to the State Board of Elections to make sure that the ballots
are mailed out to our military and voters residing abroad in a  timely
fashion.  Part 18’s appeal deals of the voter role itself, it prescribes
 that the State Board of Elections show updated lists using their
program not less than twice, annually.  Part 19 of the bill eliminates a
old provision dealing with a mandated voter registration drive. Part 20
of the bill expands access to voter records. Part 21 of the bill deals
with the timing of the withdrawal of a notice of candidacy.  It says
that if an individual has filed for an office, that individual may
withdraw from that office up to three day, three business days prior to
the close of filing.  Part 22 of the bill lowers the threshold for
candidates that wish to appear on the ballot but are not able to pay the
fee.  They may get on the ballot by signatures on a petition.  Part 23
limits the withdrawal to appoint of a party nominee, pardon me Mr.
Speaker, it limits the withdrawal of a candidate to appoint when the
military and overseas ballots have been sent out.  Part 24, creates
another study to look at the management of extremely large precincts.
Part 25 deals with increasing consistency and access to early voting, it
was part of the amendment that we discussed earlier today, it reinforces
the intent that early voting is an important provision for the people
for the state, and that it will be maintained at levels comparable to
prior election date. Part 26 another effort to make sure that people
have the opportunity to utilize early voting. It would standardize
satellite voting sites. Which means that there would be more uniform
hours, in the way the sites operate. Part 27 is purely technical. It
deletes a reference to the 2000 census. Part 28 produces the need for a
second primary.  It lowers the current threshold from 40% to 30%. This
is a matter that has deceived, that has received considerable discussion
in the house and this bill would propose to address , to have a full
fledged legislative study to adjust the lowering of the second primary
triggering mechanism.  Part 29 is a technical change. Part 30 deals with
simplifying ballot records. Part 31, this would specify that the major
party candidates are listed first on the ballot, and the party of the
governor would be the party that would be listed first.  With note to
members of the house as will probably be explained later that this is a
return to prior law. Part 32 is a provision encouraging voters to vote
the person and not the party. It would eliminate the straight ticket
voting. Part 33 would regulate the extension of poll hours requiring the
State Board to authorize the extended hours of the polls. Part 34 is a
study to increase protections for persons needing assistance when they
cast their vote.  Part 35 is the scheduling of the Presidential
Preference Primary.  This would say that North Carolina would

  <p>POTUS Presidential Primary  on the Tuesday immediately following the
Saturday in which the state of South Carolina holds its. Part 36 allows
the State Board of Elections by majority of vote, to add additional
candidates to a primary ballot for President. As members know, current
law, the State Chair of each respective political party is the only one
that can add names to the ballot, this would allow the State Board to do
that. Part 38 of the bill repeals the Political Party’s Financing Fund,
it repeals the Judicial Elections Fund, the Voter Owned Elections Fund,
and repeals the fifty dollar surcharge on attorneys.  Part 39 deals with
voter list updates, reflecting the removal of, from the roles of
deceased persons.  This language is taken largely from a House bill that
passed 111 to 0.  Part 40, Part 41 will deal with studying electronic
filing of campaign finance reports. Part 42 would raise the individual
campaign contribution limits from 4,000 dollars per election cycle to
5,000 dollars per election cycle with an inflationary adjustment to
begin January 1, 2015. Part 43 has to do with expanding the use of the
Headquarters Building Fund. As members know, it is already possible to
have a Headquarters Building Fund that is funded and maintained in its
own entity, but the only use of that money now can be for the payment of
a mortgage. What this would do is allow the building fund money to also
be used  to rent a headquarters. It would allow for utilities inside the
building and would allow for compensation of up to three employees not
engaged in political advocacy.  Part 44 would repeal the provision that
requires spoken word disclaimers.  Part 45 would place term limits on
those serving on the state board of elections. Part 47 would specify
that a lobbyist may not collect, take possession or transfer campaign
contributions.  Part 48 would repeal a provision requiring disclosure of
candidate specific communications within a prescribed window.  Part 49
would require voters to vote in their proper precinct. Part 50 would
specify a date certain for electionary communication to be disclosed by
a person. This was part of what was amended by Senator Blue and passed
by this House moments ago. Part 51 would eliminate the instant run-off
for late-term judicial vacancies and specify that a plurality wins. Part
52 would direct election  officials to annotate provisional ballots for
retrievability.  Part 53, largely technical but important, would clarify
and define the reporting periods that are required from campaigns.  Part
54 is another study. Part 55 is a study.  Part 56 would delete the
requirement that ballot measure ads specify for or against. Part 57
would study the

  <p>elimination of the 48 hour reporting requirements, part 59 would specify
that it&#39;s not a violation of criminal law for a candidate or a
candidate&#39;s committee or a political committee to conduct a raffle
if it is reported.  Part 60 deals with the effective dates.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the deal you have before you is a
bill that seeks to ensure and promote participation, confidence, and
integrity of our election system.  It is a bill that will propel North
Carolina forward.  It will improve the confidence of the voters, that
their vote, when they go to the polls and cast their vote, that is their
votes cumulative that decides who wins the elections for which they are
participating.  It is a bill that protects the important sacred
constitutional rights of participation in our election process.
I respectfully ask the members of this House: vote to concur with the
Senate Committee substitute for House Bill 589.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston,
representing ?? rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Since this has to do with the dignity of the House I
think it&#39;s a question of privilege.  Did you suspend Rule 12H?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: We did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: What purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
representing ?? rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: To speak on the conference floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion to
concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House.
Probably one of the most important and one of the most pressing issues
that has faced this body and has faced the country is the matter of
voting.  Nationwide and statewide you have seen passions flame in the
matter of voting.  I think the only thing next to that would be the
abortion matter.  You deserve an opportunity to know why passions are so
enflamed as a result of our voting system, particularly in this state.
One of the reasons I made to call for a motion to call for a committee
of the whole was so that these matters that have been added to a bill, a
simple bill that you passed out for voter identification, could be
explained in much more detail than the two to three hours that we&#39;ve
got to do it in tonight.
They call this the &quot;VIVA bill.&quot;  Some of us have now labelled
VIVA as &quot;Voter Intimidation Vilification Act.&quot; That&#39;s
exactly what it is.  In order to be fair with you and in order for you
to understand why this situation is where it is, why it is such a
pressing problem in our state and in our nation.  I think you deserve to
know a little bit of history behind it.  For those of you who think
I&#39;m not talking on the bill, I would that this involves the bill you
have before you and what the problems are and the problems it&#39;s
going to create.
I want to take you back.  I want to take you back to just after the
Civil War when the Republicans were in charge and the North won the
Civil War and proceeded to free the slaves and put the Federal troops in
the South to make sure that the franchise was enjoyed by all who were
freed by that war.  As a result of that there where many African
Americans in legislature, in the Senate of the United States, and in the
Congress of the United States.  In fact, the only time in history when a
legislature had a majority African Americans members was in South
Carolina, immediately after that.  That legislation led to the first
free public schools in the county and to the cleanup of the hospitals
and jails in South Carolina.  In 1876, a Democrat, Samuel J. Tildon,
governor of New

  <p>Was elected as President of the United States. He won the popular vote.
But there came a problem with the electoral vote, and there were three
states where that problem reigned. I believe in that one of those states
was Florida, and deals were cut and deals were made, but nothing
availed. Inauguration was set for March the fourth of 1877, and finally,
members of the Republican party came to the anti-black Democratic party
and said listen, if you put our man in the White House, we will pull the
troops out of the South. That man was Rutherford B. Hayes, that deal was
accepted, and as soon as he got into office, he removed all the federal
troops from the South, which resulted in Jim Crow. That franchise that
had been won at that time was again lost. And it remained lost. Now
that, that&#39;s part of the history. That was the 19th century. Let me
fast forward to 1956, when a lot of folks got sick and tired of being
sick and tired of the way folks were treated, so the modern civil rights
movement began about that time, and public accommodations was the first
thing that came up, but lurking in the background were voting rights. We
had gone through an era where terror had been committed on a population
in this state by our neighbors. If you wanna know what terrorism is, we
have faced as a community, we have faced terrorism like the likes of
which you have not been seen. When you tried to vote, and we&#39;re in
the 20th century now, when you tried to vote, you were vilified, and you
were lynched. When you tried to get people to register to vote, you were
vilified, you were lynched, you were run out of town. We tried, and
those African Americans who served, they were completely wiped off the
map until about 1928 when Oscar De Priest in Illinois won a seat in
Congress. Be that as it may, once we started the campaign, we began to
push for voting rights. I was one of the ones that got out there and ran
in the back rows of North Carolina with John Lewis, fella named John
Edwards, Ben Ruffin, and we were going around in the Eastern part of the
state in the middle of the night trying to talk black folks into going
out and registering to vote. And every time we did we were rebuffed
because they were scared. They were frightened, because they knew if
they did, they would lose whatever sustenance that they had, what little
sustenance they had coming in, or that white folks would run them out of
town, and go about their business. So we were run out of several places
in North Carolina because we were trying to get folks to register to
vote. The reason I keep telling, I&#39;m saying this to you, is because
I want you to understand why this is such, why it means so much to so
many people. We have come a long way. In 1965 when the Voting Rights Act
was passed, that gave us a great deal of hope. We began to come into the
halls of the legislatures, city councils, and mayors races, all of these
things happened. Had it not been for the &#39;65 Voting Rights Act, you
would not see some of us sitting here today. And what we had done up to
that time, we had just run from disgrace to amazing grace. That&#39;s
what happened. You can&#39;t avoid, you would not have us here, and you
sit there on that side, looking at us, wondering how we got here. I can
understand what you feel, because you don&#39;t feel what we have felt
in this situation. It&#39;s sort of like the guy who cried because he
didn&#39;t have any shoes, then he saw the man who didn&#39;t have any
feet. So what you are doing with this bill, we have made progress, we
have made great strides.

  <p>Racial tensions have lessened as a result of that voting rights act of
1965. Now 3 weeks ago, the United States Supreme Court came out and said
that section 4 of the voting rights act was unconstitutional. Guess what
happened? The 14 pages that we had in voter ID turned into 57 pages of
things that we had fought for and had died for and had struggled for and
because section 4 was found to be unconstitutional, which means that you
didn&#39;t have to go and get the Justice Department to approve your
voting rights changes. Now folks, early voting, now, the think is this,
let me say this to you, you are sitting now, I don&#39;t know any of you
who voted who had to show an ID. I don&#39;t know any of the folks who
voted for you to show and ID. You took advantage of early voting. You
won your race fair and square, and now you want to change the rules of
the playing field because you want it under the rules that were put out
for us. So you see what rules that were put out for us benefitted you
more than it did us because you&#39;ve got a super-majority and you
could afford to advocate these things that those of us fought for and
died for. If you had had an opportunity to actually put this bill in
committee and study it, there are sections in this bill that you
wouldn&#39;t even vote for. You wouldn&#39;t. I mean, sure you&#39;re
going to vote for increased contributions, but because of early voting,
they say, you know, early voting benefitted those in the Democratic
party. Looks like it didn&#39;t, because you&#39;ve got the
super-majority. They say that straight ticket voting is out of the
question, that you choose a person and not the party, they say it&#39;d
get more benefit for Democrats, but look at you. It didn&#39;t hurt you.
So the passions are inflamed because we thought we were on a road to
having an open, free type of election. Now you&#39;re putting back those
things that many of us have fought so far for and many of us gave our
lives. I knew these people who gave their lives for that. Martin Luther
King, Jr was a close friend of mine. There were others. Malcolm X was a
good friend. I can call any name, number of names, I have talked to
those folks, I have sat in those folks company, and the one thing Martin
and I used to sit and talk, and he would say to me, he said Nicky, he
said you know, we need, we need economic power more desperately than any
other group in American society, but the only way that we can gain that
power is to sit in the seats of the halls of power, and that is by
elections. Now my friends, you can take us back. I have said over and
over again, we have morphed from the 19th century to the 21st century.
Forget all of the gains that were made during the 20th century.
That&#39;s what you&#39;re doing with this bill that you&#39;re trying
to pass here tonight. I would ask you, my friends, very simply, to take
this 57 page of abomination, to bind it and confine it to the streets of
hell for the rest of eternity. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does
the gentleman from Pearson, Representative Wilkins, rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak to the motion, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker, and I will restrict my comments to early voting.

[Speaker changes.]..amendment, as I read it, has the effect of possibly
adding early voting sites...uh...but it does not change the fact that
&quot;early voting time&quot; in this fifty-six page bill is cut by a
third.  You know as well as I know, that your folks and my folks in all
of these districts are quite infatuated with early voting and let me
just, as an example, use the primary in District 2, which I serve.  In
the 2012 primary, there were just slightly more than 10,000 votes cast.
Thirty-four hundred were cast in early voting, that&#39;s 34% of the
total vote cast in early voting.  I ask you to..uh... think long and
hard before you undermine this new tradition that your folks and my
folks obviously make such great use of.  I&#39;ll be voting against the
concurrence.
[Speaker changes.] For what purpose does the gentleman from Scotland,
Representative Pierce, rise?
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the..report.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[Speaker changes.]  Thank you, Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen,
just wanna thank you for this opportunity to speak. Representative Shaw
did a great job and I think many of us...uh...all of us would have to
recognize that but I thought about this...last coupla&#39; days.  Having
the power to oppress does not give one permission to oppress and, as
Chairman and President of the Legislative Black Caucus, I realize my
role more than ever this session.  Not only does the Legislative Black
Caucus speak on behalf of minorities but we speak on behalf of poor
Republicans, poor Democrats and poor Independents regardless of the
color.  We&#39;ve got to be the conscience and I hope we did just that
this year. When we think about elections and I hear alot of talk about
&quot;voter ID&quot; but the more I look at it as &quot;voter
suppression&quot;, an attempt to stop people from exercising their right
to vote that is a shame. But I was surprised, and I know the Speaker is
a honorable man and I know that he would speak truth and I remember in
an article that he wrote...that he was interviewed...and he was
sayin&#39; well, really, it&#39;s not about voter fraud.  And that made
me think about it...that...well, what is the real fraud, you know?
What&#39;s really going on? And, when I think about it, the real fraud
is...uh.. that the party in power has hijacked...make an attempt to
hijack the ballot box. Uh...ya need take your hands out the ballot box
because the folks that I represent...and many of us...???? the people
vote...and I was in a press conference the other day and I was
sayin&#39; if you have a product and you have a...you&#39;re tellin&#39;
the people what your gonna do when you get here and they believe in you,
they&#39;re gonna vote for you regardless...and I think we...uh,
Representative Lewis talked about getting away from straight-party
voting.  And if that comes to pass, then people will have choice..but I
think if we do the right thing when we get here and continue to do that,
people will vote for us.  But, ya&#39; know, I had to ask myself, if
it&#39;s about voter ID, what does prohibiting some types of paid voting
registration have to do with voter ID?  Taking souls to the polls, I
think many of you are familiar with that. ???? Particularly in the
minority community, we associate voting...our churches have been a part
of that over the years...I&#39;m trying to figure what does that have to
do with voter ID? But, ya&#39;know, when you look at this thing...
Democrats, Republicans, and Independents...if we take this privilege
away from the people that we represent, it&#39;s gonna come home to bite
you one day.  You might as well realize that because &#39;what goes
around, comes around&#39;. So I wanna say to us tonight, that we&#39;re
dealing with a time in history...and I hear Chairman Hall talk about it,
we talk about a two-hour debate.  The initiative we&#39;re talking about
tonight...it should be more than two hours because this is serious.
This would change this state as we know it. And it amazes me that people
from other states are laughing at North Carolina because of all this
stuff that we&#39;re doin&#39;...

  <p>Speaker: My daughter called me today, she is an educator, she said,
“Daddy, I think I am going to have to leave this state because of all
that is going on.” That is sad to hear, to get back to the bill. But if
you are going to do this tonight, we really need to think about what we
are doing: this is not about voter ID, this is about voter suppression.
And I would ask my colleagues: Democrats, Republicans and Independents,
we need to be very careful of what we are doing tonight because I do
believe that it will come back to haunt us. This sounds like foreign
countries that our men and women have died over seas fighting – in
countries where people are not allowed to vote. Is NC coming to the
place where eventually we will have armed guards and policemen at voting
poles to turn people around? I think it is a possibility if we are not
careful – we could be going there. So I want to courage you tonight to
vote no and let the people vote. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker: For what purpose does the lady from Gilford, Representative
Adams, rise?
Representative: To speak on the report.
Mr. Speaker: The lady has the floor to debate the motion.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the house. This is
a sad day for NC. It is a sad day for our citizens. It has been said
that the nation has been looking at NC and I know they are frowning. For
237 years, in this state, citizens have voted without problem. Now,
without verified documentation to support that there are problems, we
take a 14 page bill, now 57 pages, that is full of problems for voters –
full of problems. We say that the senate made two changes – really? A
few changes? We are trying to convince citizens that have voted for more
than two centuries without barriers, without problems, without cost,
that now we need to verify who you are with a photo id, that now you
cannot register and vote on the same day, and now you cannot vote for
the same period of time for early vote, and you cannot even vote on
Sunday, and when you get to the polls you cannot vote a straight ticket
if you want to. We have even worked it out in this bill that you will
have to stay all day because we have guaranteed, with what we have done
here, that the lines are going to be longer. We have gone to the
extreme, the unnecessary extreme, to create barriers. We have targeted
young people, high school students: they cannot pre-register before they
are 18th birthday – even if they will be 18 right before the election.
That is not right. We should be teaching them civic responsibility. We
are targeting college students: they cannot use their OID. We are
targeting church folk, minorities, and women too. Viva takes our state
back hundreds of years – where we do not need to be going in 2013. I
will be voting no for the sake of our democracy.
Mr. Speaker: For what purpose does the lady of Hartford, Representative
Mobley, rise?
Representative: To speak on the motion.
Mr. Speaker: The lady has the floor to debate the motion.
Representative: Thank you sir. Ladies and gentleman, this is difficult
for not just me, but a number of us, with regard to this vote. My mother
who is about 86-87 years old, had always prided herself on going to the
polls to work, and even now, if we allowed her, I think she would still
be going to the polls to work because she enjoyed it. She enjoyed
meeting people coming in and her talking to people. In committee, when
we were discussing this bill, I remember them saying that you would need
to have an ID to vote. There may be nothing wrong with having an ID, but
I assure…

  <p>You got a person who is in their eighties or nineties, mind, of sound
mind, and able to walk or even be rolled into the post to vote, and is
known in that precinct by everybody who is there, and as soon as they
walk in the door they are swamped by people wanting to speak to them and
talk to them, and then you ask them for an ID. Not only do senior
citizens forget, because I forget, you forget, and to say that because I
don&#39;t have an ID I can&#39;t vote, or I have to go back home and get
it. And then some of these people who are telling you have to have an
ID, they have to pay somebody to take them to the polls. So that takes
away from that little check that they get. Talking about voting on
Sundays? I see tractors rolling in the fields on Sundays on my way to
church. And you&#39;re going to say that you are going to take away the
ability to vote on Sunday? Something is wrong with that picture. Our
teenagers, our sixteen and seventeen year olds, and I&#39;m going to
read you a letter before I sit down, teaching them the reason for
voting, then they get old enough to be able to vote, and now you&#39;re
telling them that even at 16 and 17 they can&#39;t even vote? What are
we suppose to be teaching our children in high school if we don&#39;t
teach them responsibility, if we don&#39;t teach them their civic duty?
Something is wrong with this picture for me. The letter I want to share
with you comes from a constituent in my district and it reads, &quot;
Dear Ms. Mobley, I am a registered, independent voter in your district.
I would like to thank you for your service to me, my family, and my
neighbors. I am opposed to the proposed voters restrictions in Senate
omniscience voting bill H589 VIVA/electional form. I am especially
opposed to the new restrictions for people under guardianship. My son
will likely be under guardianship when he is old enough to vote. He is
14 now. Although I foresee the need for additional decision making,
support for some kind of responsibility, he would likely be more than
ready to vote as he chooses. I would like him to be free to vote on
election day and with the person of his choice to help him. He will
probably not have a drivers license yet when he is ready to vote, and I
do want him, I don&#39;t want him, I do not want him to have to deal
with the harass of getting a special ID. I would like him to register
early if he chooses to do that, or register the same day he votes, if
that is his choice. I am glad our elected representatives are so
interested in helping disabled people so others don&#39;t take advantage
of them. I would suggest the better use of our legislative energy
might...

more complete funding for home and community support through Medicaid
and more access through early voting. And just so you know, my son is
looking forward to voting against anyone who makes it harder for him to
vote. Me too. Thank you for your attention. And this is a constituent
out of Elizabeth City. In the name of this family, my mother and other
mothers who are 80, 90 plus years old, let&#39;s defeat this motion as I
will be voting against. Thank you.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Whitmire, I understand the gentleman wishes to be
recorded as having voted aye on House Bill 122. Is that correct?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Affirmative. Thank you sir.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The gentleman will be so noted as voting aye. For what purpose does the
gentleman from Northampton, Representative Wray rise?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
To speak on a bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you mister speaker and members of the house. This is a bill that
will affect all across North Carolina. For this whole session, and this
is one of the main bills here that will affect rural North Carolina,
taking away and cutting days from when people can go vote. It&#39;s not
about Republicans. It&#39;s not about Democrats. It&#39;s about
independence. It&#39;s about individuals. In rural North Carolina, we
have a lot of seniors that have to get people to carry them to the
doctor, to vote or whatever. But I&#39;m not going to sit here and do a
twenty minute speech. But again, people have a right to vote. People
fought for the freedom to vote. A lot of people have spoke before ??. I
was outside the chamber but I was listening to what you were saying. But
again, it&#39;s a freedom and right that we have and what we&#39;re
trying to do is just trying to kill people from wanting to go vote.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Mister speaker, point of personal privilege.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Gentleman is recognized for up to three minutes to a point of personal
privilege.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you mister speaker. Monday, my son had open heart surgery at Duke
University, the hospital. And yesterday I came because I wanted to
represent the people that I represent. I wanted to vote against a
budget, and I pushed a button to be recognized and I was not recognized.
But that&#39;s the privilege of the speaker. I came today to do what I
needed to do to serve the people of North Carolina. But I&#39;m not
going to be able to vote and stay here on a time frame that you have to
vote on this bill, but I wanted to speak on it. But from the bottom of
my heart, I would like to thank everybody for your prayers and thoughts
for my family. Whether you&#39;re a freshman or been here a long time,
God is very important to all of us, but your family is one of the most
important things in life. And my son, he had open heart, he had a donor
valve installed. He had his chest tubes pulled out today. I didn&#39;t
want to leave until all that happened. But mister speaker, again, thank
you giving me this point of privilege. Again, Ruth, thank you for
reaching out. Thank you all my colleagues because we are one big family.
But never forget this: everything is important but nothing is more
important than your family. And so, I want to vote on this bill but
I&#39;m not going to be here to vote on it. But again never forget this,
whether you&#39;re a Republican, Democrat: we all have feelings. We all
love each other. We can all agree and disagree. But I wanted to come
here to represent my constituents. But the most important thing to me is
my family and so that&#39;s the reason I&#39;m going to leave and not be
able to vote on this bill. So, God bless each and every one of you and I
wish you all a great rest of the summer because I will not be here
tomorrow. So, thank you.

Lucas rise?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I arise on this motion with heavy heart. You
know, I live in a military district. I have seen many of my neighbors
and members of my own family leave to go to foreign countries to protect
 the right to vote. Some of them have even died, did not come back,
trying to establish democracy, not in America, but over there. And then
I look at my whole state, right here in North Carolina, where we are
suppressing individuals right to vote. Now I have no problem with ID; I
think we ought to identify everybody who votes. But please don&#39;t
complicate their process to vote. That is a basic American right. We
ought to be easing that process. And then when you say that you&#39;re
not going to allow them to vote on Sundays. I don&#39;t know what the
rationale is, maybe it&#39;s religion; I don&#39;t know. But that&#39;s
an American fundamental right to vote. But if you&#39;re going to say
that, why not banish all those who are coming to golf courses on Sunday?
What about all those folks out on the lake, boating on Sunday?
That&#39;s not the American way. That has nothing to do with voting. ??
out those folks out there who race race cars on Sunday. Has nothing to
do with voting. But yet you&#39;re not going to let church going
American citizens, denying them that right to cast their ballot to
determine the future of their county, their city, their state, and their
nation. But you let them play, you let them ride boats, you let them go
see NASCAR events. I have a problem. You all have a problem. This is not
right. We should not do this. Protect every citizen&#39;s right to vote.
And if you can say in your heart that you&#39;re doing that, God bless
you. God bless you. The God that I serve tells me that any ?? as
you&#39;ve done this to the least of these my brother, you&#39;ve done
it unto me. Don&#39;t deny, suppress, folk&#39;s right to vote, and make
it inconvenient. I know you&#39;re saying that &quot;Well, we&#39;ve
opened early voting sites in other, oh we&#39;re going to expand those
in a comprehensive fashion, all at one time.&quot; Well if it&#39;s not
convenient on Saturday at five o&#39;clock. No matter where you at that
time, it&#39;s still not convenient on Saturday at five o&#39;clock.
That&#39;s the time the number of sites is not the issue. It&#39;s the
convenience of voting. Voting ought to be made available for everybody
who wishes to vote. And I will not say anymore because I know it&#39;s
not doing much good, but I appreciate your listening. Thank you.

  <p>[Speaker changes.]...the majority puts forward a smorgasbord of voter
restrictions and potentially intimidating obstacles to the right to
vote. What do I see in the bill?  It authorizes vigilante poll
observers...lots of them, with expanded range of interference.  It
expands the scope of who may examine registration records and challenge
voters.  It repeals out-of-precinct voting.  It repeals mandates for
high school registration drives. It exam...it eliminates flexibility in
opening early vote sites.  It makes it more difficult to add satellite
voting for the elderly and disabled.  It repeals three public financing
programs and, in doing so, ends a unique North Carolina experiment in
democracy where people counted more than money.  It repeals disclosure
requirements under candidate specific communications.  It weakens
disclosure requirements for electioneering communications.  It ends
pre-registration of sixteen and seventeen-year-olds.  It eliminates same
day voter registration.  It slices seven days off of early voting. It
eliminates straight party voting and a voter now can be challenged by
anyone in the county who doesn&#39;t like &#39;em.   Just hours after
the United States Supreme Court decided Shelby County, gutting the 1965
Voting Act requirements for certain states and local governments to get
pre-clearance, the majority made clear, they would pursue a far broader
set of voting changes in the state, changes that include this laundry
list of restrictions, the likes of which we have not seen in decades.
The proposed policy solutions of this bill are directed towards problems
that either haven&#39;t been substantiated by a modicum of evidence or
have been manufactured to scare the public into accepting egregious
limits on the most sacred constructs of democracy - the vote.  And what
problems do we as a legislature solve when we turn away the poor and the
elderly and the disabled and the college student from polling places
because they do not have an approved photo ID despite the fact that
everyone at the polling place knows who they are and can vouch for them?
 And what problems do we solve when we effectively issue a poll tax on
individuals who hafta pay $24 to obtain a copy of their birth
certificate to get their photo ID?  And what problem do we solve for the
single-working-mother who can only find time to vote at her polling
place after she gets off work on a Saturday afternoon?  And what problem
do we solve for the new resident of our state who shows up for same-day
registration only to be told &quot;Not here, not in North Carolina.
Maybe you can vote the next time.&quot;  And what service are we
attempting to render to young constituents of our state, when we not
only bar their use of valid student ID&#39;s for verification at the
polls but we eliminate pre-registration and mandatory voting
registration drives in high school...well, if these provisions don&#39;t
solve problems, they will surely create them...for you are telling the
next generation, in very clear terms, their voices don&#39;t matter,
their participation doesn&#39;t count.  The majority could have chosen a
very different path...one that Republicans and Democrats have for
several decades as Representative Michaux said...chosen increasing
polling sites, increasing access to voter registration, reducing
absentee ballot restrictions, extending times to vote...but the majority
will have none of that tonight.  So down one road we could&#39;ve
gone...more access, more opportunity, more people voting. Down the
other?  Less access, less opportunity, less people voting.  If you
didn&#39;t know who was going to vote in your mind or thought who was
going to vote Republican or Democrat, which road would you have
preferred?  But, better yet, which road do you think the public prefers?
 There is more to the right to vote than the right to make a ballot
proper or drop it in a ballot box or poll and check on a box in the
booth.  It is a right fought with blood and bravery, courage and
conviction and persistence and passion and, if the majority can strip
the minority of rights simply by resorting to fear, the foundations of
democracy are undermined.  No label.  No ten-second sound bite. No
&quot;voter fraud boogeyman&quot; can obscure the import of what the
majority does here tonight.  The New York Times,a number of months ago,
wrote...&quot;Discrimination at the ballot box continues and it
grows...it just comes in more forms than it did half a century ago but
it is no less pernicious.  Instead of literacy tests, we have rigid ID
requirements.  Instead of poll taxes, we have...

  <p>Bans or limits on the vote and instead of open opportunity we have
groups descending on minorities who vote on polls, checking registration
rolls for spelling errors. So now, although we don&#39;t have what
happened 50 years ago, we have second generation barriers and this bill
is chock full of them. Whatever the political gains or losses, the
dangers to democracy arising from voter suppression and intimidation are
always greater than the dangers resulting from increased access and
opportunity and freedom. For decades in North Carolina, we have been
about expanding democracy. Today the Republican majority narrows it.
Lyndon Johnson, when he was president and the voting rights act was
coming up said the following, the vote is the most powerful instrument
every devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the
terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other
men, but nights like this reinforce the fight for equality of man still
persists. We all have a stake in democracy and promises being kept.
Tonight, my colleagues, you break promise with the past and present and
future generations of North Carolinians. If the United States awarded
medals for voter suppression, this bill would be a candidate for the
gold, for regardless of its aim, the result tonight may well be to
cripple the ability of minority and young voters to participate. You
present the bill as a hygienic electoral reform measure, but the
pathogens you seek to remove are people. African-Americans, Latinos,
young voters and low income folks who simply resist voting Republican.
Make no mistake tonight, for those of us who have worked very hard this
session with the majority to try to cast a middle ground on so many
issues, our anger tonight is palpable. Passage of this bill is a
political call to arms, and I believe the majority has seriously
miscalculated tonight and will rue the day this bill was ever conceived.
Abraham Lincoln said it best, you may deceive all the people some of the
time and some of the people all the time but you cannot deceive all of
the people all of the time. Earlier this afternoon the Attorney General
of the United States issued a notice that the United States government
will use every other provision of the voting rights act to sue North
Carolina if this bill is passed. It appears he will soon have his
opportunity. Tonight the majority ambushes the people of North Carolina
and instead of writing a bill protecting their interests, it simply
writes one protecting it&#39;s own. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose
does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Hall rise. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the caucus report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Members, I&#39;ve had a lot of my close friends, a lot of my
family members, a lot of members from your side of the aisle ask me what
have been thousands and thousands of people protesting every week
outside this chamber. What we&#39;re about to do in this chamber tonight
is one of the reasons that more than 800 people have been willing to get
arrested, to get a permanent record. This conference report eliminates
the use of all law enforcement IDs, fireman IDs, EMS IDs, hospital
employee IDs, municipality IDs issued by cities, by county governments,
but the big one for me is the elimination of the student ID. We&#39;re
in so many ways telling students we don&#39;t want them to participate.
We&#39;re also eliminating pre-registration for 16 and 17 year olds, and
if I thought this bill was genuinely about voter fraud I wouldn&#39;t be
so upset, but every member in this chamber knows that young voters are
much more likely to vote democratic, but Representative Warren pointed
out that we&#39;ve preserved absentee voting. Registered Republicans
make up 31% of the electorate but more than half of the absentee
ballots. Absentee votes, this is the most pointedly, obviously
politically partisan bill I&#39;ve ever seen. Voter fraud is 17 times
greater in absentee ballots. This bill drastically reduces early voting,
eliminates same day voting.

issued North Carolina drivers license is expired by even one day you
can&#39;t vote. But one other thing it does at the same time it
increases the size of contributions that people can make to their
campaigns. What sense does that make? We&#39;re telling voters that we
don&#39;t want you to participate as much but we want you to be able to
give more money to our political campaigns. After all the changes that
were made one final one on the conference report is that it eliminates
all the money to educate public about all these changes. One state that
a lot of the components pointed to as an example Florida. Florida spent
over twenty three million dollars to let the public know about all the
changes. North Carolina&#39;s bill spends nothing to do it. This is the
most radical voter suppression bill in the nation. I urge you to vote
no.

SPEAKER CHANGES:
I think it&#39;s well documented in this chamber how I feel about this
particular action here tonight. I believe that any act of voter
suppression or voter intimidation is a ?? to all of us and for all of my
colleagues it&#39;s not the way that we do business here in North
Carolina and it&#39;s downright unAmerican. When I think of this bill
and I look at the details of it and you&#39;ve heard Representative Shaw
so eloquently explain the history of it. You&#39;ve heard Representative
Glacier explain the details of this bill. But if you will indulge me for
a few minutes. I want to tell you what this bill takes me back to and as
you know I&#39;m a student of history. And this bill takes me back to a
time where we had marching...as we do now more on Monday, to protest
oppressive policies and racist themes to deny people civil rights. Human
rights and access to the ballot. This bill is shameful to me. I&#39;m a
native North Carolinian I&#39;m a proud native North Carolinian and I
stand on the shoulders of gentlemen like Representative Mishaw. He is a
living legend to me I...when I got to this chamber in twenty ten it was
a privilege and an honor to be in the presence of someone that I have
revered for such a while. Others that I&#39;ve revered for such a while,
who have fought bled and died for the cause and the dignity of all
Americans. Not just African Americans. But when I see this bill, I have
an image of former Alabama governor George Wallace standing up using the
famous words segregation now, segregation then and segregation forever.
This is what I see in the spirit of this bill. In the spirit of this
bill does not match up with the people that I know across this chamber.
So it has to be some outside motivation for you to even present this
bill. I don&#39;t know what your ...

  <p>but I&#39;ve talked to you, I&#39;m friends with most of you. This
document is not what I&#39;ve percieved as what&#39;s in your hearts,
but we have it nonetheless. When I see this document, I&#39;m reminded
of the sacrifices of ?? Evans, who was gunned down, shot in the back for
what? Simply because he wanted to register citizens of this great
country to have the exercise the fundamental right to vote. Whether they
were African-American or white or not. We are citizens, we have a
fundamental right to exercise our most precious right to vote in this
country. Without impediment. Without obstacles. I&#39;m reminded of the
sacrifice of three young men in Philadelphia, Mississipi in 1964. James
Cheney, Michael Swerner, and Andrew Goodman. These men were killed by a
conspiracy of people who were elected officials and were sworn to uphold
the laws of the United States Constitution. And for what? For wanting to
give all people the opportunity to live and to thrive in this country.
So members, whether you&#39;re Republican or Democrat, I&#39;m not only
appalled but flabbergasted that we would come to this point in 2013 and
roll out a bill that thumbs its nose at the progression that we&#39;ve
made as a people and as  a state. The nation, I dare say the world, is
looking at this chamber at this moment. This bill has been has been
touted as the most oppressive voter ID or voter election reform or
whatever you want to call it. But you know, living down in Wilmington
North Carolina as a young boy I was taught to call things what they
were. I&#39;m a very straightforward person. This, my good friends, is
nothing more than voter suppression. Voter intimidation at its most
egregious and its most sadistic and its most deplorable state. You know
in the Bible it talks about how a man can become so filled with himself
that even though he does wrong, it seems right to him. And I&#39;m
looking at the faces of some of my colleagues and what you&#39;re doing
seems right, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s wrong. I ask you to turn away.
Turn away from this oppressive bill, and I ask you to vote no. Let&#39;s
defeat this, and let&#39;s come up with a real way to talk about voter
integrity because our integrity in this chamber and in this state has
been lost because of this bill. I ask you to vote no.  Thank you Mr.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mister Speaker. Members, I fear we Americans have grown fat,
lazy, and complacent in our Republic. I think we have some sense that
our Democratic system is like a fire and forget missile where you pull
the trigger, our forefathers have a revolution, and to the end of
history, we&#39;ve got Democracy. I think we forget the constant
sacrifice and tending that is needed to keep our democratic system on
target. I&#39;m grateful though that there are many here, on this floor,
that know the truth. There are those both Republican and Democrat who
have served our country at war and are well aware of the sacrifice of
which I speak. And there are those that have sacrificed, and bled, and
died domestically, in our nation&#39;s civil rights struggle that also
know the truth. In a Republic where power derives from the people, I
believe it&#39;s inherently good to enable the people to exercise that
power. It&#39;s that premise that led me, over two separate terms, one
in the majority, and one in the minority, to work to make it easier for
our deployed warriors to cast a ballot. Now, I have some sense that the
ballots that came in from that probably benefited the Republican party.
I don&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t ask. It wasn&#39;t relevant. It enabled
North Carolinians to vote, it helped bring power to the people. I
reached across the aisle to work on that bill and found a ready hand to
join with me to get that passed. It was one of the happiest moments of
my time here in the House of Representatives. What a joy it would have
been for me to return here in 2013, in the minority, and again, to reach
across the aisle to join my brothers and sisters in the majority party
and work again to bring further power to the people. Instead of moving
forward, we have done an about face to 1898 with a bill that left here,
a voter ID bill, that has returned a massive, voter suppression bill
that cynically and selfishly cuts away at the very foundations of rule
by the people. Members, I was here for Jim Black. I was here for Stephen
LaRoque and I was here for Thomas Wright. I have never been ashamed to
be a member of this body like I am tonight.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. Many in this room will probably remember that
I voted for the first voter ID bill that came through the House. I can
tell you that my side certainly does remember that I voted for that
bill. I felt like I was doing the right thing. I still do. I felt like
we were attacking a perception issue that people had in my district and
across the state with the integrity of the process. I felt we were
trying to deal with it in a balanced way with a lot of different IDs and
a lot of access and that we were trying to balance the, destroying the
perception problem so that we could move on and stop pointing fingers at
each other, with trying to keep obstacles at a minimum. One of the major
obstacles that we dealt with, and I was very proud of this work, worked
with Representative Warren, worked with Representative Lewis and we ran
a floor amendment that said that if you were in a county that has less
than five days a week access to the DMV, that the county itself could
offer IDs and you would be reimbursed. I have two of those counties,
Washington county and Hyde county.

actually lower right now because the vans are broken down. I received an
email just a couple of weeks ago where they said that they cannot get
out there and so folks cannot get to get ID’s now. So we are severely
limiting the access of folks to be able to get ID’s so they can go vote
in those two counties, and other counties, particularly in the
northeast. This is another bill that has been infected by the senate,
and I am disappointed because you work hard to create balance in the
first bill and it was lost when it went to the Senate. I cannot, in good
conscience, vote for this bill now, and I would hope, that you would
send this thing back to the Senate and tell them to try again and try to
bring some balance to their policy. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker: For what purpose does the gentleman from Edgecomb,
Representative Tolson, rise?
Speaker 2: To speak on the motion.
Mr. Speaker: The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
Speaker 2: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, this is a sad
day, I think, in North Carolina. We have men and women in various parts
of the world fighting for the rights, privileges and freedoms we enjoy
and tonight, with the push of a green button, we are going to
drastically take away some of those rights, privileges and freedoms. I
hope you will vote red.
Mr. Speaker: For what purpose does the lady from Gilford, Representative
Harrison, rise?
Speaker 3: I’m sorry can you move me to the back of the queue, excuse
me.
Mr. Speaker: Sorry?
Speaker 3: Would you move me to the back of the queue?
Mr. Speaker: For what purpose does the gentleman from Vance,
Representative, rise?
Speaker 4: To debate the motion.
Mr. Speaker: The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
Speaker 4: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Part 42 of this motion labeled
Campaign Contributions, after reading the bill I think that section of
the bill – that reminded me of an article in New Yorker, not too long
ago, entitled “State for Sale” because this particular portion of the
bill increases the maximum amount of campaign contributions to $5000 and
allows that amount to increase every year after that linked to the
consumer price index. Wow! I just wonder how many middle and working
class votes are saying, “Gosh, $4000 is not enough for me to be able to
give to these politicians. I must be able to donate $5000 to them.” This
bill has nothing to do with voter integrity. It does not promote
confidence in the voting process. If this right wing republican party
were truly interested in preserving the integrity of our election
system, they would not be making it harder for the folks to vote and
easier for the wealthy to buy influence. Most Carolinians have had
enough of paid to play politics. Part 56, labeled Disclosure
Requirements, that loosens the disclosure requirements on campaign print
ads. Now, I think that North Carolinians deserve to know who it is that
is pumping big money into these campaigns. How in the world does it
increase confidence in elections when special interest money can get
dropped on the campaign in the dark and the voters don’t even know who
is paying big money to these politicians? How does that prevent voter
problem? How does that make the system more efficient? Well it is an
item but like my momma told me – what you do in the dark will come to
the light. All of the special interest money and all the big PAC money
in the world will not overcome the power of the people.

SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you mister speaker and members as many of you know I was a high
school social studies teacher. And I taught civics education but I
became active in our Democracy at the age of ten when my fourth grade
teacher told the class that women didn&#39;t always have the right to
vote. And at the age of ten that&#39;s a powerful and amazing statement
and of course I did not believe that it could be true. But it was true
and I&#39;m worried that today it will remain to be true. As a teacher
of high school students I worked hard to encourage them to participate
in our democracy. I tried very hard to talk about people like
Representative Mishaw and their story and their background and their
struggle. I tried very hard so that my students would understand what
women like my great grandmother went through who desperately wanted to
vote. Or like my grandmother who recently died never had an id. I try to
encourage them to register to vote and to vote every election every time
no excuses. We never talked about partisanship or that they should be of
a certain party. It was about democracy and respecting the right to vote
and participating in our democracy. When I came to this legislature at
the age of twenty seven. I was very excited to work on many issues, of
course education being one of them. But elections being the next one. I
have worked very hard for years to have bills put forward to strengthen
our democracy and to young people and women especially in our democracy.
Last year with the help of the other youngest member Representative
Justine Byrd we put forward the preregistration of high school voters in
North Carolina. We were on the national spotlight so much that Fox news
the national Fox News wanted to interview me on the success of the
preregistration of voters. My first debut on national television was on
Fox News and they realized the importance of preregistration of youth
voters. And today in this chamber at the age of thirty four an educator
a mother and a pregnant women standing before you we&#39;re taking away
preregistration of young people for no good reason at all. We should
encourage active participation in our democracy. We should not create
obstacles for people to vote. I was thinking about two quotes that I
used to use with my students to try to engage them in discussion and try
and make them think. And here are two I will share with you,
&quot;Democracy is where the indigent and not the men of property are
the rulers.&quot; and as president JFK said, &quot;The ignorance of one
voter in a democracy impairs the security of all&quot; We should protect
the right to vote we should encourage the right to vote, we should not
go after students and young people. We should not go after grandma and
aunt...

[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Robeson,
Representative Graham, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I’ll be brief. I
know it’s getting late. I do want to say I was privileged to vote with
my members on the, across the aisle on this bill when it came out of the
House. I’m just not going to be able to support this measure. It reminds
me of some of those treaties that was made with my American Indian
brothers back in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Treaties made, and
treaties broken, still need to be resolved. This reminds me of something
like that. I’m disappointed. I see this as a bill with an attitude.  You
know what you’re doing, and you made it clear this session. We got the
votes. We got the power. We’ve got the control. We’ve got the mandate.
We can do it, and there’s nothing you can do about it. You redrew those
lines. You understand what you’ve done, and now you’re trying to keep it
that way and for that reason I think it’s unfair, and I think it’s a
shameful bill. And I can’t support it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Columbus,
Representative Waddell, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman of the House, I’m going to brief,
too, because I know that we’ve been in here for an awful long time, and
as most of you know, a law of my seatmate, Paul ??, and Representative
Graham from Robeson, we voted for voter id bill the first time. And I
was really proud of that vote because I examined the bill, looked at the
bill read hard, and I thought Representative Lewis, Representative
Warren did a really good job on that bill. I didn’t see anything in
there that was really super suppressive, and I talked with my folks at
home and they agreed for the most part. Not everybody’s going to agree,
but they did agree. But this bill’s gone a little bit further than I
expected. It’s got some provisions in it that I really don’t like, and
I’ll give you one example and that’s on straight party ticket voting.
And I’m going to tell you why. On straight party ticket voting a lot of
people vote for philosophies, philosophies of parties. Just like the
Democrats have philosophies, and the Republicans have philosophies.
Well, where are we going to get our philosophies from now? Are we going
to get them on TV? Representative Baskerville was talking about the
4,000 dollars that the middle-class person was going to spend now they
felt like they weren’t spending enough. They’re going to spend 5,000
dollars, each election cycle. So it’s going to be about money. They’re
going to get their information over the TV, the media and anyplace else
that you can spend the most money to get the word out. They’ll say oh, I
like him because he looks good, maybe remember that name right there.
They’re not going to know anything about they’re philosophy whatsoever,
and that’s one of the reasons I cannot support this. I really think that
we’ve gone a little bit too far. I really applaud the group when they
worked on this voter id bill. I was proud to support it in the House. I
won’t be supporting this one. Thank you.

I&#39;m going to ask you, didn&#39;t you hear the emotion in
Representative Michaux and Representative Bell&#39;s voices.  This
isn&#39;t a stage act. We&#39;re not putting on a show for the cameras.
Did you not hear for yourself?  Could you not see the pain in
Representative Moore&#39;s?  He almost went ballistic when he didn&#39;t
think he was going to get a chance to speak.  Because it&#39;s so
important to him.  I can&#39;t believe we can&#39;t give Representative
Michaux, Representative Bell and the others who came forth a day to have
a committee meeting.  He asked the body to have a committee meeting so
we can discuss the 40 pages that they sent back over here.  A lot of you
know I have a son who often gets bulled in school and I&#39;ve talked in
the past and those of you who know me know why he gets bullied and what
I always tell him is until you stand up to the bully they&#39;re gonna
keep bullying you. All I&#39;m asking you, I&#39;m not asking you to go
back on a campaign promise, you made a campaign promise ?? voter ID, you
had the chance to still do voter ID.  I&#39;m not asking you to go back
on your promise. I&#39;m asking you to send this other 40 pages of B.S.
back to the Senate.  I&#39;m asking you not to concur.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the
House I along with Representative Tine and Representative Waddell and
Representative Graham voted for the first voter ID bill and we talked
about it alot and we were all reluctant to do it but I believe that the
people that brought the bill forward in the House were people of good
will who were really trying to craft a bill that would what in their
minds would solve what in their minds was a problem while at the same
time would be the least restrictive bill that they could have.  When I
stood up in Caucus and said I was going to vote for it I thought people
like Representative Michaux would get mad at me but he just laughed at
me.  He said you think we got a good bill you wait til you see it when
it comes back from the Senate.  Well he is a wise man because that is
exactly what&#39;s happened and this bill from the Senate is just
blatantly cynical in it&#39;s intent and I just can&#39;t vote for it.
I feel like by voting no tonight I&#39;m rectifying my earlier vote
because it just turned out to be the way a wise man like Representative
Michaux said it would be. So I&#39;m going to vote no and I ask you to
do the same. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For what purpose does the lady from Franklin,
Representative Richardson rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Mister Speaker I rise to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  When I listened to Representative Michaux bring us
down to the 1965 I thought about it.  I said he should just stop there.
I lived in Durham 30 years prior to moving back to Franklin County in
1998 and I took it upon myself to run for the school board and as I went
around the state campaigning for that position and I would approach
individual voters I was really shocked at how many African-Americans who
told me I cannot vote for you because I&#39;m afraid that my landlord
will put me out, I&#39;m afraid that my employer will fire me, I really
think you are a great candidate but I cannot vote for because I still
live with the tenant farmer that I lived with in 1965.  So although I
left Durham which was a very rich political environment when I got to
Franklin County that was not the case but since I have been in Franklin
County over the last from 98 to now, 15 years, I am amazed at how many
people have began to get pride in voting, registering, coming to
political meetings, being involved because they finally were convinced
that they were not going to lose their job because they voted.  They
were not going to be put out of their home because they voted for an
African-American person.  So when I read the bill and I see that we have
put in poll observers and we&#39;ve put in people who can challenge any
vote

the chair that we will, the time is two minutes from expiring for the

that time we will have to end the debate, but we are adding thirty
minutes to it. Representative Harrison, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

The lady is recognized the debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. It&#39;s difficult to follow up Representative
?? and others about what they&#39;ve had to go through for protecting
voting rights and I&#39;m not even going to try. But we are getting
ready to enact the most restrictive vote ID law in the country. We said
it was going to be modeled on Georgia and Indiana but at least they
allow for college ID&#39;s and we&#39;ve taken that out in this
conference report. We&#39;re going to be limited access in early voting
and we have this record turnout at two and a half million voters I think
in 2012 and that&#39;s just wrong.  We&#39;ve got some really troubling
campaign finance provisions in here that hadn&#39;t gotten much
attention tonight that I think will allow a lot more dark money to come
into North Carolina elections.  We are killing the state&#39;s public
financing for the judicial elections and that&#39;s been a real problem:
the perception problem when you&#39;re having to ask for money for the
lawyers that are appearing before you in court. I think that&#39;s
wrong. We are raising contribution limits. As Nathan Baskerville noted,
we&#39;re raising them in in the four thousand to five thousand.  Also
raising the limits on the thousand dollar limit on judicial races, which
is very troubling. We are telling the state&#39;s pioneering stand by
your ad provision that turned into national legislation. We are reducing
disclosure. We are allowing for the increase in outsider spending. I
think this is a terrible trend. It&#39;s a terrible bill and I urge you
to vote no. Thank you.

For what purpose does the lady from Chatham, Representative McMannus
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  In 1926, Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act.  My
grandfather was 18. In 1928, they specifically granted citizenship to
the Eastern Cherokee because the state continued to deny their
citizenship. My grandfather was 20. In 1930, Henry Owl was denied the
right to register because North Carolina said he wasn&#39;t a citizen.
My grandfather was 22. So, Congress passed another act reaffirming
Eastern Cherokee citizenship. But the local newspapers protested
Congressional interference and county registrars continued to deny
Cherokees the right to register to vote in North Carolina. In 1946 as
Easter Cherokee war veterans returned home, they were still denied the
right to register to vote. My grandfather was 38 and had 5 children at
that time. From
the distance of 70 years, we can look back and see how shameful this
was. I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll take that long for this, the most
restrictive election law in the country, to be seen that way. Let&#39;s
send it back to the Senate and get it fixed. Thank you. I&#39;ll be
voting against it.

  <p>of my 91 year old mother who actually spent many hours at her dining
room table teaching people to read the preamble to the constitution of
North Carolina so they could indeed vote. Tonight I am hoping that she
is listening to this discussion. I was told that she would because I’m
going to take a brave stance like she did many years ago and I’m going
to vote no to concurrence of House Bill 589. I’m doing it because the
senior citizens across the state who are indeed watching what we are
doing, people with disabilities, citizens with guardians, young people,
students, with and without disabilities, women and minorities. I stand
proud to follow in my mother’s footsteps and many who came before me to
make it possible to not be strict and limit people’s right to vote. Join
me in voting no. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Haywood, Representative Queen,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To  speak on the concurrence motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. To my colleagues who have spoken before me, I just want to
say, amen. Amen. Amen. And amen again. This bill is all about
re-regulating the constitutional right to vote for the partisan
advantage of the majority party. But at the expense of every citizen in
this state. It’s simply makes it more inconvenient. Especially for
students. For young first time voters, for seniors and working citizens.
The real result will be to suppress voter participation and
consequently, to disenfranchise voters. This is not government and the
service of citizens, this bill. It does not pass the smell test, for
regulatory reform. In the name of voter ID, the need of which was never
justified by this General Assembly, by a shred of evidence. It’s come up
with a sweeping 56 page rewrite of election laws reducing transparency
and disclosure for candidate communications, partisan electioneering,
independent expenditures. And at the same time, it’s raising
contribution limits to $5000, as brother Baskerville so eloquently
explained the consequences. It eliminates the public financing in
judicial races which injects special interest money in the judicial
process. Elections with more money and less disclosure. How’s that
protecting voters’ rights? It abandons this state’s proud history. Proud
tradition of civic education. In my first term in the Senate, I was the
civic education legislator of the year. I really appreciated
Representative Cotham’s comments on civic education. We used to take
pride in encouraging our young people to become voters and become
active, conscious citizens of this great state. Eliminates high school
registration drives, eliminates pre-registration for our young people
when they go get their drivers license connecting their will to be free
and drive with their will to vote and be citizens, young citizens that
look forward to that. No more paid registration drives in this state. It
eliminates same-day registration which is so convenient, so appreciated
in same-day  voting all across my district. It empowers partisan
vigilante groups to intimidate voters. This looks like third world
elections we see on...

  <p>national/international news. All of this is clearly a strategy, a
misplaced strategy I might add, for partisan advantage. Not for the good
of the whole. I encourage you to vote no on this confidence report. We
can do better. The great state of North Carolina deserves better.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Buckham,
Repersentative Fischer, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion,
Mister Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Lady has the floor to debate the
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen
you&#39;ve heard a lot this evening and I will not take long, but I did
want to call to your attention a couple of numbers that we may have
overlooked during the debate. There was a report that was issued in
April by the North Carolina State Board of Elections that estimated that
176,091 registered democrats are without the state issued photo ID card
that most will have to pay $20 to $32 for before they can vote under
this law. Plus 73,787 unaffiliated, and 1,126 libertarian voters. Among
registered republican voters 67,639 have no photo identity cards, and
over two thirds of these are women. I came to the general assembly
directly from a job at director of a non-profit called Kids Voting North
Carolina and at that job I helped to use a curriculum that was approved
by the North Carolina school board to teach children the importance of
civic participation and about the importance of voting. And before that
I tell people I have an undergraduate degree from the University of
Maryland, but I got my maters degree from being president for the League
of Women Voters for two years, because it&#39;s that kind of a job and
you learn so much from being around those women who struggled mighty for
the right to vote. And so in honor of those women, in honor of minority
persons, in honor of the elderly, the disabled, high school students,
the college students at Warren Wilson College in my district and UNC
Ashville in my district. In honor of the democrats, independents, and
yes, even the republicans who will become disenfranchised with the
passage of this legislation I ask you to vote no. I ask you to make this
a better bill. This is not the bill  that left the house. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford,
Representative Berger, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I, again, don&#39;t know where to begin with this
bill, and I really have a problem, not only with the bill, but with what
we do in here. Because when I grew up I looked at our elected officials
and our government. I always wanted to be here. And I always wanted to
come and make a difference and represent folks and represent people. And
since I&#39;ve gotten here I see that sometimes in this body we make a
very big effort not to represent people, but to simply divide people.
And I just don&#39;t understand where that comes from and why we always
have to continue to go down that road. Why we choose to have thousands
of people standing outside this chamber on Mondays yelling and screaming
at us. Why do we choose to have people in the galleries protesting at
us. It&#39;s a choice. It&#39;s all a choice. The other thing that
Tricia Kaufman said that she was a civics teacher and it was someone
like her that told me the process about how government works, and
It&#39;s amazing to me how we... I don&#39;t know maybe Tricia Kaufman
told

  <p>For the children, not, different things that were in the book, but I was
always told that you had a House, and you had a Senate, and we all know
how a bill moves. And we actually have to, according to the law,
according to what I learned when I was a kid, we have to concur. And if
you don&#39;t feel like that you should concur why would you ever, ever
vote for it? What kind of history are you giving your children and our
grandchildren? Well, it&#39;s what we do. Well, it&#39;s just kind of
how the game&#39;s played. We didn&#39;t, we don&#39;t have that in the
history book. We don&#39;t have that in our civics book. There&#39;s a
specific way that we do that and it&#39;s called principle. And if you
can&#39;t stand up for principle, then why are you even here? Why would
you let their principles overcome your principles and what you know is
right and what you know is wrong? You&#39;re gonna let that happen? You
wanna go home and tell your kids that? You wanna write that into the
civic book? Good luck with that. But I, we do want to say is that we all
know what this is about, and I really hate that this is where we are,
but the very mere fact that you have an absentee voting provision in
this bill makes every single argument that you make on the other side
absolutely null and void. Absolutely null and void. There is not an
argument after that, after you let free voting go on with absolutely no
ID, no check, no nothing. I open it up to every kind of fraud that you
can have, and you make it more accessible? Every argument that you make
is absolutely null and void at that point. So now we have to figure out
why, and I think we know why. If we have a session where we were able to
disenfranchise nurses, doctors, lawyers, hospitals, non-profits, African
Americans, Native Americans, the LGBT community, the poor community, the
working class people, middle class people, rural folks, urban folks, we
did all that and did not create a job, I understand the purpose of this
bill. Thank you. I will be voting no.

For what purpose does the lady from Mecklenburg, Representative Carney

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, there&#39;s not a whole lot more you
can add. We&#39;ve had members going in and out. Some I applaud,
I&#39;ve been looking, some have stayed through the whole thing, and I
really applaud you, because you&#39;re willing to sit here and listen to
what some have said. But I hope you&#39;ve heard from some of our
members that this goes deep, deep in their heart, and in their roots.
And they&#39;re honored and proud to be serving here at this point and
time in their life. People like Representative Michaux, Representative
Bell, our senior members of the African American community. Deep. You
can&#39;t begin to relate what this bill is doing to that population in
this state. And I remind you, when you look at the demographics from the
census, that population is growing. There are many people in this state
that are listening tonight. There are many people that are reading this
bill page by page. How many of us in here? I have. How many of you have
read it line for line since it came back, changed? For years the leaders
in this state have incrementally made the right to vote easier and more
accessible, and within today, with the Senate giving it a full day of
debate over there, their bill that they dressed up, our bill they took
and dressed up, I might correct myself, sent over here and we&#39;re
gonna have to now to the speaker two and a half hours of a despicable
bill. Where we are in the 21st century, you punch that green button as
you all will cause I know our votes aren&#39;t changing a single one of
you, although I hope our words have touched your heart. But with that
one point, in the 21st century, we should be doing everything we can
with the internet access, everything we can to make it easier and more
accessible for our citizens to exercise their right to vote, not make it
harder. I don&#39;t understand why, why do you have to be against
straight party ticket voting and I can go on and on but others have
touched that. But I will end with this because I truly do believe this.

  <p>Monday nights, grow, outside of my window. I believe there is a spirit
moving in this state that no money can be bought--votes cannot be
bought, in the next elections that are coming up across this state. It
is the spirit of the people paying attention, rising up, saying we are
the government, not you, we are the people of this state, not you 120 in
the House, not those 50 in the Senate. And what the majority is doing to
us, we are listening. Can&#39;t you see it? Don&#39;t you hear it? I end
with a text that was sent to me from a lady. I do not know her. But she
has my phone number, it&#39;s printed. Oh dear Lord, the reality of what
the Republicans have done is inexpressible, worse than anyone ever
thought. How can you vote green and do this to the people of North
Carolina? I ask you, rethink your green vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Mecklenburg, Representative
Cunningham, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak briefly on the motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is so hard. As I&#39;ve listened to everybody in the chamber talk,
especially Representative Michaux, it brought back the memories of the
last time I took Pete to vote. It was a month right before he passed
away. The last election. And when he walked in, of course everybody knew
who he was, even though he had aged quite a bit. And his picture, his
photo on his license had changed quite a bit by the time we had gotten
there. But everybody in there knew who he was. They knew who he was. He
was able to go in and vote with no problem, and we was well on our way
to the next activity of the day. He used to tell me something all the
time, and now I can see it in this chamber. He said a lesson will not be
learned that God will allow you to repeat it. He will allow you to
repeat the lesson until it&#39;s learned. So it looks like we
haven&#39;t learned our lesson. And we got to relearn again. In honor of
my former spouse, Representative William Pete Cunningham, that was in
the trenches of the civil rights movement in 1950s through the 60s, I
will cast a no vote for the citizens of the state of North Carolina
against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from New Hanover, Representative
Hamilton, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To briefly debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. It&#39;s really impossible for me to add anything
more to what&#39;s been said this evening. I will say, however, that
just when you think you&#39;ve reached the bottom, sometimes things just
keep getting worse. I&#39;m truly shocked at the magnitude of this bill.
It left the House as a 14-page bill, came back as 57 pages. This is not
about voter I.D. This is not about identification at the polls. This is
about harassment at the polls, vigilante behavior at the polls. It&#39;s
about voter suppression. It&#39;s about regression. Regression in North
Carolina. I&#39;m going to repeat what one of our esteemed members said
earlier tonight and then I&#39;m going to sit down. Because I think this
pretty much sums it up. We&#39;ve not really addressed at length some of
us have mentioned that this bill increases the amount of money that we
can receive in terms of campaign contributions, from $4,000 from
individuals or political action committees to $5,000. It also lessens
disclosure laws. So in the words of my friend and fellow representative
Sam Queen, more money

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the lady from Wake Representative Holley arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker to speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all I wanna thank you Mr. Speaker for allow an extended time I
was getting little restless because one of the things that we have not
really had an opportunity individually is to be heard and sometimes just
to be heard means so much to people, Miki God bless you, Miki gave us a
history that he is lived and for Miki’s generation and prior to his
generation things have passed on and is pass down. I think
African-American who has struggled and fought for the right to vote, for
the right to go school, for the right to come in here and be a member of
this legislator is on the backs of so many more that came before me that
I’m on it to serve them. I have a neighbor aunt Pauline, aunt Pauline is
102 years old and for a lot of this all people can tell us what their
little stories were and then recently we sat down we said, “Aunt Pauline
you are so excited about going for Obama, tells us about first time you
voted.” And she talked about fear as Representative Richardson___[01:51]
was talking about. The fear that they had to go and vote which she did
but I won’t, she said, “We went to Miami and in another room in their
back and I don’t believe it, ___[02:02] vote but I voted.” And she
talked about the pride that she took to be able to her feet to go and
vote for an African-American President and what that meant to her. And
she is the 102 years old and her driver’s license I’m sure it has
expired, I don’t think she can even find it but I will do everything in
my power to make sure this bill passes that she has what she needs to be
to able to go and vote. Now, I want to talk a little bit about what this
really is all about, and it’s about fear, it’s not about my fear because
as African-Americans having dogs ___[02:46] and going to school not
knowing what kind of environment you are gonna go into when you walked
in you have learned not to be afraid, if we learn and we taught our kids
so much how not to be afraid ___[03:04] and went to the man who is
following him and say, “What&#39;s up with this?” You get afraid when
our black kids say and look like they have no fear. Well, this is about
a bigger fear this is about a fear to do loose power, that’s what it is
about. The senate is afraid, “I understand is a little voter ID but we
got back here is something that is senate is afraid of, they are afraid
to loose power.” I ask you to join me, to join us and not be afraid
unless don’t know on this bill.

has about four minutes by commitment with the minority leader, we are
allocating four minutes for him as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker I don’t think that I will need four minutes. I
wanna to say first that it’s been said many times here by speakers on
this side of eye that this is a Voter Suppression Act and it certainly
is but I think one of the unintended consequences of the bill that
majority is going to support is that it’s actually gonna support,
suppress some voters who otherwise would be voting republican, it’s
going to have that affect that main parts of this bill indeed are voter
suppression, another part of the bill that is add to me in terms of the
way it’s been put together and that is the complete abolition of the
public funded elections that were getting money out of politics at the
same time as we…

  <p>Money out of elections were allowing contribution level to go up and not
just go up but make sure is attached to consumer price index So we can
be sure to have more private money in elections. And it just says to be
that there is something wrong with the priorities where we want money
where the bills suggest that money should play a larger role in our
elections, not a smaller role. And I think one say also that the bill in
one way called Longer lines the longer lines on election day bill. I
think everyone in this room remembers what things were like before early
voting. You waited two hours to vote typically. They talk about the mess
that was in Florida last year because people were waiting exactly 2
hours to vote and many people were discouraged from voting at all
because Florida had passed a law similar to ours. Similar to what’s
before us tonight. So when you cut early voting from 17 days to 10 when
you say on that last Saturday when people are trying to get to polls
that the county board of elections can’t  keep the polls open until 5
but must close them at 1. What you are doing is  saying  number 1 there
will be longer lines that will hurt both political parties and  you
would be saying that a lot of people will not be voting, will not be
exercising their rights who would have otherwise done so had we not been
not so determined to cut back on early voting, a program that is most
popular that is extremely popular with independents, republicans and the
democrats. It’s a sad day that we have got this before us. I am going to
Vote no and wish all of you could as well. Thank you
[Speaker Changes] Representative Hall, Please state your purpose
[Speaker Changes] to speak on the motion
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion
[Speaker Changes] Thanks you Mr Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the
house and may be more importantly, the citizens of North Carolina. It is
come to this and this is what every one has waited forward to see what
we has one time leaders of this nation would do. Once a great state
taken on this grand experiment over the last 6 months of this session.
And yes you have won control but also the responsibility that comes with
it for the future of the state of North Carolina. Now we shifted the tax
burden from the rich to the poor, but voting allowed you the power to do
that. We decided to defund the education that would provide the future
of our  children in the state. But voting allowed you to have the power
to do that.  And  although we in this bill spared Sunday voting, we have
taken  away the rights of the early voters., cut it back, which will
mean longer lines and deny the popular will of the 2.5 millions North
Carolinians who vote early and helped you to get to power that you now
use to deny them of their rights. It won’t save  money. We know that.
It’s an unfunded mandate. We know that. But voting gives you that right.
And now the question is, do you believe in what you have done. Because
the ultimate test as you pass t last time  when voting gave you the
power to do this would be submitting yourself to the same rule to the
citizens of the state of  North Carolina in asking that question, have
we really made a difference. Have we really made North Carolina better.
And what you have decided to do about this bill is to say we won’t take
the tips. we won’t submit yourself to a referendum of the people. We
will demand them the right today what we have really done. We don’t
really believe in this idea that the market will dictate and the market
will function and take the decision. You decided to cook the books and
demand people their rights. Voter Information

It has been a very tyrant night and a very interesting and emotional
night  and i wanna thank the members who stood up and shared their
personal stories all the struggles that they have gone through to win
their right their god given right their constitutional right to vote
and i wanna comment on what my friend  from  ??   said may be just speak
to the people from north Carolina for a while because i do believe there
are probably are some very scared because they are scared because they
have been told things that simply aren’t true they have been told
several times on this floor that this biil limits or forbid sending ??
it does not they have been told that this bail cuts back  the hours that
people can vote early that over half the people of this state use and it
does not. They have been told that there is a provision in this bill
dealing with guardianship that somehow we would restrict the disabled
from being able to vote and it does not do that. they have been told
that this bill somehow would neither revive  the vote because they don’t
have an  ID and they don’t have 24 hours to buy when plainly it is said
that the ID will be provided at no charge They have been told to support
tax even the supreme court has told us it is not
I would say they are .They are perhaps scared they are perhaps scared
because some of the misinformation that is being spread about this bill
even said about this bill on the floor tonight. I want you all to know
that i take my commitment in my oath very seriously. I have told you
from the day 1 that i want every person in this state entitled and
eligible to vote to have the opportunity to go to the polls and vote and
those vote cumulatively combined would decide who wins the election and
not votes that are believed are folks that vote  when they shouldn’t and
by god not folks that are turned away from the polls for not having the
right ID to vote that’s why this appeal goes to search great wins to
make sure the people are educated or what is required of a responsible
citizen to continue to complicate this republic . We hear about
absentee. We heard when this bill first went through. Oh you gonna don’t
have a ID vote absentee would now got a ?? on new word that we are
trying to spread over here . for the 5 days we listened and we heard
there was concern with how absentees is used to this

we are the only state that divides the vote for President from the rest
of the ticket, you wanna talk about these changes been based on some
kind of ___[01:09], partisan let’s talk about that, let’s talk about the
fact that of this bill 60 parts, 9 parts do with voter ID, 8 parts
contain studies to learn more about how to help people vote and give
them the resources they do, 5 parts are blank and 26 parts are election
law changes that have been adopted by democratic legislature since 2001.
So, if these attempts as you are accusing tonight, if this bill is to
rollback in a partisan fashion rules then the rules that passed the 26th
since 2001 must have been pass with a partisan motive too that’s a
logical assumption, right. It’s time to move on, it’s time to stand
proudly and say, “We did what we needed to do to ensure the integrity to
make sure that every person’s vote is counted everybody has the right to
participate is empowered to do so and we are going to continue to stand
on the principles and the belief that the people of this state are smart
enough to know who they wanna vote for, they are smart enough to get
whatever it is they need the idea whatever it is and they care enough to
get to the polls and vote.” The difference my friends’ is that the
proponents of this bill believe in the people, believe that the people
are smart enough to continue to elect their representatives and govern
their state, thank you Mr. Speaker.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That motion would be to concur and also to speak on the motion, Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.  I&#39;d like to give credit where credit is due.
I&#39;m speaking here for the absence of Representative Stevens who
asked me to carry this since he was a conference chair.  And I&#39;ll do
this off the top of my head given an idea the members of the House
changes are as follows.  There was some debate about the continuing
allowance of a full-color plate for those groups that would want to have
that for their group or entity and supporters.  The Senate concurred
that we would leave that available....[AUDIO ENDS]

  <p>However for any group applying for one after July 1 to associated with
costs are going to be 200 dollars more so that’d be 500 dollars. No,
excuse me, there’s got to be 200 more people so it’d be 500 requests
before they could do a new cover plate. The ones that currently have
full color plates, of course, remains the same with 300. The white box
with the dark black contrast letters in the white box remains on the
license plate. There was one new addition to the license plate with the
full color plates and others is that the words North Carolina will be in
a highly reflective type so it’ll make it easier for law enforcement to
see in night hours simply because you could quickly identify it as a
North Carolina plate simply because of the reflection of lights on it.
Also, I’m happy to announce that we did add some plates. There was
debate back and forth about adding some free access. I’m going to tell
you the ones that we added. For the members of the Service we added
those that have a distinguished flying cross. A new addition, those that
have the Coast Guard cross. Those that had attained a silver star, a
bronze star, combat valor recipient, a bronze star, and of course the
ones that have the waiver of a 10 dollar fee. We added Pearl Harbor
survivor. We did a merit partially-disabled veteran, combat veteran,
military veteran, military war-time veteran, World War II, World War II
veteran, Korean Conflict veteran, Vietnam veteran, Desert Storm veteran,
Operation during Freedom veteran, Iraq veteran, Operation Iraq veteran,
Persian Gulf War on Terror veteran, and Afghanistan veteran. And I
believe that’s the accumulation of the additions, Mr. Speaker, and as a
reminder, I move that the house concur. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Baskerville, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, Mr. Speaker, no purpose.

entitled, “An Act to make Technical Corrections to the General Statutes

to make additional technical and other changes to the General Statutes
and Session Laws.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, the chair moved to quickly to read that in and we
anticipate four amendments and some discussion, so we will temporarily
displace. At this time we are going to have to take a recess for a Rules
meeting and then we will back minimally to debate the third reading on
Senate Bill 515. It is the intent of the chair to take a vote on that
before midnight.
And then after that we will have at least discussion and debate on
Senate Bill 380. We are not aware of anything else that we cannot wait
and dispose of when we come back in the morning at nine o’clock. Notices
and announcements for Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the Rules Committee will meet in room
1228 immediately after we go into recess. I would ask members to please
be there promptly. It is the chair’s intent that we are able to return
within about 10 to 15 minutes so that we can resume session.
We simply have two bills, 438 and it’s on the notice, I forgot the other
bill number, it’s getting late. We have two bills that we’re going
through. I do not believe they’re controversial but I guess that remains
to be seen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Subject to the ratification of bills and resolutions, receipt of
messages from the Senate, receipt of committee reports, conference
reports, re-referral bills and resolutions, an appointment of conferees
and modifications to the calendar, the House is in recess until
10:10…Yeah, 11:10, the House is in recess.
