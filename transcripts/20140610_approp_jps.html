???
Got the House Appropriations subcommittee on public safety together. I
would like to welcome you all here this morning. We have a full days
work in front of us and we will try to cover everything we need to
cover. We are going to try to answer all of the questions we can
possibly answer for you just want to be approved by 3 o'clock this
afternoon or earlier if possible. We have this morning Sergeant of Arms
Joe Crook and ?? Hawkings. We have three of our patients with us this
morning. Caroline May, stand up Carol, Evan McNiel from ? county and
Eddis Misque from Wake County. Good to have you with us.It looks like
most of our members are here with us now. Let us cover basically what
our plan is going to be today. We will be having, first of all, opening
remarks by chairs and then we will begin the reviewing of House
subcommittee rules and the presentation of the money report and
revisions. As we go through the money report and revisions, I think it
is probably best if you have questions, when a staff member is
explaining something, let me know and we will go ahead and cover your
question rather than waiting until the end. I think it is much better to
do it that way. Please keep in mind that there is, there are some things
that depend on other things in this document so if you have a question
that attempts to tie two things together, make up your mind on when the
best time to answer that question is during your report. So lets get
started. I would like to call Staff Arm Kristine Lay. Kristine will come
up and excuse me Kristin. Hold up one minute. Opening remarks by our
chair.
[Speaker Changes] Everything is really good.
[Speaker Changes] Really Good.
[Speaker Changes] Its really good.
[Speaker Changes] I think we are both proud that we had staff increases
for post office. ?? It was a long time coming but I think we've
recognized the importance of all the ? people. All the people that have
?
[Speaker Changes] And.. Representative Bowls will be here a little
later. He had a business situation this morning that was very important.
Most of his business situations involve only once in a lifetime for
folks ?? So Kristin you will come forward and talk about orders.
[Speaker Changes]Hey Mr. ? and everyone.I am going to go over the rules
for subcommittee procedure which is one of the stapled handouts on your
stock this morning. The first rule are that the amendments must be
offered by formal ? which means they have to be written. Number two,
amendments cannot increase title spending within the subcommittee
report. Number three, amendments can only affect appropriations within
the jurisdiction of the Justice and Safety subcommittee and so you will
see a couple of transfers in the DJS. You will not be able to make any
amendments to those items. Items number four is amending you cannot
adjust any of the salary benefit of the appropriations for the
departments. Number five you cannot spend any diversions and cannot
include any language in the amendments that say Shawna or ?? carry
forward. Item number six, you, amendments cannot use nonrecurring funds
to fund a current obligation. Number seven, you cannot change the
recurring or nonrecurring destination of funds that are currently in the
budget before you. Eight is amendments cannot change substituent policy
or law.</p>

<p id="05:00">
Number nine, amendments may not fund items with management flexibility
reductions. Number ten, amendments may not affect agency or program
transfers to other subcommittees. Again, only appropriations within your
jurisdiction. And finally, number 11, amendments may not include fees or
other finance-related matters. Mr. Chair, that's all the rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Christine. Before we go any further, I'd like to recognize
Chairman Burr, who's sitting in with us this morning, he's been doing
yeoman's work, and he says he's going to take it easy today and let us
work. Glad to have you with us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I'm gonna start in the Committee Report, which is the document
with the big box on the front of it. Mr. Chair, if it's okay with you, I
will go through DPS admin and law enforcement and the switch over to
provisions for DPS admin and law enforcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That'll be fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Items one through three are the salary and benefit adjustments for
the Department of Public Safety. The House is providing a $1000 salary
increase. This is different from the Senate's, it's gonna add $809. Item
number two is the retirement contributions that go along with that
increase...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative [inaudible 00:01:23]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, you said to ask questions as we go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I noticed in one it says one thousand two hundred and thirty-six, and
[inaudible 00:01:32] says a thousand, can you explain the difference?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The thousand dollars is the salary increase, the one thousand two
hundred and thirty-six refers to the associated benefits that go along
with that salary increase.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So they, it's the same.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senate's was a flat one thousand dollars salary and benefits, so
their salary increase was $809. It was a thousand dollars when you added
in the benefits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Could you point me then that says the provision of salaries and
benefits are parts of the appropriations act provides additional details
of this increase? Where is that at?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's gonna be in section 35 of the larger bill, the bill that was posted
online this morning, it's not in the actual JPS section of the special
provisions, it's in the salary and benefits section, which is 35. We can
get you that page number, I think John's looking for it right now. Okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Item number three is the step increase for the Highway Patrol, and
you'll find additional information about that in section 35.6B as well,
slightly different from what the Senate did, in that it graduates the
increase, it provides a 6% increase for troopers with two years or less,
a 5.5% increase for troopers with three to six years, and a 5% increase
for troopers with seven to nine years. And there's another related
special provision in section 35.11A, which directs the Highway Patrol to
study using prior law enforcement experience as they determine where a
trooper would end up on their salary scale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. You mentioned that troopers have been there for up
to nine years, say nine years?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Seven to nine years, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Nine. So everybody who's been there above ten, ten or above, does not
receive...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They've already hit the top of the pay scale, so they get the regular
state employee increase, the same amount that all other state employees
would get.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Item number four is the management flexibility reduction, this is the
same as  was in the Senate budget, it's 6.3 million non-recurring. Item
number five is a modification of a reduction in the Governor's budget,
it is the same as was in the Senate budget, it eliminates three and a
half positions that have been vacant in admin over at DPS, and also
eliminates some operating funds over there. Item number six is a new
item, this is transferring into the Department of Public Safety from the
Department of Administration the Rape Crisis and Domestic Violence
Center and the associated grant programs with that. Item number seven is
the same as was in the Senate and is eliminating the last recurring
pass-through appropriation to a non-profit in the Department of Public
Safety. Item number eight is a modification of a Senate item, this is
elimination of 25 vacant trooper positions; the Senate had eliminated 75
vacant trooper positions. Item number nine is also a modification of a
Senate item and provides funding for state Highway Patrol uniforms; this
is slightly different from the Senate item because it follows the number
of troopers that need uniforms. Item number ten provides $100,000
non-recurring for the Highway Patrol  Troopers Association's caisson
unit. Item...</p>

<p id="10:00">
Number 11 is the transfer in of the state Bureau of Investigation from
the Department of Justice, and it includes a million dollar reduction
once it is transferred. The Senate budget had a 750 dollar reduction in
the transfer. Item number 12 is a modification of a Governor’s item and
provides three additional SPI agents for the Computer Crime Unit. Item
number 13 is the modification of a Governor’s item and it was the same
in the Senate, which was the ALE district office consolidation
reduction. 14 is the modification of a Governor’s item, same as in the
Senate, and it restores some funds that were eliminated as part of the
budget last year. Item number 15 is a modification of a Governor’s item
and transfers Animal Welfare and the Spay and Neater Program from the
Department of Ag to the Department of Public Safety. The governor had
also included 100 thousand dollars increase for the Spay and Neuter
Program; that is not included here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Turner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Could you expand on the
reasoning behind this and how it’s going to help? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chair ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??, would you like to respond
to that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well we were asked to do this, and because it
was not being administered as it should be and the people were moving
over also, so we want to put it under here so hopefully they will be
investigated and they will do what needs to be done. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
This was also a strong concern of the Governor’s. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And this would
include all the veterinarians and…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair?
Representative turner, there’s one veterinarian in this program and then
there’s people out in this region who go out and do the inspections, so
that’s what… The rest of the veterinarians in Ag are doing stuff with
cattle and chickens; not the animal welfare, dogs and cats. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you for that information. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Graham.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Where would we find this in the
bigger… the main report? What page would that be? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
mean in special provisions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, special provisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is in the Department of Ag section, and I
apologize, I did not write down the section number, but John will look
it up quickly and will get that for you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me. So
it’s in the Ag section? Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Item number 16 is
identical to a Governor and Senate item, and it’s just shifting some ??
to receive support. Item number 17 is the same as in the Senate and is
eliminating some funds for the Joint Forces Building Repair line item. I
think, Mr. Chair, if I could pause for a minute, I think John has the
statute for Representative Graham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Graham, it’s section 13.14, and that’s in the agricultural section of
the report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We will be
going over the provisions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Item number 18 is a
modification of a Governor and Senate item. This is the creating a new
fee for hazardous materials and businesses. The fee will be 50 dollars
for each hazardous material a company has, and 90 dollars for each
extremely hazardous material a company has. The Governor and Senate
items both had a pro rata amount based on when the fees were actually
paid; the House has the entire reduction because those fees will come in
in 14-15. This item will also provide funding to local governments for
hazardous material response activities. Item number 29 is an item that
you did not see when we reviewed the Senate budget, although it was in
the Senate budget. It provides 3.2 million dollars for ?? and the
Division of Emergency Management. You didn’t see this in the Senate
budget because the Senate budget had transferred the mapping functions
out of Emergency Management and into the Chief Information Officer’s
Office, so the money was going there, but now the House has not
transferred those functions, you’ll see an information item here. There
is an associated item in the Department of Commerce’s budget where the
funds are coming from, and there’s some leftover money in Commerce’s
disaster reserve from Floyd and Fran that is providing the funding here.
Item number 20 is the same as was in the Governor and Senate budget, and
it’s 11 thousand dollar reduction to the Adjutant General’s Office. Item
number 21 provides funding for the operation of the Tarheel Challenge
Academy in Stanly County. Last year you provided some repair and
renovation funds to rehab an old school building down there. This
provides partial year…</p>

<p id="15:00">
Operating funds. They expect to have it up and running in August of
2015. This item also provides funding to shift the positions at
Salemburg from temporary personal contracts to state employees. They've
been on temporary contracts for some reason since 1994 when the program
was first started and they need to be shifted over to full time state
employee positions. Mr. Chair, that's it for the money in law
enforcement and admin, and I'd like to shift to the provisions now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Moving over to provisions now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So in
the other packet with the seal on the front. The first general provision
for the Department of Public Safety is 16a.2, this is a modification to
the Governor's Crime Commission Gangnet report and it's just adding in
where the report was supposed to go. Before it just went to everyone.
16a.3 is a repeat of a provision that you saw last year and it was also
in the Governor's budget, and it is limited authority to the Department
of Public Safety to reclassify administrative positions. Item 16b.1 is a
modification of an item that was in the Governor's budget. This is the
same as was in the Senate and it directs the Department of Public Safety
to use funds from law enforcement to pay for security enhancements
required by the FBI for access to the FBI's criminal justice information
system. It also encourages the Department of Public Safety to use asset
funds for this purpose. This is an allowable use of those funds. 16b.2
is the ABC Permit increase, generates $9.6 million and you'll see that
listed out in the availability statement in the front of your bill,
which I think will be reviewed tomorrow with all the appropriations.
16b.3 is the Hazardous Material Facility fee which we discussed already.
I want to bring to your attention the fee is actually set out on page
153, lines 40-43, and then there's some changes from the Senate language
on page 154 lines 21 and 22 where it says to provide grants to counties
for hazardous material emergency response, planning, training and
related exercises and then lines 23-28 which state that DPS may
establish and operate a hazmat team in Lee and Moore Counties and that
they shall use proceeds from this fee to ensure that hazardous material
emergency response capabilities in those counties are sufficient to
respond to hazardous material emergencies related to natural gas
exploration and extraction. 16b.3 is an amendment to the definition of
an emergency, it adds public health, riots, explosions and terrorism
related causes. The title of the next provision is on page 154, but if
you turn to page 155, section 16b.5 directs the Department of Public
Safety to use law, funds available to the Division of Law Enforcement to
purchase mobile viper radios, they need $2.9 million for that purpose,
and it also encourages them to use funds available to them in the seized
asset funds. Section 16b.6 is a repeat of a provision that was in last
year, state capital police receipts of quota positions. This has been
modified somewhat, it allows them to contract with state agencies to
create additional state capital police positions, but it requires them
to report on the creation of those positions to the chairs of the
Appropriations Subcommittees and the, yeah, the chairs of the
Appropriations Subcommittees within 30 days of creating those positions.
Section 16b.7 is a change to the adjutant general statute in the
National Guard and it just is giving them authority to create an
additional assistant adjutant general. This position will be funded by
federal funds. Mr. Chair, that's all I have for general provisions in
law enforcement. Operating funds. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Going back to the
money report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So we're back to the money report, and
we're on page 55 item 22. This is a Governor's recommendation to close
one of the five prison regional offices and to eliminate the ?? command.
18 facilities including 16 prisons and 2 contract facilities have closed
since 2009, with no change in the prison regional office structure. Item
23 is the consolidation of the management of Tillery and Caldonia</p>

...those are adjacent prisons to each other down in Halifax County. This
has been done successfully up in Buncombe County with Craggy and
Buncombe Correctional and here in Wake County with Women's Prison and
Raleigh Correctional.
Item 24 is a reduction to various operating line items. The elimination
of 11 vacant positions.
Item 20...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Mobley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Back to item 23, with the
closure of one, do you know which one it's going to be?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Mobley. Neither of the
prisons are closing. The management of the prison consisted of having
two management structures. Since they're adjacent and Tillery supports
the mission of Caledonia, there will be one manager but all the prisons
in the state operate on a unit management concept so Tillery will still
be managed as a unit but it will not be sort of a stand alone facility.
It will be managed at both those locations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Item 25 on page I6 is the removal of the rest of the
misdemeanants from the state prison system. When you all created the
Justice Reinvestment Act and created the State Misdemeanants Confinement
Program, you removed all misdemeanants with sentences of 91 to 180 days
from the state system and paid for them at a state-wide misdemeanants
confinement fund.
What this proposal does is eliminate the remaining misdemeanants who
have, now any misdemeanant with a sentence above 90 days or the DWI
folks will be transferred to county facilities that participate in the
State-wide Misdemeanants Confinement Program and we'll talk more about a
special provision that goes along with that.
The regular structure sentencing inmates will transfer or people who are
sentenced on or after October 1st will go and then the DWI folks January
1st or after.
Sort of as part of this change, Item 26 is the closure of Fountain
Correctional Center for Women down in Nash County. That will close
October 1st. On August 1st, North Piedmont Correctional Center for Women
in Davidson County will close. And then November 1st, Eastern
Correctional down in Greene County will be converted from a male
facility to a female facility.
There's a similar facility to Eastern in Troy called Southern
Correctional and in 2004 the department transitioned that facility from
a male to a female facility so they have some experience doing that.
Turning to special provisions. If you look on page 155 towards the
bottom of the page. Item 16C.1. This begins the misdemeanant transfer
provision. We presented this last week to the subcommittee and there
have been a few changes since you all last saw this based upon some
feedback from the sheriff's association working with the department, our
drafters and some folks from the school of government. So I think we're
getting there.
The first section is the same as you saw before. It deals with the whole
split sentences and where those folks go.
The first major changes that you're going to see are on page 156,
Section B. When this was originally drafted the title of this,
Commitment to the Division of Adult Correction and Department of Public
Safety was inadvertently stricken. So you see that restored because this
whole section of the statute deals with folks that go to adult
correction and folks that go to a local confinement facility and that
title was inadvertently stricken.
On lines 28, 29 and 30, it just clarifies that misdemeanors are going to
go to the State-wide Misdemeanant Confinement Program. Before it said
local confinement facility and that was not clear enough to where the
intent of these offenders to serve their sentences is.
If you go down to line 48, it clarifies that folks who are felons are
going to serve their sentences in the Division of Adult Correction.
Top of the next page, Section C is struck because it was similar,
redundant language that sort of described where misdemeanors went, where
felons went and it was just similar, redundant information.
And then finally down on Subsection F on line 32, it stresses that DWI
offenders and other misdemeanors are going to serve their sentences in
the State-wide Misdemeanant Confinement Program.
C is the same as you saw before. It deals with some statutes related to
racing and driving while license revoked.
Subsection D deals with the...</p>

In the classroom of 21,000 dollars approximately. Item  number 75 is a
Senate modified item which eliminates museum from the grassroots science
museums. A health adventure museum closed down and that funding was
eliminated. The house eliminated that particular museum but added two
new museums so they actually increased the grass roots science museums
by nearly 43,00 dollars. The research triangle institute item number 76
is also a senate modified item. The house appropriated 500,000 to this
entity on a non recurring basis whereas the senate provided 250,000 on a
non recurring basis. The last item under state aid is the support center
which is a house only item providing the support center with 1,000,000
dollars on a non recurring basis. Mr. chair, I believe Timothy will come
back up to go over special funds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks Aubrey. So now we’re going to continue on with the special funds
pages which is the remainder of the money report packet starting on page
H19 with the department of Agriculture. The three items that you see
there were also in the senate money report that was the reversion of
those cash balances that are listed there 2,000, 11,0000 and the 1
almost 2 million from sleep products. The biggest difference there is
the sleep products the senate had transferred the operational budget
from that special fund into the general fund. The house leaves that
budget within that special fund but just sweeps the cash balance from
it. So if you turn the page over to page H21 the warehouse investment
fund, you’ll see that the senate had also swept that cash into the
general fund as we covered in the money report. Those funds are swept
into the division to offset the general fund support on a non recurring
basis. Turning the page to page H23 the Swann waste fund those funds are
trans - as we already went through with the money report – those funds
are transferred to solar and water conservation division to offset
general funds support on a non recurring basis. With Mr. Chair I’ll turn
it back over to Jennifer Hoffman to go through the ?? special funds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks Timothy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jennifer Hoffman of fiscal research starting on page H25 ??? special
fund you see the aquarium emissions fund being reduced and transferred
to the general fund. You also see the 3.5 million dollars of the
advanced license sales fund being transferred to the general fund to
support the three items that were already reviewed. What’s new in this
particular budget code is on the top of page H26 and that’s the
diversion of 3 million dollars of the emission inspection fee form the
Inan pollution control account to the general fund in fiscal year 14-15
only. There’s a special provision there that directs the division of air
quality to use their cash balance to support this program next fiscal
year. You see something similar happening on page H27 with the reserve
for air quality’s fuel tax. This diverts 750,000 dollars of fuel tax
that would otherwise have been allocated of the division of air quality.
That money will be deposited in a general fund and there is a
corresponding special provision that directs air quality to use its cash
balance to offset this diversion. Beginning on page H29 there’s a series
of special fund pages and what these do is divert interest earnings that
these special funds would have otherwise earned to the general fund on a
recurring basis so these special funds will no longer receive their
interest. Those special funds include the marine conversation fund. If
you flip the page it’s the dry cleaning solid tax special fund, the
Bernard Allen drinking water fund, continue to flip the page the waste
water operating training fund and then a number of funds within the
commercial lust cleanup budget code. Those particular funds include the
brown filled superfund, the commercial linking underground storage tank
fund, the emergency response fund, the enactive hazardous sites cleanup
fund, the enactive hazardous sites cleanup fund that’s kept separately
form the first one due to Senate bill 1429 that’s the money that’s used
for the pre-regulatory landfills.  It’s kept separate and apart from the
other fund. The non commercial linking underground petroleum and storage
tank fund and.</p>

Page 162 is the House provision that 16C.9 to deter inmate access to
cell phones. This encourages the department to find funds from Federal
sources or other sources to enhance prison security regarding cell
phones and access to cell phones.
16C.10, the use of closed facilities. This is the provision I mentioned
that follows the money. If you turn to the next page, page 163, lines 1
through 3, this allows the Department of Public Safety to use available
funds to reopen and convert closed facilities for this purpose using
funds available.
16C.11, this is a repeat of a provision from last year. It allows the
department to reclassify positions as support staff for the probation
and parole officer positions that were created in last year's budget.
16C.12 is a technical correction that clarifies how many rehabilitated
ex-offenders need to be on these community corrections advisory board.
16C.13, this is a study that will see if the UNC providers who are
providing health care to inmates may be able to take advantage of a
Federal program for reduced drug pricing costs.
Mr. Chair, that's all I have for Community Corrections and Juvenile
Justice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. We'll charge to the Department
of Justice next.
In the money report on page 8, items 32 and 33 are the assigned benefits
changes for the Department of Justice.
Item 34 is a $1 million management flexibility reserve. This is the same
as was in the Senate.
Item 35 is the transfer of the State Bureau of Investigation to the
Department of Public Safety.
Item 36 is an elimination of all of the toxicology outsourcing funds
that you all put in the Department of Justice's budget last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could I ask a question on it? Correctional on that
begins as, why we doing that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Last year you all appropriated $750,000 to the crime
lab in the second year of the budget in 14-15 for the crime under
outsource with private toxicology labs. You also appropriated money, I
believe it was $500,000 to the conference of DAs for local DAs to
outsource to local hospitals. So that part of the program is happening
and we'll find out how it's working later.
For the outsourcing of private toxicology by the crime lab, they issued
an initial RFP for that several months ago and no one responded. Then
they've reissued it and have gotten two responses on this reissue. But
it is my understanding that they are less than stellar responses...
Oh, I'm sorry. Christie is vigorously nodding her head and saying no,
no, no, they're good. But nonetheless, the Senate had a reduction of
$250,000 and then the House is taking all of the money...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I got that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Page R9, Item 37, this is a modification of an item
that was in the Governor's budget and it provides six forensic
scientists and two forensic scientists, two, an evidence technician and
a forensic scientist supervisor for a DNA unit at the western crime lab.
The Governor also had this item in his budget. The Governor's salaries
were slightly less than what these salaries are set out here because
forensic scientists are hard to recruit positions.
In addition, the Governor did not have lease money or a crime lab
funding for to build the western crime lab in his budget. The House
budget does include funding to build the western crime lab on the
Edneyville campus. That was also included in the Senate budget. So there
will be a place for these 10 people to go.
Mr. Chair, that's all for the DOJ's money and I will turn to their
provisions unless...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Page 163, the first provision in the Department of
Justice section is the transfer of the SBI Crime DOJ to the Department
of Public Safety. We went over this somewhat when we reviewed the Senate
budget earlier last week. I'll run through the substantive pieces of it
again for you.
17.1A is the actual transfer, [?] type 1 transfer of the SBI to DPS.
Most of the next 17 or 18 pages are statutory and conforming changes but
if you do look at, I'm going to draw your attention to...</p>

<p id="35:00">
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  17.1G These are the statutes that are related to the
Division of Criminal Information, and this pulls Information out from
under the SBI and places it under General Provisions in Law Enforcement
to give DPS more flexibility in consolidating the different IT functions
that exist for law enforcement.
Now we can skip the next 17 or so pages, and go to page 181. Subsection
M, down there on line 41; this is the appointment of the director of the
crime lab, and it is basically the same as what was in the Senate ??
There's been a couple of technical changes to it, but it does have the
Governor appoints a director, confirmed by the General Assembly, for an
eight year term . . . I'm sorry, did I say crime lab? I meant the SBI,
not the crime lab. The House is not moving the crime lab, so everyone's
clear. Sorry about that. So they're eight year terms, confirmed by the
General Assembly,and the Director may only be removed for certain
reasons laid out in the statutes, including committing a felony,
becoming addicted to substances, not coming to work, that kind of thing.
NNN, Subsection NNN, allows for the appointment of an acting Director,
until the next year, the next session, when you all will appoint the
real Director.
Section OOO is a limitation on movement of funds or positions from the
fund code 40SBI. Subsection PPP takes the Alcohol Law Enforcement
Section and moves it under the SBI, so it will become a branch  of the
SBI. And if you look at, drawing your attention to lines 42 and 43 there
has been a change there to the statutes, this is the same as was in the
Senate budget, but this language just emphasizes that the General
Assembly wants ALE to focus on ABC law enforcement. It does not change
their jurisdiction on any criminal matters at all, but it does change
the emphasis the General Assembly wants them to focus on.
Turning to page 183, Subsection UUU, this directs DPS to consolidate ALE
and Highway Patrol regional offices. I'm sorry, not Highway Patrol: ALE
and SBI regional offices. The Highway Patrol regional offices, you all
tried that last year, it didn't work out. VVV is requiring DPS to report
on the consolidation of the SBI into the Division of Law Enforcement;
there's three reports required there.
That's it for the transfer provision. The next provision, 17.3, is
directing JPS oversight and HHS oversight to jointly study the merger of
the Crime Lab and the Office of the State Medical Examiner into an
independent agency, and they are to report back to the 2014 General
Assembly on their findings.
Mr. Chair ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Graham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you, thank you Mr. Chair. Last week we were
talking about the reduction in ALE offices from six, from nine to six.
We're going to keep the nine, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Graham, the SBI has eight regional,
eight regions and eight regional offices. ALE has nine. And so I think
the assumption is the DPS will look at that, at both the eight and the
nine, and determine what is the best for the SBI and ALE as a whole. But
there is a reduction related to that, so one would assume that it will
go not up to nine but down to eight.
Page 184, Section 17.3A:  Ensure proper role for Attorney General. This
clarifys some language in the statutes, first that the GA is the client
if the Attorney General is representing the General Assembly in any
matter or in connection with any action of the General Assembly.
Subsection C, says that if the General Assembly hires outside counsel,
then that counsel shall be lead counsel if the General Assembly chooses
to designate them as such.
Section 17.5 is transferring the Private Protective Services Board and
the Alarm Systems Licensing Board from the Department of Justice to the
Department of Public Safety. This is a Type 2 transfer, these are
independent boards so they are just where they're . . .</p>

Administratively housed is being switched from the Department of Justice
to DPS and you'll also see in the conforming language down there
subsection b on lines 47 and 48, it's taking the attorney general out of
the appointments and putting in the secretary of public safety and then
if you turn to page 185 line 18 it's saying that the director will be
appointed by the secretary of the Department of Public Safety. So I
believe that's all with the Department of Justice. Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? Oh, OK. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chair. From the money report in
page I10, this is the office of ?? services, items 38 and 39 are the
salary increase and retirement contributions, item 40 is an
administrative reduction to the ?? service, this is a modification of
the Senate item, this reduces the appropriation by 20% and removes the
position that was with the Senate Budget. I'm going to go on and with
your permission, Mr. Chair, I'm going to ?? provision, so turning the
page to item 11, this is the Administrative Office of the Courts, item
41 is the compensation increase, salary increase, item 42 is a step for
all assistant and deputy clerks, item 43 is a step for magistrates, item
44 are the retirement contributions and item 45 is the judicial
contributions. When we talk about the Senate budget they had a very
similar item where the state overcommitted to the judicial retirement
for the current year, so this takes money back out after giving the cost
of living allowance, so it's not cutting into retirees at all, it does
still include the cost of living allowance. Item 46 sweeps the salary
reserve and directs AOC to budget salaries at actual levels, it ?? at
the end of March. Item 47 is a reduction to the administrative and
services division of the Administrative Office of the Courts of 6.6%.
This is a modification from the Senate budget which had a directed cut
to technology services and a 5% cut to the rest of Administrative and
Service budget. Item 46 is the state funding for family court and item
49 eliminates the direct appropriation for access to civil justice that
goes to the state bar for access to civil justice in all province. Now
turning to provisions on page 186 starting on line 18 section 18 A.1, it
is a modification of a similar provision that appeared in the Senate
budget. This directs IDS to develop a plan to deal with the public
availability of fee applications, directs IDS to work with the
controller and OSBM, the agency has said that they had a few problems
with the budget or with the original or the Senate provisions so this
gives them time to work that out. Section 18 A.2, this is a request from
the agency. This gives the ASE and IDS some time to work on this report
that is due on July 1, 2015 now dealing with the criminal case
information system for public defenders, also this directs this report
to go somewhere, this was a staff oversight from the last budget.
Section 18 B.1, this is very similar to a Senate provision dealing with
various reporting requirements. I walked through this last week and I'd
be happy to do it again if anyone's interested. Yes, sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. OK. So, OK. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Couldn't find your ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's all right. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] On the money report, page 12, family court, we were doing away
with that ??. This ?? no more, is this what I understand. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That's what it does, that's correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And this
??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] What is the basis for that? I
don't</p>

Representative Dollar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s not a statewide program.
There’s only, like, 13 family courts in the state. My district doesn’t
have them. Some work well, some doesn’t, and this does not preclude an
additional district from having the family court; we just are not going
to fund it. In some cases they could even be local funding of the family
court if that local area wanted it, or if the management of a system
wanted to designate a judge as a family judge… so there’s some latitude
there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I just follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to make a comment, I’m
really concerned about this. What do we do…? And you hear my
frustration. We’re trying to keep children with their families, mothers
with their children. If they’re not with their mother then where are
they at? Somebody’s got to take care of these children. I see this and I
think we have a strong family court in my county. I’ve been there, I’ve
seen it work, I’ve seen it be successful, I’ve seen children coming back
to their mothers. For me this is a family issue. To me this is a moral
issue, and just to say if we can pass that off to someone else, I’m not
sure that we’re going to see a benefit when we pass it off to some other
part of the judicial system when we’ve got folks who are experiencing
working with these families – councilors, individuals who can keep these
families whole. I’m really concerned about what we’re saying here and
sending a message out to our families, especially those who are
afflicted with issues as it relates to drugs, so I’m really concerned
about  the message we’re sending. I’m really disappointed to hear this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could
explain some things for Representative Graham, the family courts that
are being abolished here have to do with couples who are getting
divorced. It has to do with civil court. The courts that you’re
referencing are juvenile courts. They’re still within the district court
system. They’ll still be operating exactly as they have before. These
courts only dealt with divorce, property division between… If you’re
saying “Whose not getting the kids when mom’s not getting them?” it’s
dad, because courts decide which parent shall have them. These are
divorce courts. These are specialized divorce courts; they have nothing
to do with abuse, neglect, dependency at all. Those courts are still
operating completely the way that they were. ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
“family” part of it I assume was what you were… the wording “family”
raised your concern I think, but you see it’s a little bit different
from handling family matters. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ve got a great
judicial district. I’ve been to yours, and we’ve got one, and we look
after our children just as well as your county does. We have about the
same number of people working in juvenile courts as your county does,
and that will stay the same, but we don’t have a standardized family
court system in this state. We just don’t have it. And we don’t have one
in my district. You have one in yours, but why should we have
specialized courts when we don’t have enough money? And o what we’re
trying to do is make sure that the court system works, but the family
courts in our estimation do not serve a statewide purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further questions, comments? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve got a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
On these facilities, the juvenile facilities that that have in Lenoir
County, do you remember them approaching us at this committee and giving
us this plan that they have for the future to go from the old facility
to the newer facility that was closed? Do we do anything? Do we know
anything on that or why not is hasn’t been…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Lisa,
could you comment on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly, and thank you
for asking. I should have mentioned that there is a provision in this
budget that will allow – it’s not in this package but it’s in the full
budget. Section 36.4. It’s in the capital section. That allows the
department to take the funds that had been allocated for the repair and
renovation of the kitchen at ?? Lenoir and to instead use those funds to
start implementing that plan – the strategic facilities plan. So there
is a provision for that. Thank you for asking. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chair?</p>

So moving to page 188. I’m sorry, 189, section 18B.2. It’s an annual
report on criminal court cost wavers. This is very similar to a
provision in the Senate budget. This redirects it to the chairs of the
appropriations subcommittees and the JPS Oversight, and directs ASE to
aggregate the number of wavers that are being given in each district
into ?? judge granting the waver or wavers. Section 18B.3 on line 16;
this is the report dealing with compensation of court reporters. This,
similar to the Senate budget, adds another reporting requirement.
Section 18B.5; this is language dealing with the training of superior
and district court judges on the crime lab. We worked with the Scholl of
Government on this language and this has been modified from the Senate.
Section 18B.6, starting on line 38; this deals with special superior
court judgeships. This language would, with the next four special
superior court judges whose terms are up, the next two would be
converted to business court judges, the two after that would be
eliminated, and this has some very specific language that deals with the
assigning of business court judges, starting over on page 190 on line 1.
This increases the number of business court judges and deals with the
provision. Section 18B.14 starting on line 27; this directs the courts
to assess a fee for toxicological testing performed in private hospitals
by prosecutors. This is slightly different from the Senate language. On
page 191 and at the bottom of page 191, the Senate language directed
this money to go back to the prosecutorial district; this money would
instead go to the general fund. And that concludes my presentation on
the House budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I have a question about the last thing he just talked about,
the testing. The question, and we dealt with this as an independent bill
in Judiciary Committee: Who pays the initial 600 dollars to the private
hospital? Is this merely a private hospital fund? And at some point we
talked about that maybe the district’s contract could give the moneys
paid as opposed to coming from the general fund, and then we talked
about what if the test didn’t cost 600 dollars, and what if the fees of
the expert were not 600 dollars? Are we getting a windfall somewhere,
and is the money going to the person who paid it out? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff had some concerns about the original language in the Senate
budget, going back to the prosecutorial district. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
as we did. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, it seemed to violate some of the
general principles of the unified court system when money goes back to
the general fund instead of back to the courts, so the 600 dollars is
just to make this type of testing parallel to state crime lab and the
local crime lab, with the thinking that there shouldn’t be an unequal
level of court costs based on who actually does the testing, so…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But the… let me follow up. The question was still,
where does the money come from to begin with to pay the private
hospital? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, last year ya’ll
appropriated 500 thousand dollars nonrecurring to the Conference of DAs
to pilot this program, and they are doing that I think in five counties
right now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Almost. Almost five. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And
so the theory is that if you have this fee, it gets charged, it comes
back to the general fund, then ya’ll come back next year and choose if
the program is working. If the Conference of DAs comes back and reports
to you “yes, the program is working”, you will have an additional source
of money to provide recurring funds, because right now it’s just
nonrecurring. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. That helps. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Other questions? Representative Graham? Charles Graham? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? questions. Can I go back to the…</p>

The special provisions on page 160, maintenance in prisons, I just have
a question on that, and the question is are we as a committee supporting
privatizing prison reform, prisons? Prison maintenance, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Graham, the public currently has a
contract in order to do maintenance in 3 prisons. Two of the contracts
are up at the end of this year and the third one's the end of April so
they're in the process of preparing an RFP related to those 3
facilities. The General Assembly in 2011 said you cannot expand that
maintenance beyond those 3 facilities unless the General Assembly acts.
What this language does is sort of removes that prohibition so they can
expand that if they can do it in a cost effective manner also obviously
maintaining the safety, so it is not saying we're going to go forward
and expand that, but it gives the authorization because before you all
had a prohibition that they could not do that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So they
can, I guess you're saying they can move forward if they feel that it's
something that can be done in a positive way without ?? these original
policies state and also taking into consideration safety. Without any,
excuse me, I'm sorry, without any policy or anything currently in the
legislature. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, sir, all they're doing at this
point is they are wanting to remove the prohibition, just to give them
the fund to explore what's out there because before they could not ??.
The Senate reported to the General Assembly to ?? Subcommittee to deal
with ?? current maintenance and some issues that have come forward, they
decided to expand this ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That requires they are ??
to anticipate savings and so forth. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Other questions? What's your title, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Commissioner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Commissioner. Did you
have any additional information that might help that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Our purpose at this time, we
hit this, we anticipated 11 'o' clock, and that was just about right.
Question Representative ?? ? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Commissioner? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry. The very
last section, this is a special fund page, which is why I forgot it. In
the commerce section of the budget you will find a provision that
transfers the ABC Commission by type to transfer to the Department of
Public Safety. The ABC Commission is an independent commission. It is
operated independently but it does have to be housed somewhere. Right
now it is in Commerce. The House budget is moving it to DPS and so what
you see here on the special fund page is the transfer of the ABC
Commission's funds to DPS. There ?? Representative McNeill ??. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I want to comment on that. There is a ?? reform that allows for
a very close cooperation between ELE and the ABC Commission. ABC is
undertaking a lot of studying work on dealing with underage drinking and
auto accidents and so forth and so that would allow them to be in close
proximity. Do you have another question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up
question was so it's just to transfer, no change in, no cutting their
budget, the budget stays the same, they're just moving from one agency
to another? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Mr. Chair. Representative McNeill, the
Senate budget had, you'll see at the bottom of page 514, there's a cash
balance there of $5.8 million. The Senate</p>

reached the time and we’re now closing the time for reception of
amendments. Are there any questions or comments prior to the time we
start going into amendments? Representative Reives. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was curious in looking over it what our ??
prosecutes, and I guess my question is what the policy was behind moving
the state Bureau of Investigation out of the AD’s office. I know when I
prosecuted, it was good having that investigative arm there with the
AD’s office. It was kind of a smooth transition when you could get cases
moving that we could prosecute locally, and I was just curious… [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I can give you my thoughts, and then someone else may want to…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have
several state law enforcement agencies, and from a budget standpoint, if
you had those agencies closer together so that they can purchase
automobiles and maybe those kinds of things that have to be money spent
on for agencies, it’s better to have them operating close together.
Also, there are two schools of thought in terms of where a law
enforcement agency should fit in with prosecution agencies. For instance
at local government level, the sheriff does not work with the DA. The
chief of police does not work for the DA. They are a law enforcement
agency and the DA is a prosecutor. So and from a general management
standpoint, there was a feeling that by merging for instance the SPI and
ALE, who have basically the same authority and responsibility, although
ALE we’re seeing is more concentrated on alcohol law enforcement, they
still can all enforce the same laws. It doesn’t make a lot of sense,
having two large bodies like that in state government. So that’s some of
the thinking, and I’m sure there may be other thoughts as well. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Did you have a comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well if I could follow-up… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Have we had a chance to see how that’s worked in maybe
any other states or anything, that sort of…? Is there any precedent for
it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’re going to… There’s precedent at the federal
level. FBI is at the frontline with the prosecutors. There’s… We are
asking for I think it’s three different reports, isn’t it? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes sir. It’s three. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Three different reports
we’ll be getting back to find out how this is working next year, the
year after and so forth, so we want to know if it works or not, as with
anything we do, and we have addressed some in this budget, but it can
always be tweaked or it can be changed if it’s a mistake. So it’s a
matter… There are two schools of thought – we fully realize that – but
we feel like we need to make this move now in the interest of moving
forward with a consolidated law enforcement function, and we’ll see how
it goes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Other
questions or comments? If not, Representative Stevens is recognized to
send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. My
amendment is on the special provision, page 184. I’m sorry, not 184.

somewhere in here. We are requiring ?? defense to prepare a plan for
putting all of the applications publicly online and to give us a report

project to get all of that and I think there’s some concern about

well. He thinks it’s a good amendment that would limit the total amount
of fees that any one company could pay to five thousand dollars net,
which is estimated to have no impact on the total amount that the
program will in fact collect, but I think it’s important to send that
message to the business community that we’re not putting an open-ended
fee out there. I would move that you all vote for this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions? Staff, can you give us any further
information on that, or…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? talk to the division
about it here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Szoka. You’ve
heard the motion. All those in favor, indicate by saying aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those opposed, no. The ayes have it.
Amendment passes. Representative Jackson is recognized to send forth an
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My amendment
appears on page I10 of the money report, where it shows a reduction to
IDS of 466,380 dollars. IDS is a ?? that… their administrative functions
were actually spread upon three different areas including public ??, so
they are willing to make do with the same cut of 466,380 but would like
a little discretion to cuts on travel, train, things in the other areas
of their budget. So it wouldn’t affect the money; it would just allow
them to get it across their whole agency and not just in one particular
area, and I move for adoption. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’ve heard the motion
and explanation of the amendment. Are there any questions? If not, those
in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those opposed
say no. The amendment passes. Moving on, Representative Hurley. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mine’s on page 189, and we had asked AOC
to study how the compensation for reporters would be done, and they’re
just asking for a little additional time, so all mine does is change the
date to January 1st for the final report on compensation for court
reporters, ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions? Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not in any opposition to her amendment, but I guess my
question became, I thought we’ve studies court reporters several times,
and I just didn’t know why we were studying them again. Are we still
missing something? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’re not studying them. They were
studying them. Excuse me, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Hurley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] They were trying to decide the best way to do
their compensation because they were doing it differently all over the
state, and they’re still working on it. They just need a little
additional time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Purely a compensation study. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any other questions? You’ve heard the motion and information on
the amendment. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All those opposed say no. The amendment passes. Oh my goodness.
What a wonderful room to be in.</p>

<p id="70:00">
There is not enough room in this building for us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm
to ?? the night out. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We should. We really, really
should. I want to thank the committee members for all the cooperation
that we've gone through. I know it hasn't always been fun, and I thank
you very much for staying in the room and that we've taken a big step.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a motion to send at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's now the time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that the
Justice and Public Safety Subdivision adopt the Appropriations
Subcommittee report as amended and further move that staff be authorized
to make technical records and conforming changes related to reconciling
the various amendments adopted and that the appropriate totals be
adjusted accordingly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You heard the motion. All those
options. All those in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All those opposed say no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The ayes have it and the motion is carried. Thank you very
much, we're adjourned.</p>
