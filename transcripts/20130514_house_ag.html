Members of the house committee on ??would you please take your seats.
and if seems to be any confusion in the room u have perceived correctly.
Transportation was little late getting out, we would first like to
acknowledge ?? John crook?? Charles Goodwin and we are also delighted to
have our pages you with us today and half men sponsored by
representative Radal, Robert Jenkins sponsored by speaker Telis, Curtis
Johnson sponsored by representative Stanberg and Christin ?? sponsored
by  representative Malfit. And we do have another special guest in the
room today which is require all of you in this committee to be very kind
to me today because I have told my wife how much you all love and
respect me and she is in the back seat the young lady with the green top
on ?? and we would be glad to have her here. You have an order
representative ??. Our first bill that would.Jackson would you be kind
enough to give  the committee an ?? condition of representative Langdon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you representative. Representative Langdon was in
wake mid last night and he has two adjacent stands put in his heart. He
want me to give a excuse absence for today and tomorrow. ??. But he is
in good spirits and he is doing well and he should be home today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you and I am sure that we all sure remember him
and those who give him ?? prayers. Our first bill this  afternoon is has
bill 663 representative Ramsey you are recognised to explain the bill.
This bill will ??[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. chairman members of the
committee and lot to be recognised sent forth in moment  Mr chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The PCS represented ?? are ready with force from last
week. Representatives Ramsey's  recognised sent forth in the moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the surgeon of arms have passed out the moment
with any view anyone just has and let us know. What is moment does it
changes and we had some discussions about this bill at the last
committee meeting and I had good discussions with that with the justice
and others and ?? regarding their concerns about this bill. And if we
recall the prior bill gave you some protection ?? and ?? certified and
the plan would have to show aggressive negligent standard  to be
successful and but this moment does is give you reward-able perception
and if u get certified and if get good standing with that program but
that perception can be overcome by clearing conventional evidence. They
felt like from party stand forth and put them in better instead to be
fair to the former and to the consumer down the line and that would be
the moment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] representative ?? you are recognised to
read the moment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr Chairman I have a
question for staff. If staff could explain for me the difference between
the committee substitute and the amendment, how the amendment ?? changes
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] staff you have recognised to answer the
question from the representative. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you
representative and Than you chairman, so the PCS would have provided a
strict bar to liability for  a certified producer. In last ?? was caused
by the producer ?? negligence and intentional misconducts. The amendment
would still allow  negligence liability</p>

It would just increase the burden of proof on the plaintiff from
preponderance of the evidenced too clear and convincing evidence, which
is a higher evidentiary standard if the producer is certified.  Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Refer to the amendment.  Further discussion, further debate?  Hearing
none, all in favor of the amendment, say aye.  Any opposed?  The
amendment barries.  You're now represented.  We're back on the bill.
Any questions or discussion on the bill itself?  Representative Luebke,
you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I'm wondering if there's anyone from the
public who wanted to comment on this because this is about lawsuits, and
I just know is there anyone in particular from the academy, the trial
lawyers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, I did have one person to approach me, but that
person came to me and withdrew from speaking.  Is there anyone who would
like to speak to this.  Identify yourself to the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for recognizing me.  My name is Phillip Eisley, and I met a
contract lobbyist for the North Carolina advocates for justice.  I wanna
thank representative for working with us, getting the bill much better.
We're very supportive of his changes, and we appreciate the opportunity
to sit down and talk this through.  We appreciate the amendment, and
we're supportive of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

house bill 816.  Representative Daughtry, you're recognized to explain
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, there is a strictly, strictly technical
amendment that is being passed out at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's not in the folder.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those who do not have 816 PCS, would you please raise your hand?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now's a good time to vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Daughtry, would you be kind enough?  The staff has asked
me to give them time to locate this.  Would you be kind enough to let us
displace momentarily?  Thank you.  Is representative Ray here?
Representative Ray.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.  Representative Faircloth is going to run this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Faircloth is recognized to explain house bill 936.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and committee.  This is a bill that addresses a
quite interesting problem.  I got several requests from across the state
to look at the problem of people who poach wildlife.  Who either take it
for commercial purposes illegally or destroy it in some way illegally</p>

<p id="10:00">
This is not at all talking about the person who legally goes out and
hunts or fishes or whatever the case may be. We're talking here about
people in many cases who are taking wildlife for commercial purposes and
it's a very serious crime when you look at what it can result in. This
bill establishes a what's called a wildlife poacher reward fund within
the office of the state treasurer. The fund will be used to pay rewards
to persons who provided information to the wildlife resources commission
or to other law enforcement officials having to do with the taking,
injury, removal, damage or destruction of wildlife resources. These are
serious levels of crime as far as wildlife's concerned. The assets of
the wildlife poacher reward fund would be derived from the following: a
percentage of the compensation paid annually to the commission and
special conditions of offender's probation. Any amounts paid to the
commission as ordered by the judge, any amounts paid to the commission
or rewards paid from the fund, the proceeds of any gifts, grants and
contributions to the state which are specifically designated for
inclusion in the fund and there are clubs and individuals who have
already said they would be contributing to the fund and then any other
sources that are allowed by law. There's a special condition under
section 2 a special condition simply says a court after finding them
guilty the court may also include as a condition to probation
compensation to the agency for any reward paid for information leading
to the arrest and conviction. If for instance a reward is paid out of
let's say 1000 dollars to discover who this wrong doer is, the wrong
doer is then arrested based on information and then is convicted then
his punishment could include repayment back for the amount of that
reward that was spent so it can be used again if you will. I think it's
a good bill. I've got a lot of support for it and Mr. Chairman there's a
spokesman here I think from the commission and ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you like to do the amendment first? Representative Brisson this is
a very technical amendment, Representative Faircloth, Representative
Brisson recognize and send forth the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We'd like to recognize the staff to
explain the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. The
amendment simply changes on line 17 of page 1 where it reads
&quot;resources commission shall establish rules&quot; it simply changes
that to &quot;shall adopt rules&quot;. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion further debate on the amendment? All in favor say aye. All
opposed. The amendment passes. Further discussion further debate on the
bill. I have Representative Riddell first. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir for
a motion at an appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion?
Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative
Faircloth, tell me in layman terms how you envision this to work. Give
me an example of the poaching you're talking about. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could we have the wildlife representative speak to that? I think you'd
probably give a better illustration. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the
representative from the wildlife commission please state your name for
the record please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm Dale Cavney, Colonel with North
Carolina Wildlife Resources Commissions Division of Law Enforcement. And
the way we would envision this working is we would specify through those
rules the types of violations that would warrant the awarding of the
rewards and the levels of the rewards based on the type of offense. In
other words, fishing without a license, I couldn't see that we would pay
reward for that. But for the more serious offenses, taking big game
illegally, commercialization of wildlife, those types of offenses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So shooting deer out of
season or any animal or any of the game out of season would that be
considered poaching? Do you envision that to be a poachable offense
subject to</p>

[Speaker Changes] Mr. Carter, you’re recognized to respond.
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] Follow up.
[Speaker Changes] Well its illegal killing rattlesnakes and copperheads
and some of these vipers are considered to be endangered. If someone
killed a rattlesnake, would that be something that would be subject to a
reward?
[Speaker Changes] You are recognized Mr. Carter.
[Speaker Changes] It would  depend on the rules that are adopted by the
commission and those would go through public hearing so there would be a
betting process by the types of offenses we would offer rewards for.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Lucas.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chair. Question, if in the event that
the poacher is a juvenile, who is responsible for the fine?
[Speaker Changes] Representative Faircloth, are you prepared or would
you like staff?
[Speaker Changes] Staff.
[Speaker Changes] Staff, you’re recognized to answer the question from
Representative Lucas.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Lucas, could you repeat the question.
[Speaker Changes] For Juvenile offenders or those who are indigent, and
have no resources for fines, would it be the parental responsibility, or
what happens in that case?
[Speaker Changes] The bill does not speak to that, so it would be just
whatever provisions are in existing law for other fines for juveniles
and indigents.
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion, further debate? Representative
wAddell, you’re recognized for a motion.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chairmen, I move we give a favorable
report to the...
[Speaker Changes] Representative Waddell, would you hold just a second.
Representative Lubekey you’re recognized.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chairmen, I’m sorry last minute here,
but I wanted to follow up on Representative Lucas’ question. What if the
person is an adult is given a $5000 cost and that person doesn’t have
$5000, or even $500. What is the consequence for the violator when the
judge says pay back $5000 or $500, and the person doesn’t have any
assets.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Faircloth or staff.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Luebke, just frankly, I don’t have an
answer for you off the top of my head. We’ve have to look at it, but it
would be whatever would govern this particular statutes and penalties
assess that a dependent was unable to pay, it would be applicable to all
penalties where defendants were not able to pay. So it is general
existing law, and we’d have to go look that up.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Waddell, you’re recognized for a
motion.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chairman, I move we give a favorable
report to House Bill 936 with referral to finance.
[Speaker Changes] As amended?
[Speaker Changes] As amended, yes.
[Speaker Changes] You’ve heard the motion. All in favor say aye. All
opposed. The ayes have it, bill passes Representative Daughtry, you’re
recognized to explain 816.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Committee.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chairmen. Before I do I want to send
forth an amendment.
[Speaker Changes] You’re recognized to send forth the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] To explain the amendment, its very technical the
change it makes, it harmonizes the bill to make sure that its not one
half, its two thirds of the vote.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Daughtry, Representative Horn moves
that we have the PCS before us. All in favor say aye. The PCS is now
before us.
[Speaker Changes] And I want to send forth the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Recognized to send forth the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Simply those changes the one half to two thirds is
technical and makes it harmonizes the bill. Appreciate your support.

All in favor say aye,
[Speaker Changes] Aye.
[Speaker Changes] All opposed? The amendment passes, we’re now back on
the bill.

List, the good things that tobacco has done. We all know what the bad
things are, but the good things include Duke University, Wake Forest
University and many many other things throughout our state. Tobacco
continues to be a good product in our state and it is being promoted now
by the Tobacco Growers Association. Which has been in existence, as I
recall, for many years. This simply allows them by referendum to assess
the growers if they choose to be assessed, so that they can promote
tobacco throughout the world. We’re selling our tobacco in many places
in the world and this simply is a mechanism, as sweet potatoes has a
mechanism, to promote their tobacco. It’s all it does, it takes
two-thirds of the vote of the growers if they choose. After the
referendum, if they choose to do so, then the association would promote
tobacco as they have, as they see fit. And all of the money is kept up
with, in a very appropriate way. I don’t know of anybody who’s opposed
to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative West.
Representative West.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, at the appropriate time I’d like to make a
motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Representative Lubke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry to be asking so many questions, but this is for Representative
Daughtry, in years past, and it’s been a while since we’ve had one of
these, but there have been other commodities where the issue of this
kind of assessment has come up. My recollection is they always came to
finance. I don’t see that this one is going to finance. You know, I
don’t care because I support the bill, except from a policy perspective
or rules perspective. They used to have to go to finance, I’m quite sure
of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s not in my pay grade, I don’t know. Representative Starnes may know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, you are recognized to address the question put
forth by Representative Lubke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under the rules of the House, I don’t see how this bill could just skate
finance, and I think their meeting in the morning at 8:30. I bet we
could get it on the agenda.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have no – if it needs a referral it does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I had a question I wanted to ask the department just out of
curiosity. Now that the allotment system has ended, how many acres of
tobacco are we growing in North Carolina and how does that compare to
when we had the allotment program?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ll recognize the Representative from the Department. Identify
yourself. Mr. McCloud?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman we’ve got Graham Boyd here with the Tobacco Growers
Association. He knows the numbers on acreage produced.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Last year approximately 165,000 flue cured in North Carolina projection
for this year is maybe 170- 175,000 range.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How does that compare?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be trending upwards since the tobacco buyout. North Carolina
now accounts for approximately 80% of the flue cured tobacco in the
United States. Total production. And demand worldwide continues to
increase as well. And then opportunities for crop advancements research
technology, accountabilities, new procedures that we’re also
implementing to provide better integrity for a product.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, and how many acres were we growing prior to the buyout?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, at our peak say in 1996, belt-wide, Florida to Virginia for flue
cured, and that’s what we’re specifically talking about on this bill, we
were producing somewhere, marketing when we had the program, about 1.2
or 3 billion pounds at the pinnacle of that. Of course it was controlled
by a USDA program. When that program went away, tobacco trended, of
course, in a different direction. I would say that 2003 we were probably
140 or 150,000 acres in the state. So we have benefited from migration
of production. For us to increase our acres, some of that has come at
the expense of states like Georgia, Florida, and a lot of that is due to
the fact of our close proximity to processing. Universal Leads in Nash
County, largest processor in the world. Alliance One is here.
Stabilization Cooperative has its facility in Timber Lake. So you
products move closer to where the center of processing and manufacturing
tend to be.</p>

<p id="25:00">
We have the opportunity to expand significantly more as long as we keep
a close match on supply and demand.  The acreage is out there.  And the
disposition of the growers is out there, too, to grow more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could say one more thing about tobacco before I close my remarks.
I grew up on a tobacco farm and there was a family near where I grew up
that not only grew tobacco but sold pesticides and fertilizers to the
various farmers in the community.  And back in the 50s or late 40s, the
federal government abolished or outlawed DDT and a thing called
malathion.  I don't know if you remember that or not, but it was
outlawed.  And this farmer who had sold that product as well as
fertilizer, a black car pulled in the yard.  And when a black car pulls
in a farmer's yard, it's an issue; it's an alarm bell goes off.  And
this man got out and he said he was with the federal government and that
he was checking around to be sure that those people that sold malathion
and DDT did not have any more inventory.  He said, &quot;I have this
card and this card is from the federal government.  And it allows me to
go on your farm and to ensure that you don't have any of these outlaw
products.&quot;
Well, the farmer and his wife under the tree said, &quot;Okay,
well.&quot;  And he showed the card to the wife and then he went and
looked in the pack houses and in the shelters, all the shelters, and he
didn't find anything.  And he was ready to leave and he looked out and
there was a pasture and a small cinder-block building in the middle of
the pasture.  And he decided to go look at that.  And he started walking
across the field.  And the farmer had bought a new bull. [LAUGHTER]  And
when he got about half-way out there, that bull started chasing that guy
from Washington.  And he started yelling, &quot;Help!  Help!&quot;  And
the farmer said, &quot;Show him your card!  Show him your card!&quot;
[LAUGHTER]
I move for a favorable report on this as adopted.
[LAUGHTER]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before we recognize that there were three other people who wanted a
brief comment, a statement of clarification from the Chair.
Representative Luebke, we will speak to the speaker about this.  The
referral to Finance, that would come when he reads this in.  We will
cover that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to mention that Finance, Representative Starnes, doesn't
have to meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 because the bill is not subject to
the cross-over in that case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have three.  Representatives Waddell, Brisson, and Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I just wanted to make a comment about the bill.
When you're talking about making an assessment, and they're referring to
Finance, this only affects the tobacco farmers, the certified tobacco
farmers in North Carolina.  And it's being voted on only by the
certified tobacco farmers.  So I don't understand the real reason why it
would have to go to Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brisson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was basically the same question I had.  I was going to ask our
majority leader why he thought it might need to go to Finance since
there's no state dollars or anything else, just the growers money.  They
make the decisions; a decision has not been made on the amount, whatever
they would contribute, but maybe rules says it does have to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I'm probably wrong, as usual.  [LAUGHTER]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had just an inquiry for Mr. Boyd.  Very
quickly, is this a completely brand new assessment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Boyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Yes, this would be a new assessment to address some of the
issues coming forward.  Good agricultural practice programs that has a
cost associated with it, that's new as we talked about integrity, cost
of that.  One thing to mention to, it is refundable.  So that if a
grower is disgruntled or dissatisfied, he can apply, he or she can apply
to receive their monies back.  So in that sense it is their prerogative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I had a comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just over twenty-five years ago, I made a choice.  I almost went into a
situation where I would have been in agriculture trying to figure out
how to kill the little critters that eat tobacco.  But I chose a
different way.  And I'm still dealing with little critters with the law
field.  But anyway, my comment here was my friends in the Christmas Tree
Association, I have the chairman of the national association in my
county, tried to do this on a national level and got ...[AUDIO ENDS]</p>
