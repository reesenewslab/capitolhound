The House will come to order. Members will take their seats. Visitors
retire from the Chamber. Sergeant-at-Arms will close the doors. Members
and visitors will please silence all cellular phones, personal
electronic devices. The prayer will be offered by Representative Rick
Glazier. Members and visitors in the gallery please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is an adaptation of a prayer, &quot;Where Can We
Find Hope.&quot; There is holiness when we love and serve without any
thought of reward or hope for personal gain. There's holiness when we
promote family harmony and when we seek to unite others near and far.
There's holiness when we share with others our resources, our ideas, our
enthusiasm. There's holiness when we are willing to be laughed at for
what we believe in. There is holiness when we relieve suffering, visit
the sick and comfort the bereaved. There is holiness when we remember
the lonely and the neglected to bring cheer into a dark corner. There is
holiness when we sacrifice time and energy to teach our children. And
there is holiness when we pray in truth and humility for the strength
and grace to lead and not follow, act and not just talk, and to remind
ourselves that each day brings a new opportunity to be a better person.
And let us stay humble.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, pleas remain standing for the Pledge of
Allegiance.

drafting that up. But we’ve got some good guys, some good players, and
Representative Jones says that he wants to coach us and I asked him was
he going to take me out of the game. And he said well, probably not. And
I said well, Representative Jones are you going to take me out of the
game? And he said absolutely not. And then I said well you can be the
coach then. So bring your sneakers and we’ll try to get all the
liability stuff taken care of before Monday night. And we’ll practice
right after session on Monday and try to do every Monday. And Mr.
