[Speaker changes.]  Senate will come to order.  Sargent-at-arms will
close the doors. Members will go to their seats. Members and guests of
the gallery will please silence all electronic devices.  Leading the
Senate in prayer is Senator Tommy Tucker. All members and guests in the
gallery will please stand.
[Speaker changes.] Let us pray. Father, we just wanna pause today to say
thank you.  Thank you, Lord for the freedom that you give us.  Forgive
us Father when we take for granted the price that's been paid for us to
be free and to come together and to be able to deliberate over the
people's business.  We pray for everyone in this chamber but, Lord, most
of all we just thank you for the peace that we have in our lives.
Father, we are just so grateful to you and we pray for the men and women
and children of Israel and Gaza that are within the sound of a siren,
which means that they have sixty seconds to find cover. Father, the men
and women that pay the price for us to be able to be free and to be able
to stand here...it's beyond what we can fathom.  Lord, your grace, your
love...you're a good God and we acknowledge that.  We pray your wisdom
and discernment in the decisions that we make and may we honor you in
all we do and say. In Christ's name, Amen.  [Group Amen.]

Division of Emergency Management those two things really damage this
bill in my opinion. So, I’m gonna ask everyone if you would please vote
not to concur so we can go to conference and straight this out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there further discussion or debate on the motion? The question for
the Senate is the motion to concur in Senate Bill…The House Committee
Substitute Senate Bill 729. All in favor of concurrence will vote aye,
all oppose will vote no, the sponsor asked that you vote no, five
seconds will be allowed for the voting, the clerk will record the vote.
None having voted in the affirmative and 46 having voted in the
negative, the motion to concur is defeated and the house will be so
notified. Senate Bill 794 the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 794: Disapprove Industrial Commission Rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. The difference what the house is sent back to
us as they have added a new section, Section 8 and what Section 8 does
is as it directs the conference of Chief District Judges to describe
uniform statewide ___[01:20] guidelines for the computation of retroact
of child support obligations this was non-controversial and it was
originally in House Bill 1092 ___[01:31] this is supported by the family
section debarment and the conference of Chief District Judges. So, I
would ask that you vote to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question for
the Senate is the motion to concur in the House Committee Substitute to
Senate Bill 794, all in favor of the motion will vote aye, all oppose
will vote no, the sponsor asked that you vote aye, five seconds will be
allowed for the voting, the clerk will record the vote. 47 having voted
