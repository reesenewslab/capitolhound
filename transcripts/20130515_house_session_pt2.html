If the House will come to order please. Ladies and Gentlemen first off
there are some bills on the calendar that may require expertise of
either legislative staff or in one or two cases staff from the
departments. The chair is going to allow staff to be available to the
extent a member needs them to respond to any questions on, on the floor.
Also ladies and gentlemen rule 12H. If I can have your attention because
the newer members may not know. This rule 12H is the no coat rule. And
without objection rule 12H is suspended. Is there objection? So ordered.
Coats can be removed. House bill 341 the clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Committee substitute for House bill 341. A bill to entitle and
to enact to provide a tax credit for employers who participate in
apprenticeship program approved by the Department of Labor. General
Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SOUND] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and
gentlemen of the House the, I, I mentioned before we went into recess
that the chair is going to try and use some discretion to move as many
of the bills that we think we may have limited debate on ahead. It is
was then any members right to object if I move ahead of the calendar to
object. And then we would have to leave of the House in order to move
ahead in the calendar. But I would go ahead and apologize in advance.
I’m gonna use knowledge and a little bit guessing to try and move
through some of the calendar items that I think we can move through
quickly. If any member has an objection to it the chair would happy to
honor any objection and then have the body rule. Representative Torbett
is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker, members of the House. It is actually a pleasure to bring this
to you. This bill is actually an act providing tax credits for employers
who participate in an apprenticeship program approved by the Department
of Labor. And it was very rare circumstance but I was thrilled to have
both Commissioner Chere/g Barry/g and the Lieutenant General of the
great state of North Carolina Van/g Forest help me present this in
finance. They are very much behind this bill. Let me just give you some
statistics to tell you what this bill would help do. [SOUND] The U. S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2012 annual average is showing employment
of North Carolinians age 16 to 19 at 25.4%. It is 16% of those age 20 to
24. The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics stating 2011 averages for North
Carolina because 2012 was not available yet. So that the unemployment
for whites between the ages of 16 - 19 was 26.2% and 15.3% for those age

unemployment rate was 47. [CROSSTALK] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative

Rep. Cleveland.
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.
113 having voted in the affirmative, 1 in the negative, the House
committee substitute number 2 to House bill 109 has passed its second
reading without objection, will be read a third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate?
If not, the question before the house is the passage of House committee
substitute number 2 for House bill 109 on its third reading. All in
favor, say &quot;aye?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed say &quot;no&quot;?
The &quot;aye&quot;s have it, House committee substitute number 2 for
House bill 109 has passed its third reading and will be sent to the
Senate.
House bill 359, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee substitute for House bill 359, a bill to entitle an act to
make changes to the administration state retirement system, that will
extend the transfer of benefit options to participants in the 403b
supplemental retirement plan, clarify the timing of social security
offset for long term disability benefits, establish a 415 per ??
benefits preservation as allowed under Federal law and provide that
domestic relations orders, dividing interests under the retirement
system must be submitted on approved forms. General assembly of North
Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Collins is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
This bill has 4 parts, we got a great vote on this in 2 committees it's
been heard in, State Personnel and Appropriations.
First section simply extends transfer benefit options that were already
available to people in the state 401k plan or the state 457 plan to the
new state 403b plan, just to make that same for all participants.
Second part clarifies the timing of social security offset benefits for
long term disability, right now for some reason or another, the state
offsets the money that social security disability's gonna pay you
against your state disability benefit 1 month before social security
actually pays you. We're gonna true it up and make sure that they don't
offset until you're actually receiving the benefit from social security.
Number 3, establishes a new account to keep money in for those people
who are fortunate enough to be drawing a pension that is greater than
that allowed by defined benefit plans under the IRC code section 415,
and we're gonna actually do away with the privilege of receiving more
than the IRC code says you should for retirees after January 1st, 2015.
Just so you know, that's $205,000 for somebody 60 and up of retirement
benefit. But we're also segregating the money to keep the state
retirement plan more fiscally sound.
Section 4 just requires people to use a certain form for domestic
relations order to be recognized by the state to increase operational
efficiency from the state itself. Appreciate your support on these
technical changes to this plan.

Representative Schaefer is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen.  You just heard the bill,
basically.  I learned very quickly in committee this morning that there
is no opposition to this bill, at least not that I'm aware of.  Do you
want to just very briefly state what it does is that it really tightens
down on our human trafficking laws, specifically as it relates to minors
and victims of the sex trafficking.  Provides for compensation,
restitution, things like that.  Two things of note.  What it does is
that it calls for education in the schools on these issues of human
trafficking, so that students can be educated and know if they're
getting involved in something that might be sex trafficking, and to
protect them against that.  It also provides for a statewide hotline.
That is something that was particularly requested by organizations that
work in the anti-trafficking field.  So, with that I urge support of the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hamilton, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.

<p id="060:00">
A third option, and that is this B-corp. And I would say to you on a
revenue side that's probably a good thing. Some group of people choosing
to be about an enterprise are now going to be picking, rather than
picking a non-profit organization they're going to get to pick a
for-profit corporation that still allows them to do what they do. And so
it is good in a revenue sense. Some range of corporations can be
for-profit and thus give us revenue. There is a lot of web chatter
continuing as up to the minute about this bill.
What I just find amazing is that there is some perspective that this
bill is some sort of hidden agenda 21 driven bill. Let me respond to
that. Republican Governor Haley of South Carolina, [??] or Louisiana,
Corbit [SP] of Pennsylvania, McDonald of Virginia have all supported
this bill. The sponsors of the bill - and this is going to cause some of
my democratic friends to probably go, oh, maybe I shouldn't be on this
bill. The sponsors of the bill and most of the - two of the states that
I've mentioned were graduates of Bob Jones University.
This is not a conservative or liberal bill at all, it's actually an
entrepreneurial bill. If you haven't noticed, those coming up younger
than us want to make profit but they want to be about doing good things,
and this type of corporation allows them to do that. And I want to give
you one quick personal story. As you all know I was a summer camp
director not that long ago and 25 years ago when I was a lot younger I
wanted to buy a camp, and I was caught in this conundrum between do I
want to be a for-profit, yeah, I want to be a for-profit, but I want to
do things like give kids the opportunity to take risks so that they can
grow into adults in the right way. But it would have been easy to be a
non-profit but am I going to put money into a non-profit? No.
On the other hand, if I had a bunch of investors in my corporation,
let's say I got my mother, my brother, my sister all in the corporation,
we all agree on this thing. My brother gets married, my sister gets
married, my brother gets divorced, my sister dies. Now I've got two
members of my corporation probbaly who've got their stock form their
spouses who may not share the enthusiasm for the cause that I might have
here. If I had been able to have a B-corp I would have never had that
problem. I could invest the money that an entrepreneur puts in his
business and at the same time be about the good purpose that I was
about. Let me tell you there's 14 states that have already approved
this. Delaware has already passed it through one house and I'm told that
it will become law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the gentleman yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McGrady does the gentleman yield? He
yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McGrady you remember how this bill came
out at committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How did it come out of committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It had a very strong vote, I don't remember exactly
the vote but it was a huge vote in the two committees that it was in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Was it almost unanimous?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In one of the two committees it was nearly unanimous,
the other ones there were some [??] votes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman if anticipating where
Representative Michaux is going and seeing lights on the chair is aware
of five amendments that the chair understands the bill sponsor supports.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will agree to all five amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair would perhaps request that the bill sponsor
maybe yield his remaining time to debate the bill after those amendments
are taken up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's certainly appropriate, thank you.</p>

Representative Stam, is recognized to debate the amendment.

Yes, one of the objections to the bill is the third party standard in
there and it’s sort of vague and has raised hackles. This amendment just
takes that issue off the table by taking out the third party standard. I
urge you to adopt the amendment.

Ladies and gentlemen, again, the chair would advise all members that the

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I realize the sponsor’s in favor of all these
amendments, I believe he thinks that the Senate might take them out.
This amendment would make this new corporation statute parallel to our

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This amendment is on page 7, if you will notice
there, there is some sort of benefit enforcement proceeding that is set
up in this new corporation where a shareholder can sue if the
corporation is not doing what the shareholder thinks it should be doing.
The whole purpose of this new B corp is that all of these members are in
favor of not just profit, but some other ambiguous social criteria so I
think that what they should do is every individual shareholder should
have the ability to sue not just holder of 5% of the entire corporation.

offices or facilities of the benefit corporation, its subsidiaries or

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. If you do look at this bill there's several
definitions at the beginning that are troublesome. One of them on page 2
line 3 says general public benefit. A material positive impact on
society and the environment taken as a whole as measured by a third
party standard from the business and operations of a benefit corporation
and number line 31 that same page defines a specific public benefit
purpose a corporate purpose conferring any particular benefit on society
or the environment including but not limited to any of the following and
there's a list of things. This amendment on page 5 talks about the
corporate purposes and what I'm doing there requiring that a corporate
purposes have one of these general benefits  that was discussed in that
earlier definition or psuedo definition and it also says a specific
benefit. This amendment requires that a corporation a big corporation
have a specific benefit in its purpose which right now it says may I'm
changing that to shall which matches the section A above it that a
benefit corporation shall have a general public benefit. Thank you Mr.

As you can tell I'm amenable to working with people. I guess I wish my

the story by the way my brother did get married but didn't die. My wife
my sister didn't get married and my mother left me the stock so I never
had that problem. I was able to run what is essentially a B corp type of
corp is a for profit and if you look in Time magazine some years back
now my camp was not noted as if you're going to do everything right in
raising young men you ought to go to Falling Creek Camp. But I shouldn't
have been put to that purpose. This is a good bill. Other states have
adopted it. When Delaware adopts it soon we will we'll be behind. South
Carolina and Virginia are already advertising this. They've got B corps
and North Carolina doesn't. This is an entrepreneurial bill and I urge
you to support it.

one of my amendments.  Colleagues, the concept of benefit corporations
is designed to transform not only the business culture, away from our
free enterprise profit motivated system, but to transform all of
society's value and behavior through a philosophy that's imbued with
criteria of sustainable development, which is in effect government
approved development and social equity. A legal benefit corporation
agrees to be certified by an independent third party. We had a big
discussion about LEED a couple of days ago. This is going to be another
third party certifier which will
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the speaker will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I remember correctly the Stam Amendment removed the
third party reference you just spoke about.  Correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To continue on, because I know that the bill sponsor
is going to have friends over in the Senate take care of all these
amendments I know that that will get back in.  A benefit corporation
that's legalized by State legislation allows corporations to divert
profits from shareholders in order to pursue environmental and social
humanitarian missions. H440 states that government may legally recognize
corporations in subjective social moral areas where government has no
authority.  The problem here friends is we have tons of entities in this
state that can be used for all kinds of purposes.  Representative
McGrady discussed them.  We've got foundations, trusts, LLC's, C Corps,
S Corps, non-profits.  There's lots of ways to do lots of things to help
your community, your environment, your shareholders, your family,
however you'd like to. Preparing a new corporation like this which I
think it's on both the ALEC list and the NSL list so I don't know if
that's a good thing or a bad thing, so you decide for yourself, I think
there are a lot of troubling questions to this and I would urge that you
vote against this. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  So the bill sponsor contradicted himself a
couple of times when he said we have corporations that are for profit
and we have some that are not for profit and this one was for profit one
time and then it was not for profit another time and I think we're
opening a can of worms here if we don't know where this is going to
lead.  We just made a whole bunch of amendments to a bill that we just
got a day or two ago.  We don't really know what's in it.  Now we really
don't know what's in it and we heard that when it goes to the Senate
it's going to really get fixed so that it's going to be totally
unrecognizable from what it is now and I can't support something like
this because you don't know what's in this really and what it's going to
do and I haven't had time to look at it and study it, not that that
makes any difference, but I can't support this thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Daughtry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I've been around practicing law a long time and I did
not know about anything but C Corporations when I started and all of a
sudden everyone was a C Corporation because you got the beneficial
limited liability and other things that we were told in law school to
advise your clients that people who wanted to be a corporation, a C
Corporation, was the thing to do and then a little later the S
Corporation came along and that was the trend.  Instead of a C
Corporation you suggest to your clients let's have an S Corporation and
that went through the 70's and 80's until recently the vogue now is the
LLC's and the LLP's.  This gives you limited liability and you can
advise a client that this is a way that you might want to consider as a
vehicle to run your business. In the last 15 years we've seen a change
in our economy because a lot of people have become very rich. People who
have got into IT for example, Microsoft, I saw Bill Gates on television
on Sunday night.  He has $67 billion that he has made and he feels a
real obligation to give back to the world and so he wants to eradicate
malaria, polio, and four or five other diseases throughout the world.
And I think that you're seeing that capitalism would like to help those
areas where it can.  People want to do good things. Fred Fletcher who
hired Jesse Helms is interested in a B Corporation.  There's a man in
Durham who had a column</p>

then he got on the work and they started moving people from one house to

started making money and they started all kinds of things. it's a
wonderful thing, and that's a perfect example of a beautiful voice, but
the last example was Paul Newman is a guy who made a lot of money in the

but I think they got it. as I voluntary cooperation. if you could advise
people that they may select to do or might not. the difference between a
big corporation of the city Corporation is that you are as a director,
you are issued, which tries hard. you can't maximize profits in this
particular corporation, you'll have to maximize profit. you can do
something else. you could run a chair if you spend the money different
ways, but is voluntary. these are people that are looking after their
money, their Corporation and they are going in the catholicity, white,
and they're paying taxes. I can imagine why. if someone wants to do this
voluntarily. if you would be be opposed to this is not some strange
thing is that you will answer to recognize observers and is making a
difference in South Carolina. we got an article from there saying how
good they are receiving after those big corporations are being received
in South Carolina. people are using them and their work, but nobody is

thank you, Mister Speaker, members of the house arousing opposition is
building on failure wireless this bill was filed last year in it never
did make it out of judiciary committee, and I think we had was a really
included five six hearings on this bill and I was smitten out there? to
my good friends and fellow attorneys. it appears little more to the
story. first off, represented blouses distribute some information from
civil toss talking about some of the problems they've had with this. I'm
from it didn't raise ideological issues, but I wanted to stay away from
that, this even forget that part. what I wanted such a perfect number.
this is not necessary in the entire country right now the entire United
States. you have a believe in fourteen states that adopt this message,
Delaware, which is the leader in corporate law has not adopted this deal
in the building. Delaware's looking at passing is not the same thing
that we are doing here in you want to try to follow the lead of what
Delaware's doing. there's a reason that most of the Fortune five hundred
companies locate their corporate headquarters. there, one thing is one
of people for corporations in the first place. why doesn't someone if
they have a charitable purpose gland is hang a sign up, and to start
doing it for the reason people use corporations.one is from any
liability and business contacts is for tax treatment, but it's also sure
you will all one thing you want to know when you're investing capital
when you're when you're engaging in a business enterprise is one of the
Serbian law S1 Delaware such an attractive location for corporations is
a good solid case law. this is a new creation. this would put North
Carolina in the minority of states of all fifty states only fourteen are
doing. I believe in New Mexico last week. the bill passed was vetoed by
the governor of this. this is not necessarily give you a few examples.
how can someone with a for-profit company right now. think about. think
of all the for-profit corporations. you know they are there, doing
charitable work as we speak. when any corporation can do that. anyone
can articulate that it is in the Corporation 's best interest that it is

corporation. You can also look at LLCs, other business entities. The
bottom line is you don't need a B-corp. Now, this bill has been passed.
I understand the third-party part is out right now. But this bill is
being promoted all around the country in states by a third-party group
that wants to be the clearinghouse to determine if the corporation meets
the criteria. Think about that. You've got a cottage industry forming up
to be the underwriter laboratory, if you will, to say that this
corporation meets it or not. Now, I understand it's come out. I would
suspect it may come back in if it passes. If this bill passes, I
certainly hope the third party provision stays out. Right now, under
private contract options and benefits, corporations are allowed to
engage in any lawful purpose already. It just can't engage in unlawful
activity. You can have a shareholder agreement that defines what the
corporation is going to do. You can have other contracts that establish
and direct what the fiduciary duties are of directors, corporate
executives, so forth under current, existing law. This is a solution in
search of a problem. I would submit to you that this bill isn't
necessary, that there are those who see that there are all sorts of
agenda to it. I don't know about that. I won't even touch it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Iler, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Moore?? Representative Moore, I'm getting lost
among the lawyers a little bit. I need it like a fifth grader here. Is
anything stopping you and me and Representative George and others from
forming a corporation today for profit and, at some point, today or
later, forming a non-profit foundation to accomplish what we're talking
about here today? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not only, Representative Iler, is
there nothing stopping us from doing that; there is nothing stopping us
right now from having a regular C-corp, S-corp, whatever you want to
have where we want to make it as part of our mission to engage in some
purpose other than maximizing profits. There's nothing stopping us from
doing that right now. It's simply the by-laws we adopt, the shareholder
agreements, all that. There's not a thing that would prevent us from
doing it right now. This just frankly is not necessary. And so you
always have to wonder, if it's really not necessary, what's the real
story? Why is it being pushed? Members, I would encourage you to vote no
against this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, please
state your purpose [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. I would be redundant. I would not be redundant; I would be
boring your if I went through what I originally was going to say because
it's already been said by two more eloquent speakers than I. South
Carolina's a B Corporation state. To my knowledge, thirty days ago, they
didn't have any B corporations. North Carolina is a non-B corporation
state. To my knowledge, there are three B corporations presently
operating in North Carolina. Now, if they can operate here as a B
corporation, why do we have to pass this bill? B corporations become B
corporations by paying B labs twenty-five thousand dollars to certify
them as B corporations. That's all it is. And it has been stated,
anything and everything a B corporation can do can already be done
through the present corporate structures that we have. There is an
underlying reason to these B corporations. There's probably more than
one, but the most obvious one that I know of is for B labs to grow and
become the certifier throughout the United States of B corporations. We
don't need this. It's not going to help the state of North Carolina. And
I would encourage you to vote against it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady's recognized to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I disagree with
this and do not support this. As Representative Moore clearly pointed
out, there are a lot of points of law that would come up, and we're
opening a corporation to being sued now by individuals but whomever's in
it. How many of you always agree that the way to handle a particular
social problem or public purpose is the way to do it? This opens us up</p>

to offer specified coverage for autism spectrum disorders, and I said
this in committee, but you can go to the bill itself, and if the
insurance system wasn’t so complicated, you could summarize this bill in
just one sentence. It’s on page 2, line 21. It says “Every health
benefit plan shall provide coverage for the screening, diagnosis,
treatment of autism spectrum disorder”. That’s what the bill is about at
its heart. Most unlike the previous bill where there are only 14 states
that adopted it, this one the majority of the states have adopted it,
and so we’re now in a minority that doesn’t provide for this sort of
coverage. My argument for you now is that it is time for us to join the
majority on this subject. The bill that is coming before you is a
balance. I know there are some people in the chamber who would like to
see a broader bill. Are there children who could be autistic who are not
going to be covered by this bill? Yes. And then there are some in the
chamber that think either there shouldn’t be a mandate or think that
maybe this is too broad, and we have tried to address that. As my
colleague will soon… Mr. Murry will soon explain, we’ve gone through a
process and have really tried to be sensitive in terms of what the costs
might be. We’re right in the middle of the pack. This is not a generous
bill – not as generous as some would like it, certainly – and what we’re
trying to do is as Representative Murry has said several times, it’s
sort of hit the sweet spot by reaching compromises here. We need to
proceed and provide this coverage, but we need to do it in a
business-friendly way, and so the bill really reflects that, and if Mr.
Speaker  I can turn to my colleague Mr. Murry, he can proceed from
there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Murry rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman’s recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Between the House Insurance
Committee yesterday and the House Appropriations Committee yesterday, we
had strong votes in both committees and we added amendments to the
legislation to make it more palatable to our small business community.
We strengthened the opt-out provision for the small business community.
If they can demonstrate that their premiums will be impacted by greater
than 1%, they can be exempted from this legislation. The benefit cap
initially in the legislation was 75 thousand dollars annually. We
reduced it in a PCS in front of Appropriations to 60 thousand dollars,
and then an amendment was run to further reduce that to 36 thousand
dollars, which is comparable to Virginia. We additionally added an age
limit cap to age 23, which is consistent with Virginia law as well.
Additionally, any patient to qualify with this benefit must be diagnosed
by the age of eight. Additionally we added clarifications on who may
prescribe treatment, consistent with North Carolina law. There will be
several amendments offered, and there are some that we can agree to and
some that we can’t, but I would ask for individuals to consider if
you’re looking at the pro-business climate, and we’re always talking
about how we’re competing with Virginia and South Carolina, well both
Virginia and South Carolina have this coverage inclusion in their
states, and so let’s be competitive with our neighbors. Let’s add this
coverage to our families in North Carolina and be competitive with them
as well. The number of states is continually being added. There are 32
states, and I’d like to see North Carolina be 33. Texas is consistently
ranked as one of the top states for business, and Texas requires this
insurance coverage in their state as well, so I would ask that you</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does the gentleman from Person County,
Representative Wilkins rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To send forth an amendment, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The member is recognized to send forth the amendment.
The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Wilkins moves to amend the bill on page
3 by deleting lines 12 through 17 and renumbering the remaining
subsections accordingly.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The member has the floor to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, let me first direct
your attention to item L, that is the portion that I added yesterday
through amendment to square us up with Virginia. And why am I so
interested in that it's because I live on a border county. However,
staff told me today that while I was adding L, I should have taken out K
because L does exactly what it's supposed to do to match the 1% in
Virginia. So I ask you please support the amendment and true up the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake County,
Representative Murry rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ask members to support the amendment, quickly.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Member is recognized to debate the amendment, has done
so. Members, there are several lights on. Is there further discussion or
debate on the amendment? Hearing none, the question before the House is
the adoption of the A1 Wilkins amendment. So many as favor the passage
of the amendment will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. Fifteen
seconds will be allowed for voting. The Clerk will open the vote.
The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. One hundred and six
having voted in the affirmative and three in the negative, the amendment
is adopted. Now back on the bill. For what purpose does the gentleman
from Cumberland, Representative Szoka rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To offer an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The member is recognized to send forth an amendment.
The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Szoka moves to amendment the bill on
page 3, lines 23 and 24 by inserting the following between the lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The member is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ladies and gentlemen, I have several concerns with this
bill and this amendment addresses one of my primary concerns. When the
Affordable Care Act was announced by President Obama, he stated that if
you like your current healthcare plan, you'll be able keep that plan, in
effect you're plan will be grandfathered. In the Affordable Care Act,
pages 710 to 716, which I researched and read that, although we're
trying with this 1% to in effect grandfather small companies with 50
people or less, in my opinion, and I will tell you I'm not an attorney,
I'm not a lawyer, but I did read this and it seems to me that the law,
or that the bill as written will not, in fact, meet that grandfathering
clause. I checked with Blue Cross/Blue Shield, not that they knew
everything about the law, but they are one of the biggest companies in
the State, and they've told me that 95% of Blue Cross/Blue Shield North
Carolina small group plans will actually be subject to this. And that
the 1%, they'll not be exempted.
The problem I have, small business is struggling. I don't know about
your district, but I know about mine. I get calls every day from small
businesses who they're struggling. And this is another mandate. I think
that we need to stay consistent with the Affordable Care Act. Whether
you like it, whether you don't like it, it is the law. And I think we
ought to follow that act, or that law, in terms of who we chose and how
we chose to grandfather our small businesses. I ask that you would
support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion, debate on the amendment? For what
purpose does the gentleman from Wake County, Representative Murry rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Representative Szoka for offering this
amendment. I would ask members to oppose it. And for this reason. The
amendment that Representative Wilkins offered yesterday in
Appropriations, which is in the bill before you, addresses appropriately
small businesses in a similar way that Virginia does. For small
businesses in Virginia will be treated similarly to the small business
in North Carolina. If you defeat this amendment and keep the bill as is.
And so if you want to remain consistent from State to State and have
similar benefit structures from State to State, I would ask that you...</p>

purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover County, Representative
Catlin rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The member is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I urge your support of this amendment. We just passed
House Bill 649, which was an effort to mitigate the effects of the
Affordable Care Act on North Carolina's small businesses. We don't want
to just turn around a pass an expensive mandate on the struggling
businesses of North Carolina. I think it's a very good amendment and I
suggest you support it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion or further debate on the amendment?
If any members wish to debate the amendment, if you would raise your

the gentleman from Gaston County, Representative Bumgardner rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The member is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also support this amendment
as a business person. We're about to vote on a mandate and it's very
uncomfortable to stand here and be in the position of opposing, being on
the side, I'm voting on a very emotional issue. I get that. I understand
it. But this is a good amendment and this is a mandate we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion on the amendment? For what purpose
does the gentleman from Wake County, Representative Murry arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Perhaps I could say it a different way. If you want to
gut the bill, pass this amendment. Because this amendment essentially
guts the bill and if you like the Wilkins amendment from appropriations
yesterday which gives the range up to 1%, if there's a 1% premium impact
to a small business they will be exempt from this legislation if they
can prove the exemption, which is exactly what Virginia did. And so I
would ask members to oppose this amendment. Keep it consistent with or
neighbors and don't gut the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does the lady from Mecklenburg County,
Representative Cotham rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To speak briefly on the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The member is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I ask you to oppose
this amendment and vote no on it. The amendment that was added last
night in the Appropriations does strengthen the small business opt out.
I own a small business, as well. This is an emotional issue, but I do
ask you to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does the lady from Wake County,
Representative Avila rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To ask Representative Murry a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman from Wake yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Your statement earlier just
clicked and I want to ask a clarifying question. You said that the small
business has to prove a 1% increase in premium. How are they going to
justify that it's because of the autism increase on their premium and
not something else?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Based on claims data. Based on claims data in the
patient population in their small group, they will be able to prove that
because of their population, because of their small group and this new
coverage issue that the increase is due directly to the patient
population and this coverage.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford
County, Representative Blust arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To see if Representative Cotham will yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the lady from Mecklenburg yield to the gentleman
from Guildord?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Cotham, for purposes of this bill and
amendment, what constitutes a small business? How is that defined?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I'd have to yield to my colleague and friend,
Representative Murry on that. He's saying 50, which is what I believe
was in the amendment last night.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland County,
Representative Szoka arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a

[SPEAKER CHANGE] I would just like to reiterate that we already have law
that covers what we're doing here. It's called the Affordable Care Act.
I don't see why we want to go outside of that. Like it or not, that law
takes effect, well, it's in effect now. Exchanges. Everything starts the
first of January. We're in effect setting up a double standard for this
law. I just don't understand why we would want to do that because it
doesn't make sense. It's making it more difficult on small business to
comply with this law and I just ask you to vote for this amendment.

For what purpose does the lady from Randolph County, Representative
Hurley arise?

[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman has the floor to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, this is a non-adversarial amendment. Really
doesn't have anything to do with the numbers or anything in the bill.
I've talked about this with both Representatives McGrady and Murry and I
don't think they're opposed to it but I'd rather them speak for
themselves on that. I don't want to speak for them. What this does is
basically takes Section 1-G and remove everything after the first
sentence. This, by the way, I don't think part of their, I think was
part of an amendment that was added on to it, anyway. I don't think this
was, I don't know if this was original bill language or not. But the
problem I have with everything after that $36,000 per year is that it
basically gives the Commissioner of Insurance legislative power to
change this benefit and ultimately gives it to the United States
Department of Labor because their the ones who are determining this
medical inflation rate that he's going to act upon.
As I heard this talked about in committee, one of which I was a member
and one of which I was just a bystander because I had to present a bill
there. We kept saying we'll try this $36,000 limit and if we need to
come back and change it later, we can change it later. Well, we're
giving that authority and that responsibility away if we don't take this
language out. We're giving it to the Insurance Commissioner of the North
Carolina, and ultimately to the Department of Labor of the United
States. I want to ask that we keep that responsibility here in the
General Assembly and I ask you to pass this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
Seeing none, excuse me. For what purpose does the gentleman from
Henderson County, Representative McGrady rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] What the gentleman said is correct. The sponsors of the
bill support the amendment. More than just support it, it's a good
amendment. A bit of clean up that probably is needed after some
amendments that were made in committee so I urge you to support the
amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The amendment I have is very
similar to the one we heard two amendments ago. This just exempts
businesses of 50 employees or less and individual plans. It's not a
grandfather issue. This is all businesses of 50 employees or less. It
makes our law consistent with South Carolina. We've heard how we needed
to be competitive with Virginia and we fixed the bill to be consistent
with theirs. This just makes ours consistent with South Carolina for
border counties in North Carolina. It's very important for jobs. And I
ask for your support.

[CHANGE SPEAKERS]:  Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]:  I ask Members to oppose this amendment as I've
clearly discussed earlier the way we've handled this issue is the one
percent added to the small business health plan.  I will say if South
Carolina's maximum benefit is $52,000 a year so if you want
Representative Goodman to increase it to $52,000 we might be able to
agree with this amendment but otherwise if we're going to keep it low,
keep the maximum benefit low, then I think the 1% plus or minus for
small business, the 1% increase is more reasonable with the low cap that
we've got so I would ask members to oppose this amendment.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]:  Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.
 Saying not, the question before the House is the adoption of the

[CHANGE SPEAKERS]:  Ladies and gentlemen, this topic is critical.
Treatment of these children is critical. All I ask is that you recognize
the fact that the State of North Carolina has a responsibility to see
the people providing the treatment are licensed and certified in this
State.  I understand that some of these people have out-of-state
certification that may be quite valid and I honor that.  In fact, I'm
glad they can come to this State and practice their art, but we do have
a responsibility to see that they're licenses are certified as well in
this State and that's the core of my amendment.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]:  For what purpose is the gentleman from Nash County
Representative Collins rise?

[CHANGE SPEAKERS]:  Member is recognized to debate the amendment.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]:  Folks, I don't know when the last time I studied a
Bill that I wasn't planning on supporting as much as I have this one is
but this is one issue that I question not only the sponsors but the
supporters of this Bill.  The lady in the red dress who kept coming
around to all of our meetings.  She was in my office today and I asked
her about this very pointedly because this is one of the things that has
been brought up.  I think we've had a little bit of a turf war
professionally within this Bill.  Sanction 2, which Representative
Shepard introduced was designed to take care of a problem, which I think
also touches on the military problem we've been hearing quite a bit
about and that is that we don't have enough providers here in North
Carolina, especially around the military bases to take care of the
Tricare patients and so forth.  What I found out by digging and asking
some questions was that North Carolina is either the only, or one of
very few states that make these behavioral analysts operate under the
supervision of a psychiatrist or psychologist because apparently we
don't have a licensing process in North Carolina for this behavioral
analyst.  There is a Behavioral Analyst Certification Board and I
questioned this very tough because I'm in a financial field where I have
a designation that took me a long time to get because I had to take a
number of courses and pass a lot of exams and all to get it but there
are other designations I can get to put letters behind my name by going
to a weekend school and you and the public won't know the difference.
So, I asked very pointedly about this particular certification and I was
told that you have to have at least 1,500 hours of study and so forth to
get it, so it's not a bogus certification.  The problem, at least as I
see it with this amendment, is that we don't currently have a licensing
procedure apparently in North Carolina for the people that have this
national certification.  So, with that in mind, I'm not sure what you
want to do about this amendment but I don't think there is currently a
licensing process in North Carolina to take care of this.  I don't think
these Board Certified Behavioral Analysts are any the less competent for
that but I just thought you all to know that before you vote on this
amendment.

we're one of the only states that requires them to work under the
supervision of a psychologist. With that being said, this goes way back,
it wasn't something just started, and Representative Earline Parmon and
I worked with a military psych committee last session to try to address
this and we came up with a 21 page bill that basically did nothing.
Before that took place, Representative ?? also had this same language
this same bill and she hit a blocked wall I think because of control.
Because in our state the psychologist board opposes. And the point I'd
like to make is that these analysts are not practicing psychologists but
they are trained in the scope of their field and the training that they
have there is national board certified and with being national board
certified if there is a problem you can report them and have complaints
go against them. But it's a dilemma for our military people. This
afternoon I was told that the headquarters of the Marine Corps at this
time is not transferring anyone to Camp ?? that have military dependants
that have autism because of this. So it's a real issue, it's not
something that just came up, it goes all the way back to Representative
Earline Parmon, she tried to work it out, we tried to work it out in the
last session, so I ask that you oppose this amendment, thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the House, if you want to kill this bill, this is the way to
do it. WE will not have licensure for the ABA in this state for at least
two years. So if you want to kill the bill, and not have care for these
children, then vote for this amendment. I know it's a well intentioned
amendment, but if we want to have this coverage for these children, and
you heard from Representative Phil Sheppard. We have marines that aren't
even coming to our state being assigned here because they cannot even
have this ABA treatment for their children here. And the Generals have
pleased with us to please bring, please pass this legislation and get
this coverage in the state of North Carolina so tri care can cover them
here. Can have the coverage for, tricare covers them we just need to
have to be able to have that people here to do this treatment. So
please, eventually this will be a jobs bill for the state of North
Carolina. We will have these ABA specialists here in this state of North
Carolina as soon as we pass this bill to do this treatment for the
children. Please pass this bill. We will get this certification, I'm
sure. It is federal certification. We are not going to be trampling on
any of our Psychologists and Psychiatrists. This is not what it's about.
Please take care of these autistic  children and vote against this
amendment.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, I would urge
you to vote for this amendment. I remember when we did mental health
reform and we had new provider groups coming in and we had a lot of
problems. I remember talking to the director of Medicaid director, who
was then the Medicaid director saying to that person were you surprised?
And that person answered to me you know, we really were. We thought the
providers would do the right thing. We need a state level monitoring
board -
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p id="130:00">
...for the providers, these are good providers. 99 percent of them will
do the right thing, so you are always going to have some providers who
need local monitoring.  You do not need to go to a national level board
to get that monitoring done.  We can implement a licensing process for
this group faster than two years, it would not take that long.  This
bill does not say that they have to answer to any specific group, at
least at open.  This is a good amendment, it gets the process moving to
put us in the right position.  This is a patient protection amendment.
This will protect the families and the patients to make sure that the
people who are delivering these services are fully qualified and are
doing the right thing, and I urge you to vote for this amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Other professionals who have licenses in other states that require
certification and continuing education and that type of thing, have
agreements with other states that they recognize their licenses and
their ability to practice their profession in other states.  Each state
can decide whether it is going to recognize credentials from another
state, and that is all, in my opinion, that this requires.  I do not
think that this requires an extensive re-certification, re-registration,
great, big, huge licensing board established separately in this state if
someone is going to the trouble to do all this in another state. So I
think this just requires some cooperation of exchanging credentials and
getting that recognized. I think we owe that to the people who are
getting the services and to the people who are going to pay for the
services.  Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland County, Mr. Szoka,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are many things about this bill that I don't like, but one of the
things I do like is Section 2, the way it is right now. The problem with
military bases is that soldiers' families receive their insurance
through Tricare. Currently, when they're here getting Tricare, they
cannot receive... Tricare will not pay for the services that this bill
is intended to provide to these autism patients.  Somebody else said it
exactly right, if you want to kill this bill, you will vote for this
amendment.  I would urge you to vote against this amendment. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members, I rise in opposition to this
amendment. This bill is about children. It is about vulnerable children,
a very special population.  They can't wait two years, they can't wait
more. This is a group of children who we can really help better their
lives and their future here in North Carolina. And it is sad that this
amendment is about adults, and it is about companies, and maybe even
insurance providers, but this bill is about children and their families.
Those are the ones, the parents who are lobbying for this bill, so I ask
you to stand with these children and with these families in North
Carolina.  Do not kill this bill.  Do not hurt these childrens' future.
Please oppose this bill...the amendment, I'm sorry.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I hate to be historical, but I want to go back and share with you that
this didn't just start this session.  Representative Arlene Parmen[?]
tried to address this problem, and in the last session Representative
Park and I did through the Military Oversight Committee. And during all
this process, the state psychology board knew all about this, but nobody
was ever willing to come to the table and work on this. To echo what
Representative Cotham has just said, in the meantime the people that are
suffering are these children and these families. So I ask you to oppose
this amendment because we worked on this long enough. Thank You.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Murry, this is
just a quick question. When we had the discussion in here earlier on the
oral treatment cancer parity bill, there was a document that was passed
out that gave some indication of the types of impact there were on
insurance premiums on the various states where this had been enacted. Do
you have any data, any kind of idea of where this is for autism?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Yes ma’am, I do. Thank you for the question, and
if you look at our averages from the states, I believe South Carolina
and Virginia and Illinois and Indiana, some of the other states, the
average year one impact is 15 cents per member per month, and the
average year two impact was 31 cents per member per month on the premium
impact for those, for the average of the states around our area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized the debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. Member of the House, this is a bill that I have really
wrestled with hard, and it seems every session I’ll think we’ve got to
do something about these mandates. It’s adding to the cost of the
policies, it’s pricing some off the market altogether, but then you come
up with a certain mandate proposal and it’s just very difficult, and I
think we do at some point Mr. Speaker need maybe a select committee or
something to look at the overall mandates, and I wish maybe we’d weight
some against the other, but the reason I come down finally in favor of
this bill against some of my instincts is just having a three-year-old
daughter. I just can’t imagine being a parent and being in the position
of some of these parents with these children. I just, I would think
you’d just have to wonder “What do you do?” because there’s costs that
are real and children are so lovable, and I’ve read some of the emails
about how my child started out looking normal and everything was going
good, and one day something started happening, and I just think… put
myself in their place, and what do you do? What do you do if you don’t
have the money for health insurance? Because it eats you up alive. So
maybe this isn’t the right place to draw the line on mandates, and I do
admire these parents because they give these kids so much love and care
and it’s really something to watch them, and I wonder what I’d be like
if I were in that position, but I do again think we have to come to
grips at some point wit the mandates and do something about it and get
some kind of overall policy on where we’re going. One final thought: I
don’t know whatever happened to our high-risk pool. I would have thought
that that would take care of some of these situations. I thought that’s
why we debated in here so long at one point and passed a high-risk pool.
So we have to look at some alternatives at some point. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitmire, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Briefly speak in favor of the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Three simple
but very sobering facts: The average family with an autistic child
spends 75 thousand dollars out of pocket per year. Out of pocket. 86% of
those families end in divorce, mostly attributable to financial stress.
32 states in our nation have this. I ask that you support it. Thank you.

the vote to reconsider simply puts the bill back on the calendar. Rep.

deny is a continuation of the bill that we passed last session under
House 344 to serve children with disabilities.  The major difference in
this bill and current law is that current law is a tax credit and there
are a number of lower income folks who are not able to take advantage of
this situation who have children with disabilities and this will change
it into a special education scholarship grant.  We have had multiple

I understand that last year we allocated money for the tax credit and
this year we are talking about allocating money for scholarships.  Is
that the same money?

It is for the same purpose.  The money will now be a grant as opposed to
needing to apply against the income of the families who receive these
scholarships.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Gentleman yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well if this is the case, then will we need additional monies for the
tax credit that people are currently receiving and monies for the
scholarships?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No M'am, the scholarship grant takes the place of the tax credit.  We
are repealing the tax credit so that money that was going out as
expenditure will now be applied to the scholarship grant so it will not
be in addition to the previous tax credit, it is replacing it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
So, follow-up?

Folks, I am a proud primary sponsor of this bill.  We did this bill last
year, it passed out of here maybe with just a few people voting against
it.  It passed the Senate unanimously.  This year we are back with a
very similar bill that allows people who were not able to take advantage
of it, now they can take advantage of it.  This is a really good bill
because the folks that I represent, and a lot of you represent, now
because it is not a refundable tax credit, it is a grant, now will be
able to receive the tax credit. This bill is about choice, sometimes you
will hear rhetoric about that but we do believe that parents have the
right to choose the school, especially if they have a child with special
needs.  The public schools do a great job with special needs but there
are parents who are looking for choice and this gives them the ability
to do that and this gives us a grant to be able to do the same thing for
folks who are limited in income, to those who need it the most.  I urge
you to support the bill.

reimbursed for the cost of tuition in two installments, one in the first
semester, and one in the second?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, that's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Currently, do public schools offer the treatment for
children with disabilities for free?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The schools offer some treatments, yes. The ones that
they do offer are free. Many families have to go outside and provide
other services at their own cost.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But predominately children with not so severe
disabilities are dealt with in the public school system? Sorry Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They are for a large part, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to be recognized to send
forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to send forth an amendment. The
clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton moves to amend the bill on
page two, line 14, by rewriting that line to read
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Effectively, what my amendment will do is require that
the private school or the non-public school provide the same free
services that are already being provided for by the public school
system. The intent of this amendment is to protect the purpose of this
bill, which is to assist low income families with tuition support. You
will find that across the state, most private schools do not provide the
disability treatment. Treatment for ADHD, for the more moderate
disabilities, for free. They in fact charge an additional fee for
special tutoring services or special treatment. In fact, there are many
private schools throughout the state that don't even provide for an
assessment of a child. That must be paid for out of the parent's pocket,
as opposed to an assessment for a child which is provided for in the
public school system. So what this bill effectively does is protect,
again it protects the purpose of the bill, which is to provide tuition
reimbursement for low income families with, for children with
disabilities. It would require that the non-public school provide these
services at no additional cost to the parents.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker point of order. Representative Stam, please
state your point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Under Rule 43, a House amendment deleting a previously
adopted House amendment should not be in order, and it appears to be the
same line that Representative Brandon just amended. And if that's true,
it's a little hard on these computers to put them all side by side,
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The House be at ease. The chair rules the amendment
out of order. The amendment is withdrawn. Representative Jordan, please
state your purpose. Representative Goodman, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I would like to use my
get-out-of-jail-free card and change my vote on the Representative
Brandon's amendment from No to Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recorded as having voted Aye on the
Brandon amendment. Representative Insko, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To comment on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker,
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The House will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this is a really
important bill for us to be getting better and more special education
services to children who need them. This population of children is badly
underserved across the entire state. I served on the Chapel Hill ?? for
eight years and was a county commissioner and much of my time was spent
trying to get improved services for children with disabilities. The
federal government never paid the amount of money they promised they
would pay, so it's been left up to the states and local governments to
supplement those services. Unfortunately, it costs a lot more than
$3,000 a semester, or $6,000 a year, to provide an adequate and
appropriate education for these children. Many of you live in
communities, larger communities, that have special schools for children
with disabilities. And if you do that, Salem has them, Charlotte has
them, Raleigh has schools, Durham has a school</p>

<p id="160:00">
I think there's one in Asheville also, the tuition for those schools is
probably $10,000 a semester and the class sizes are four to five
students each because that's the best way for these children to learn
and to catch up. $3000 a semester will be a small down payment on the
amount of payment it will cost to send these children to an appropriate
school.
So I'm in favor of helping children with disabilities, I think we need
to be putting more money into all these programs. This bill could help
the people who have ore money, but it will not help low income parents
because they will not first of all have the money to drive their
children to school, they won't be able to get off work, transportation
will be a problem. So I would like to be able to support a bill that did
do this, this bill is not adequate to do that, I'm gonna vote against
this bill, I hope we'll have abetter bill sometime [??] ...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask representative Insko a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko I just heard you say that you
would support a bill that would do all that, I want to know did you
consider making an amendment to increase the cost, maybe making it from
$3000 to $7000 or $8000 dollars to be able to afford for low cost
students? Because I certainly would support that amendment if you wanted
to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well thank you representative Brandon. I would support
an amendment that would increase the amount of money for all the
children with disabilities that go to public schools or to private
schools, I would do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. Representative
Adams please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question, Mr. Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you representative. I think in committee when we
talked about this bill there was some discussion about the fact that the
money follows the student, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe so, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there a point where a student leaves pubic school,
goes to private school because that's what these funds will do, and they
need to come back, will the money come back?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not sure of the answer to that. Gotta ask maybe
one of the other sponsors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady wish to redirect the question to
representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I heard the question. Representative Adams this is
a reimbursement after you have paid for the tuition and the special
services on a daily basis for that semester. So they don't come back
that semester. Thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And thank you for the answer. May I speak on the bill
Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Well I needed that
clarification and I think that makes it a little bit worse for the
children that we're talking about. We're talking about the poorest, the
poorest of children which means the parents are poor. Children live in
poverty because their parents live in poverty. Now how in the world -
we're talking about a reimbursement, we're talking about the fact
they've got go spend the money first that they don't have.
And as representative Insko has said, the cost of the tuition, the money
that's being provided, $6000 dollars is not going to offset that, and
for some parents - these parents that you're talking about, 600 dollars
would probably be a problem for them to raise. So while we say that we
want to help the poorest of children, and I think that's good and I
certainly support all children, particularly children with disabilities.
But we're setting them up for failure. They're not gonna be able to
attend. They're not gonna be able to get there, they're not gonna be
able to raise the funds to offset what is going to be provided for them.
And I'll tell you, I don't even see how they're going to have it to pay
on the front end and to be reimbursed for it. Lets just be real about
this, there are some other things going on here. The money that's being
provided for the poorest of children will not help them get the
education that we say or that the bill sponsors say they want them to
have. They will not be able to - now I've researched schools all over
this state, even those in Guilford. You cannot pay for it on $6000...</p>

6000 dollars a year, but you've got to have the 6000 dollars to pay for

be able to pay the difference, but it wont be the poorest of children

my problem with the bill is even more basic than that, this money is
suppose to be going to disabled children to a private facility, but
nowhere in this bill does it say its going to address the disability,
now the public school system has had to address the disability of these
children, they've done an iup, iep and they are getting daily work done
on this, yet nowhere in this bill, when this money goes the child goes
to their private school is there any accountability for them addressing
the issues that the child or disabled child has brought with them, this
is a very very significant problem with this bill, this money could go
to tuition, but its not going toward the speech therapy, its not going
for the other therapies that the child may need and that's where i think
the major major flaw is with this bill and i cant approve it thank you
[change speaker]
representative braden speak your purpose
[change speaker]

[change speaker]
gentleman is recognized to address the bill a second time
[change speaker]
i think that people miss the whole point of what choice means, its a
mind boggling argument, to me to think that someone who has a special
need child that is looking for choice would actually take their child to
a school that is inadequate, who would do that? who in the world would
do that? if you had a child that had special needs and you knew the
services they need, why in gods name would you ever take them to a
school that didn't serve them correctly and its a false argument, please
vote for the bill

[change speaker]

[change speaker]
representative brandon does the gentleman yield?
[change speaker]
absolutely
[change speaker]
the gentleman yields
[change speaker]
representative brandon, using the scenario the representative holly just
indicated, a child that needs speech therapy, is this private school
going to provide a certified speech clinician for that child?
[change speaker]
I think that if the parent, had a child that had a speech deficiency
that was looking for a choice, would not take their child to a school
that did not have a speech therapist, it does not make sense, because
they would actually have to pay for the cost of the private school, they
might have to make up the difference of the 3000 dollars, just like
representative inscell, they might have to drive there, why in the world
would you drive to a school, pay additional cost, and not have the
services, I don't understand that
[change speaker]
representative adams please state your purpose

[change speaker]
thank you speaker thank you, i don't think that anyone has suggested
that the schools were inadequate, I'm certainly suggesting that the
pocket books of these parents are inadequate and that's the problem,
that we can set up this process and provide funds, but if they cant take
advantage of it than this bill, than what we're offering doesn't do them
any good, i believe parents are going to try and select good schools for
their children, that is not my concern, once they identify the school,
do they have the money in their pocket? if your talking about the
poorest of parents they do not, its a bad bill

This is simply to add the Bill to tonight’s calendar for consideration.
If we don’t start adding these Bills here we’re going, we’re going to be
here a long while. It only takes a majority leave to add the Bill and I
think that as a courtesy that, that’s has routinely happened. So I ask
the member, whoever objected, consider withdrawing their objection.
Seeing that, I’d ask that we add the Bill, I’d ask to be heard for a
motion.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman has withdrawn the motion. Is there further objection? So
ordered.

[Speaker Change]
I’ll yield. It’s House Bill Seven Thirty, excuse me, House Bill Seven
Thirty, titled Insurance and Healthcare Conscious Protection.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
The next Bill, Mr. Speaker, move that the House Bill Nine Eighty Two,
short title is Modify Medicaid Subrogation Statute, be added to
tonight’s calendar.

Statutory Law be added to tonight’s calendar.
[Speaker Change]
Without objection. So ordered. House Bill Seven Fifty Five, the clerk
will read. Ladies and gentlemen, the Bill was, is back before us. It was
displaced. At the time it was displaced Representative Blust motion was
before us. The lady is recognized to debate the motion. Debate the
amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. In a final appeal for your support for this
amendment. First of all I would like to address a couple of comments
that were made in the opposition to or reasons why you shouldn’t. And
first of all, I guess I need to commend Representative Stam for Apex and
their wiliness to have computers and everybody that’s needing to know
what happens in the city of Apex. But how many of you have large rural
areas where that access is not available? How many of you have sections
in your urban areas where that’s not affordable and they do not have
access? As far as Representative Ramsey asking about what we’re doing
here tonight being available only on the internet. It’s no secret we’re
in town and the doors are open for us to speak. Yet we’re trying to
introduce limitation on the notices for public hearings that will impact
people’s lives. They won’t know the meetings areas taking place. They
won’t be able to walk through the doors and make their views known. I
don’t think that’s what we want to do. The stated goal here tonight is
to save money. That may be part of it. However there seems to be an
ulterior motive driven by the natural tension that exist between the
government and the press. As been reflected in some recent exchanges
here in the General Assembly. To legislate anything here based on
pettiness or paranoia, seeking revenge belittles the position we hold.
As the ultimate source of all government funding, whether it’s Federal,
State, or Local, through their taxes or their fees, our citizens are
entitled to and should demand the fundamental obligation of openness and
honesty from the people they elect. The button we push tonight is not
going to be about saving our tax payers money. The button you push
tonight is going to tell the citizens of North Carolina how important
you think they are as participants in their own government. Please
support the amendment. Thank you.

...Speaker, on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Member, I recently circulated, if you've been on your email accounts, a
message from Secretary Skvarla, the department and the secretary support
this amendment.  This is a bill about giving notice.  Despite what
you've heard from the press, this isn't about newspapers, although it
clearly is about money.  Western Union thought sending messages by wire
was their mission.  No, they forgot they were about communication.  The
railroads thought they were about moving people and cargo by rail; but,
no they almost lost it, too.  They were about transportation.  This is
about notice.  There's no ulterior motives here. This is a pilot
project.  The bill has been narrowed with time and in fact it's an
effort to expand notice, not limit it.  Fact:  circulation of newspapers
are plummeting.  Fact:  a lot more people, particularly those younger
than us, are receiving their notices, their communications,
electronically.  How do we know if we can do notice better if we're not
even willing to run a pilot project?  There are only four classes of
notification here, out of all the notices that one department of state
government is offering.  And you're telling me that we can't run a pilot
in that way?  How long is it we're gonna [sic] wait until we begin to
look at this?  I urge you to defeat the amendment, and then vote for the
bill.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  And, ladies and gentlemen, we had a very
lengthy debate on this bill earlier today in committee. I just wanted
again by reminding the members of this chamber that our North Carolina
state constitution states in Article I, Section 13, that no human
authority shall in any case whatever control or interfere with the
rights of conscience.  This bill attempts to do that. It attempts to
protect individuals from--from violating their consciences.  We
discussed at length the nature of the fact that many folks in North
Carolina have differing views, and one of the speakers this morning
opposing the bill mentioned that some of these issues are not very
controversial; and really, indeed, they are--[end of data...]</p>

&lt;h3&gt;
to not put folks in the position of having to violate their consciences
on these controversial issues. So, just take you briefly through the
bill. The first section adds health care provider to the protections for
individuals in the health care community form being required to perform
abortions or engage in any type of medical activity that will end in an
abortion. So we've done that. The latter portions of the bill, the
latter two sections of the bill, the first of the two, really is
essentially the opt-out provision from the mandate for providing
abortions under the health plan offered through affordable care act.
This is expressly authorized by federal law, so we've just taken that
and we're doing that. The 2nd of the two mirrors the ?? at the federal
Hide Amendment and essentially says that local tax dollars cannot be
used to provide for abortions in health insurance plans for local city
and local employees. I would ask that the members support the bill, this
is a good thing for the conscience rights of North Carolinians. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr., Speaker. This bill takes an enormous step
backward for the reproductive rights of the women of North Carolina.
Right now more than 90% of health plans have the ability, women have the
ability to use their insurance to cover abortion. It's a choice, it's a
legal choice. Women pay co-pays for their insurance with their private
insurers, and they have a right to be able to get the full panoply of
health care options. If private insurers, not for religious reasons, but
for these other moral reasons or their own choice, want to deny those
rights to women, they are imposing their own views on captive employees.
And that is just wrong. Moreover, that conflicts with federal law. And a
federal judge in Missouri just ruled that the affordable care act
preempted private insurers decisions to do that. So my friends, you are
setting yourselves up for another abortion lawsuit. Track records so far
from this House of Representatives in the last couple of years, three
laws stricken or held up, as unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if Representative Ross will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
These lawsuits you're talking about, at what stage are those? Were those
just the district court? Have any of those even made it to the circuit
court yet? We're only 2 years into this and these things take a while to
weave their way completely through the courts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, so far they are at the district...most of them are
at the district court though the 4th circuit has been very clear on the
choose life license plate. So, there we go. But while they're going up,
tax payers dollars are being used. And they're being used really to try
to deny women the rights that they have. Their Constitutional right to
be able to have an abortion because certain people oppose women
exercising that right. Nobody here wants people to have to have an
abortion. But when you need to have a procedure like that and a woman
and her doctor choose to have it, it is best to have it in the safest
possible way, and if women have a health care provider that provides it
if insurance companies are willing to cover it, that is the safest, most
affordable way to do it. And this bill does everything it can to deny
that option to women. And all I can say is that women will remember how
you vote. Please vote no.

[Speaker changes.] ...Representative Insko moves to amend the bill on
page two, lines 20 through 27 by rewriting the lines to read:
[Speaker changes.] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker and I understand the line
pages have been changed...the...the line numbers, this is Section 2A...I
believe it's section 2A.  The patient...you all probably know that the
patient protection and affordable care act forbids the use of tax
dollars to fund abortions. That's a restriction on how tax dollars are
used. We may not always deci...agree on how the tax dollars should be
used but I think we all agree that that's an appropriate decision for
legislators...for elected officials to make. What's the best use of tax
dollars? This language goes a lot further and makes it virtually
impossible for any woman who buys insurance through the state exchange
to obtain a policy that includes comprehensive, reproductive healthcare,
including access to a legal abortion. This language restricts a woman's
right to make her own decision...an independent, freewill decision that
she believes is in her own best interest. Controlling decisions a woman
can make about her own health is a very big step beyond making a
decision about how to use tax dollars. Elected officials are not
expected to limit anyone's right to make their own decisions about
legal, comprehensive healthcare insurance.  My amendment replaces the
language in this section with the language that exists in the federal
affordable care act, restricting the right of any tax dollars to be used
through the exchange in any way for the use of abortions. It limits it
to just that so I hope that you will vote...please vote for my amendment
and don't further restrict a woman's right. We don't have the right to
do that...to impede a woman's right to make her own decisions. Vote for
the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Gentleman is recoznized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker, Members of the House...I have put on
your desk an excerpt from the affordable care act and probably it was
being passed..out...while Representative Insko and Ross were talking so
they probably didn't see it but if you'll go to the page that at the top
left says HR3590. This is a provision in that act which gives this body
the power to do what it's just about to do. Look at there...and it's
signed by Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden and Barack Obama and it says, a state
may elect to prohibit abortion coverage in qualified health plans,
offered through an exchange in such state if such state enacts a law to
provide such prohibition. It's right there...black and white...I
could've had the whole bill but that was 2000 pages so I just picked out
the relevant page. And then...so I don't hafta speak on the rest of the
bill...if you turn to the next page, this is...this particular law is a
couple years old but it's the same today as it was then.  The
DEWINE?????? amendment, the same standards in the federal employee
health plans that are proposed in this bill, signed by Barack Obama, Jos
Biden and Nancy Pelosi.

Offer through an exchange, referring to the exchange portion of the
affordable care act. I thought we refused to set up an exchange earlier
this year. Does this apply to that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We did not set up
a state exchange, but there is a federal exchange and the bill, the
affordable care act specifically, consciously, negotiated with Burt ??,
I think was his name, to stick this in the affordable care act to get
enough people to vote for that bill, so that it would pass. So, yes, we
can take action here to effect coverage in the federal exchange for
policies offered in North Carolina. And many ?? states have done this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield
for a follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So are we participating in the federal
exchange? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The federal exchange will operate in North
Carolina, I don't know that we're participating in it, but it's gonna
happen here because there is isn't a state exchange. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Deborah Ross, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. It is
absolutely true that the state could pass this law. The portion of this
that says that people can't get abortion coverage under the exchange.
Many states have done it, most states have not. And the reason why
states have not done it, is because they understand that if women pay
for their own insurance under the exchange, which is what you have to
do, that women should be able to select the kind of health care coverage
they want to get. Rather than having the state choose it for them. Women
are smart, they're the primary health care consumers for their families
and themselves. And what this part of the bill says, is that you just
don't respect a woman's right to make that decision, that you know
better for her, and so you're going to double, triple, quadruple the
price of an abortion. The result and consequence of that, they're gonna
be two results. One, they're gonna be a lot of women who are gonna be
hoppin' mad at you for doing it, and the second is gonna be that they
may resort to less safe abortions and that will be on your conscious.
Representatives Insko's amendment avoids both of those things, I
encourage you to vote for it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak very briefly on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just find it very ironic that people who
have voted for two health care mandates over the last week suddenly want
everybody to have freedom and not be mandated as to what's in their
health care, I hope we'll vote against this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the

affirmative.  12 in the negative.  The amendment passes.  Representative
Adams please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Speak on the Bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The lady is recognized to debate the Bill as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  You know, women who seek abortion care may face if
this Bill goes through high out of cost pocket expenses for these
services and many perhaps will have to postpone the abortion care while
attempting to raise the funds and so, as you've heard, the delay may
exacerbate both not only the cost for these services but also the risks
for the procedure.  I said this morning in Committee when this Bill
surfaced and this part of the Bill came up very suddenly, it was not
disclosed to the public as to what was in this Bill, this portion was
added, so people did not really have an opportunity to not only prepare
a response but they were basically left in the dark.  And when I look at
the fact that we're talking about religion as sort of an underlying
emphasis for this Bill, as a Christian, I am really appalled that we are
using religion as a license to discriminate against women because that's
exactly what this Bill does.  A woman who decides to end the pregnancy
deserves access to safe, legal care for the procedure.  So taking away
the coverage, and that's what we're trying to do.  You take away the
coverage that does not reduce the need for abortion.  It only create a
barrier, as you've heard, for women to have a safe medical procedure and
care that they need and, of course, it's going to force some women to
resort to some drastic measures.  We've heard about the dark houses and
that's perhaps what we're going to have.  It's wrong for us to deny
coverage for a legal medical procedure just because some people are
opposed to that procedure.  That is blatantly unfair and it is very
unrealistic for us to believe that by eliminating an opportunity to
women to have this as a part of their health insurance that we're going
to solve at least a problem that you think exists.  Now, we started out
with this Bill eliminating contraceptive services and I'm pleased that
we made some adjustments with that, and I just wanted to let you know
that there are some companies that provide contraceptives for men who
have various dysfunctional problems and so Viagra and those other kinds
of things are provided, so I'm glad that we took another look at that.
But, we need to come to grips with the fact that abortion is legal and
in some instances it is needed, and for us to single out women, again we
are discriminating based on gender and that is grossly unfair and this
is just a series of Bills again coming through this General Assembly
through this House that ultimately wants to get at eliminating legal
abortion in this State altogether.  That's exactly what we're trying to
do.  There are a series of Bills coming, there are a series of Bills we
are already seeing and that is the ultimate goal and we need to be
realistic about it.  Women deserve the same opportunities, the same care
for their health as we afford to men and we need to be mindful of the
fact that we are continuing to discriminate based on gender.  That is
unfair and it's ungodly too.

Bill is amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes members, I'm concerned that we could be setting up
a double standard. For men there's currently insurance coverage for
Levitra, Viagra and other medications for erection problems. Yes, there
are. So women can't determine for themselves what to do with their
bodies when they become pregnant and other issues arise? I'm a woman, I
decide everything what to do for myself. When it comes to making a
decision like that and a whole lot of other women out here in this
world, that's between their doctor and their selves. It's a personal
decision and their families, it's personal.
In this bill there's no mention of exemptions for pregnancies from
incest or rape. This is personal. It's between the doctor and their
families, it's personal. So what are we going to say to the women that
are raped? What do we say to the women that suffer the incest and may
not have the income to raise a child? Could be very young. What options
are they going to have? It also says in the bill that as a nurse if
someone comes and needs help after an abortion, it could be botched,
they could be hemorrhaging, that I possibly as a nurse should not
perform those services to assist. That's what it says in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] As a health care provider - I do not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If the lady will allow the chair to direct the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. As a woman, as a nurse, anyone
that comes to me for care no matter what it is required for service I
would not turn them away. Abortion or not. It does not matter. Whatever
the healthcare need is, that is what we are to provide. We are not to
turn people away. Thank you.

facts don't change of what we're doing. Those who would say they're
opposed to abortion by this bill and the actions contained therein only

decision, and by removing their doctors and making counseling and care

Blust and I actually have filed a bill to right this wrong, to right
this injustice because what happens is people who are just the slightest
bit negligent can’t recover anything in North Carolina, even if the
person or the industry that injured them is 99% negligent, and we have
had sob stories from people who were slightly over a line and got hit by
somebody, a drunk driver, and couldn’t recover anything. So these kinds
of lawsuits don’t happen in North Carolina, the kind that this bill is
trying to prevent. Moreover, the sponsors of the bill couldn’t cite one
case that had been filed. I represent probably more restaurants and bars

Required be at the school. That shouldn't be. Y'all may have received a
communication from A-R-C, ARC, giving the reasons why this is not
possible or not a good idea, is a lot of parents even in public school
today they get some of their special ed services in the public school
and they go out and buy them elsewhere. So we want the parents to have
the freedom, I'll just give the example because it was very similar to
one that was asked for Representative Brandon. You may have a child that
has a speech problem and that child may want to go to ABC school and
then every afternoon after school go get those speech services for a few
minutes or a half hour, just whatever, in a private clinic. And this
amendment would prohibit that, and the sponsors of this bill very much
ask you to defeat this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative Hamilton a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton is there anything in your
amendment that requires that the services to be provided at the
location?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No. Thank you for asking the question Representative
Insko, I was going to address that myself. It does not require the
services be provided at the school physically at the non-public school
location, but that the non-public school not charge any additional fees
or tuition associated with the special services for the child, therefore
protecting the tuition reimbursement for the child that the bill is
intended to provide.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam is recognized to debate the
amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time. Mr. Speaker on line six
required by the students [??] on a daily basis from the non-public
school. We debated this almost three hours in the three committees to
which this was sent. So each of you heard it and one and in some cases
two and for some of you you heard it three times. Every single objection
in those committees was not really to the bill but to the existing law.
And Representative Hamilton again wants to change existing law to make
what we have less useful for the people who need it and use it. What the
bill does is to make the existing program possible for those of lower
income.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I'm - I will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the speaker a question Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, I still don't agree with your
interpretation. I understand that students do take field trips, they go
to Moorehead planetarium and they are receiving the services there. It's
off site, it's still a service. It's provided by the school. So can you
correct me if I'm wrong about that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can. This amendment requires that the special
education related services be received from the non-public school.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The existing law - let me finish my answer and then
I'll be glad to accept the follow up. Existing law does not require
that. Existing law says that you can be reimbursed for tuition and/or
special education related services. And for your information related
services is not just some vague term, it is a term of [??] and it's four
pages in the federal register. So we know - everybody in the field knows
what those are. And I just want you to know that the Disability Rights
groups very much oppose your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to I guess debate the amendment with the speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment a
second time, the speaker up here or the other person who spoke, he spoke
but he's not actually the speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. I think we have a
difference of opinion on interpretation here. I'm happy to send forth
some perfecting language to make sure that everyone understands that you
don't have to actually have the treatment on campus. The intent of the
amendment is to make certain that the non-public school provides the
services at no additional fee or tuition cost to the students.</p>

Speaker1:   House bill 683 for xx reading.
Speaker changes:  xxxx North Carolina Act.
Speaker changes: Representative Blackwell is recognized to read the
amendment.
Speaker changes: Representative Blackwell moves to amend the bill, on
page one , lines 24- 31 by rewriting those lines to read.
Speaker changes: Representative Germanio  is recognized to explain the
amendment.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker. I basically am in agreement with
the thrust of the proposed bill; I just think that there is a definite
sense in which the bill in an effort to protect businesses, not just
small businesses, but large manufacturers , anybody that is essentially
engaged in dealing with food, that it perhaps goes overboard ,this
amendment would two things that I think would improve the bill and make
it more reasonable. First of all as the bill currently defines knowing
and willful conducts, it doesn’t just require that there be an intent to
deceive or injure xx or actual knowledge that conduct be injurious in
order to be knowing and willful. First you have to prove a violation of
some State or Federal law regulation has occurred. The combination of
all those requirements xx seems to me pretty much a hurdle which nobody
is going to get over which I suppose was the intent but I am not sure if
it is fair to consumers. So the first thing that this does would be to
eliminate the requirement that you have to show a violation of State law
or Federal law regulation in order to for it to be knowing and willing
conduct. The second thing that this is primarily with respect to xx
item,[ throwing light??] line 9 of the amendment. It says that conduct
that is committed with any of the three things that are listed there;
the first two items are in the bill, the third item which added is that
if the conduct was committed with reasonable intent to know that they
would xx there was a reasonable probability of injury to consumers. If
we don’t add that line with which essentially what it says is the
consumer is out of law work if the food processor, manufacturer whatever
who engages in conduct for which he has reason to know presents a
reasonable probability not just a possibility of injury; but because he
doesn’t have actual knowledge, that it’s  going to be injurious, then he
is off the hook. I think that this is a more balanced approach and I
would urge the House to xx the amendment.
Speaker changes: Representative Brown, please state your purpose.
Speaker changes: To debate the amendment.
Speaker changes:  The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker. I certainly appreciate
Representative Blackwell’s attempts to make an amendment, but
unfortunately I do believe it weakens the intensity of the bill and
would encourage the members to vote against the amendment. Thank you.
Speaker changes:  Further discussion and further debate on the
amendment. Representative Moore please state your purpose.
Speaker changes: Briefly debate the amendment.
Speaker changes:  The gentleman is recognized debate the amendment.
Speaker changes: Mr. Speaker,  I wasn’t going into this at all, but  I
supported this bill and I will support it but I will just point out this
amendment is a measured way to do it; it’s no use getting into the full
xx of     negligence clause that applies in this State about comparative
contributing , it’s not that but I would like to tell Representative
Brown who I did support that I did support your bill, and I will support
your bill whether the amend passes or not.  XX I don’t think this
amendment hurts your bill, I don’t think…   and I think it’s fine. It
seems a xxx amendment, it seems fine.
Speaker changes: xxx
Speaker changes: Representative xxx please state your purpose.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker, I guess I need to direct this
question to Representative Moore as the attorney.
Speaker changes: Representative Moore ,  does the gentleman yield?
Speaker changes: She is asking me questions xxx bill?
Speaker changes:[Laughs]
Speaker changes: How are you?
Speaker changes:  The third point what says to know there is a
reasonable probability for injury, very obvious that we know whether
there is reasonable degree of certainty that if anyone over indulges,
whether it’s in corporates or McDonalds or anything? And xxx the kind of
results that we are hearing about an obesity .</p>

<p id="250:00">
And things of that nature. Does that not kind of loosen up and open up
possibilities under the law?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I could probably be an expert witness on too many big Mac’s but,
that being said I don’t think, I really don’t think it weakens the Bill,
I mean it’s, I agree completely with what Representative Brown is trying
to do on his bill. People should not be able to go in and sue a
restaurant for bad choices. If you go in and eat a double Quarter
Pounder and fries every day and show up with heart disease you really
shouldn’t be surprised. And we can’t, we can’t make the folks who are
the manufacturers or the store owners or whatever responsible for
peoples bad health choices. I don’t believe this amendment undoes what
he’s trying to do I really don’t. If somebody can show me where I’m
wrong I’ll stand to be corrected, but I think this bill just kind of
puts a little bit of measured balance in it. I applaud what
Representative Brown’s trying to do, but I do think this is just a good
balance.

Representative Hardister said was put together with his agreement, the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Question for Representative
Hardister.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Hardister, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Representative.  When we had this bill in
committee, I asked about if you knew whether public schools borrowed
funds for operations.  Have you, do you have an answer for that now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I believe the answer for traditional public schools
is no.  I think they’re appropriated for funds that would address what
you’re talking about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does the gentleman yield?  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The bill says that the charter schools would be
permitted to borrow funds.  Do I understand that you could also use the
state funds to pay the loans back?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  This is for operational costs.  For example running
water, electricity, any type of maintenance or what it takes to operate
a charter school.  That’s what that applies to and this is currently
taking place.  It’s not clarified in our laws that charter schools can
borrow money.  Some banks are lending, some banks are not.  This just
puts it in law that charter schools can borrow money for operational
expenses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Hardister, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Representative Hardister.  I got a letter
from my public schools today and I just want to clarify this.  She says
that there are problems with the proposal because they’re sharing
funding with charter schools out of special purpose funds that are
restricted use and such as pre-kindergarten, ROTC, which charter schools
do not have these programs and they have been litigated before.  Could
you clarify that please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes ma’am.  The amendment that Representative Horn
ran and took care of that and that provision is now out of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Robert Brawley please state your
purpose.

This morning there was a question asked, does it give rights and the
bill sponsor said no but it does and down below it tells you the rights
that are given to them. I know there's others that I think are gonna
speak as you mention on the back here if you will notice, there is
Representative Faircloth and Representative Alan McNeil and
Representative Daughtry that we oppose the bill and I would just take
you're consideration and vote no, red. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative ?? please state your purpose [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lady is recognized to debate the bill [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and
gentlemen, we have employees as deputies and police officers who face a
lot of danger on our part and we are saying here that when they see
flagrant fraud and abuse that we're not gonna offer them protection.
Protection of their jobs. Cuz they face somewhat of a unique situation
if they ever get fired for whatever reason, their career is pretty
ruined because they will be black listed and it will be very difficult
for them to find work in any other location in the profession that they
love. So I would suggest that we offer them the same protection that we
offer state patrol and as we've seen works well for our state employees
as well, ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative McNeil please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir, I appreciate the comments that ?? just made I
totally disagree with you. Article 7 section 2 of the North Carolina
constitution says in each county a sheriff shall be elected by the
qualified voters thereof at the same time as members of the general
assembly. A sheriff is a constitutional officer, ok. We're not talking
about police chiefs here we're talking about sheriffs. If a sheriff does
something wrong he can be sued in court both personally or
professionally, either one ok. Article 1 section 9 of the constitution
also allows for ?? elections. So if a sheriff does something wrong he is
gonna have to answer for it at the ballot box. Also general statute
153A-103 reads, each sheriff and register of deeds elected by the people
has the exclusive right to hire, discharge, and supervise the employees
in his office. So a sheriff has a statutory right that very other few
people have to discharge his employees. Our court systems work just
fine. I won't state the county but a county in North Carolina recently
settled a $96,000 law suit filed by a deputy that was discharged. He
sued, he wont. And if you want to google other deputies that have sued
for being discharged, you can just go right ahead and google it. There
are several of them out there. As a matter of fact there is one county
west of here, rather large county, that I think was sued three times in
one year for discharging deputies and those cases I think are still
pending in court. So I think there is plenty of remedies out there
already. If someone doesn't like what a sheriff does, they are welcome
to take them to court. I don't think we need this statute. This statute
would have a chilling effect on sheriff's offices and police chiefs. It
would set them up for situations where every time they wanted to
discharge an employee, it would set up a whole layer of bureaucracy that
would probably grind the sheriff's office or hurt the sheriff's ability
to run his office.  I just think it's a bad bill and I think you should
oppose it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Goodman please state your purpose

...recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don't think I could say any
better what I have to say than what Representative McNeill just said. So
I would just say let's vote against this bill. Our sheriffs and chief of
police do a good job and we don't need to pass this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] See if Representative Dollar will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dollar, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dollar, I think it's page 1, lines 17
through 25, and even going further it says what the statement of policy
is and what can be reported. How true to get this protection, how true
does the report of some kind of defalcation covered by this bill have to
be? What if it's found out later it wasn't true, what's the standard of
proof? Does something have to ultimately be established in court? I mean
it's easy to say we want a whistle-blower to report bad things, but how
do you protect a false charge from being made, for instance?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] There is protection for that and it does have to be
true. And of course what you have is you have the employee who has to
come to Superior Court and be able to carry their burden in this manner.
And I would just point out in that regard, Representative Blust, that
ALE agents, SBI agents, the Highway Patrol, the officers with the
Department of Correction, probation, parole officers, they have all been
under this protection for almost 25 years. It hasn't created additional
bureaucracy. It's been good government in North Carolina and it will be
good to extend this protection to those men and women who put their
lives in danger every day.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Faircloth, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, members of the
House. We got to take a little trip, we got to go back a ways and look
at things that have happened over the years. There have been attempts
many times since back in the 50's, 60's, 70's and on up to the present
day, when the union movement has tried to reach into North Carolina and
particularly into its law enforcement agencies. My first job as the
chief of police came in 1972 or '74, I'm sorry. And one of the first
things I faced was a test from a group of law enforcement officers, part
of which represented or were with the agency I was chief of. And some of
whom were from other agencies. And they came in a group to sit down and
tell me basically how I was going to run my department and how I was
going to treat them if they had a complaint and what have you. They
didn't succeed at what they tried. I ran the agency the way a manager is
supposed to run an agency. And a professional police chief is going to
do that or a professional sheriff is going to do that.
Are there bad folks out there running agencies, you're doggone right
there are. And I'm not sure I would run the flag of the State of North
Carolina up as being lily white and some of the problems its had over
the years. It's not the best example in the world. I don't know of any
officer, if he knew something illegal was going on in his department or
the department he worked in, whether he was a rookie cop or whether he
was a 25 year veteran. If he went to his district attorney and said I've
got to talk to you about something that's wrong in my department, he
would find an open door and he would find somebody who would listen to
him and he would find somebody who, along with him, would root out the
corruption in that department. There are ways that it can be done within
a proper management structure in North Carolina, we do not need people
coming in with pseudo unions and trying to take over our local police
departments and sheriff agencies and I urge you in the name of good law
enforcement and professional law enforcement officers, to vote against
this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Cotham, please state your purpose.</p>

<p id="275:00">
Thank you mr speaker, to spea on the bill.
THe lady is recognized to speak on the bill
Thank you, I want to keep this brief because we are all tired and it has
been a long day. Just wnted to say I dont think I could say antyhing
better than what the previous reps have said, the goal of this bill is
to root out corruption in north carolina govt. We have heard this
statement at various levels our governor has spoke about making sure our
govt is open and honest. The goal of this bill is very  simple; its and
anti retaliation protection that our law enforcement already has so why
shouldnt others have it? its a simple whistleblower law. many are trying
to make a big deal out of this and make a mountain out of a molehill and
that is simply not the case and so I ask you stand for law enforcement
and police and for good govt so I ask for your support.
REp Mceil state your purpose
I wish to debate the billa  second time. Ldies and gents of the body I
was a 32 year law enforcement at the sheriffs office. I have seen a lot
come and go in those days. We had the state bureau of investiagion, we
had the FBI investigate our officers. Not many years ago the
constitutional amendment was passed to change who could run for
sherriff. THere are many avenues to deal with corruption whether it be
at a sheriff office or a police dept. We have enough there and this is
unneccesary bill and it is a union in sheeps clothing.
Rep Bowles state your purpose
Debate the bill as second time. If I could ask the rep hurley a
question. IT was mentioned by rep mcneil from randolph that the sheriff
was elected and so was the clerk and they appoint their employees. Would
you follow under this?
We served at will and pleasure of clerk. So when I was fired I wouldnt
think about retaliating or anything
Dahler state your purpose
Speak a second time. I will be very brief. If whistleblower protection
and protecting our employees/law enforcement from being able to report
corruption in state govt to report fraud in abuse. IF that leads to
unionization why hasnt that lead to unionization of state employees that
last 25 years? it hasnt, because thats not what it is about. It is about
providing protection to rank and file law enforcement officers so they
arent caught in a vice and can feel free to report and the burden of
proof is on them. These are professionals lets treat them that way and
extend the same protections to retaliation we do our state law
enforcement officers.
Rep Horn state your purpsoe
Debate the bill. Several people in this chamber have worn a uniform.Some
of those uniforms have had a badge, some have had stripes and things on
the collar. All of you who did wearn the uni that when you put the uni
on you gave up your traditional civilian rights. You have to know when
you put on a uniform you have to you may be doing some things you might
not</p>

<p id="280:00">
Wanna do, but you depend on those above you to make those kinds of
decision. It sounds great it sounds like a great idea these guys deserve
the protection and opportunity to root out corruption or mouth pieces.
THere are processes in place in any uniformied organization for you to
pursure that issue, or any issue. They arent always easy but neither is
wearing a uniform either. Youve worn a uniform, youve worn a uniform,
youve alot of us in here and there were times we were told to do things
we didnt like and they were wrong except we didnt kinow the rest of the
story. So i ask you to give that consideration, a paramilitary
organiazation is not a civilian org. There are different rules,
different expectations and theres a different mindset. I could not be
more strongly in support of the guy on the beat, on the street the guy
that works the mids and swings and all the rest of them. The guy puts
his life on the line and Ive been there when you knoc on the door at 3

extend the same protections to those men and women on the frontlines
even tonight as we speak, protection against any retaliation if they
become aware of fraud abuse vioatlions of state law and they wish to
report that to the appropirate authorities so someone can act. Lets
extend to those professionals that same protection against retaliation
we extended aomost 25 years ago to highway patrol and other uniformed
state employees. Its good govt and I would appreciate your support.

Rep Starr the chair understands you yield your time to rep fairqua
thank you mr speaker I wont beleauger this. We have talked about it and
we know how everyone feels about this. Ill tell you this there is nobody
anywhere in any business that is watched more than the leader of a law
enforcement agency. There are no better employees than great police
officers and sheriff deputies. THey are wonderful people, there is a
rotten apple once in a while but in most cases the apple is found fast.
Its hard to keep secrets between officers and they are not gonna stand
around and be beaten down by someone who is lording over them. Do not
make the mistake of thinking this is somethign thats just gonna help
some officers.</p>

Speaker, I'm getting a little bit more concerned by adding to tonight's
calender, particularly something that has come back from the senate that
we really haven't had a chance to sit here and make a decision on. I
don't see why we can't do it tomorrow when we've had an opportunity to
at least try to get a look at it. We don't know where we're going.
[speaker changes]
Representative Michaux, the reason the chair is going to urge the body
to take this up, we think it will be disposed of very quickly and pass
out of the house by very large margins. It came back from the senate by
very large margins and it is a matter that we would like to go ahead and
dispose of.
[speaker changes]
Mr. Speaker, may I debate the motion briefly?
[speaker changes]
The--
[speaker changes]
Just for the members that benefit. This bill passed our chamber 112 to 2
and 48 to 0 on the senate. And it is a time sensitive bill which is the
only reason this particular one was being added tonight. And so, it's
one of those that was not deemed to be very controversial. If it was, we
wouldn't be adding it on, but it is time sensitive and
[speaker changes]
I would add, Representative Michaux, that this is only 1 of 2 bills</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, this is a time-sensitive issue House Bill 484
pertaining to the wind permitting process that passed this House 112 to
2, in the Senate 48 to nothing.  There was some technical issues made on
the bill to extend some of the permitting timeframes.  I’ve talked with
the rest of the bill sponsors and everyone is in agreement and we ask
for your support tonight.  Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I just asked the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bell, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I support your bill.  I just wanted to learn a little bit more
specifically about what permitting, the changes in the permitting
schedule.  If you don’t mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There were some issues there that the wind and energy people brought to
us about some of the timeframes were a little too close to the
permitting process. This would give them a little more time, I think
about two weeks to get their ducks in a row before they proceed with the
permitting process.  It was nothing that affected the intent and all
parties involved were in favor of this.

Further discussion?  Further debate? If not, the question before the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Members of the House, it’s late.  I will be
brief.  House Bill 695 is focused on families in the general areas of
statute 1550 A to prevent the application of foreign laws that might
violate a constitutional right of a person.  Six states have pioneered
this path.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitmire?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will yield for a minute.  The chair would like to extend
the courtesies of the floor to thank you for Representative Cotham for
service throughout the day and we wish you well. The gentleman has the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.  Anyway, six states have enacted very similar
legislation.  It’s withstood the test of time without challenge. It’s a
bill that – it’s proven.  It protects our constitutional rights,
especially of that of women and minorities. It also reinforces the
constitutional basis on which our freedom enterprise system is founded.
Again, I suggest you support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.

To see if Representative Whitmire would yield for a question.

Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Whitmire, has this been a problem in North Carolina anywhere?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, not yet. We have at least 27 states, 27 cases in
multiple states where it has.  The most egregious cases have been cases
such as custody and divorce.  And absolutely, it has. We don’t want it
here. That’s the purpose.

Follow up.

states because some other states have done it.... Explain what the
problem is and maybe it's worth voting for, but to me to run after other
states because Missouri passed it or some other bill passed it seems
like a wrong way to go. I urge you to vote against this. End our
evening, not by bothering with foreign laws or whatever. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I've been trying to tell this body all
since we've been here that we have two constitutions by which we live:
our Constitution of North Carolina and the United States Constitution.
And both guarantee our rights to live under those constitutions. The
only way that we can become subject to any foreign constitution is by
some kind of treaty or pact that might be which has been entrusted under
our constitution by those bodies. This, to me... Here we are at 11:20 at
night trying to pass a feel-good bill. A bill, just looking at it,
really doesn't mean anything, because you've got the protections.
They're already there. So you just don't need it. Why, why... We just
don't need this. I feel, except when I get threatened around here
sometimes, I feel pretty good because of the constitutions that we live
under, and I'm protected by them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Deborah Ross, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill's sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire, this came through Judiciary
C?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, it did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did anybody from the family law section of the Bar
Association or the Bar Association give an opinion on what they thought
about this, because usually if we're going to amend the laws in a
particular area, they'll come to the committee and let us know what
their position was. Did you hear from them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, we did, Representative Ross. Would you like me to
elaborate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, may I ask another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What did they have to say?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill was pushed out to multiple agencies,
including the Bar Association. We finally got something actually
substantive that showed their concerns in areas. You have at your
station two handouts. One of which...</p>

Shows their concerns and in the bold print some very thorough rebuttals
that includes multiple case law cases, it's thorough. They are yet after
several requests to further address. Today what we heard in judiciary C
was there spokesperson who - not to make little of the message that they
brought, was brought purely by a messenger and from the standpoint of
being able to answer any further questions, they were not. And again,
the other handout, further and in a much more concise manner address the
two key things that were mentioned today. So that is the response that
we continue to wait and that's a very thorough response. Please look at
it if that's of any interest to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask another question Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Who prepared the response?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As far as any single person that put the response in
there is one primary individual and but that also had reached back to
several others who contributed, and then as far as reviewing it, it got
reviewed here. Do you need a name or  just if it's one person or many?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well you can give the one person and if there was an
organization involved that would be nice to know too, but I just would
like to know who prepared it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The name of the primary individual , the subject
matter expertise legal counsel is Mr. Steven Jillay [SP] with the
security policy council.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, as you know the house is getting long and
Representative Shaw had made a statement. May I pose a statement to the
bills sponsor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir this is your bill. The house is now getting late
and I'd appreciate if you would follow some [??] or recommendation and
representative Dollar please, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On behalf of all the members of the body the chair is
happy to extend the courtesies of the floor to Representative Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir I move the previous question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative has moved the previous question, all
those in favor vote aye, all those opposed vote no, the clerk will open
the vote. The clerk allot machine record the vote. 70 having voted in
the affirmative, 30 in the negative, the motion passes by rule. The
minority has a period of up too three minutes, Representative Hall. The
house will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I have out of the greatest
respect for my colleagues reserved my time during these three minute
periods or given it to other members so they would have an opportunity
to speak. Unfortunately I am going to take a couple minutes of this time
and I'd appreciate you all's indulgence on this particular matter
because it gets to be kind of important when we have these matters come
before us. And I know everyone wants to go home, the hour is late but at
the same time we have a very important matter and this might be
something that we should not give short shrift to as we go forward.
And so I'd ask that you really consider this vote and whether we're
dealing with something that's really worthy of our time and effort going
forward, and certainly we know this. If this tentative gets legs so to
speak we'll see it again, And what are we really afraid of here? Is
there really some effort afoot? Is there really some instance this has
happened in North Carolina? We've heard the answer no. There's some
areas in the United states that have reportedly had some problems on...</p>

this type situation, none that can be substantiated. I think our
constitution is strong enough, there are enough protections clearly, in
our constitution and in the United States Constitution, in our legal
system, and it does not appear that we're under threat of this
happening. I think you also want to put it in the context of the control
that we have in this legislature, in the laws that we pass, and even the
regulations we have of our judiciary. So I submit to you that this is a
bill that is not needed, it carries us into an area that really is a
distraction from what our duties should be, and I ask that you'd vote
against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, the gentleman has a period of
three minutes that he may yield to any other member.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen of the House, we will be
proactive on this issue, and I urge you to vote yes on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before the House is the passage of the
House committee substitute, the House bill 695 on its second reading.
All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. All members record. The clerk will let the machine record the
vote. 74 having voted in the affirmative and 36 in the negative, the
House committee substitute, the House bill 695 has passed its second
reading without objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection having been raised, the bill remains on the
calendar. Ladies and gentlemen, this ends the calendar for today. The-
And quite honestly, given the material that we covered, the chair is
surprised that we were able to get through all of it. The calendar for
tomorrow, it's good news for tomorrow. We only expect maybe six or seven
bills on the calendar. About half of those are on third reading for what
occurred today. We are going to have, I believe Representative Dollar is
going to announce an appropriations meeting that will begin at nine,
he'll announce that shortly, please pay attention to the announcements
before you leave. We will have session at 11:30, and we'll be here as
long or as short as we need to before we send you on your way, but my
guess is we will have a fairly early adjournment for cross-over day. And
the chair is also what you can go ahead and plan for your planning
purposes, there will be a no-vote session on Monday. Notices and
announcements, Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To make an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We will have appropriations. We will delay
appropriations until nine-o'clock in the morning. Delay appropriations
will be at nine in the morning. We have three bills, we're going to
maybe have some additional discussion on Representative ??'s bill, which
is a hold over. The other two bills we're taking up are House bills 767,
brass the class, which is an education bill, and we will be taking up
House bill 980, which is a medicaid, or maybe our annual medicaid
shortfall bill. This is a very important, time-sensitive bill that we
need to get out tomorrow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, to make an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized for an announcement.
