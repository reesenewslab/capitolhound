Senate will come to order. ?? at arms will close the doors. Members will
go to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery please silence all
electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is the Reverend Peter
Milner Senate Chaplain. All members and guests of the gallery please
stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's pray together. Father in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom
come, thy will be done. We need your covering tonight, Lord, everyone of
us. We need our hearts covered, our minds covered, our families covered.
All the education in the world doesn't really help us out sometimes. We
need so much more than that. We often fall short of what You desire for
our lives. Lord, spare us from our wills. Have mercy upon us who does
not know what to do sometimes. Lead us into the way of righteousness.
Bless all those in authority here on this night. Bless their cities that
they represent, their counties that they represent, every city
throughout this wonderful place that we call North Carolina. Lord,
there's only one strength - that's the strength of love. So spread
abroad Your spirit of love that all peoples may be gathered under the
banner of the Prince of Peace, as children of one Father to whom be
dominion and glory now and forever. In Christ's name, Amen.
