remind you that we’re back at 2:30, its the intention of the Chair that
the calendar will carry over to Monday but there will be one matter
considered before we adjourn of importance. I further note that Monday
will be a skeleton session, no votes and that today’s calendar will be
carried over to Tuesday and Representative Cleveland is going to make,
as soon as we come back at 2:30, Representative Cleveland is going to do
a motion for a bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House welcome back to order
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ve been asked by the Speaker to announce that matters on the calendar
will be carried over til next Tuesday. That Monday we’ll have a skeleton
session, no votes and observance of Passover and we do have an important
matter to take before us today.  Representative Moore before you do
that, I’d like to recognize Representative Cleveland for motion in
respect to the calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I’d like to move that House Bill 280 be
re-referred to the Committee on Public Utilities.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, House Bill 280 is re-referred to the Committee on

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion if I might, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I move that the having voted on the prevailing
side, I move that the vote by which the UNC Board of Governors election
yesterday was confirmed, be reconsidered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized to speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Members, I know many of you have already heard about our
situation. We had a math tallying error yesterday with our Board of
Governors election, as we know we had a bipartisan Teller Committee that
met. I chaired that, I will take fully the responsibility and offer my
apologies to this body that there was a math error in that. There was a
number transposed in the elections results.</p>

<p id="20:00">
that number would appear to have an effect on the outcome of that
election those documents were discovered or that math error was
discovered this morning when our clerk's office working very diligently
to go back in and review the process discovered the math error it was
brought to my attention shortly before we went into session and has
necessitated of course these the delay today so again I accept full
responsibilities and I hope you all will accept my apology for
inconveniencing this body and causing this process to be delayed but I
guess sometimes we have to it takes longer to get right and we tried a
new method of counting yesterday by splitting everything up among groups
to try to make the process faster and in the process of that haste
apparently I transposed a number when we got that back in so to insure
that we have an accurate tally and to ensure that there you know no
concerns by anyone two things are happening I'm requesting two things to
happen. One of course is that we reconsider this so that and at the end
of that assuming that motion is adopted the Teller committee will then
regather along with the minority leader and the majority leader back
into the speakers conference room to once again count the ballots and
make sure that we have an accurate ballot result to report to you and
then the other thing that is happening is members asked about their
ballots the clerks office has prepared a photo copy of all ballots and
those copies will be delivered each members desk if you want to look at
your ballot again. I assure you no ballots were changed they were
maintained by staff and the clerks office so the ballots are as they
were but just answer if anybody had a question and to be super
transparent we decided to do that but that essentially is what where we
are and we will assuming this motion is adopted will move through this
process as quickly as we can but as accurately as we humanly can so
again I would urge your consideration of the motion and again to my
friends and colleagues here apologize for this inconvenience
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
members to be clear on the procedure if this motion passes there would
need to be a second motion to reconsider the viva voce voice vote then
we would send the tellers back to redo their report then with regard to
their report there would another viva voce vote then there'd be a final
electronic vote and before that that would be debatable and we discussed
that with minority leader allowing some time for that is there further
discussion on the first of the four possible votes the motion of
representative Moore to reconsider the vote by which the confirmation of
the UNC board of governors election occurred if not all those in favor
will vote Aye all those opposed say No the clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will open the vote. 108 having voted in the affirmative 1 in the
negative the motion is passed. Representative Moore is recognized for a
second motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you as mentioned earlier I move that the voice vote by which the
election  was confirmed also be reconsidered on the same grounds as the
previous motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
further discussion further debate? if not the question before the house
is whether the viva voce vote by which the house confirmed the election
of the UNC board of governors shall be reconsidered all those in favor
will say Aye opposed  say No.  The motion appears to carry the motion
does carry. I'll now direct the tellers joined by the majority and
minority leader to continue their duties well be in a recess but while
their in recess if you all would do that report back as basically you
can
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
if you'll hold for just one moment I'd like to thank the pages if you
all would stand up for being with us this week.  I've given them a link
to a work on parliamentary procedures that they can study this weekend
so if the tellers will the same tellers plus the majority and minority
leader if you will retire. Representative Blust is recognized

tradition of balance and bipartisan work. I'm not here  to say it was
50/50, but we worked hard to have that kind of balance when the
Democrats were in the majority. And so it's with a heavy heart that we
are losing some good strong members and I would contend also some of the
fine history of what the board of governors has done and of our
university. And I know that we've got some good people who have been
elected, but it's always nice to have a few people who have had that
perspective, and particularly people with that financial expertise. And
for what it's worth I hope that we take this experience to heart and
understand that we are all better as a state, as a body, and in our
institutions when we don't ignore and shut out the voices of people
based on their political affiliation. And for that reason, I simply
cannot vote for this full slate.

Rep. Blust is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if Rep. Moore will yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does Rep. Moore yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Moore, the error from yesterday was 10 votes not carried over from
a tally sheet correctly, but I noticed today several of the candidates
vote totals have at changed at least slightly, how did those other vote
totals change?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There were 2 things, one was, and again the members of the teller
committee are here, and until you go through the process of counting
this ballot, it seems simple enough to be able to count ballots. But
through the process of the way it's done, there's room for errors, and
essentially what you had Rep. Blust, was just a couple of math errors
that would not have affected the outcome. But then, the of cours, the
one with respect for ?? where a 3 was written down instead of a 13, and
that did in fact affect that. One other thing that was different in the
total, Speaker Tillis's ballot was not counted in the mix yesterday when
the Sergeant at arms retrieved the ballot, his got left at the dais. And
so in this count today, obviously it was counted in and we had used his
to determine the requisite numbers yesterday.

Rep. Michaux is recognized.

You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House, and I want the
majority leader to understand that I know who's in charge and what the
situation is, just like I know who's the president of the United States.
Now he got elected too. But the- let me tell you, this thing goes even
further than the board of governors. It goes down to your University
system. And I can give you an example right now, the way that even the
way the board is constituted which is majority Republican right now,
there was a school that had 2 trustees appointed by the Board of
Governors. You have to understand that the trustees to these
universities are appointed by the board of governors and the Governor.
So there you've got a lock on the whole thing, I understand that too,
Mr. Starnes. The thing is that these 2 people who were appointed as
trustees to that university have no knowledge of the University and no
connection with the University at all. And within the next 6-8 months an
additional 5 trustees are going to be appointed to that University. Now
the problem my friends is simply this: When I came here, the board of
governors had just been instituted and the statutes and the legislation
that was done at that time had indicated that minority party, every
time, would always be represented, that minority by race would be
represented on that board, and slots were given to those people under
those statutes. Well we got challenged a few years back by one Walter
Davis who challenged us because it was a quota system. So we changed the
system to knock out all those particular numbers that were put there to
create that diversity. But we still kept people in those proportions so
that the whole board of governors representing the whole university
system would be adequately and</p>

...represented. And now what we've been told and been told to us very
plain and clearly, that you're 'gone put all Republicans on there. That
you're going for all of these jobs. The other thing is that you have now
dropped minority race representation down to two, when in the past we've
had at least four and sometimes seven, on a thirty-two member Board of
Governors.
So this is one of the reasons I got up and said what I said yesterday,
because it just isn't fair. It really isn't, and I understand where the
power is. You've got it. But why exercise it to a point where you cut
out representation on the Board of Governors, a premiere university
system. The most premiere university system in the country. It cut out
diverse representation by either ethnicity, race, or party. It just
really doesn't make sense. And here again, I'm just not in a position to
vote for this confirmation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker. Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker and members of the Chamber, I know it's
important for us to try to insure people have opportunities, but I do
want to point out something about our university system. Sometimes we
might narrow our focus and think it's only about folks in North Carolina
or folks we appoint to the Board of Governors. But they are required,
and I think we expect them to reach out to their circles of influence
and get support for our university system.
As we all know, we compete for and ask for federal participation in
research projects and student aid, etcetera, and we have to work with
our federal government as well. So when we narrow our focus and think
only of one party and don't keep in mind that we have people at the
federal level who are of both parties, as we have a Republican Senator
and a Democratic Senator in this state, that we may minimize our
opportunities to help our university and help our communities.
And so I hope we'll keep it in mind as we go forward, that there is some
value in having some balance and having some diversity of thought and of
opinion, and possibly of party as well. Maybe we're not doing the best
service for our university to completely cut off opportunities for
people to help serve and support our university system. And I hope we'll
consider that in the future.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? If not, the question
before the House is the confirmation of the election of the eight named
persons to the University of North Carolina Board of Governors. All
those in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. The Clerk will open
the vote. The Clerk will open the vote. The aye's are 75, the no's are
18. The motion passes, the persons are elected, and the Senate will be
so notified. We've already had notices and announcements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Representative, who is...I can't see.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was not able to vote. I pushed and pushed and my
light's not working.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh yeah, I see. That's why, you're getting me
confused. I thought Garland Pierce wanted to talk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's right, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Were you recorded?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, not at all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How do you wish to be recorded?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady will be recorded voting no. The total will be
adjusted accordingly. We've already had notices and announcements, the
Speaker Tillis has asked me to advise that Monday will be a skeleton
session. No votes in observation of beginning of Passover and has asked
that the entire rest of the Calendar be carried over to Tuesday. Does
Representative Moore have a motion then? We've already had
announcements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn
to reconvene on Monday, March the 25th, 2013 at four o'clock PM. It will
be a skeleton session, members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore moves...</p>
