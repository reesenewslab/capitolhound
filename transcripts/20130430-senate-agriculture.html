And the seasonal high ground water table, an additional 2 feet on top of
the debris. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So in places like the east where the water
table's pretty high, you probably couldn't do this? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That might be a question for DNR, but the rules are 2 feet. Whether it
would go in a specific location would be up to the hydrology in that
location. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll have that question answered when DNR
speaks. Any other questions before the committee? Senator Ford. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The question that I have is what
specifically in the legislation that would help ensure that the 400
sites that you just described in your area would not become ground fill
sites. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll let DNR answer that when they do it. I
would say this from a private sector point of view. We're recording a
plan. We're on record, the people that demolished these buildings are on
record as the property owner. They're recording a plan at the state and
at the local level saying we buried something here. You'd have to be
pretty mindless to go bury something were you recorded a plan saying you
buried something if it didn't actually belong there, so I think
historically in our community where we've had problems is not where
people admitted they were dumping debris, it just got dumped. But I'll
see if Secretary Gillespie is available to answer the questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Secretary, please
identify yourself. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Rich
Gillespie, Assistant Secretary of DNR. Two questions I've heard, one is
the question about the groundwater down east. In those cases there, if
it could be done you would have the sides raised above higher so you
would actually have a mound. If it could be done because the water table
would have to be protected and so we've discussed that. When we were
negotiating the bill we recognized that and it would be a case similar
to that. On the case where the ground has contamination, if there was
contamination it would be included as a brown fill site, however we do
have a process in place in this bill where we will review that and those
we don't think that that will be the case in this instance in this bill.
The sponsor of the bill has, like he said, worked with us very closely
since January on this. We went through many versions on this bill to
make sure that the environment was protected and DNR feels comfortable
in the way it's drafted and we fully support the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. I did not see within the bill
any type of bonding requirement. My concern is that I hear staff
clearly, but when you have C and D landfills and you've got MSW
landfills all across the state, they are monitored on a regular basis
and that there are individuals that you can hold accountable. I'm
familiar with the two industries that are looking to take advantage of
this legislation. One of the things that makes me uncomfortable is a
land owner who may become absent or who gets missing for whatever
reason. At the end of the day, with all good intentions, sometimes bad
things happen. What is going to be in place to ensure that either that
municipality or the state's not going to be on the hook if in the event
that one of these sites becomes a brown fill site and that a reclamation
or cleanup takes place, is there any type of bonding that would be in
place to ensure that some financial stability would be in place to deal
with the future loss on these sites. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford, I
think Secretary Gillespie has an answer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. In response to that, currently inert debris, C and D
landfills can be done now without the bonding. In this case here, we
have very could be very minor traces of paint that could be maybe some
other very residue, small amounts of chemicals could be in there so we
don't by being able to go in early in the process and look at these
facilities and test that, we will know up front whether or not it's
inert debris or not and whether they'd be a danger so we don't feel like
there would be a concern with that because currently you could do this
now as long as it is inert debris and the only difference here in this
is like I said because you might have some paint on some of the bricks,
so it's not required now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Last one. With landfills</p>

… you have owners. This is their responsibility. This is what they do
every day. You’re going to demo a site, and you’re going to bury the
debris in place. And you’re going to walk away. I’m trying to get
comfortable with who is going to be responsible, and I hear staff loud
and clear, they are not anticipating anything happening, but the only
way to know for sure is to monitor it on a regular basis with a criteria
to ensure that nothing happens. Because I’m not worried about today,
it’s tomorrow and the future that I think that I need to get comfortable
with, that these sites will be properly monitored and taken care of.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clodfelter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman at the appropriate time I was going to move for favorable
report on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold that for one second. Senator Kinnaird.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I have three questions. I’ll start with the
earliest one. What do you do, do you dig a hole and then bulldoze this
after it’s imploded. How do you, just mechanically how does this work?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A large number of these sites have existing basements or existing
foundations that can be filled in around. They just collapse them inside
the basement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok. Thank you. I was going to ask about monitoring, which I wonder if
that’s already been asked. What about historic reuse? Are there any
potential? The latest trend now is take, of course, these big factories
and turn them into housing and retail and office space. Are these really
not historically important, and historic reuse would not be appropriate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Most of these facilities, I’ll speak to my area.  Most of these
facilities were built by folks that were all about efficiency. These
buildings were multi-story, they’re not in a location where anyone would
want to live, have an office or go to a restaurant. If there is a
significance and they’re in a location, that’s being done. That’s being
done in my community right now. But most of these are just junk building
that have no use and they’re completely unusable for any current use,
residential, retail, anything else. There’s just no value. Which gets to
the monitoring issue. We’re not monitoring now. We’ve not gotten to the
point in this state where we require people to tear down buildings just
because we can. They’re required to be secured. They’re required to not
present a nuisance. We’re not debating whether these go to the landfill,
we’re debating whether they stand upright as a blight on our community,
or whether they disappear and become a greenfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, one final question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe you can plant a little garden on top, with your two feet of dirt.
But anyway, you said that you’ve been working with ?? and did you also
meet with any environmentalists during this process?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ll I expected ?? to cover the environmentalist issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. In listening to the bill sponsored, I think it’s a
great idea. It gives these communities and small towns the opportunity
to clean up these landscapes, and we have to hear from ?? as well as he
that this is going to be recorded and plats involved, where future land
owners and future property owners will know these demolition sites are
there. I think it’s just a great way to clean up our landscape and our
small communities. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Craven.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I’d like to start with one question. Has anybody from ??
checked out the sites, along with you who want to dispose of them, to be
sure that the two feet is enough and all of that, all of those
considerations. Or if they’ve just done it in a lab sort of an
environment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Secretary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. On the two foot depth, on normal landfills four
feet is required. We feel very comfortable with the two foot that we’ve
put in here. You’ve got to realize these are extremely low risk sites.
We would not spend one dime monitoring these sites because they are such
a low priority and we have such higher demands elsewhere. So to us this
is almost not an issue with us. But, have I been to Catawba County and
seen the sites that Representative Wells is talking about? Yes.</p>

You can drive through down town any time you want to or the surrounding
areas and you can see it.  Have I been to the Colt Fire power plants
where these are? No, but I’ve seen pictures of them. I’ve not been on
the site myself, personally, I’m sure our division director has been on
many of these sites. To us, this is a very low priority, low risk issue,
and we’ve done more than adequate enough protections in here to protect
the environment, otherwise we would have had this solved in the first
meeting we had with these stakeholders. It’s been months coming to where
we are now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you. So we’re satisfied that we’re going to build a
mini-landfill, but at less than the landfill requirements now, because
we think it’s going to be an okay thing to do. Correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well again, in response to you on that, just remember, seeing the
landfills, they’re currently all over the state now. We see this as very
similar to that. These mini-landfills exist elsewhere.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one last statement please - you haven’t convinced that me it’s
safe, by your testimony and what you said. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wayne
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have one quick question. After you demolish this and you cover it, can
you not rebuild on it or can you not put a park on top of it? I mean,
aren’t there other uses for it after you do this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, there’d be other uses. How it handles on the site, they may be
re-used, there may be a building on the ten acre site. The building only
takes up ten acres, so you have the remaining eight acres.  You wouldn’t
want to put a building on top of any kind of field material that’s not
compact with soil, but you could put a parking lot on it. You could
absolutely put green space on it. I know of one that comes to mind
that’s going to be green space along a major traffic artery. It’s going
to be green space. Right now it’s an old boarded up mill. It will be
green space.
[speaker changes]
The reason I’m bringing that up is because I think we’re thinking it’s
going to be a landfill out there or a seedy place. This is just to
improve the property, build something else on it, and make it more
usable for your city, town, whatever – the way I understand it.
[speaker changes]
This is largely about aesthetics. How do we take what’s looking a ghost
town and make it look like something? Open space, parks, new buildings
would improve those aesthetics.
[speaker changes]
Senator Coffelter.
[speaker changes]
Mr. Chairman, I think representative Wells under-sells his bill. It’s
about, as far as I’m concerned, more than aesthetics. It is about that,
but it’s also about health and safety. I don’t know how many times you
ride past an old, abandoned textile mill that’s literally falling down
on the site. The owner right now may have no place to haul the materials
to. It’s going to continue to sit there, rot, collapse, collect vermin,
create a haven for rats and other undesirable health conditions, and
maybe even a place for people to conduct illicit activities; drug
dealing or other illegal activities. Cleaning these sites up is more
than just aesthetics. I agree with representative Wells, it is that, but
it’s also a health and safety issue as well. If the owner can’t find CND
landfill space really accessible, or the cost of transporting it is too
great, then the building is not only going to be an eye sore, it’s going
to be a health and safety hazard too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Coffelter had a motion for the meeting for a favorable report.
Before I take that real quick, any comments from the audience, the
public? Let’s get to the vote. Favorable report to house bill 706, all
those in favor will say “aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, no. Ayes have it. Thank you. We’re going to continue to jump
around the agenda a little bit. Next, Senator Raven has a bill in
another committee. I believe right now senate bill 341, amend
intervention transfer law.  There’s a PCS. We have a motion from the
committee. Senator Jackson moves for the PCS. All those in favor will
say “aye”, all those opposed “no”. Ayes have it, two to nothing. Bill is
before you, please continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago we went over this bill. There were
some questions that came up before the committee, this PCS address…</p>

<p id="15:00">
Those questions, and I will be happy to go over them. I believe at a
glance there are four additions or changes on the PCS, and when I hit
the pages, if I do, when I do, I will tell you. On page 12, there's one
before that, by the way, but on page 12, line 8, section C, we have
added updates requested by the certificate holder to a conservation
plan, drought management plan, appliance and monitoring plan. That
basically is something from the department, but a question arose and so
we put that in. And then the, the biggest question and we spent most of
our time talking about on this bill is on page 13, and this specifically
addresses concerns that Senator Allran and Senator Hartsell and
Clodfelter had, and that was about the Catawba River Basin et cetera.
And this was put in and it follows the language from the attorney
general concerning that issue and the court case. And on page 14,
section 4B, this was, line 16 there was an addition there, which section
one of this act shall expire if the cumulative volume of water transfers
by public water system sharing a single intake. Those are the additions,
I believe, to the original bill. Senator Barringer is here to assist me
if you have further questions, and Mr. Jeff Hudson is here if you have
technical questions concerning anything else, and so, mister Chairman, I
will take those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions. Questions from the committee. Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. I'm not sure, it's really sort of a
clarification. The fix on the litigation between North and South
Carolina I assume is page 13, lines 11-15.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I just, I've gotten this assurance from Mr. Hudson and otherwise, I
just want to be absolutely certain that this fix will do absolutely
nothing with regard not just to the Catawba, but the Yadkin, and other,
and other bistate rivers as it relates to this particular litigation. I
just want to be certain that it doesn't, it preserves that resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. Hudson, would you like to address that please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, I don't think, I think this takes care of Senator Hartsell's
concerns. We had looked at some other language that might have
specifically referenced the Catawba River Basin, for instance. This
language does not do this so, any, any river basin transfer, any river
basin, even outside the Catawba that would be inconsistent with this
agreement, the commission would not be allowed to grant such
modification to a certificate. So I think it takes care of your
concerns.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I assume that that resolution of my concern went all the way to
China on the internal system here, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? would say so. There to ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the appropriate time, I'd like to move for a favorable response.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions for the committee? Anyone from the audience? We have
one comment from Jeff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If, if the committee's ready for the motion, if I could also get a
direction of staff to make a technical fix. Some of you may have noticed
in what we sent out last night, there was still some highlighting left
in the PCS. We just need to remove that, so just, if you would direct
staff to make the technical fix, we'll do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There will be a technical change to the bill. Senator Wade, move
unfavorable to the original, favorable to the proposed committee
substitute. All, all those in favor will say aye. Opposed no. Ayes have
it. Thank you Senator Rabon.

Next Senate Bill 380, Senator Jackson the [??] Landfill Permit Fee
Timing. There is a PCS, Senator Jackson moves for the PCS, all those in
favor will say Aye, all those opposed no. Ayes’ have it, 1/nothing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Members of the Committee, this
Bill is a recommendation from the Environmental Review Commission that
was hailed in the interim. This Bill will codify the cost for [??]
sanitary landfill and transfer station design and operational phase
permits for both 5 and 10 years. The duration of these landfill and
transfer station permits was [ratified] in last year’s short session in
Senate Bill 810, the Regulatory Reform Act was 2012. It basically
directs the Commission for public health to amend the rules govern the
duration of permits for sanitary landfills and transfer stations and the
period in which those permits are received. Basically, they’re going to
have an option for a 5 year permit or a 10 year permit and if they
choose the 10 year permit, they’re going to have some cost savings
involved with that but they will also have a review some around the 5
year period. This Bill will basically bring our state statue’s up to
date. I’d be glad to entertain any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question for the Committee? Senator Walters. Comments
from the audience? Senator Walters moves unfavorable to the orginal,
favorable to the proposed Committee substitute. All those in favor will
say Aye, all those no. Ayes’ have it, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Stay up there. Next on the agenda, Senate Bill 507,
eliminate out dated environmental reports.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a Bill that basically does exactly what is
says. There is a lot of report . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hold on a second Senator Jackson. What I think you’re
trying to say is, you move to propose committee substitute, all those in
favor for proposed committee substitute will say Aye, all those opposed
no. Ayes’ have it, you may continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, I didn’t realize you were a
mind reader. Very good, this bill actually does exactly what is says it
does, it eliminates outdated environmental reports. If you would look on
your Bill summary you will see a tremendous list of reports, they’re
obsolete and unneeded at this point in time. [Deener] has asked me to
run this Bill and Secretary Escobara is in the process of making
[Deener] more customer friendly as he was directed by the Governor, more
efficient and better organized and in doing so the directors of all
agencies throughout [Deener] were tasked with finding reports that are
wasted tax payer money and/or department time. A lot of these do both,
like I said your Bill summar has the report and I will be glad to answer
any questions on these reports.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions form the Committee? Senator Kinnaird.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What is title 5?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Title 5.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, on page 131, line 31. I just don’t know what
it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is a good question Senator Kinnaird.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I mean, I’m happy with the Bill, I just don’t what
that is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s a reference to the Title 5 of the Federal Clean
Air Act, so it’s a reference to air quality law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But it pertains to the report that has to be filed and
is no longer needed and unnecessary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions for the Committee? Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Move for favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll hold on for just a second. Any comments from the
audience? I see none.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade moves unfavorable to the original and
favorable to the proposed committee substitute. All those in favor will
say Aye, all those [??]. The Ayes’ have it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Now we have Senate Bill 412 for Senator Hartsell
Water Infrastructure Authority Water Grants. We’re going just for
discussion only today, hopefully we gave enough time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee.
First, let me simply say thanks to the Chair for at least placing this
on for discussion, which is more than I accrued 2 years ago when I filed
the original identical Bill. The Bill itself . . . I genuinely
appreciate that, I was serious about that. I would say also this Bill
has absolutely nothing to do with the [Atkin] River or [Alcoa], yet.</p>

<p id="25:00">
Now, the bill itself actually arose from a review of our financing and
implementation of water and infrastructure-related grants, water and
sewer grants, an undertaking that was done by a program evaluation
division, and we have members from the program evaluation division here
to take care of that, perhaps to answer some other questions and give
some explanation. The review that was undertaken and the result of that
review were published in a report by PED, the subject of which was and
actually the conclusion of which was North Carolina's water and waste
water infrastructure funding lacked strategic focus and coordination,
and there were very specific recommendations made to take a look at
various programs both for the financing and grant programs, long
programs, all those kinds of things associated with water and waste
water infrastructure in North Carolina. If you look at the report
itself, you will have- and these are available downstairs in the program
evaluation division and I would commend it to you. We find that there
are a tremendous number of locations, both state, federal, and in some
cases, local, where financing or funding is available, sometimes by
grant, sometimes by loans, for infrastructure- water or waste water
infrastructure programs. What we also find that at the time that this
was undertaken, some of this has been corrected in the ?? and I will
acknowledge that, that there were varying applications. In fact, for
each of these various programs, there was an inconsistency in those
applications and there was little coordination in terms of where the
funding was going for the needs and the priorities associated with the
projects. What the bill does is make an effort, utilizing existing, in a
sense, programs or entities, to try to put this together in one place.
Now I don't mean to look at the grants or loans that might be made but
the feasibility of the projects associated with them both independently
and together. There is a function that the local government commission
would have in at least reviewing some of these so that you got the
infrastructure side and the financing side looking at these things in
some degree of combination. Without- the program evaluation study
suggested three things. That we actually had in 2005, we established a
state water infrastructure committee that was to put together some of
this, but it hasn't been functioning a great deal, which is not terribly
uncommon. They have made some efforts and have done some work since this
bill and the study and the finding was made. We're trying to get a
little more effort in putting all this together, and that's what the
bill is about, to try to coordinate and use our finding and
strategically place it in such a way that we can take care of the
projects and frankly reduce the overheads associated with the various
programs. What program evaluation recommended was to direct the state
infrastructure committee to develop a state-wide strategic plan. It
needs assessment for water and waste water infrastructure. We did not
have such a plan before, we still do not have such a plan. Since 1999 we
have spent better than a billion dollars on various and sundry aspects
of these various programs. Not to say that the grants and things made
weren't good for various specific situations; many of them were. The
vast majority of them were, but there's a performance issue associated
with trying to put all these things together. We were trying to- they
also recommended better oversight of water and waste water funding by
this commission or by the authority, something was established, and
suggested using loan programs more than grant programs whenever possible
for them. We have a revolving loan, we have other kinds of things. One
of the things that took place in, for instance, 1988- excuse me, 2008, a
lot of money came down from the feds for certain types of program-</p>

<p id="30:00">
Problem is it doesn't do you a whole lot of good to have some of those
programs and have those, those grants and other things available if you
can't get it on the ground and get some things done. What we're trying
to do is to create a situation where we have an entity that has
oversight of all of these programs and grants and loans, focusing more
on loans so that the folks to receive things have a little more of
little more skin in the game quite honestly. We also need to recognize
that there are something like 200-plus water entities in the state to
provide water, not quite as many that will do sewer, but we probably
have too many, and so there is at least some prospect for creating some
degree of regionalization with this specific legislation. Mr. Chairman,
I'll be glad to go through the specifics. I know that there are some
folks who -- I frankly opposed this before because they said they would
try to do better, and frankly I think they did do better. But I still
think that there needs to be in existence some entity. And what this
does is create the authority which would be housed technically in ??,
but would have the financial resource working with the local government
commission to look at how some of these things are done and create
consistent applications across the board, actually simplifies that
process in a very significant way because right now we provide a whole
lot of work for engineers who have to look at -- to modify the differing
kinds of applications in doing these kinds of things, where we have a
single program we can actually probably reduce some of that cost
associated with it as well. Mr. Chairman, I -- we have Larry from the
program evaluation of ?? is here who may be able to address those
specific questions. I'll be glad to answer any of those, and I would
recommend this study to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So we're gonna do a pop
quiz right quick, make sure that everybody read the PED study. I'll ask
the members questions, make it more entertaining. We have questions from
the committee?  Any questions currently? Senator Wade. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, could you give us an example of how this would work of
a municipality or someone ?? the water system and they want to extend
something or they're having a problem? How do you foresee this working?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, when they want to -- they can do their own
regardless. We're trying to create in effect what is a clearinghouse for
these applications for looking into the funds in a single way, a single
site in the state so that we can address in a fairly simple way. If they
think that they qualify or their going to do something else, I mean,
that's useful in terms of delivery of the system in they're area or
perhaps coordinating with an adjacent area, which is frankly something
that we really need to do particularly in Piedmont, North Carolina. That
they have a single source, they can go there, they can make an
application there, and it's into -- and we have all sorts of funding
preferably on loans, but it could be some grants and very specific
situations. We have a lot of situations in North Carolina where without
identifying a particular location, we have problems that have developed
in terms of frankly adjacent municipalities. Everybody thinks they can
do it best themselves. In fact, in the long run, they spend a lot of
money on developing, for instance, a water treatment plant, but they
don't have enough water to come into the plant to actually treat the
quantity of water they're projecting. But they could perhaps go to an
adjacent just to get a line to an adjacent municipality, draw the water,
and have the water they need, not have more than they need, spend the
funds in another way.  We actually have somebody with some expertise in
the state to kind of look at those kinds of things. That's what it's
designed to do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Followup? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Hartsell, are you -- I think I'm reading that there would be some
problems with -- you're trying to get it towards regionalism and save
some money or better equip the cities, towns, and you might have some
people that are more in keeping their own water system and they don't
want to reach out to other cities and towns that might need it? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I think that's a fair statement; I think that's a fair
statement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions from committee? Any
questions or comments from the audience? Senator Kinnaird. [SPEAKER

Wanna say that Senator Hartsell's been working on this for years, and
I'm glad that we're finally gonna be successful, and I wanna more for
favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for discussion today. Secretary ???.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee, this bill appears to
be almost identical to the one that was introduced in 2011, and like
Senator Hartsell says, a lot of things that have been done since then
that have made this process improved. ??? would  have to speak against
this bill as it's currently drafted, and be opposed to it for several
reasons.. actually, lots of reasons. I have many detailed and specific
reasons, but I just want to address a couple of highlights of the way
it's currently drafted. The main thing that we'd have concerns about is
on our drinking water state revolving fund, where the state puts up 20%
of to match and draws down federal funds. Currently, in the governor's
budget this year, we're drawing down about $49 million, and we feel if
this bill passed, we'd be in violation of the EPA regulations as far as
how this bill would allocate the money that's provided by federal folks,
and it would be inconsistent with the guidelines, so we feel like we
would lose that $49 million that would be coming to us. That, and also
there's the state water infrastructure council has certain duties that
they do, and in this bill as it's drafted, it would give them the task
of doing certain things, but it eliminates their statutory authority to
do that, so that's sort of inconsistent. And then also we would question
the way that it would be perceived, as far as a top-down approach to
funding infrastructure in the state, and that there's nothing in this
bill that prioritizes how funding would be done, and I feel like that
the cities and the counties would have grave concerns with it, also,
because of the grants and loans that are provided to them. And then,
over in ???, I don't know how many of you have seen our new missions
statement, but we feel strongly about that, and one of the key points in
that mission statement is a cost-benefit analysis on anything, and this
bill violates that because it doesn't have that cost-benefit analysis,
and doesn't analyze whether or not you're creating or solving a problem
that exists. So, those, and like I said, the many other, very detailed
concerns that we have is why we oppose it, but other than that, we would
support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let.. yes, Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think I'm gonna have to put something in about ALCOA.. cause that can
take care of a lot of the funding issues, but let me.. with regard to
the $49 million we're talking about, it seems to me it's a fairly simple
task to modify some language to fit something to make that work. With
regard to the other issues, I am fully, I am confident the 200 plus
units who have independent programs would not like something that we're
not, it makes them do something that they might not otherwise want to
do, because everybody thinks they can do it themselves and, in fact, in
many cases, they cannot. The other thing I would say is this: it is
absolutely imperative that we look in these days, this is not designed
to be a top-down approach, it's designed as a way to--you know, kind of
clear that up, we're more than willing to try do that--, it's designed
to create what is in fact an integrated approach. It takes a look at
priorities associated with, we have a fixed amount of funding, it can
come from any number of sources. That's likely to be the case in the
future. We need to have that funding coordinated in such a way that we
get the most bang for our buck, and that's what this is designed to do,
so that we can take care of that in a realistic way and not, as they
saw, pick winners and losers in situations where folks might be losers
to begin with, become winners in the short-term, but we don't have the
improvements associated with the infrastructure that we actually
ultimately need. We designed to try to create an integrated approach to
look at these kind of financing needs. I would suggest to this committee
it is incumbent upon us to look at these kind of situations as we move
forward in the economic environment that we have, because we have</p>

In many cases, in many cities and towns in public infrastructure right
now, systems that are in fact 100 years old, particularly sewer systems,
where you have infiltration and infill that costs everybody, including
the environment and people, an awful lot of money. And those systems
were originally designed for 40 year lives. I mean that's true for
water, too. And we've got to look at the potential for upgrading it and
it's gonna have to be done in terms of, in a strategic way, to try to
address that as we go forward. Anything that would do that with DENR,
with PED, with anybody, is something that we need to address sooner
rather than later. Because otherwise, we're going to have many failures
and we want to strategically be able to take care of ourselves in that
time.
[speaker change]
Senator Raymond.
[speaker change]
Thank you. Senator Hartsell, can you describe real quick how
implementation of this bill would affect DENR and what they do in their
charter, or can DENR respond, also?
[speaker change]
I don't know that, I think Secretary Gillespie has addressed one aspect
of this, and I've tried to address another. There's no reason we can't
marry the two in some reasonable fashion. I'm not, I don't know that it
necessarily affects DENR. I don't know that it doesn't. It does look
into that there's a factor that we rarely ever look into here, and
that's and I look at this, let me explain something. In my other life,
which I had once upon a time, as an attorney, I happened to represent a
water and sewer authority, locally. It's a regional system primarily ??.
We have done all sorts of things to try to reduce the costs associated
with the infrastructure and have made it pretty dog gone successful
looking at an integrated fashion. We have this tendency to try to
preserve things as they are and continue to do the same thing the same
way. We've got to look at the way we fund things in a way that we can
strategically say that we are improving not just the infrastructure, but
the quality and lives of the public as a whole. Now, how would it affect
DENR? We all know, and this is no reflection, this is true throughout
state governments through local government, everything else. We have a
tremendous number of silos. Those silos have built up over the years and
folks want to continue to do the same thing the same way. Which is the
definition of insanity. It won't work. And we're just trying, there is
probably a good range here that we can address that we need to look
into. It will take some time to do that, but the time to look at it is
now and it's not just to continue punting the ball. And I frankly think
that's what Secretary Gillespie said, too. He said the have problems
with certain things. That's not to say we can work those things out, but
by the same token, if we don't make some effort to do it, we're going to
continue to get ourselves deeper and deeper in the hole.
[speaker change]
Senator Kinnaird.
[speaker change]
One question and one comment. Did this not, if it didn't come out of
program evaluation, was it not informed by program evaluation?
[speaker change]
This is actually the result of a program evaluation study. Here's the
study.
[speaker change]
If I may comment, Mr. Chair.
[speaker change]
You may.
[speaker change]
We set up these things to say how can government work more efficiently
and more effectively and then we pay not attention. So, that's my first
comment. My second comment is having been a mayor of a little town, and
now living in another small town, aging water and sewer systems are very
expensive in two ways. The first is leakage and infiltration. You lose a
tremendous amount of water in an aging water system and you lose, you
have troubles with sewer systems with infiltration. And these are things
that are out there probably the quantity is enormous throughout our
state and small towns. And that means dollars. Dollars lost, but dollars
to fix up. It's a huge cost to go into these aging systems. So if we can
find ways to help these systems as well as do regionalism, which I think
if you're building new infrastructure you really need to think
efficiently and effectively there, so I just feel like this is the way
to go. And that if we have a program evaluation commission we ought to
pay attention to what they say. Thank you.
[speaker change]
Thank you, Senator.</p>
