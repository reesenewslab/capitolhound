and so again, what this bill is about, is simply exempting primitive
camps and primitive farm buildings  from the building code. And I'm not
trying to do any more than that.
Mr. Chairman, I don't have the PCS in front of me. If I could get us a
copy...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, if I may make an inquiry?
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Avila? Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have 2 PCS's?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just believe we're being very efficient. Or not very efficient.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is not the PCS. The PCS that I've got has an effective date of
immediately, as opposed to July 1st. So if you've got 2 PCSs...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The committee will suspend for a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's how you can tell the difference.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, you should have the new PCS before you- the- what is- the
difference between the two is one has an effective date which is
immediate, that would be the PCS that McGrady will be working from.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This shows version 3, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Rep. McGrady. The floor is yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm gonna stop right there and see if people have questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Shepard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir Mr. Chair.
I just have a comment, Rep. McGrady, I certainly support this. A few
years ago I went with a youth group, a high school youth group, to West
Virginia whitewater rafting, and we stayed in some of these primitive
camps and it was quite an eye opener for me, especially for an old man
like me to have to take blood pressure pills at night and had to trek
about a mile down the mountain to the restrooms, but anyway I certainly
support this, and I think it's great for everyone to have an opportunity
to stay in some of these primitive camps and to see what it was like
during those days and times. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, and I too think this is a good bill. I just
though want to protect the owners of the camp, and is there any- could
you tell me how liability is dealt with? Because if a kid gets hurt on
something that isn't something that wouldn't have been up to code, is
there- what happens? I mean with greenhouses and farms where it's more
adults, there's maybe a little less concern about it, but I just wanna
make sure that there's- people don't think that just because now they're
not inspected by the building code that  then they don't have any
responsibility to the campers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. McGrady?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Great question. The first thing that a camp director does is on the
application get the parents to clearly understand what type of camp
they're going to, and provide a waiver with respect to- they can't send
their son or daughter to this camp and expect the same standards they
might have if they were going to a more developed camp. And so that's
the first tool that a camp director puts into place. The second one
frankly is insurance. And the expectation would be that a jury would, if
there was a question of negligence, would have to take into effect-
account that in fact here, the parents are making a decision to send
their son or daughter to this camp, or to attend themselves, and they
need to understand that they're going to a camp that tries to replicate
things in 1830, and they don't have some of the same protections they
otherwise would have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I follow up, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I think that that's all great, and I don't want to slow the bill
down so I'm not going to say that we have to do something about this in
the committee, but I just think it might be good to put something in the
law, particularly because this deals with children, saying that anybody
who owns one of these camps  needs to have liability insurance. Or
something just to be very direct about it, so that people don't feel
like they're completely allowed to operate free outside of the
constraints that they'd be operating under now. And that can be on the
Senate side or somewhere, but I just- a friendly recommendation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Noted. Rep. Richardson?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  On the PCS down at the bottom effective date, I know
that’s just a typo I think.  This act will become, when it becomes law,
effective should be in there correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I believe it is, line 36 on page 2, this act is

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I was looking at the bill summary.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Presnell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I was just gonna say I wholeheartedly agree with this
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chairman I think this is a good bill and I will
be prepared to make a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Any additional questions for members of the
committee?  Seeing none, Representative Jones you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I move for favorable report
for Opposed Committee Substitute Version 3 for House Bill 774
unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The motion being properly before us, all in favor say
aye.  All opposed.  Motion passes.  Thank you Representative McGrady.
The Chair would like to recognize an additional Sergeant of Arms John
Bay.  Thank you for joining us this afternoon the last bill on today's
agenda is House Bill 796.  Representative Whitmire you're recognized
present your Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chair.  Thank you all for hearing the
bill.  796 is somewhat of a unique bill and I will simply say it's the
epitome of the one size truly does not fit all in our great state that
has rural and urban issues where often times we assume when in reality
you can find many niche and pockets of this great state where you have
small counties whether it be geographically or in population that simply
don’t fit what's on the books.  In this case a columbarium, just so
everybody knows what it is,  is basically a structure that  if one
chooses to have their remains upon their death cremated it's a place
instead of scattering their ashes to the winds they can be placed and
commemorated with their name there.  It's basically you could just
consider it a tombstone, except it's basically a structure to where
multiple people in their little placquered area would be commemorated.
With this in the interest of the very jammed week I certainly welcome
questions but we have endeavored for quite some time.  The people who
brought this to my attention have endeavored for over three years to
find a means within the law and within the various provisions to seek
out to build a columbarium in Polk County which has 21,000 people and is
our third smallest county in this state and it simply is not there.
They've reached out to various oversight agencies within the state, the
Cemetery Commission in particular dating back to march 2011 trying to
seek solutions and they simply have not been able to find them.  I
continue to work for the Cemetery Commission which may here at the very
last minute have found an option and if they do find an option that can
be corroborated, I will certainly endeavor to go that method instead of
changing the law.  But in the mean time with much due diligence in place
this is merely crafted so as not to circumvent the free market.  The
free market has known of this need that 292 members of our greatest
generation who now are in their 80s and 90s at a retirement community in
Polk county have thought to solve.  They're wanting to build a 3X10
structure so that those in their privately owned retirement community
can let their cremated remains be commemorated with their name instead
of simply being scattered amongst the trees and bushes in their area.
So with that I ask that you support this and realize this is at the
heart of, we've got some situations in our great state where one size
truly does not fit all.  It's merely crafted and no it does not run
counter to the free market because it's an infinitesimal piece of the
market share out there.  The backers behind this are not gonna simply
build this and let it become abandoned.  Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Representative Whitmire.  Before I take
questions from members of the committee I would like to recognize
someone who would like to speak in opposition of this bill.  Mr. Lucious
Pullen in the audience.  If you could Mr. Pullman state your name and
who you represent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Can you hear me Mr. Chairman?  I'm Lucious Pullmen, I</p>

<p id="15:00">
Been a North Carolina lawyer for 59 years and I've represented North
Carolina Cemetery Association for 19 years. And I have talked with Chris
Whitmire about what his constituents want to do and I've talked with
several of them as far back as over a year ago. And they seem to want
some free legal advice so I opened my book and gave them the names and
addresses and phone numbers of lawyers in their county who would give
them free advice like the county attorney and the city attorney. But
what they are trying to do does not need to be in this law, it is an
unnecessary law and Ive tried to explain that to Chris and I think we're
making some headway here.
The chairman of the North Carolina cemetery commission is a constituent
of your first vice chairman, Hugh Blackwell, a good Harvard trained
lawyer. And I told the chairman a long time ago that they could not
under our law, which is a perpetual care state cemetery law, regulate a
private columbarium like this. Nor can they regulate a family cemetery
like my grandfathers family cemetery on a Nash county farm. So the
chairman called and told us that they had no interest in trying to
regulate what these people want to do. And here with me tonight is Bill
Gaffney, stand up Bill. Bill is on our association legislative committee
and he is also secretary and treasurer of the state cemetery commission.
And he has told Chris that he will go over to the office tomorrow and
get a letter from the North Carolina Cemetery Commission saying they
don't need this bill and we will not try to - the cemetery commission
will not try to regulate them. And if you want to hear from Mr. Gaffney
who owns cemeteries and serves in several capacities. Are you okay with
that? He'll bring a letter tomorrow to representative Whitmire telling
these people they can do legally what they want to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Pulan [SP] At this point I'll open up
questions to members of the committee, representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Okay, we'll suspend that. Representative Blackwell.
None? Representative Lambeth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is my question Mr. Chairman and for the bill
sponsors. So what harm does it do to have this in statute?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Whitmire?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lambeth, to the best of my recollection
with the due diligence that we put into this, one of the concerns that -
I have the letter here that dates back to where the outreach to various
oversight entities such as the cemetery commission. One of the things
that they have dwelled on is the number of abandoned cemeteries. And
when I say cemetery, whether it's an acreage plot, traditional caskets,
mausoleums or columbariums, it all falls under that definition. The
context of concern has been for abandoned cemeteries. Now keep in mind
that when you got to the effort in such a nearly crafted provision to do
this in the first place, you're investing money into a very significant
purpose, and I really think that we're stretching to say that these
columbariums are going to open the door to make a whole bunch of
abandoned cemeteries, but that was what it was dwelt on. And it also
gave reference in this letter back to what cemeteries require. and it
requires 30 acres. We have a bill that's been filed that would increase
various thresholds of bonding an acreage for commercial endeavors. But
right now, what would this hurt? This would basically fulfill a hole in
our law and give people who have a very vested purpose to be able to
satisfy a need that has been vested. I don't think it hurts anything.
Could it? Could you extrapolate? Sure but I don't think that's reality.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, if I could ask Mr. Pulan [SP]
a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just heard the presenter mention that they've been
working on this for three years. And what you're offering is such a
simple solution, why was it not arrived at sooner?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess I didn't talk to the chairman until he called
me and asked my advice, which he has been doing for 19 years even before
he was chairman. I told him that this is like a family cemetery, family
cemeteries are not regulated in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko.</p>

is simply this. The outreach has been there, I certainly know that
there's a whole lot more buy in if all stakeholders have a means to make
substantive input and are as close to happy as possible, and my moving
forward and has been for several weeks, this was not done in a vacuum
short notice by the way. Is if these speculative intentions statements
can come to fruition where I have it clearly in front of me, I would ask
that one, we move this on through this committee, and in the course of
the House, if it's favorable there on to the Senate, I will continue to
work with the subject matter expertise that is voiced, but also been
quoted to the contrary in letters to see if we can find the solution.
And I've done that in good faith, I'm not saying that I'm all-knowing
and perfect, we know that better than to assume any of that. But do I
believe them? I don't want to say that I disbelieve them, but I haven't
gotten what I need yet, and that's where I'm at and why we're still up
here in front of the committee. And thank you for your indulgence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Speciale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I heard correctly, the secretary of the cemetery commission gave an
erroneous explanation, an erroneous interpretation of the law a while
back. So the purpose of this, and from what I can see, would be to
ensure that that doesn't happen again. Because the bottom line is they
called up and they asked can we do this, and she interpreted it as
&quot;no you can't&quot;, maybe someone else will interpret the law as
&quot;no you can't&quot;, so it makes sense to put this in so there's no
erroneous interpretations. I recommend we pass this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Lucas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair.
What I am hearing is there has been communication, although maybe some
kind of mixed response inducement there with the cemetery commission.
But what I'm also hearing is that the cemetery commission feels that
this can be solved without law. Would that be your assumption, Rep.
Whitmire?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Whitmire?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that's an accurate summary, and we're at the point based on
crossover and all this, that all the due diligence that we've done,
there's a point where we have to either stay or go. And I do not have
enough information to say &quot;Oh yeah, all's good&quot;, because the
conflictions, and such as this letter that talk about minimum acreage
requirements to do a traditional cemetery, when in reality, the pursuit
is not a traditional cemetery, it's a columbarium run quite-
the facts don't quite add up and I certainly don't want to say that
someone has given me poor information, I always assume that people are
giving me the best information they have . But at this point, your
analysis there is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Since I believe that we have all the parties in this room at this time,
is there any reason that there can't be some kind of collaboration
between the parties in this thing solve without a law?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Whitmire?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir I will simply say that we're continuing to do that. And maybe when
things are brought to a crucible of it's before a committee, maybe that
brings more players to the table with more information. And I will
continue to work with them pending a favorable approval here, but to
date, and it's not just been here and there, I have not received enough
to make the assumption that we are good to go because the context of
private vs. this, vs. that, it is somewhat of a stretch at this point to
know  this with confidence and reliability to know that we're good as
is. I do not think we're good as is based on the facts presented today
behind the scenes leading up to the day's committee hearing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Well I get what's going on, this is basically leverage. But the bottom
line s that some of the folks who have testified said that it wouldn't-
you could be accommodated without changing the law completely. And the
downside to changing the law in this part of the law is that certain
protections wouldn't be afforded even to these folks. For example making
sure that things were</p>

taking care of in perpetuity. Whether or not it's leverage, it seems
like they might get what they want today, but they may not get what they
want in thirty years. We need to be thoughtful when we make the law
because you're making people happy today but there may be problems down
the road. It appears that there are probably the votes to move this but
I would just ask that you think about what you're doing to the law and
potentially to the people who want this today by exempting them from
some of the protections that we have in our cemetery act.
[speaker changes]
Representative Horn.
[speaker changes]
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Question for the presenter. As I understand it,
you've indicated that if we pass this onto the floor, is there a ??
referral Mr. Chairman?
[speaker changes]
There is not.
[speaker changes]
If we pass this on to the floor, but from the time we pass it and before
we vote on in on the floor, you become satisfied that this is not - this
is redundant, then you would ask that it be displaced from the floor
'cause my point here is passing a law for the sake of passing a law  is
not what we should be doing here. We've got plenty of laws. We need a
whole lot fewer. I'm not encouraged to vote for passage of another law,
however, in order to ensure that the goals intended are in fact
achieved, I would like assurance that if you are satisfied, you will ask
for the bill to be displaced before it goes to a vote on the floor.
[speaker changes]
Representative Whitmire.
[speaker changes]
Representative Horn, I couldn't have said it better. Thank you. Yes, we
don't need any more unnecessary laws, if possible, than we've got now
but with that, until we get reliability and confidence in that the
alternative is not just a matter of we won't check on ya, which is not
good enough for me. If we get a viable solution that is legally solid,
and run through subject matter experts far more savvy in this field
especially on the legal side than myself and many of us. Until we get
that, I have to continue to pursue. But, if we get a solution,
absolutely. That would make this pursuit unnecessary and it would be
handle d without further pursuit.
[speaker changes]
Representative Avila.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Just a comment that Representative Whitmire is
up against a lot of the same thing that I have been up against and some
of you have been when you want to get a piece of law passed and that is
nobody will come to the table till you're standing up in front of a
committee or you've got something in writing and it forces them to and
for my input, I would second the recommendation that we continue to
carry forward and if we can reach an agreement before the governor has
to sign it, so much better.

Thank you Mr. Chair for the bill's sponsor. Representative Whitmire, how
long have you been working on this for your constituents? My question
has to do with the time frame that you've been working on it and now,
there seems to be people willing to work with you all of a sudden now
that it's on the committee floor.
[speaker changes]
Representative Whitmire.
[speaker changes]
Sir, I personally, dates back to January. As far as the chronology here,
my predecessor and her predecessor were involved with this too.

Representative Brisson.

Thank you, Mr. Chair. I don't know why the - just trying to understand
why the cemetery commission ?? could be worked out. I don't know why we
can't take em at their word instead of using a bill to force them.
That's not good business, I don't think. When we moving in the private
?? of cemeterys. That's a big area. Rural areas are full of em and I
don't know why you just having this discussion on one cemetery and here
we are making a law for one cemetery.  I really got a problem with that.
[speaker changes]
Representative Ross.
[speaker changes]
Just thank you Mr. Just for another comment just to remind the
representative that if he leaves a bill on the senate side and doesn't
want to use it, all sorts of things might happen to it.
[speaker changes]
Not all necessarily good.

Representative Brawley

kind of want to reflect back what I think --</p>

follow up.
could we just have the staff explain the problem.
yes miss [??] Brown.
thank you Mr chair from my reading of the statute there is an ambiguity
and there is some level of un-clarity in the statute there're references
in the statute to businesses operating [??] but there also is a section
of the law that provides any legal entity wishing to establish a
cemetery has to file a written application for authority with the
commission so it is absolutely clear that the statute only applies to
businesses number one and so based on that ambiguity someone who wanted
to create a cemetery and a [??] is included within the definition of a
cemetery might have to get authorization from the commission this bill
would make it clear that this type of [??] is outside of the statute and
outside of the act that requires that authorization.

reason why this is a good law and I am prepared to make a motion at the
