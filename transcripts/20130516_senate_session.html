Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Clodfelter a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clodfelter, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was very much impressed by your talk yesterday about the fact that
this penalty is going to be assessed and you had thought that you might
run an amendment or have you declined to run an amendment.  We will just
continue to assess people who are getting a refund or owe nothing will
still get this penalty?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, for the first time, we will be assessing a penalty on
these people.  It’s not that we’ll continue to do it under the bill for
the first time, we’ll assess it.  I do not have an amendment this
morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President. To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I feel like this is really a disservice.  We are hearing about the IRS
on the national level revenue people.  Why are we assessing people a
penalty when they are late and they are even owed a refund or owe
nothing?  I just think the policy is not a good policy and I intend to
vote against it for that reason.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate?  Hearing none, the question for the Senate

We had an eventful week this week.  We hope you enjoyed it.  Thank you

Members, next week will be Budget Week so now we had a relaxing

your e-mail.  The budget is likely to be released sometime one Sunday
online.  Keep an eye out also for subcommittee meetings.  You can plan
if you’re on Appropriations Subcommittee that you’re likely to meet and
review the proposed budget 4 o’clock Monday. On Tuesday, we plan on
doing the Appropriations Base Budget meeting and we plan on doing
Finance and Pensions.  The idea will be to go ahead and vote the budget
on Wednesday and Thursday next week. So again, please keep an eye out
for committee notices and…</p>

<p id="10:00">
For the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, would the gentleman yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter, some of our members were trying to figure out who
would be in full Appropriations Committee for the purposes of amendments
and that types of stuff. You all did it a little different than we’ve
done in the past where members of subcommittees, perhaps, aren’t a
member of full Appropriations.  Could you explain to us how to figure
that out?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would anticipate that you would have to be on the Appropriations Base
Budget Committee and so you would need to work with a member who is on
that committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other notices or announcements? Any other business to come before
the Senate?  Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor for a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr.  President.  Members, this is my sixth long session in
eleven years. Senator Nesbitt, this is probably his thirtieth long
session.  Senator Allran, his forty-fifth. But I do not remember one
going as well as this went this week.  We weren’t here till midnight
like some other folks that occupy this building. I thought we got things
done quickly and I just want to thank everybody for the efforts and the
work that you put in to get this move and getting out at a decent hour
on Thursday. On another note, I just would like to sincerely thank
everyone for your thoughts and prayers to the trials and tribulations my
family’s had the last couple of weeks with the passing of my father. It
has meant so much and I just wanted to thank you personally.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator.  Any further business to come forth before the
Senate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook has the floor for a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to say happy birthday to my seatmate.  He is a young man of
804.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson has the floor for a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.  Yesterday, a few of us were walking through the area here coming
back and we saw a young fellow just sprinting ahead of us with some
earplugs and listening to music and it was going on and going on and I
just want to commend Senator Apodaca for his health trick and he’s doing
a fantastic job, but he did not even hear us yelling at him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further business coming forward for the Senate? Now, the chair
recognizes Senator Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  I move that the Senate do now adjourn subject
to the referral or re-referral of bills and resolutions and the receipt
of messages from the House and the Governor reconvene on May 20th, 2013
at 7PM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion of the Senate to now adjourn subject to the stipulations stated
by Senator Berger to reconvene Monday, May 20th at 7PM.  Seconded by
Senator Tillman.  All in favor say “Aye”.  Opposed, “No”.  The “Ayes”
have it.  The Senate stands adjourned.</p>
