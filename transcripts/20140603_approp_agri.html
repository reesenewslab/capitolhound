The Sergeant-At-Arms that is with us today are Marvin Lee, Bob Rossi and
BH Bow. And today we’ve got a couple things we’re going to do. First
we’re going to have a presentation from the Ag. Committee based from NC
State Plant Science Research Initiative, and this is for discussion
only, and after that we’re going to have State FFA President Carmen
Honeycutt to make a presentation to us. And in case you’re interested
while we’ve got the State President, she’s my great niece, and I vote
ya’ll ought to hear from her, and I hope you’ll bare with me and not
leave the meeting and be here for it. Marshall? [NO SOUND 0:46 – 1:34]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] … as an agriculture teacher, which I did for many
years, and it’s always good to be with the State FFA President. I wore
one of those jackets once upon a time and some others in this audience
did too; right Ray Starling? It’s a pleasure to be with you today, and I
want to thank our Chairs for the great job they’ve done in shepherding
an idea that came to us from stakeholders, and he asked today if I would
come and share just a few update points about it. Our college continues
to be known as and seen as one of the top colleges in agriculture and
life sciences in the country and indeed the world, and we’re really
proud of that, but one of the things you do is when you are continuing
to do great things you want to continue to build upon that, so there’s
been a lot of conversation from our stakeholders about how we do that.
What I’m going to do over the next couple of minutes is give you an
insight into a couple things that relate to two initiatives that are
coming before you. One deals with the Plant Science Initiative and a
second one that deals with food processing. So as we do that, let’s take
a look for a minute at… see if I can operate this now. Does that need to
be in there? There he goes. So one of the first questions we ask
ourselves is “Why North Carolina?” And when we talk about the
agriculture industry, we thought it would be good to give you a slide
about North Carolina, and in terms of North Carolina agriculture, we
know first of all that we have a big industry that begins on the farm,
and if you listen to our Commissioner and others talk about that ongoing
basis, we know that agriculture tends to be a huge economic driver, but
it’s really because there’s people on the farm that make that happen. We
have a lot of agri-business, a lot of s in between that work in
education and other realms and research, but it really begins on the
farm, and I think it’s important that we start there when we start any
conversation about agriculture in North Carolina. The second thing we
think about is our commodity organizations and all the groups that that
brings together, and we’re fortunate in our state to have 90 plus
commodity organizations that deal with various commodity groups and
organizations that support agriculture and continue to do great things
is our state. The third thing we think about is our department, and we
have a great partnership with our Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services, and we’re always excited about the great things we see
happening there, and just yesterday we were able to join them for an
event over in Clayton on a research station to see some wonderful things
that are going on there, so part of their leadership and their work. The
fourth thing you think about is the private sector. When I name the
private sector, I’m thinking about Research Triangle Park and all the
things that we have there – the assets we have in that part of the word
that deal with agriculture from research and innovation. And then you
think about things that have happened in recent years in terms of
developments in sweet potatoes and tobacco and poultry. All the
innovations that have occurred, many of them are driven through
partnerships between our institution, NCANT, and the private sector. And
then the fifth thing we think about is those loan grant universities,
and it’s always important for us at NC State to remember the great
partnership that we have with North Carolina A&amp;T State University.
They are a great institution, and their Dean Bill Randle and our Dean
Rich Linton really spend a lot of time together trying to build those
partnerships. So if you’re going to talk about plant sciences, you’re
going to talk about food and where we can go into the food processing,
you…</p>

<p id="05:00">
?? to understand this piece first, and again I think it’s a good
reminder for us to think about agriculture in that context. When we
think about our college, the college of Ag and Life Sciences, we try to
be strategic. Most of you know we went through a strategic planning
process and through that came out with five core areas that really deal
with what goes on not only in North Carolina but also globally, as we
think about sort of the food system around the world. Because North
Carolina is a global player, and that’s an important thing for us always
to remember. That while we are always doing great things here, a lot of
our technology and research has implications on feeding the world.
Because we think about production and quality and accessibility and
profitability. We think about stewardship of the environment. We think
about food supply, to make sure it’s secure and safe. We also think
about human health and how that intersection between health and wellness
and great agriculture come together. Then we also think about leadership
development, and how we create new leaders and future leaders for the ag
industry. These are the five imperatives or strategic things that our
college continues to work on and we partner again with the Department of
Agriculture, private industry, NCANT and others to make sure these great
things happen. Now as we think about agriculture itself, if you remember
some of you who sit on the commission, the Ag and Forestry Commission, I
shared some of these recently and this is a good set up for talking
about plant sciences. That we think about what’s going to happen in
agriculture on the horizon. We were asked a couple months to share with
them sort of our best thinking, when we think about that we think about
first of all plant sciences. Because we are so plant-centric in North
Carolina. When you think about all that we grow. We grow practically
everything but citrus. That’s about the only thing we don’t grow in this
state, or can’t grow. Haven’t figured out a way to grow it on a mass
scale yet. And when you think about plant sciences, you think about our
ability to increase yields, to have pest resistance, new crops, water
management, drought tolerance, things we can do and we have done. And
much of that, the reason we’re big into that is because of the tobacco
industry. I think that’s an important segue to always make, is that the
tobacco industry because it generated so much for so long and continues
to, it brought a lot of plant specialization to North Carolina, in
particular to NC State in terms of plant breeders and people that were
really some of the really smart people that deal in that sector. Another
thing we think about is food processing. And this is an area that we
think is really ripe for the picking and something I’ll talk about in a
moment. But when you think about all that we produce, and you think
about the fact that we send off a lot of our crops to the upper Midwest
and to the Northeast to be processed, what if we could process it right
here, and then have the value added here and create jobs in North
Carolina, across the state of North Carolina? We think that’s possible,
and that’s one of the things I’ll come back to in a moment because we
believe and we all know that we’ve lost things like textiles and
furniture making, and some of those things have certainly taken a hit
over the years. But what if we could create a new manufacturing in the
area of food processing? Wouldn’t that be great to find good jobs that
people can have and we think that can be an economic driver in the
future. So I want you to keep these two in mind, and I’m going to hit a
few others just so you can know what we’re thinking about in terms of ag
and life sciences. We’re also very concerned about food and nutrition
and food safety. Those are not only issues in North Carolina but around
the world. We think about the ability to improve nutrition for people,
and hopefully have quality of life long-term. Agriculture intersects
with all of that. We also think about the farm of the future and what
that means in terms of technology, to help that person on the farm do a
better job in terms of precision agriculture, making sure that the right
treatments go into land and the right treatments go in terms of working
with animals or whatever their area may be. But the farm of the future
will certainly include analytics and working with farm equipment. Those
kind of things we think are a part of our future in working with NC
State. We also see a growth area in animal agriculture in terms of
alternative feeds and how we can quit importing so much feed but grow it
ourselves. Different kinds of feed that we can grow here and we think
that’s going to be an important part of growing the future of animal
agriculture in North Carolina and across the country. We also believe
there’s a niche here, a local foods niche that’s really important.
That’s a growing area in North Carolina. A lot of folks want that local
food aspect. They want to be able to grow, to go and get it at the
farmer’s market or whatever. And that is an economic driver in many
communities and so we’re involved in that, trying to help build those
kinds of linkages as well. We also see on the horizon the importance of
preparing the next generation of agriculturists, to ensure that these
young people that you’re going to see in a few minutes, that wear the
blue and gold jacket of FFA, have a future in an industry, that there
are good jobs and opportunities for them to grow. So these are seven
things that we lay out. I wanted you to have a copy of that today as you
think about the great strategic work that you have to do in terms of
public policy and moving the state forward in terms of agriculture. Now
let’s talk about two of those. Plant sciences first of all. When you
think about North Carolina again, you think about the diversity of what
we grow. What we can grow, we can pretty much replicate any soil type,
any climate that you want in the US. Let me give you an example. If you
go to Northeastern North Carolina, we can</p>

<p id="10:00">
…replicate the Midwest in terms of grow crops
If you go to the Northeast, Northwestern part of the state, we can do
what they do in the Northeastern part of the US in terms of Christmas
trees and those kinds of things.
If you go to the Far West, we have apples, which is exactly what they do
in Northwestern US.  We can pretty much replicate, and that’s why that
research station infrastructure we have in partnership with NCDA is so
important.  It’s really important because we are able to generate new
technologies, new ways of doing things that replicate them.
So when you think about plants, and what we can do here, and you think
about the infrastructure we have in terms of the College of Ag and Life
Sciences, you also think about the infrastructure in the RTP.
Phenomenal infrastructures there with major corporations; in fact, many
would argue that we have within fifteen miles of us the highest
concentration of plant science expertise from a private sector position
as there is in the world with the companies that are in RTP and finding
ways to work with them.  So, we think about plant sciences, we’re
thinking of an initiative that yes is going to be a part of NC State,
but is also going to be a part of North Carolina’s future.   Because as
we work with those research stations and we work with private industry
this will create jobs across the state and we know the majority of jobs
in agriculture looking forward will be plant-centric, not only in North
Carolina but around the U.S. so there is a lot of opportunity to think
about that student experience, how we can drive economic development,
how we can work with our external stakeholders – those who are on the
farm today and those who will be on the farm in the future --  to do
better things here.
In terms of a big idea, one of the things we’ve given you is a handout
that really shows the centerpiece to that being a complex that would
hopefully be at Centennial complex some day that would allow us to
really bring together not only the academic research piece of this not
only the private sector in terms of renting out space and working
collaboratively with private industry, but also being able to work with
regulatory agencies and figuring out ways to work more closely together.
 It could be world class.  And that’s an important thing for us to think
about, if we’re going to do something, I think we have it in our ethic
in North Carolina to do it well, and so we want to be about that.  So,
again, this is something we’re thinking about, and I know there’s some
language, some legislative language to support a Plant Sciences
Initiative, and it is a partnership between us and lots of colleagues
across the State, including the Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services.
So again, Plant Sciences is one area.  A second area that we’re looking
at really closely is food processing and this has caught a lot of wind
the last year or so because some of the folks, including some in this
room, began to think “If we grow it and then we ship it somewhere else
to be processed, and they ship it back to us to buy from ‘em, why can’t
we close that gap” And we believe we can.  We aren’t going to be able to
do it with everything we grow, but we do believe there’s opportunities
there when you think about sending strawberries to Ohio where it becomes
strawberry jelly, why couldn’t we make that jelly here?  Why couldn’t we
figure out ways to do it?  Take any crop you want to take – why can’t we
figure that out?  And we believe we can, so there’s also language you’ll
see that our stakeholders have driven for us and with us to ensure that
we figure out how to do that.  because we believe that if we can figure
out ways to grow it, to process it, and then sell it from here, that’s
going to be a good economic driver for many communities and literally it
could affect all 100 counties of North Carolina.
Again, it would be building on our assets, it would be about
entrepreneurship, some new kinds of innovation, it could also be about
job creation and bringing in certain kinds of companies that may want to
come here as a result of that.  So again, you’re going to see language
and you have seen language that would support this kind of initiative
(both of) these being feasibility studies in plant sciences and
feasibility study in terms of food processing to figure out what can we
do and then come back with you with a more defined plan.   So we
appreciate any support that you might have for those.
So, with that, Mr. Chairman, I’m gonna stop and say “Thank you;” again,
these things have been talked about a lot by many in this room through
the Commission work.  We have given you a handout that has the slides on
it. If you have questions, we’d be glad to entertain those, and again,
thank you for your support and leadership for Agriculture and Life
Sciences in North Carolina.
Speaker Changes: Any questions (mumbling)
Original Speaker: Yes Sir
Speaker Changes: Representative (sound like Pigg)
Speaker Changes:  Thank you Mr. Chair. I’m wondering where, or what
role,  NCA&amp;T is playing in this.  I know you made reference to it,
but looking at the bill and in looking at the handout, there really
doesn’t seem to be roles.  Is there a way that you’re thinking about in
incorporating A&amp;T more?
Original Speaker: Yes there is.  Yes Sir.
Representative (sounds like Pigg): Where would I find that in looking at
the bill?
Original Speaker:  It’s a great question and it doesn’t show up in the
bill, but what we plan to do is, we’re going to be creating an advisory
group that’s going to help lead this charge.  It’s not only going to be
NC State, we’re just gonna be obviously the facilitator of it.  We’re
gonna involve NCA&amp;T, the Department, we’re gonna involve…

-department of the AG, we’re also going to be involving private
industry, farmers and others to help us create what that should be.  So
they will be one of the key partners in the whole process.  They’re
going to be there actually, we’ve already had conversations, we’re
talking to them yesterday, as late as yesterday about it so that, yes,
they’re very much engaged in this because their niche, and they’re not
certainly limited to this niche, but they do great work with small
farmers.  Many of you may know that.  Dr. Randal[???] and his team do an
extraordinary job and we partner very closely with cooperative extension
in particular.  That’s where you see a lot of that partnership there,
and in the research arena and it’s really important that we grow that.
So it certainly is not in any way not going to include them.  They will
included in the mix as we think forward about how we go forward, yes
sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luke [???] this summer when we had the activision[???]
meetings they were there and they made presentation and very much a part
of we were trying to do.  So I thought it was a good connection, and we
definitely heard from them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas[???]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair.  Allow me to applaud the concept of food processing
plants.  I’ve long wondered why we ship our food out of the state to be
processed at other areas and brought back for us to buy it.  As we
consider these food processing plants, I hope that we will give great
consideration to processing it right in the rural areas where it is
grown rather than sending it to Rawley[???] or to Charlotte[???] or to
some other big cities in the state.  Let’s provide some jobs in the
rural areas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I can respond to that, representative.  One of the things that this
project – both of these projects is driven by stake holders.  Many of
our stakeholders are in rural North Carolina and the reason that they
have brought this forward is they see this as a way to bring new jobs
back into this rural area.  So we’re right on line with you.  A great
statistic that our dean[???] and I were talking this morning, and he
apologizes for not being here, he has a different meeting today on a
similar kind of topic, but he said that his analysis has been that when
you take a product that we grow, that about ten percent of the
profitability of that product stays in the state.  Ninety percent goes
to the processing and somewhere, that’s the valuated part.  So we’re
losing a huge amount of opportunity by letting these products go out.
So we hear that, we believe that it can be a stimulus for rural North
Carolina, we can do some good things there, and we’re looking forward to
figuring out how we can do that, so thank you for the comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Kerr[???]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair.  What processing do we have in North Carolina now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have some, and some of you can probably tell me as quickly as any, I
know there’s some bread processing that goes on in this state.  There
are some small groups that do some work in this area, but we just – when
you look around and you look at what we do send out, we’re not, we’re
missing so many opportunities.  So, you can go to rural areas, you can
find spots of it in small towns, but you don’t see what we think can
really be an expansion.  Again, I don’t want to over state it, we want
to do a study on this to insure that the help happens at the right
places because we don’t want to – when we get stewards[???] so that’s
part of the study to show us where the gaps are, where we can do this.
And we think again that’s something I might add to this representative
Turner[???] that we want to add, we want to have commerce involved in
that, we want to have all the partners, the department of AG again will
be involved in that, other partners help us do that study.  Again, we’ll
lead it, we’ll facilitate it, we’re going to have a lot of partners to
insure that it has that state-wide foot print.  And there’s a lot of
product too that comes from other states, like on the border.  Like if
you’re up on the north eastern border, there might be a product grown in
the neighboring county that could be brought to us to process.  That’s
good, we’d steal anything from Virginia, South Carolina that’s fine with
us!  So there’s all that kind of thinking we’ve got to put into this
too.  Lots of opportunity there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We used to have some dairy processing plants.  Do we not any longer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There still is some.  And you’ll find those in some different counties.
You’ll find dairies that do ice creams and milks and those kind of
things.  But again, it’s hit and miss.  It’s entreprenurs who have been
very thoughtful, small.  We think we can build this out so it can be a
real economic driver.  And again, we just have to study to make sure
before we set a heading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any others?  Representative Qunn[???]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A couple of things, I havn’t heard Kanapolis[???] mentioned, that’s one
of our institutions, you know, out of the old food processing space.
We’re doing a lot of work there on nutrition and other such things.  And
then again, I’m from Western North Carolina, and our farms are --</p>

<p id="20:00">
Small. And they’re very specialized. And we’ve been for the last decade
for sure, strong in niche processing. We’re taking tomatoes and making
tomato sauce and we’re pickling everything that you can imagine. We’ve
done all kinds of value-add, lot of (especially) retailing as part of
that and so, it’s not the same all over the state. There’s a big
agriculture in Eastern North Carolina and there’s very niche agriculture
in Western North Carolina. But we have Blue Ridge food ventures, for
example, community college incubator program does an incredible job that
you might wanna look at as a model to be replicated in a lot of places.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We agree. As a matter of fact, you couldn’t have asked
for a more different state in terms of agriculture than we have, you
travel the state as you have and you see it full value and that’s
somewhat what we see as a great opportunity that we’ve been figuring
out. Cluster?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One other point, Mr. Chairman. The extension service
is egg extension of our land grant universities all across the states.
So, you have a network, a footprint all across the state. So, you are a
good player to help coordinate a lot of good assets that are happening
across the state. So, I hope you’ll certainly recommend this approach.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Representative. Representative Horn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chairman. I was involved in the food
processing business in the sales area for quite a number of years and I
recognize the great opportunities we have in North Carolina because we
?? raw materials, as you mentioned it. But, it’s critically important
that we work across the silos of transportation and education to ensure
that our kids come out through school, are aware of the many career
opportunities in the food industry, not just being a farmer and that’s
not just because those are the hardest working people out there I know.
But, all of things it takes to be in food processing is technological
issues, chemistry issues, transportation issues which brings me yet
another one, and it’s critically important to food processors that we
have an infrastructure that allows them to get their products quickly
from the point of manufacture it into the hands of the consumer as we
move into these just in time delivery sequences that most of the
distributors and I’m hopeful that you’ll work closely to ensure that we
have a good egg education and good work with our ports and our highways,
freezer space at our ports, critically important for processing in this
state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Representative Horn. Representative Ramsey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to follow up with Representative Turner.
It’s common I can’t speak for other Agricultural sectors; I know from
the dairy industry we have a few processors left in North Carolina.
There’s a consolidation of those processors and one of our challenges of
growing dairy in our state is every day, milk is shipped in the North
Carolina. We’re a fluid deficit region and if our processors are able to
obtain enough product, they’re moving milk from Texas in the Midwest
into North Carolina. So, you have dairies like 100dairy down in high
point milk van in western North Carolina. One of the challenges for
farmers is that from markets too, where they have opportunities to
obtain processors beyond just one processor. So, there’s some
competition and like in the Midwest, you might be able to sell your milk
to 5 or 6 different processors. Down here, you don’t have that option.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At this time, we thank you, Doctor ?? for being with
us and we’ll close this part of the meeting and then I wanna bring up my
great niece and now she’s gonna say a few words. She’s the president,
North Carolina FAA and her dad is egg teacher and I had a lot to do with
that too, since I was an egg teacher and he followed my steps, I ?? him
four years in high-school. And, I’m very happy to represent to my egg
committee Carmen ??. Carmen.</p>

<p id="25:00">
Well, I just want to start out by saying thank you for letting me be
here today. I know you all are very busy and your time is very valuable,
so I won’t talk as much as some of the other Honeycutt Ag teachers, but
I’ll try to keep it a little short. But as I’m sure some of you know,
agriculture education has three key components. We have classroom
instruction, SAE, supervised agriculture experience, and then we have
FFA. And I might be a little biased, but FFA certainly seems the most
fun to me. But in the classroom, we learn the basics. And like you said,
Representative, agriculture education is the key to the future of
agriculture. It’s been mentioned here today. And we learn the skills in
the classroom that prepare us to go out and to be that future in
agriculture. And then the supervised agriculture experience, that’s our
opportunity to get the hands-on experience with those skills. So that’s
when we really learn how to do things. I have a three acre garden at
home, and I have learned way more than I could have ever learned sitting
in a classroom, by getting out and doing that hands-on experience. And I
think that’s a really key component to agriculture education, and
education in general. And then we have FFA. And I think what’s really
unique about FFA is that it’s an opportunity to take all those skills,
all those things we’ve learned, and to have the leadership, to learn the
leadership, to apply those things to North Carolina as a whole. So, I’ve
been listening a little bit to what you’ve talked about today with the
food processing and I think FFA really prepares students in agriculture
education to be able to branch out and to make some of those things come
true. And I think the three circle model that I talked about with
agriculture education kind of transitions over to FFA in general. So in
FFA we have our own three components. We have our FFA camp, we have ag
teachers like ?? mentioned. And then we have our blue jackets. And I
won’t talk too much about all of that but FFA camp is a lot of fun for
all of us. And this is when we really get to meet members from across
the state. And that’s where we really start to learn about other
counties and all the different agriculture products that are made in
North Carolina. And it’s really interesting to see. We get to do a lot
of fun things and we play sports. And I learned that I’m not very good
at that, but I just spend a lot of time talking to everyone when I go to
FFA camp. But that’s where we apply those leadership skills we’ve
learned and that’s where we get to learn about other people’s products.
And we get to see things from across the state. And the second part of
agriculture education and FFA is our ag teachers. Like ?? said, he
taught agriculture education and he had the I don’t know if it’s a good
thing or not, but he had my dad and my uncle. So he had Honeycutts in
his career. And I think our agriculture teachers are truly the core of
FFA. Because those are the people that pass on that experience and that
knowledge so that we’re prepared to go out and make the future as bright
as we can make it. And I think they’re the cornerstone to the future of
agriculture. And so they’re very important to all of our hearts and I
know my ag teacher and my dad and my Uncle ?? have all been key players
in what I’ve accomplished in FFA and in life and in agriculture. And
finally, FFA has the blue jacket. And they’re not exactly comfortable on
a 90 degree day, but they are a key tradition to FFA. Not many people
can say that they wear a blue corduroy jacket every day. But I’ve had
the opportunity to wear blue corduroy a lot this year. And it’s not as
uncomfortable as it looks. Once you start breaking in the jacket, it’s
really nice to wear. But it’s the unity that brings us all together.
When you go a state convention, which is coming up really soon in June
for North Carolina, you see all these blue jackets flood downtown. And
it’s an amazing feeling to know that all of those people are there to
support agriculture. And they are there to learn about agriculture and
they want to be the future of agriculture. So I think that’s what really
FFA is all about. We are preparing ourselves so that we can make the
future of North Carolina and North Carolina agriculture as bright as we
can possibly make it. So I just want to say thank you for your support
for agriculture education, for FFA and for the industry we all love.
Agriculture. So thank you for letting me be here today and I hope you
all enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
