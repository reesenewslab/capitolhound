was sworn in to his second presidency and you were just a freshman
coming down from Hickory. It’s absolutely amazing how the years go by
quickly, but with all that being said, we’re going to miss you. You’ve
done a great job and the state of North Carolina thanks you, we thank
you, and all the best. Come back and see us often.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d just like to say this. You folks are awfully, awfully kind. I really
think its backwards. I need to be standing up here and thanking you all
for everything instead of the other way around. I can assure you, just
the privilege and the honor of being allowed to serve in public office
and serve the people and to serve with folks as incredibly fine as you
all are is definitely its own reward and I don’t need anything else.
Thank you very much.

Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, motion relative to calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I move that we bring House Bill 718 to the top of the
calendar for immediate consideration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, so ordered. Senators, we’ll be starting with public
bills on second reading. House Bill 718. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 718, Ensure Adequate Funds for TAs/Rev Allocation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Hise, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, members of the committee...Thank you, Mr. President, members
of the Senate. This bill simply comes together for two things. One, this
is a fix, a change, sorry, in the policies for the TAs that will allow
school boards who moved funds in the previous year to shift that same
amount of funds increased by 2% from the teacher allotment to open ended
funding and do that at the average teacher salary versus the minimum
teacher salary as was the change in the budget. There’s some other
changes relative to 1224 that deal with the technical parts of the
amount of funds under the new tax the counties have control over and
this makes sure that that’s clear and understanding that its just the
funding of the new tax and doesn’t apply to all appropriations. I’ll be
happy to answer any questions you may have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, send forward your amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. I appreciate that you
all are bring forward this technical fix to a couple of provisions in
the appropriations bill as it relates to education and I’ve got one
more. What this does is ensure that we do, here when we budget, what
we’ve done since we’ve been doing budget. At least, I can’t imagine, the
last 50 years, which is the base budget includes enrollment growth. That
whenever we live in a growing state, we live in a wonderful state.
People want to move here. Every year, more kids are going to our schools
and every year for the last 50 years, that enrollment growth is part of
the base budget. With the budget as you all have written it, it means
that if we don’t fund it, and now we have to fight for it each and every
year, that we’re going to have larger class sizes, more kids in the
classroom, and fewer teachers. This just ensures we do what we’ve always
done, put it in the base budget and it’s a technical fix just like the
last one. I look forward to your support. Thank you. Happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know, I don’t know what I just heard because it’s about as far from
reality as the truth can be. We’re still going to have teachers in
classroom. Actually we cut class size, didn’t we coach? In many grades.
I just don’t understand where these misgivings or these untruths come
from and it’s kind of disturbing at this late hour that we have to
listen to that, so I move that this do hereby lay upon the table.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.

Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of parliamentary inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, we have to make a vote on the lay upon the table. If that’s
what your rising for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question was, is this a debatable motion? Can we discuss the impacts
of this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not debatable, Senator. We do have to take a vote on it. We will
have…it’ll be one electronic vote, Senator. We’ll have one electronic
vote. The question before the Senate is the motion to table amendment
one. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote.

OK, I think we got it cleared up. Senators, final vote was 27-13 in
favor of the motion. The Amendment 1 lays upon the table. The bill
un-amended is back before the body.
Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Blue, you can send forward your amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Blue proposes to amend a bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Blue is recognized to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I think
that House Bill, the Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill 718 is a
much needed solution to some of the problems that have been pointed out
to us about the budget bill. It fixes the problem with the TA's and some
of the other issues that we've all heard about. It also clarifies what
can happen with a quarter cent sales tax, which is good. With the County
Commissioners having some greater authority over it. But there's one bad
thing in this bill. And the bad this is, we've acknowledged there are
things we need to fix in the budget bill, and especially this issue with
the Teacher's Assistants. And we put in this bill that we are willing to
fix that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Blue, I hate to interrupt you here, but the bill was not drafted
correctly. If you could come up to the dais please and initial this,
we'll let you have your full time when you go back, but it's not showing
up on the dashboard for the members because it was drafted with the
wrong numbers. So, if we'd get it initialed and changed.
Thank you, Senator.
Senator Blue, you can continue or start over if you prefer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
No, that'd simply reiterate everything I just said. The one thing that's
bad about this bill is we acknowledge that we need to fix this problem
with the Teacher's Assistants. All of us probably have probably heard
from our Superintendents or our Chief Financial Officers in these school
districts that say that, you know, you got this confusion as to what
they can do with regards to hiring them, or keeping them and paying
them, and all of that. So, we acknowledge that this is a genuine fix for
it, but while acknowledging that we say that we are willing to fix it,
but we are only willing to fix it if the House passes another bill
that's totally unrelated to this fix that we all acknowledge needs to be
done. What we say in this bill, that it's only effective if the House
annex House Bill 1224. 1224 has all kinds of things in it, it has
various taxes and other things. I think the House voted, 85 to 20 or 30,
not to accept. So, if we genuinely believe that we need to fix this bill
so that our school districts can operate efficiently, so that they can
pay the Teacher's Assistants, so they can keep the Teacher Assistants
and trade them out with the Teachers, or however they best think to do
it, then we ought to let that stand on its own bottom. If the only thing
that this</p>

does. It takes out this proviso that says that we’re willing to fix it,
but we’re only willing to fix it if the House is willing to drink some
castor oil that they have said they don’t want to drink. I think that
the problem is important enough that we ought to fix it without trying
to tell the House what they got to do on an unrelated bill. I move the
adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it’s important to know that 1224 is an important piece, I think,
for education. Probably one of the most important pieces that we can get
passed in this session because what it will do is it will allow the
counties across the state to put forward to its citizens in a
referendum, the opportunity to pass a quarter cent sales tax to be spent
on education and that has a lot of flexibility on how it can be spent in
flexibility, whether it’s on teacher’s pay or it may be school buildings
or could be community colleges. It has a lot of flexibility in it. I
think it gives counties another avenue to raise revenue for education
instead of property tax and I think that most counties would support it.
I would ask that you defeat this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the adoption of amendment two. All in favor vote
aye, all opposed vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting.
The clerk will record the vote.
Hartsell, no. Barringer, aye.

The final vote. 15 having voted in the affirmative and 25 in the
negative, amendment two does not pass. The bill unamended is back before
the body. Is there any further discussion or debate?
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was perfectly prepared to support this bill even though you all didn’t
deal with the ADM issue that you should and that will, on a going
forward basis, ensure that we are not guaranteeing our school systems
that the counties can plan on future population grow. Set that aside.
Ya’ll are playing political games. You’re saying to the House, if you
actually care about TAs and not firing TAs before this November
election, you’ve got a gun to your head. You have to take a bill that
you’ve already indicated by a supermajority that you don’t think is good
policy. There’s a lot of reasons that 1224 isn’t good policy. We don’t
need to re-debate it all again. We know what you’re doing to Forsyth, we
know what you’re doing to Wake County. You’re saying to the House, you
have to fire TAs or put up with our bad bill.  That’s a terrible way to
govern and I oppose this bill because of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Tillman, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, every school system received money on their ADM
projection for the teachers that they would need. We do that projected
for the next year. They’ve got their money in hand. They also get money
for the TAs. Now, we gave them the flexibility to take that money for
TAs and teachers and interchange it however they wanted to. Now they got
smart in the game and they started exchanging and taking dollars for the
teacher money and taking it at the average teacher salary rather than a
zero which we changed it to so they wouldn’t scam the system. I was a
part of that in the school time, and yet we took the higher paid,
locally paid…or state paid teachers and shifted the positions for lower
paid positions and we did that all the time.</p>

<p id="25:00">
you take and pay locally the Teachers that are state paid, and you pay
them this salary and you pick up dollars that way. Now, since they all
had the money, about 100 million dollars of that last year was not used
for Teacher's Assistants. In most cases, they took and hired Teachers,
additional Teachers, although they had what the allotment called for.
So, they choose to take that in many school systems, and I checked with
the Superintendents. I said, how much money did you shift from TA's to
Teachers? And it was several hundred thousand dollars for systems, about
$100,000 across the state. So they took that, and now they're crying and
saying, oh, we're short on TA's. I said, well how much money did you
shift? I said, shift that back and take those extra Teachers you hired
and have normal class sizes, rather than the 10 or 15 you can have, or
coaches, or mentors, and so forth. So, they took the flexibility we gave
them, used it the way they wanted to use it. So, to say that we're
taking Teacher Assistants out of the classroom is not true. The money is
there, they can put it where they choose. Now they want us to cover
their sins and to put this money back. Now, you can say that's being
fair, Senator Blue, but I'm saying they took the money and used it where
they wanted to. Now we've got a fix in there for one year to put this
back so they can all say we've got all our money now for the TA's, and
so they'll put it where they want to. But they had that flexibility,
they wanted it, I think they should have it, but that's what they did
with the money. So when they're crying that we're short of TA's ask them
where the money went. It went into classrooms or other areas.
Thank you.

Senator Berger, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Before the clerk reads that bill in, I would request a moment of
privilege out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK. Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, we've been here for
a long time and we've passed a lot of legislation, and we're about to
take up three adjournment resolutions. I just wanted to spend a moment
to talk a little bit about where we are, because we are finishing up
this session even though we've passed a number of things with several
unresolved issues. Among them are Medicaid reform and Coal Ash
legislation. And I think we can all agree that both of those items need
to be addressed. Also, you've heard some discussion about 1224, that's a
bill that was sent over to the House with bipartisan support on the
Senate side. However, we are a part-time Legislature, and as a part-time
Legislature folks are entitled, and their families expect them to be
home by a certain time. You have commitments, you have other jobs for
the most part, and the time has come for us to adjourn and allow our
members to go home, and allow our families to spend some time with the
folks that spend so much time here. For that reason, the primary reason
we're here today is to vote to adjourn. We're optimistic that the House
will agree to the terms the Senate recommended earlier this month that
we conclude all substantive business until a special session on both
Medicaid reform and Coal Ash mitigation in November. My home town of
Eden has spent a good bit of effort and time over the past several
months dealing daily with the consequences of Coal Ash. I understand the
gravity of that problem, and believe fixing it to be a top priority. I
know that Senator Apodaca and a number of other folks have spent a great
deal of time dealing with the legislation</p>

?? that we worked on here in the Senate. It was passed in the Senate
with every single member of this chamber agreeing. The Senate passed a
strong Coal Ash bill that would give North Carolina the strictest
regulations on Coal Ash in the nation and be the only state that be
required the closing of every Coal Ash pond. But Coal Ash is, and we
expected to be, a highly complex issue. We hope to be able to come back
in November and continue to work to fix that problem and to fix it in a
way that is productive and something that the people of North Carolina
will appreciate. At this time, the Senate’s going to take up three
resolutions to provide flexibility on the terms of adjournment so that
we have an adjournment that will actually take place. One resolution
will call for the Senate to adjourn citing no further legislative
meetings for the rest of the year. A second resolution will adjourn
until the previously agreed to November session on Medicaid reform as
called for in the state budget. Then the third resolution will be until
a special session in November that allows us to take up both Medicaid
reform and Coal Ash mitigation. Let’s be clear. The Senate’s preference
is, as we’ve said all along, to adjourn until special session in
November that allows us to take up Medicaid reform and Coal Ash
legislation to mitigate the Coal Ash issue, but it’s time for the
session to end and that’s why we’re giving the House maximum flexibility
and the choice of adjournment. We are optimistic they will agree to
adjourn until a special session in November so that we can take up Coal
Ash legislation and take up Medicaid reform, but it will be up to them
and, again, we are hopeful that they’ll take up the adjournment
resolution that allows the most flexibility.

Senator Apodaca has the floor for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Berger has appointed the hardest
working man in the Senate, Senator Apodaca as chair, Senators Berger,
semi-works and Senator Wade who works hard as members of the conference
committee on Senate Bill 729, Coal Ash Management Act of 2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Soucek, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Soucek has the floor for a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. While we were back in session, a while back, I
received inquiries from many of you about two staff members from
Samaritan’s Purse who had contracted ebola overseas and I wanted to give
you a little bit of information. We have both of them back in the United
States, both of them have turned the corner, one is almost released from
the hospital and the other one is expected to fully recover. Thank you
for your thoughts and prayers on that. One piece of information, there’s
been so much national media on this with staff that we’ve had in West
Africa and coming back, and the risk. We have been in contact with the
CDC and with the parameters and what we know about ebola, the risk is
infinitesimally small. It is completely containable in a western medical
environment. Every precaution has been met or exceeded to make sure
there is no danger to this country or this community and that continues
to be the case. We do ask that you continue your thoughts and prayers
for the thousands of people in West Africa who don’t have western
medicine who are suffering from a disease that has a 50 to  90% chance
that you will die if you contract so thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Any other notices or announcements? Any further
business to come before the Senate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A couple of announcements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First, members, as far as our schedule is concerned, we’re going to
adjourn to tomorrow morning at ten o’clock. We still have one more bill
that we intend to vote. It is a conference report on the regulatory
reform measures. I believe information about that bill’s been shared
with the minority party and we intend to vote that tomorrow morning. We
would do it tonight, but I was told that it would probably be sometime
after 9:15 or 9:30 before we had all the paperwork on that, so rather
than wait around, and we’re going to need to be here tomorrow anyway.
We’ll do that at ten o’clock. So far as I know, that should be all the
business that we have tomorrow, at least formal business. If something
else comes up, we’ll make sure we let folks know.
Second announcement, Mr. President.
We do have some members who have decided that they’re going to retire.
Several of them are here. We have cake and refreshments that will be
served in the quadrant outside these doors of the Senate and encourage
you all to be there, especially if you’re one of the retirees, it’s
mandatory attendance, Senator Walters. Mr. President, if there’s
no...I’ll wait to see if there’s any other announcements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any further business to come before the Senate? If not, the
chair recognized Senator Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate do now adjourn subject
to messages from the House and the Governor, the referral and
re-referral of bills and resolutions, receipt of conference reports,
ratification bills and appointment of conferees to reconvene on Friday,
August 15, 2014 at 10 AM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn subject to the stipulations
stated by Senator Berger to reconvene Friday, August 15th at 10 AM
seconded by Senator Apodaca. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed say no. The ayes have it. The Senate stands adjourned.</p>
