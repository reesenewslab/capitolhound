Representative: … in local government, in terms of the police chief and
the mayor of the small town. You cannot beat that kind of commitment, a
two hour community. Who would have known at that point, that as he moved
the senate years later, I would replace him in the house. And now, in
the senate, I feel like our lives and paths have been very entwined. You
heard from the resolution how amazing his life and career has been. To
be young, as he is, and to have accomplished so much in terms of law
enforcement, local government, public service, his love and commitment
to his family and to his church. If I can think about what was important
to Senator Jones, I think you would all agree that he had a strong
commitment to education. We were all in meetings together about
education, particularly Halifax County. He was committed to eliminating
poverty, and very proud to head up a joint committee on poverty
elimination and economic recovery. We had some public hearings around
the state and learned so much about what the keys were to poverty
elimination. He really took hold of that whole idea of justice
reinvestment. You all may remember that, as chair of the justice and
public safety appropriations committee, he was really committed to that.
He went to meetings around the county on that justice reinvestment
issue. Finally, he came around to supporting raising the justice juvenal
age which, initially, as a strong law enforcement man, was not his
inclination, but he was really concerned and committed to the best for
our youth, and became convinced that ending the school to prison
pipeline, in whatever way we can, with strong services, with detention ,
if we needed it, for youth who were violating the rules, but also,
looking to how we can keep them out of that adult criminal justice
system, that was important to him. So, I just want to stand again in
honor of him to call to your memory and our respect and consideration
the life and service that he gave us. I also know that he was very close
to many of you and often told me many stories of things you all did
together and the ways he built relationships with you, and I am sure
many of you will speak to that. Mr. President, at the appropriate time,
I hope that you will also recognize his family, who is in the gallery,
along with many locally elected officials, friends and loved ones of
his. Thank you.
Speaker: Thank you Senator. Senator Davis, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To speak on the resolution.
Speaker: Senator Davis has the floor to speak on the resolution.
Representative: Thank you Mr. President. To members of the senate, I
stand in support of this joint resolution today recognizing and honoring
the life of senator Ed Jones, who was a friend to many of us, and
especially me. We have many acquaintances in life but fewer friends, but
Ed was a friend, and a dear friend to us all. We actually knew each
other way before either one of us came to the senate. We served as
mayors. He was in Danfield, Snowhill, and often traded notes but one
thing I knew in the midst of it all, is that he truly loved serving
people and Danfield, his district. Senator Jones, as Senator Bryant
alluded to, was later appointed into the house, and eventually into the
senate, and I can tell you, it can be a tough time as we make these
transitions, but I was honored to actually chair the executive committee
that actually appointed Ed in both cases, and in both cases, that
executive committee knew that it had just the right person. While
briefly serving a term together in the senate, he was a friend that many
of us have that, you know, we would go down to the snack shop before
session, after session, and talk about what was going on. He often
conveyed to me, especially of those who served with him, to be a part of
this distinctive institution and to serve with such distinguished
colleagues.</p>

Representative: He said that in the private conversations. We also
talked about bills and as we spoke about our bills, he had a litmus
test. His litmus test was this simple: how would the bill impact poor
people? That is why he often said to me, what was the impact on poor
people, actually he said poor folk. We would converse and we know that
the many contributions that he served and provided in this chamber, as
he was a very well respected and regarded voice, especially when it came
to crime control and safety. We could trust his voice. He lived by his
legacy and his motto, where he would say that it is not about the titles
that we possess, it is about the job that we do. Those that said no,
Senator Jones, was first class and he topped it off with that signature
bowtie. Senator Jones is deeply missed. I miss him truly, but his
influence is with us today. I would like to thank Maryanne, who is up in
the gallery. Thank you Maryanne for sharing Ed with us. As we talked
about, he was a very adventurous person. Thank you for letting him
venture into the general assembly. To his daughters, Alicia and
Ginselle, to Andrea and Lineara, to those grandchildren, you know that
he loved dearly and spoke about you often. To Erma, Senator Jones
remained grateful to you and appreciative of all that you did for the
residents of the district, and more importantly, your loyalty. I would
like to say, personally, to Senator Apodaka and  President Berger, thank
you for all the that you lend in the transition of that office. We are
ever appreciative. Lastly, I will share a story. I was visiting with Ed,
and this is just to attest to the kind of character that he was, I was
visiting and we prayed together once in a hospital and he looked up to
me and said that he was fortunate, smiled, and he was very jovial or
laughable. He would keep you laughing. He looked up me and said that he
was so fortunate and blessed, and I said to him – Ed, what do you mean?
He said, in the midst of my situation, I have been afforded an
opportunity. So many people wake up every day assuming they are going to
come home and they don’t come home, they don’t get that chance. There
are car accidents and all kinds of things that take people away. It is
kind of interesting because riding up today, there were five accidents
and two detours off the 64 - how interesting. But he said, I have been
given an opportunity to get it right and to make preparations. I say to
everyone here – lets hold on to this legacy. Lets work every day to get
it right. Lets not take for granted any breath. Lets count our
blessings. One of the greatest blessings that I could ever count is
having known my friend, Ed Jones.
Speaker: Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To speak to resolution.
Speaker: Senator Brown has the floor to speak to resolution.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. I don’t know that I can add a
whole lot more than Senators Brown and Davis have added, but I will just
speak briefly what I think about Ed the most. Ed was kind of a soft
spoken guy: you never would seem him get too excited, he was an even
keeled guy, from what I remember most. One thing I will say, I don’t
think there was anyone in this chamber that did not respect Ed Jones. He
had the utmost respect of everybody just because of the way that he
carried himself each and every day. Ed never got up and spoke very much
on the floor but</p>

<p id="20:00">
One thing I always remembered most about Ed is when he got up to speak,
everybody listened, because he always had a message when he spoke. And I
think that was because of that true respect that we all had for Ed
Jones. I had the opportunity to go to his office several times, and ...
to talk about issues important to eastern North Carolina and to his
district, and he was always gracious, and he loved his district and
loved his family. We talked about that several times in his office as
well, and... Ed was just... became a pretty good friend of mine, and I'm
going to miss Ed Jones. He was just a special guy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As my colleagues have indicated, Ed really was that very special member,
somebody whose friendship I personally carry and someone who I enjoyed
many days and occasions with, whether speaking to him about the
political issues of the day or sitting back and just enjoying humor at
that snack bar or wherever we may find ourselves. He was a person of
great compassion, somebody who understood the needs of everyday people,
somebody who, as a former police chief, former state trooper, former
mayor, understood the needs of small towns, understood the needs of
individuals. When there were floods that impacted his district, he was
the first to come forward and ask us to pull together the resources to
help those people that were hurt. When there were tornadoes that
impacted his district, he was among the first who were out there helping
those people in need and coming back to here to rally for resources to
help those that had been impacted in a way that was profound in
affecting their lives.  He was certainly someone who understood that
when it came to poverty, that whatever that we could do as a state to
uplift those individuals was something that we should accept as a charge
and as a mission and serve with him on that poverty commission that he
established years ago.  I will greatly miss Ed for all that he did and
for all that he contributed. Nobody was probably more knowledgeable on
issues about law enforcement when they came before us. We all listened
to Ed's perspective. He served with dignity, he served with honor, he
served with class, and he served with integrity. We will all miss Ed for
his tremendous and significant contributions, but we thank his family
for allowing them the opportunity to let him serve time here in this
chamber with us, because it was certainly a major sacrifice that... and
he never realized that he was cheating himself of that time. I know in
his final days was spent a number of occasions visiting with him over at
Chapel Hill, the hospital, and even in those final hours he wanted to
continue serving.  There was never a time that he did not know what we
were discussing here. There was never a time that he was not aware. And
while the time was running out, he still carried that concern and that
commitment about the direction that we were taking. I know one day when
I was there I was talking to his wife and they said, &quot;Well, it
looks like he's going to be going home. We're going back home to
rest.&quot; And I thought at the time perhaps that was a good sign, that
perhaps things had taken a turn for the better. But I realize in
speaking with her that day that what it really meant was that there was
nothing further that anyone could do.  It was time for him to go back
home, and to be with his family in his final hours. We thank Ed for
giving so much of his life, so much of his time, to his state and to his
community, and we thank his family allowing us the privilege and honor
of having served with him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Is there any further discussion or debate?
Senators, we do have a leave of absence granted today for Senator
Newton.
Question before the Senate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger has the floor to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just briefly... I don't think I can add anything to what's already been
said other than Ed Jones is probably one of the finest men that I've
ever met, and I think, to a person, everyone in this chamber would agree
with that. His legacy, I think, is the memory that we all have of him
and how he carried himself, as was referred to. But it's just a pleasure
to have known him and it's a pleasure to know that people like that
serve in this body, so I commend the resolution...</p>

Senator Davis, do you yield?

Another attorney is after me.

I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I'm not after you, I want to make sure I understand, it's not only
who gets to testify, but it's who does the work and it applies to the
state lab as well and so for instance, I'm looking in section C4 lines
seventeen through twenty three and I'm having to scroll down to see what
page it is. We're getting there sir, page three. My concern isn't
testifying in court where there's a big backlog and wanting to drive
people up from Raleigh, I completely sympathize with that problem, but
it also seems to weaken the requirement of who can do the actual
analysis and it would seem like we wouldn't want to weaken the standard
for the state lab in terms of having people achieve a certain level of
certificate. Is it your intent to do that? And is it your understanding
that the bill does that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein all tests that the lab does are not equal and to require a
lab to do the DWI test can amount to having a physician take out a
splinter. It's just not practical. This is not rocket science to do
these things and we need to get these DWI offenders off the road and
this is a bill to accommodate, especially the western part of the state
and other rural communities as well. Because like I said, dozens of them
are being dismissed because we - sometimes the lab technician won't show
up in Raleigh because they're so busy, they're overloaded here.

takes the state auditor off of the committee on actuarial valuation of
retired employees health benefits and substitutes the Attorney General.
And it also allows the state auditor to do audits on the university
system. And this is a request by the university system.  Before, some of
them were doing - having different auditors from different places do the
audit on the university system, what this allows is to have some
semblance of certainty for all these things, they're held to the same
standard. I recommend this to you as well, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?  Senator Robinson, what are
purpose of your ayes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill's sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, I do not object this, I think that's good, but it was my
understanding - are you sure that the university system already is not -
there's a requirement that the state auditor does the auditing, or is
what the bill is saying?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's what the bill is saying. My understanding is they have the
flexibility to go to other auditors, that's why the auditor came to me
and asked for this and actually she was request - this bill was
requested by the university system, so that the audits basically lay on
top of one another, they're using the same language for the audits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok, I don't object to</p>

Speaker changes: Senator  Hise?? is recognized to explain the bill.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. President, members of the SENATE. Members
this bill comes as an emergency bill from the treasury , what we are
looking at here, it’s currently under state law, in addition to stocks
and bonds  that are owned  by the treasurer , there is an alternative
investment pool . There are five items in the investment pool and an
aggregate of those cannot exceed 34percent of the overall investments;
each one of those pools has an individual cap on it in the range of
somewhere between five percent and ten percent for each of those . In
order to simplify that because any one of those say five percent could
wind up exceeding  that cap through solid performance or poor
performance of the rest of the market moving forward. This eliminates
those individual caps and comes to an aggregate of 40 percent of the
investments that cannot be exceeded in alternative investments as well;
some other technical clarification to the treasurer’s investment block,
bill asks for your support.
Speaker changes: Any further discussion and debate. Hearing none the
question for the center to pass the bill 558 on its second reading . All
in favor vote aye, opposed no. Five seconds we will have for the voting

This legislation applies to appearance bonds where the defendant is
charged with a misdemeanor, except for offensives involving impaired
driving. It has three provisions. If the case or cases are not disposed
within 36 months of the date of the release on a bail bond, the surety's
obligation will automatically terminate, with the defendant remaining
obligated on the bond. With the consent of the Administrative Office of
the Courts, they are directed to modify the appearance bond to indicate
the 36-month term. This legislation is retroactive, so all existing
bonds, professional and surety bondsmen are obligated to provide written
notice to the defendant that their obligation under the bond will
terminate 36 months after the bond was provided. The intent of this
legislation is to alleviate the burden on our counties to house
defendants awaiting pretrial release. District attorneys and bail agents
were included in the discussions, and I know of no opposition to the
legislation. I ask for your support. Thank you, Mr. President.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 634, Increase Penalties/Utilities Theft.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, this bill is to combat
the rising problem of attempts by folks to bypass their gas meters and
hook up their houses and their businesses on their own, with such items
such as bicycle tubes and garden hoses. And as you can imagine, it
presents quite a public risk. There have been accidents. And what this
bill does is increases the criminal penalty for doing such acts as this.
This bill was well vetted in the Judiciary 2 Committee. Senator
McKissick asked us lots of questions, and I hope we answered all of his
questions. The penalties that are increased are consistent with the
Sentencing Commission guidelines, and I worked with ?? ?? and the Chair
of the Judiciary 2 Committee to get this right. Be happy to answer any
questions. I commend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Blue, for what
purpose do you rise?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, I can understand the danger associated with somebody
doing one of these tricks on gas or electricity, but what about water?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, I appreciate that. There are significant public health
risks to hooking up your water when you don't have back-flow regulators
in place and so forth--you can contaminate the whole water system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question for Senator Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I never got really clear, we were sort of going through a lot of agenda
items in J2, and you and Senator McKissick were going back and forth
about what actually is the liability of a landowner in this situation.
Could you just sort of review that so that I know and we all know what
has to happen for you to be criminally liable in this situation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Bryant. As you know, you have to be beyond a
reasonable doubt, culpable in an act such as this. If a tenant does it,
the landlord would not be responsible for that, but if the landlord's
involved, they certainly would be</p>

And subject to all the penalties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you yield, senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, I just wanted to make it clear that a landlord
could end up going to court because if there’s tamper with his prima
facie evidence, if the box is tampered with correct? I think I’m right.
If this prima facie evidence of the landowners’ responsibility or of the
landowners culpability, the landlord would have to go to court and tell
to the DA or somebody and say well it wasn’t me it was the tenant or
whatever they would wanna put forth. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As you know Senator Bryant, there’s a whole host of
scenarios that could occur and certainly it’s possible that landlord
could be looked at for prosecution is if they had somehow been
responsible for it. Just like any other citizen might be looked at and
investigated as a potential suspect in a crime. So that’s entirely
possible. If they didn’t have anything to do with it, then certainly the
state has to prove this case beyond reasonable doubt. So, thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 489 Consumer Finance Act Amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Gunn is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. We had some great discussion
on this bill Thursday. From that discussion came three amendments that I
think made a good bill even better. With that been said, I have no
further comments and appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the amendment on the dashboard, senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s coming up to the clerk now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You can send forth your amendment and let’s get it on
the dashboard before I recognize you to discuss it. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is on the dashboard senators. Senator Robinson is
recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. As you heard on last
Thursday, I had some concerns regarding consumer credit counselling and
how people get in to debt and don’t seem to have the education in terms
of financial literacy to understand what is going on with their credit
and how to get out of that, how to be better citizens in terms of paying
their bills etc. And so, I’m sending forth an amendment to require that
certain borrowers have consumer credit counselling. I’m not saying who
has to do the counselling but certainly that they have that. I assume
that most of us in here understand how to do that. But often times,
people get in the middle of large debts so that they can even have a
thousand dollars, don’t know how to pay it off. They default a couple of
times, they miss a few payments, they go back for re-finance link so
that they understand what is going on, how to better handle their
payments. If they’ve been late 2 or more payments or they deferred a
payment, they defaulted on the loan or they are re-financing an existing
loan. This is to help them to be aware of how to manage and most of you
in here, I assume all of us know how to manage. I know Senator Hise does
how to manage and I try to do this and I still but we have an obligation
to educate the rest of our citizens so that they are good citizens as
well in terms of paying their debt. So I [commit] the amendment.</p>

Senator Gunn, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Robinson, I think we all, generally speaking, want
people to make good decisions when it comes to credit. One thing I do
like I about Senate Bill 489 is that we do have  a lot of consumer
protections in it, including for our young military members, and keep in
mind you have to sit down face to face, you have to be qualified, you
have to have payments, this is an advertised loan. I think this bill
itself affords a lot of counseling, and it seems to me that this
particular amendment, if it were to be applied, may be shouldn’t be just
applied to this loan. I don’t think that this is the right avenue to do
that, I think this would be better served if was part of a broader based
counseling deal, so I would ask you to oppose the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment once more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson has the floor to speak on the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I want to say that, and I’ve said to Senator Gunn, while I
support and I want us to make sure that, as opposed to Visas and credit
card, that we have this as an alternative for people, and that’s a good
thing. But I also think that we have an obligation, some of the data
that was pulled up showed that 279,000 of the loans or 61% were made to
people and the loan size is $1000 to $3000 and the next size $3000 to
$5000. 64,000 loans were made. That indicates that these are people who
are the working people who have some financial issues, something’s going
on they had to borrow that money. They may run into default, they may
have to refinance, etc. They’re having problems, oftentimes they don’t
know how to get out of that. All companies don’t do that. I think it’s
imperative that we give people that kind of information so that they can
make good decisions. I know that some of the financiers have said that
those folks may go somewhere else. Well, if they are good
businessperson, those people are going to return to them. They’re going
to return and borrow money once they pay off that debt. If I were you, I
wouldn’t want anybody defaulting, I’d lend them some more money. That
means that you’re going to go to court and you’re not going to get your
money back anyway. I think this is something that we ought to have in
the law so that we are looking out for our citizens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate.  Senator Gunn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just quickly, let me reiterate that to tag this particular provision on
this one loan avenue to  me is not appropriate, there’s any other number
of loans out there in other states. Credit cards that don’t have these
type of revisions and I would ask you to oppose this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill’s sponsor asks you to oppose the amendment. Is there any
further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the passage of amendment seven. All in favor vote aye, all
opposed vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk
will record the vote.
15 having voted in the affirmative and 33 in the negative, amendment
seven fails, Senate Bill 489 is back before the body. Any further
discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a last time on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I’m very disappointed that we did not add this. The credit
union has this type of small loan and they do require it, actually. But
what I’m really disappointed at is that this is an unsophisticated
borrower. Very often, with a minimal education struggling, they’re not
making comfortable wages. They are struggling. And for us to take
advantage of them, not us, this industry to take advantage of them
really bothers me. There was an amendment last week which blended
anybody who is taking a loan up to $15,000, but that ‘s disingenuous
because people who need to borrow $15,000 can go to a regular bank and
get a 6 to 7% loan. 94% of these loans, 94% are less than $7,500 so
giving that break to those people who supposedly are going to do the
$15,000 is meaningless. We are hurting people getting them into a cycle
of debt. We have statistics that show this cycle of debt occurring over
and over again. And if we take the military out because it might hurt
the military...</p>

counted him to be a dear friend. Without going on and on, he was quite
an example to me about civility and being a humble man and working
together on issues even when you don’t agree with folks on the other

floor when he requested that at some point in time it would be nice if
we could all kind of swap seats up and not be the back row and the front
row, and maybe at some point Senator Berger would have been able to do
that, but that was one vote I did not want to miss. I’m sorry I wasn’t
here for it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Any other notices or
announcements? Is there any further business to come before the Senate?
If not, the Chair recognizes Senator Berger for a motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate do now adjourn
in memory of Senator Ed Jones, subject to the referral and re-referral
of bills and resolutions and the receipt of messages from the House and
the Governor, to reconvene on Tuesday May 7 2013 at 2 pm. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The motion is the Senate do now adjourn subject to the
stipulations stated by Senator Berger, to reconvene Tuesday May 7th at 2
pm, seconded by Senator Davis. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. The ayes have it. The Senate stands
adjourned.</p>
