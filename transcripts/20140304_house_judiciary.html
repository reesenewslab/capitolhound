  [background chatter and laughter] I would like to welcome everyone to
Judiciary 1. We have a nice crowd of people here today. A lot of
television people are here, we’re awfully glad to have them. Everybody
fix their tie so they look good. We, our first bill is gonna be Senate
Bill 2 and today when we decided to hear this bill there’s a number of
people that called the office and wanted to speak and so today we’re not
gonna have a vote but we’re gonna have public input from those who have
asked to speak, and I’ve got a list of eight names from those who would
like to speak, but before we do that though, I would like to introduce
Senator Newton who is the sponsor of the bill. He is my senator. He
lives in Wilson. He’s an outstanding legislator and he will explain the
bill [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,
Chairman Doughtry. I appreciate the opportunity to be back here again
for a House J Committee and so the new name, J1, I’ll get used to it
eventually and I’m sure everyone else will too. I appreciate being here.
And so this bill had quite a bit of discussion and commentary and
vetting in the Senate side. We had a long committee hearing on the bill
and a very long debate, and I’m sure folks have read a lot in the media
about what this bill supposedly does or what it doesn’t do and so forth,
so I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to speak with you about
it. I’d first like to say that the genesis of this bill is really not
what is so many folks perceive it to be. The genesis of this bill really
came out of a situation with the administrative office of the courts
sending forth guidance to the magistrates and courts personnel about how
to deal with the change that has been brought before us from the federal
courts regarding Amendment 1 and how would the court personnel go on and
deal with it. Unfortunately that letter back in October cast it in a way
that essentially put a lot of folks in the magistrate’s offices and the
register deed’s offices that have religious objections to performing
same sex marriage in a very difficult position of having to chose
between their sincerely held religious beliefs, in essence religious
freedom, and what they were being in essence threatened with by the AOC
which the letter included the threat of possible criminal prosecution if
they didn’t perform. Senator Berger and others in the Senate, and I’m
not sure if there were people in the House but there may have been, but
in the Senate there were a number of folks that sent a letter to the
Director, John Smith, and asked him to revise this letter that what was
required of the state was an effort to accommodate the religious freedom
of employees of the magistrates and register of deeds offices and we had
a lot of debate on the Senate floor about that, but I don’t think
there’s really as much legal controversy as some would let on about this
requirement. The folks, employers are required to make an effort to
accommodate folks’ sincere religious belief and that includes the free
exercise of their religious beliefs, which also includes if I may, their
clearly not being forced to do something that they have sincere
objection to, so really this was a failure of common sense in my view of
how to deal with it. There were a number of counties that had been able
to internally work out their systems for those folks who felt they just
could not participate in this

  <p id="05:00">
  to do things like work the graveyard shift when there wouldn&#39;t be
requests for civil ceremonies and things of that sort but this letter
did none of that. This letter said, essentially, you will comply, you
will do it whether you like it or not. And many of us felt that that was
the wrong way to go. So this bill essentially lays out the framework no
which we&#39;re going to balance the religious freedom for employees of
the court system versus the requirement that we serve all of our
citizens and that we comply with lawful court orders regarding the new
definition of marriage that the courts have discovered. So essentially
what this bill does is it sets out the framework for, in particular
let&#39;s use magistrates as an example, if a magistrate has an
objection, that it&#39;s their sincere religious belief that they
can&#39;t participate in a marriage of some kind that they have the
right to recuse themself but they don&#39;t get to pick and choose. They
recuse themself from doing all marriages. So you&#39;re not going to
have a magistrate who will do it for one couple but won&#39;t do it for
another couple. That&#39;s prohibited under this bill. Essentially this
bill ensures that all couples that seek to be married in a civil
ceremony are going to be treated exactly the same way. It also sets out
for the first time the minimum amount of time that a magistrates office
will have to be available to perform civil ceremonies. So there&#39;s
been some confusion about what magistrates may be required to do versus
other folks. Ultimately, if all, hypothetically if all the magistrates
in a certain county were to recuse themselves, the ultimate
responsibility for ensuring that all marriages are done falls upon the
chief district court judge. Legally that is very sound because elected
officials are not immune from the requirement that they may have to do
things that they have an objection for. In other words, there&#39;s not
an exception for them under Title 7, by definition. So, in essence, I
may have rambled on here, Mr. Chairman, for a while, but in essence what
this does is it preserves religious freedom for those who would object
to participating in certain kinds of marriage ceremonies. It gives them
a common sense way to recuse themselves and withdraw and at the same
time preserves the right of all couples, regardless of their sexual
orientation, to be able to expect service from the state of North
Carolina and ensures that the state of North Carolina is in compliance
with lawful court orders. We talked a lot about the magistrates,
essentially it is the same process for the employees of the registered
deeds office and, with that, I&#39;d be happy to answer questions from
the committee and if there are none or in short order I do have another
appointment that I backed off to be here today but I appreciate the
opportunity to explain the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions from the committee to Senator Newton? Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I had a little confusion, I thought we were
here on another bill this morning but I understand it got rescheduled. I
wanted to ask a question about, Senator Newton, about the financial
impact of this. How is the, if a magistrate decides to not do his sworn
duty and he takes himself out of the ability to do that for a six month
period, is his pay then adjusted for his inability or refusal to do his
sworn duty for that period of time and are the other members who would
be on the staff that have to take up those duties, are they additionally
compensated?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, thank you, thank you Representative Hall. So I would first
take issue with

  <p id="10:00">
  you&#39;re with you characterization of refusal to do sworn duty that is
improper in my view of how to describe what it is for. What I would say
is refusal to basically concede their sincerely religious beliefs and
concede to orders from an administrator in Raleigh and not bend to the
will of being threatened with prosecution that&#39;s how I would
describe it. It&#39;s a question of religious freedom and as you know
and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re well aware and everybody in this room is
well aware the first amendment has been with us since the creation of
the republic and our own article one section thirteen of our own
constitution is very clear about matters of conscience and religious
belief in our state. So, the task falls to us to balance these things.
To answer you question specifically the information that we have
received from physical staff is that there&#39;s no anticipated cost
what so ever. There still are magistrates and there still is a chief
district court judge and all of those people are still employed and
there will be civil ceremonies regardless of whether one does it or not.
And as you know I&#39;m sure there are many, many, many duties that
magistrates perform. Civil ceremonies is actually a tiny portion of they
perform. So honestly the ability to adjust on or two magistrates in an
office and have someone else do this very small minimal part of their
job really should not bring any cost to the state at all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McNeil.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Actually I don&#39;t have a question of senator Newton but I
would like to take off on that last question. And make somebody explain
this to me. I&#39;m not a lawyer but I did some research on this and
where the magistrates and seven eight two ninety two it says that
it&#39;s additional powers on the magistrate. And if you go down and
look in that section it talks about it. Well now, we&#39;ve heard duty,
I&#39;m not a lawyer but I know the word duty and the word power are two
different words. So is it a magistrates duty or is it one of it&#39;s
powers? I know as a sworn law enforcement officer I took an oath of
office to uphold the law. But I had a lot of digression in my job. I
didn&#39;t have to write everybody I saw speeding a ticket. So did I
neglect my duty as a law enforcement officer? And back to his point
about the constitution, I just think there are a lot of grey areas here.
I think it&#39;s a great bill, I think it fixes the problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Mr. Chairman can I respond? I&#39;ll just get with you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, I know you&#39;ve got members of the public here
that I think want to speak. I&#39;ve got plenty of questions on this
bill and I&#39;m quite happy to hold them off until a future opportunity
the Chair wanted to open it up to the public as you see fit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any more questions of senator Newton? If not we&#39;ll hear from the
public.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair apologies just to confirm, is it your intent that we have a
future opportunity to question the bills sponsor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may Mr. Chairman, I&#39;ll be happy to answer your questions
privately or publicly any time you wish representative Martin. I&#39;ll
enjoy the conversation always. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think senator Newton has got to leave. But we&#39;ll have another
opportunity down the road to answer more questions. As I mentioned
earlier were are a number of calls regarding and opportunity to speak.
And the first person who&#39;s name is on the list is Lorraine Lungran.
If you&#39;d come up here please. The time limit is three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon. I am the reverend Lorraine Lungran an Episcopal priest
serving a congregation here in the capital city. I happen to be married
to an Episcopal priest. Also represent my bishop the right reverend
Michael B. Curry who could not be present with us today. I believe

  ...park way overfly ?? on Sunday. Whenever we obliquely or overtly ??
discrimination in our laws we violate the duty of government in this
land to protect equally the rights of individuals across the spectrum of
persons living within our bounds. I urge this bill not become law in
North Carolina because first, government officials take an oath to
impartially and faithfully discharge the powers of their office or
duties, depending on the interpretation. Basing on an individual&#39;s
religious beliefs the denial of, or limitations of services offered by
our government does not to me uphold that oath. Second, Senate Bill 2
stands to violate my sincerely held religious beliefs in that I believe
all persons are created in the image and likeness of God and thereby
deserve the access, support and protection of their governmental
representatives at all levels. That means couples legally entitled to a
marriage license or to ask a magistrate to officiate at their marriage,
need to be granted their rights during all regular business hours. If
this bill was in effect when I sought to be married, I might have been
denied a license because someone&#39;s religious beliefs may not have
adhered to the fact that women can be ordained or that they would not
think that a clergy couple should be married to one another. Third,
marriage is a civil right, holy matrimony is the is the ?? of safe
communities. Each of which currently holds the freedom to administer
that sacrament in accordance to their traditions. Clergy are not
currently compelled to officiate any couple&#39;s marriage whether they
be straight or gay. I believe defeat of senate bill 2 best supports the
common good of the people and officials of North Carolina. Thank you.
[speaker changes] Next name on the list is Sarah Preston A.C.L.U.
[speaker changes] Mr. Chairman, while she&#39;s approaching just a quick
administrative question. We are having the people that are testifying to
come to the front so we can make sure we hear them and we can see them
for media convenience, is that what we are trying to do? [speaker
changes] For the media, the media asked for them to come up here
[speaker changes] Sure. [speaker changes] I&#39;m just trying to
accomodate them [speaker changes] Yes sir. [speaker changes] Thank you.
Good afternoon, my name is Sarah Preston. I&#39;m the Policy Director
for the A.C.L.U. of North Carolina. As an organization committed to
protecting both the religious liberty of all people, as well as the
equal rights of gay, lesbian, transgender, and bisexual individuals, the
A.C.L.U. is deeply troubled by Senate bill 2. It should not be the
policy of the general assembly to allow governenment officials to pick
and choose which job duties they wish to perform. It is a fundamental
missunderstanding of civil marriage to perform. It is a fundamental
missunderstanding of civil marriage that magistrates perform that has
led to introduction of this bill. As Judge Perry ?? a former magistrate
explained in a recently in ??, any magistrate who resignes over
religious objections to performing same sex marriages is confusing a
magistrates responsibility to conduct civil marriages with a member of
the clergy&#39;s ability to sanctify a marriage. Magistrate do not
sanctify marriages and they never have. They perform civil ceremonies
and shouldn&#39;t have the ability to deny that service to anyone,
regardless of their sexual orientation, race or religion. The U.S.
Consitition protects the free excercise of religion and ensures that no
clergy member would ever be forced to sanctify a marriage with which
they disagree. Under the law, no church can be compelled to perform that
falls outside of their faith traditions. But government is different.
Public officials should treat everyone equally under the law and a
magistrates oath demands it. If the legislature passes this bill
allowing magistrates to refuse to do a job duty and uphold their oath,
what is the next category of government official that will refuse to do
part of their job, and what job responsibility will it be. It has been
almost 40 years since 2 foresythe County magistrates refused to perform
a civil marriage for Carol Anne and Thomas Person. Because they had
religious objection to marrying a white woman and..

  American man. The persons were recently profiled in high point
enterprise where Caroll Ann described hearing about magistrates refusing
to marry gay and lesbian couples saying, I feel like it’s the same
thing. Whether you are gay or interracial, a Jew or a gentile,
magistrates have no right to decide who you marry. North Carolina has
moved past this era of allowing government officials to use religion, or
religious freedom as an excuse to deny government services to otherwise
qualified residents, or impose a government official’s beliefs on
somebody else, and Senate bill 2 would return us to those days. We would
respectfully ask this committee to reject this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Reverend Terrence Leathers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon everyone. I’ve got it, thank you chairman. My name is Dr.
Terrence Leathers, and I have the privilege to serve as pastor of Mount
Vernon Christian Church in that small bedroom community known as
Clayton, North Carolina. I raise my, I raise my voice today because I
stand in opposition of Senate bill 2. In my opinion, any bill that
allows government officials to opt out of their duty in providing the
LGBTQ community their legal right to marry is unwarranted and
discriminatory in nature. First, government officials swear an oath to
faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of their office. When
public officials seek to deny services to tax paying citizens based on
their religious beliefs, they are not living up to their oath, and they
are not serving the common good. Second, in America we believe that the
government should treat everyone equally under the law, and not
discriminate. Government officials who have sworn an oath to serve the
public shouldn’t be able to pick and choose who they are going to serve
based on their religious beliefs. Third, gay people are our sons.
They’re our daughters, sisters, brothers, parents, friends, neighbors,
and coworkers. They work hard serving the military and pay taxes. When
they walk into the government office, they should be treated like anyone
else and not be discriminated against. And lastly, let me say that I can
understand the reluctance of some who may not want to perform a civil
marriage. In all honestly, there’s some reluctance and unreadiness in
the very core of who I am. This is a journey for me. However, I know
that houses of worship and clergy have the constitutional and protective
freedom to determine which marriages they will and won’t perform in
their faith traditions. No church could be forced to perform a marriage
that goes against its religious beliefs, however you are the government,
and you must care for and address the personhood rights of all people
that live and work here in North Carolina. You may agonize over it and
even dislike it personally, but as a government official, do the right
thing. Do not pass this bill.

Next speaker is Chris Sgro. Is that right? How do you pronounce your
last name?

Good afternoon. I’m Chris Sgro. I’m the executive director of Equality
North Carolina, North Carolina’s LGBT rights and advocacy organization
representing over 250,000 LGBT North Carolinians. I’ll be brief. I’m
here today to talk about the real harms presented by Senate bill 2 to my
community and to the state. SB 2 is not about religious freedom. It is
not a compromise that strikes an appropriate balance. It is a, it is a
problematic piece of legislation that puts the state on a slippery slope
where public officials can opt out of providing which essential services
they provide. SB 2 is not about whether you support it or support now
same sex marriage. This is about whether you believe taxpayer funded
public employees can choose which parts of their job they will or will
not do. Magistrates are the only people who can conduct civil marriages
in the state of North Carolina. Now, I am a Roman Catholic, and I know
that my home parish priest will not officiate my marriage, and he should
not have to, as it would violate his faith tradition, and the marriage
equality ruling that happened in October did nothing to change that.
We’re talking about civil servants in a civil matter. We cannot set the
precedent that

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jeff Thigpen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair, members of the committee. I&#39;m Jeff Thigpen,
the Guilford County register of deeds. I&#39;m here today more as a
county department director and a manager than anything else. I&#39;m
also an elected official and a former county commissioner. Some areas
that I have concerned about related to this bill particularly has to do
with my daily operations. For example, over the past 12 months, my
office has done 3,600 marriage licenses, 265 of which have been same sex
marriages. We also do other duties in terms of 6,100 marriage copies,
2,600 birth, certified birth copies. We do 66,000 real estate
transactions in a year. Since the great recession, my office has gone
from 33 full time and 3 part time staffers to 25. If this bill were
passed as it were currently written, will I have two members of my staff
that would ask for religious recusal? Would I have five? Would I have
seven? And also, the way the bill is written, the employee puts the
register on notice as regards to their religious objection. They&#39;re
given full power without question to state the religious objection and
immediately be exempted, not just from a marriage license they disagree
with, but from all marriage license, and as you will see, I just said we
did 30, we did 60, 3,600 marriage licenses. 265 of those were same sex
couples. So this is a bill that when you talk about the pragmatics of
it, it puts me in a significant disadvantage in terms of staffing. The
sincerely held religious objection is not at all defined. If a Catholic
employee discovers that an applicant is applying for a second marriage,
can they object? There&#39;s no due diligence here. The bill doesn&#39;t
give local elected officials any flexibility to determine for example
with their county attorneys whether or not there are significant
practical burdens that may happen and or whether the religious objection
is clear and defensible. Okay, thank you. If I need additional staffing,
I would have to go to my county commissioners to get an additional staff
member. If they approved it, I&#39;d have to interview that staff
person, or the potential applicant. Can I ask them whether or not they
would religiously recuse themselves from issuing a marriage license when
based on the short staffing I may end up having because of this issue,
they were religiously recused from in the first place. So I&#39;m trying
to fix a problem that might actually continually be a problem.
There&#39;s been no formal discussion on this in my association. Our
legislative coach here is here today, Wayne Rash who&#39;s a wonderful
register out of Caldwell county. I think it would behoove the committee
to slow down a little bit and look at how and what the practical
implications of this bill may be not on urban counties, but also rural
counties as well who have small staff members who may be recused and not
be able to provide the services they need for their citizens. That&#39;s
a major concern that we&#39;ve got to work through, where the rubber
meets the road. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chairman, members of the committee, I&#39;m Reverend Mark Creech,
executive director of the Christian Action League. The Christian Action
League wishes to express its appreciation for what we believe to be very
critical legislation. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to believe that we have
arrived at a time when such proposed legislation would be needed in our
state, but nonetheless here we are. One of the prominent opponents of
this measure has argued, and I quote, it goes without saying that the
first amendment already protects their religious freedom. No one can
tell any North Carolina magistrate or any other public official what
they can or cannot believe, but if they want to be magistrates in North
Carolina, they cannot stop doing their jobs simply because they
don&#39;t want to follow the law

  That exists, but such statements I suggest fail to fully recognize the
purpose of the free exercise clause of our cherished first ammendment,
the freedom to practice one’s religion. It doesn’t simply mean that one
can believe whatever religious tenets he wishes in the solitude of his
own home or in the privacy of his religious organization’s established
place of worship, but it means that one can practice freely the
teachings of their faith in public, in the public square, without the
authorization or endorsement of the state or fear of reprisal. Signor of
the constitution William Livingston said, “Consciences of men are not
the objects of human legislation. How beautiful appears our expansive
constitution in disclaiming all jurisdiction over the souls of men and
securing by a never to be repealed section the voluntary unchecked moral
suasion of every individual. Our tradition is always been not to
interfere with the practice of religion and if there is a law that
perhaps is deemed necessary to interfere, then the state is to use the
least restrictive means possible for achieving a compelling state
interest and if an exemption would avoid that religious interference
then it should be granted.” Senate Bill 2, the legislation that is
before you, represents, I suggest, the best of what we’ve always
believed in North Carolina and what we’ve believed as a nation
concerning the freedom to practice one’s faith, and may I say in
response to Mr. President’s remark that somehow that there’s some
confusion here about performing a civil ceremony or sanctifying the
marriage let me just say that some of these magistrates and registers of
deeds are concerned that they would be forced to perform what they
believe is not a marriage. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Tony Coch.

All right. My name’s Tony Coch. I’m a small business owner. I want to
get the business perspective on this that I see out. I have a production
company, a media production company. I’ve had it for 22 years. I have 20
employees now in Raleigh, I also have 15 in Vancouver now and we’re
getting ready to open up in New York City and it’s exciting times. We’re
growing by leaps and bounds, but the stress of that is to try to find
really nationally qualified, talented people to work with me, to embed
in my team, and to specifically see how this bill and others like it, it
creates a, what others tell me is a hostile environment to people they
care about, to themselves, people they love, in North Carolina. The New
York Office is specifically designed because I can’t get people to come
here to work for me. I have one person who’s a remarkable talent in New
York City. He really is one of the key people for the next bit of growth
in our company. He’s been in the city a while. He’s been married to his
wife for 6-7 years. I think they’re ready to have kids. I can offer them
so much here, right? He wants a yard and a minivan and I can give him
that. I can show him such a great place here, quality schools, safe
environments for the kids, and the one reason he won’t move here is
specifically because of what he perceives as a hostile environment in
North Carolina, not to him, I think his brother’s gay, many of his
friends are gay, that’s the one thing that keeps him from coming to
North Carolina. Another point in running a small business is obviously
I’ve gotta go make money. I’ve gotta close deals. I spend most of my
time up in New York, Boston, Vancouver, the West Coast, and what is done
in North Carolina is directly associated with me when I go into these
meetings

  and very specific point one of my clients up in Armonk, top fortune one
hundred company has a million and a half dollars in my revenue every
year in his pocket. He&#39;s gay. I have to fight that every time some
sort of bill some sort of legislation rumors come out that seem to
create a hostile environment here that&#39;s associated to me that makes
those bills difficult. I want to expand I want to grow, I want to keep
it here because this is the state I love this is where I grew up I am
North Carolinian by birth. These sort of things work against us
everyday. And I&#39;m asking you not to vote for this bill simply
because I just want to do my business I want to grow and it stops with
this sort of thing, thanks.

Thank you Mr. Chairman members of the committee I&#39;m John Rustin
president of the North Carolina family policy council. I&#39;d like to
begin my remarks by reading to you a provision from the United States
Constitution and the North Carolina Constitution. Amendment one of the
United States Constitution says Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
Article one section thirteen of the North Carolina Constitution says all
persons have a natural and inalienable right to worship all might god
according to the dictates of their own conscience and no human authority
shall in any case whatever control or interfere with the right of
conscience. Senate bill two is a very reasonable balanced approach to
dealing with a very specific circumstance that we have in North
Carolina. Since the federal court rulings forced the legal recognition
of same sex unions on our state last fall a number of magistrates and
register of deeds staff have found themselves in a highly conflicted
situation. Although the issuance of marriage licences is a function of
register of deeds offices and solemnizing civil marriages is a function
of magistrates offices some individuals serving in these offices and in
these positions have a sincerely held religious belief that marriage is
only the union of one man and one woman. And to participate in a union
of a same sex couple would require them to violate their sincerely held
religious beliefs. As you heard earlier the statutes that outline the
duties and functions of registers of deeds and of magistrates in North
Carolina are set by the North Carolina general assembly the are under
your purview and it is perfectly appropriate if you deem necessary to
amend those laws. As you heard earlier from Senator Newton the
administrative office of the court sent out a directive to magistrates
and I want to quote a couple of sections from that. All magistrates must
treat same sex marriages for which a marriage licence has been issued by
the register of deeds the same way marriages between a man and a woman
are scheduled and conducted. It further more states that if a magistrate
refuses to discharge the duties of his or her office including a refusal
to perform a marriage of a same sex couple, that refusal is grounds for
suspension or removal from office and paraphrased as well as criminal
charges. Thank you. Senate bill two would address this problem by
enabling assistant and deputy registers of deeds to recuse themselves
from issuing all marriage licences and would enable magistrates to
recuse themselves from performing all lawful marriages for a period of
at least six months. Magistrates and register of deeds staff will not be
able to pick and choose which marriages they participate in but they
would recuse from participating in all marriages. This will ensure that
marriage certificates will continue to be issued in all one hundred
counties of the state and that there will be a magistrate or another
judicial official that would perform those marriage ceremonies. So to
suggest that marriages will stop in North Carolina is just not factual.
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That ends the speakers list. We have had eight speakers. Would somebody

…In my remarks but I did want to kind of give you some faults, some
mistakes Register of Deeds Association I’m here today on behalf of the
North Carolina Associations and Register of Deeds, my name is Wayne L.
Rash, Register of Deeds at Caldwell County. The state, the Register of
Deeds Association is not abdicating for or against this bill; I want to
let that be known first we are not taking a position on the bill itself.
However, we do have some very serious concerns about the implementation
of the bill and how that would work especially for our smaller counties,
we did a survey to find out and some of you may have seen this
information but the number of employees in each of our 100 Register of
Deed’s offices 42 of our counties have three or fewer employees in the
Register of Deed’s Office, of those 23 counties have only two employees
and then we have eight counties that only have one employee in the
office besides the Elected Register of Deeds. So our concern is with the
passage of this bill is--how would that work for especially those
smaller counties if there is one employee in the office, if there is two
employees in the offices, the chances are much greater that they may
opt-out of that then if you have a larger county, ?? who has 25 or 30
employees. So the concern becomes how does that work and the bill that’s
currently written would ask the Elected Register of Deeds to do all of
those marriage licenses. That becomes impractical to ask the Elected
Register of Deeds to be there for 52 weeks of the year, Monday to
Friday, 08:00 to 05:00 everyday. So again, we are not abdicating against
the bill but what I ask that you at least consider some accommodation
for those smaller counties, if there is someway to do that I see in the
bill that for the magistrates there is an expectation that at least
marriages be performed for 10 hours a week, if there is some ability to
put an accommodation in there for Register of Deeds staff, especially in
these smaller counties because I have much concern for those counties
about when and how and how that would work for those counties. So that
would be my comments and thank you for that consideration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Anybody else in the public would like to speak? If not the meeting is
adjourned.
