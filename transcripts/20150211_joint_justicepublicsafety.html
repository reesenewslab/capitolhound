  Would everybody take their seats? I don&#39;t know if this mic is
working, is it seem to be working? Alright, good enough. Okay, thank
you. The sergeant at arms will close the doors and everybody take their
seat, we&#39;ll get our committee meeting started. We&#39;ve got a
rather extensive presentation and we&#39;re going to sort of change the
way we&#39;re doing it this morning. This is going to be a pretty
complicated presentation so, except for you gentlemen who are attorneys
and experienced in law enforcement and other things, we&#39;re just
going to take questions as we go. So if you all have a question, rather
than get so far along and then you forget what questions, because
I&#39;d like to air these questions that you have. I was told to
recognize the sergeant at arms and the pages, so I&#39;m going to do
that. Thank you, Maria. Let&#39;s see who we got. House Sergeant at Arms
Barry Moore, Barry, good to have you here. You look like you could
handle on the House side. If we have any problems we&#39;ll be calling
on you. B.H. Powell, B.H., good to have you here and David Lithkin,
David, good to have you here. And the Senate Sergeant at Arms Larry
Hancock, Larry, where are you? Okay, Larry, good to have you here, and
Giles Jeffries, Giles, good to have you here. Okay now let&#39;s see.
We&#39;re supposed to have two pages. You all folks stand up.
Cumberland, Rick Glazier has a, and I&#39;m not sure how to pronounce
this, if you wouldn&#39;t mind pronouncing your first name.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hello, my name is ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well thank you much and we&#39;re glad to have you here, hope you learn
a lot and hope you never have to experience any of the things that a lot
of these folks have to offer. Maybe you&#39;ll be a counselor or other
things. James Berry III from Wake County and you&#39;re Representative
is Brigadier General Gary Pendleton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are you the General or is he the General?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think he&#39;s the General.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good. Well we represent the military, too, here. So good to have you
here and glad you&#39;re interested and hope you learn a lot but we
won&#39;t allow you to ask questions. But you&#39;ll meet all these
people, all these representatives and senators, etc. So if you have any
questions, if you have any questions about law enforcement or anything
related to it, there&#39;s somebody in this room that will answer it,
and if they don&#39;t they&#39;ll pretend to. But anyway, alright, so
let&#39;s get started. We&#39;ve got, let&#39;s see, where&#39;s my
sheet? Yeah, that&#39;s what I need. Thank you. Overview of Structured
Sentencing, this is complicated but we got someone that can answer, I
can assure you because I&#39;ve served on this committee. John ??, John,
if you would. Wherever John is. Oh yeah, here he is. Come on up John.
Does any of the subcommittees chairs, I mean, not subcommittees but
committee chairs have any comments before we begin? Either side? Hearing
none, it&#39;s all yours John.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. On behalf of the
Sentencing Commission and our Chairman, Judge Spainhour, I want to thank
you for inviting us here today and letting us have this opportunity to
talk with you about structured sentencing. I see so many familiar faces
around here that I feel like a lot of you could give this presentation
about the same as I could now. But hopefully we can answer some
questions for you in the next hour and give you a better understanding
of what structured sentencing is about. I would also like to introduce
here our Executive Director Susan

  And our Associate Director for Research Jenny Hebner and Rebecca Murdoch
from the research and policy associates. They&#39;re here to help answer
questions and provide anything you might need. Today over the next hour
I&#39;d like to cover at least four areas here. I&#39;d like to begin
with just a brief overview of who the sentencing commission is, give you
an idea of who these people are and why we&#39;re here, and then talk
about structured sentencing. First, the timeline, the history of how it
got to where it is today and then we&#39;ll spend the bulk of the time
talking about the basic elements of structured sentencing, the different
components and how it all works together and what the policies are that
underly those elements and then your staff also asked us to talk briefly
about maybe some of the impact that structured sentencing has had on the
criminal justice system. As the chairman said, I certainly invite your
questions along the way and hopefully that will help clarify anything
that I might say to you at this point. I do want to point out our
website is listed on your handout, on the slides as well. We&#39;re part
of the judicial branch, so we&#39;re off of the NCcourts.org website,
and on there you can find just about any information you might need. The
punishment charts are posted there electronically. We have lists of
felony offences, misdemeanor offences, all of the studies that the
commission produces, the reports they provide to the General Assembly
are posted there as well as all of our contact information. Should you
have a question in the future, you&#39;re welcome to contact us by
either phone or email. So the first question is then who is the
sentencing commission? The commission was actually created back in 1990.
We&#39;ve been around for 25 years now, it hardly seems like it. The
General Assembly put them together essentially to come up with
sentencing structures for use in the court system. This commission was
designed to be first of all experienced, to draw together a lot of
experience from the field. Also to be independent and objective. We have
28 members at this point representing all areas of the criminal justice
system. We have a police chief and a sheriff, we have a district court
and superior court judge, a prosecutor and a defense attorney, the
commissioner of corrections serves on there as well, we have victims
representatives. We also have legislative members. We&#39;re pleased to
have Representative Jackson, Representative Faircloth and Representative
Daughtry as members here. We also have three Senate members and Senator
Bingham is a former member of the commission, so we have appreciated
their input as well. It was designed to be independent in that all the
members are non-partisan, they&#39;re appointed by leadership from all
three branches of government, and finally they do bring their experience
to the table. All of these members are volunteers, they have other jobs,
full time jobs in the system, but they bring all that experience to the
table, but they also look at empirical information. They try to do their
analysis based on statewide data not just anecdotal evidence and
hopefully that produces a better product. Originally when the commission
was created they had a very large mandate. The mandate was to develop
the structures for use in the courts, also to classify felony offences
and misdemeanor offences, also wanted to develop a continuum of
community corrections, come up with programs that would cover the whole
spectrum of needs in the community and finally to develop a population
simulation model, a computer model that helps us project what resources
we need based on the policies that are put in place. Well, the
commission worked for about three years on this project, put together an
entire package and brought it to the General Assembly in 1993. The
General Assembly spent the entire year studying that, pulling it apart,
looking at each piece of it and eventually passed it at the end of the
1993 session. The laws took effect at in October of 1994, so structured
sentencing has been in the laws in North Carolina for over 20 years now.
There have been some modifications along the way. In 1995 after the
first year of implementation, the General Assembly added a few
punishments, increased some of the punishments simply in response to the
feel, what they found as they started to work within the system, then in
2009, several years later, the General Assembly adjusted policies again
to deal with a projected growth in the prison population. This was a way
of curbing that projected growth and finally, probably the most
significant change recently was in 2011 when you enacted the Justice
Reinvestment

  Speaker 1: Dealt in large part with probation nerds[?] and new ways of
dealing with people in the community. If you look in your handouts you
can see a copy of, you can see a copy of the grid on page ten, towards
the back, but before the commission ever addressed the grid and came up
with the details of it, they first set down a set of principles that
they wanted to put in place, goals they wanted to achieve with this new
structure, and there were five principles. First one was Truth in
Sentencing.
At the time the commission was created felons for example served about
19% of the sentence that the court imposed. Generally they were
released, uh, parole release, they were given a great deal of credit on
top of that, and they were serving about 19% So the first goal was Truth
in sentencing. That whatever sentence the judge imposed would be the
time the offender would serve, there wouldn&#39;t be that tremendous
reduction to it.
Second goal was that the structure would provide consistency and
certainty in sentencing. That offenders who commit similar offences and
have a similar type of prior record would get similar sentences, there
wouldn&#39;t be a great deal of disparity depending upon what district
you were in, or what judge you were in front of, So that they were
similar going across the state in every court.
The third goal was to provide a rational basis for the sentence. To be
able to explain why they got what they got. This is based on the
seriousness of their offence and the seriousness of their prior record.
When you look at those two factors things that everybody can see and can
be easily pulled out, and then that is the basis for the sentence they
receive
The last two principles they set out deal with resources because that
was an issue as well when the commission was created. First one was to
set priorities for the use of the resources. The commission realized
that prison and jail beds were the most expensive resource, and there
was a limited number of them. We couldn&#39;t put everyone into a prison
or a jail bed. That was the problem we were facing at the time. So they
decided that only the most serious offences and offenders, violent
offenders repeat offenders, Those are the ones that they would designate
the jail beds for, the prison beds. Those who have nonviolent offenses
have little or no prior record they would use more of the community
corrections, the less expensive sanctions. So this structure was
designed to help prioritize that.
And the last goal was to balance the policies and the resources.
Whatever policies they came up with they want to use, especially the
correctional simulation model they developed, to determine what sort of
resources would be needed.
How many beds will you need, how many probation slots, how many
community corrections programs? So that these offenders get the
sentences that are handed out in court. I ask you to keep these in mind
then as we go through the structure, I think you&#39;ll see how they
sort of play out with the decisions that the commission made.
Well as I mentioned before in the back of your handout on page ten, you
can see a copy of the felony punishment chart. You&#39;ll see a lot of
letters and a lot of numbers in there. It&#39;s a large grid; there are
a lot of felonies.
New Speaker: If, uh, if any of y&#39;all have a question, if you would
just raise your hand, we&#39;ll break in at the appropriate time and
we&#39;ll try to get your question in.
Speaker 1: Yes I believe it&#39;s behind the slides. Those are the pages
I&#39;ll refer to as we go along.

  <p id="15:00">
  Okay, so that is the felony punishment chart. I don&#39;t know if
you&#39;re happier to find it or to not see it at this point. It looks
complicated, but it actually breaks down to four really simple parts.
Four elements. You&#39;ve got the offense class and the defendant&#39;s
prior record. These are two pieces of information that are provided to
the judge in the court at the time of sentencing. Those are easily
identified. Offences have classes assigned to them. Defendant&#39;s
prior record can be received from EOC and so on, so they are simply
pieces of information that go into this grid. Then the judge uses those
to determine the sentence and the sentence is going to have two parts to
it, the disposition, what type of sentence, whether it&#39;s an active
or a suspended sentence, and then the duration, how long a sentence are
they going to impose. That&#39;s the area, those two areas where the
judge has more of the discretion to tailor the sentence to fit the crime
itself. As you see various criminal justice bills coming through the
general assembly, you will see they will address at least one of those
four areas. Usually they are offense class, when you see new offenses or
you see reclassification it will apply to the offense class and
sometimes you may deal with a specific disposition or there may be
changes to sentence lengths, the durations, but it&#39;s always gonna
come down to one of these four areas and as we go through each of them
you&#39;ll see how they fit into the grid and then that will help to
explain how they affect the changes in the grid if you see a new bill.
So looking at the grid, the first two pieces of information for the axes
of the grid. The offense class is the first column, A through I, all the
offences are assigned a severity based upon the severity of the offence.
Prior record level will go into that top row. There are six levels and
every offender is going to go into one of those six levels based upon
the seriousness of their prior convictions and the number of prior
convictions they have and for our discussion right now we&#39;re going
to focus on the felony punishment chart cause I&#39;ll be talking about
felons in general. At the end we do have the misdemeanor chart and
I&#39;ll show that to you briefly and explain how that&#39;s similar to
what we have for the felons. How the mandate was was the commission
classify felony offenses based on their severity, so the commission
developed a set of criteria to guide their decision. They looked at what
types of harm come from the felony offenses and what degree of harm. For
types of harm they looked at harm to person, harm to property, harm to
society, the degrees they looked at serious and significant and minor
injury and then they ranked those in relationship to each other and as
you might imagine if you would think that through to yourself you would
put harm to person probably first, those that result in injury to people
as your most serious offenses. Property and societal harm come after
that. The commission did the same thing. They wound up developing this
set of criteria to say what kind of harm fit into each class. This first
group here you see from A to C, they&#39;re primarily those that result
in injury to person. See, serious, debilitating, long term personal
injury, serious personal injury. There is some degree of societal injury
built in there as well for the serious, long term, widespread societal
injury. Some examples, first degree rape, that&#39;s classified as a
class B1 felony, serious, debilitating, long term personal injury. Armed
robbery with a class of D, you see serious infringement on property
issues but you also see the safety concerns in use of a deadly weapon,
so this helps to put them into categories where you have similar
offenses with similar classes. If you move on to F through I, you see
more of the property offenses, more of the societal injury. Things like
larceny and breaking and entering are all in class H, serious property
loss from a home or by the removal of property. Some of the societal
injuries like distributing obscene literature in class I. Overall this
helped to give proportionality to the offences, to make sure that your
more serious offences were treated more seriously than the other
offences

  <p id="20:00">
  And get them grouped, with similar offenses. This criteria is only a
guideline. It’s not in statute. It’s not a requirement in any way. It’s
something the commission developed to help it do its job. I will say
that when the commission submitted the original package, all the felony
offenses were classified according to the criteria, and the General
Assembly adopted those new classifications. And most of the offenses
that have been classified or re-classified since then follow this
criteria. One of the things the sentencing commission does as part of
its statutory duties is to review all proposed legislation for its
consistency with structured sentencing and with this criteria, and we
issue a report that you will be receiving a copy of in the Judiciary
Committees as well, and I will say like I said, most of these have been
consistent with the criteria. Occasionally some have not, but in general
most of the felony offenses are still in keeping with this
proportionality. By doing this, you can see it helps to provide a little
bit of that consistency, and a little bit of the rational basis for the
sentence, because the offenses are now classified according to their
severity. The other piece is the prior record level. Here, offenders are
classified based upon the number of prior convictions and the
seriousness of their prior convictions. You can see a copy of this chart
on page seven, as well, of your handout. First column, they collect
strictly the number of prior convictions in each class. But then if you
move over to the third column, you can see numbers there – weights
assigned to the prior convictions. Those weights are based upon the
seriousness of the offense. If you think back to the criteria, you can
see a Class A felony, which was murder, the serious personal injury
area, they have higher point totals. Class A has ten points, Class B1
has nine points, and so on. When you get down to the property offenses,
the societal injuries, you have lower point values. Two points, four
points. Our most serious misdemeanors are included. They get one point
each. Now there’s also an additional point added on to the prior records
score, one if they have committed this offense before. If they’ve
committed the offense, been convicted of it, and sentenced for it and
now they’re back again for the same offense, they get an additional
prior record point that increases their score. Also, they get an
additional prior record point if they’ve been in the criminal justice
system at the time of the current offense. Maybe they were on probation
and they committed a new offense. Or they were in prison at the time and
committed an offense or escaped. They will get an additional point that
will increase their prior record score. The score is totaled up and it
places them then in one of the six categories you see there. Level one
is essentially a first time felon. They may have one prior record point,
that may be one prior misdemeanor, but they cannot have a prior felony.
Your felonies start at two points. So if they have a prior felony,
they’d move up to level two already. And they work their way up to level
six, 18 or more points there. If you think about the scoring, you’ll see
there are two different ways that they can get to the higher levels. One
is you can have a couple of serious prior convictions. If they had two
prior first-degree rape convictions, that’d be nine points each. That
would take them up to 18, they’d be level six already. However, if they
had for example ten prior breaking and entering offenses, that’d be two
points each. That gives them 20. So level six offenders, violent
offenders and repeat offenders. So we are grouping them together and
grouping together those with little or no prior record. So those two
pieces of information are presented to the court at the time of
sentencing and that gets the judge into the grid. Every offense has a
class assigned to it. Every offender is going to get a prior record
score and prior record level. Where they intersect on the grid, that’s
where the judge gets the information about how they can sentence, what
options are available to them. And remember we’re talking about two
parts here: the disposition and the duration. I’ll start with the
disposition. You look at the grid and you can see As, Is and Cs all over
the grid. These represent the three different types of dispositions
available to the court. A is the active punishment, I is intermediate
punishment, C is community punishment. Where you’ve got an I-slash-A or
a C-slash-I, there the judge has

  <p id="25:00">
  the discretion to choose between the two. But what do these three
different letters mean is a lot more, there&#39;s a lot more behind them
than what you see on the graph. First of all, when you talk about the A,
you&#39;re talking about the active sentence. For a felon, that
represents prison. There&#39;s no other option in there, they will be
sent to prison. For misdemeanants, they&#39;ll be going to jail. For
felons, that sentence will also include a period of post-release
supervision. They will serve the sentence they received in prison but
there will also be a period of supervision after that when they reenter
the community. When we get into the durations I&#39;ll go into that in a
little more detail. If, however, they don&#39;t get an active sentence,
then the judge is looking at suspending the prison sentence and imposing
either an intermediate or a community punishment. This is where a lot of
the other programs and other sanctions are available for the judge.
Intermediate punishment means they must get supervised probation. The
judge can&#39;t just let them go with a fine. They have to get at least
supervise probation. The statutes recommend a period anywhere from 18 to
36 months, but the judge could go as high as five years at that point.
Now, it&#39;s up to the judge as to what sort of conditions they want to
put on to probation. They may include a split sentence, where the
offender serves a short period of time in prison and then goes out on
probation, sort of get a taste of what prison is and then they get the
opportunity to be on probation. It could include a drug treatment court.
It could also include any other condition that you hear about in
general. It may be electronic monitoring, house arrest with electronic
monitoring. It may be what they&#39;re calling quick dips now. This is
something new under the Justice Reinvestment Act. This is a short, a
very short period of time in jail, like two to three days. They can give
them one time or they could give them up to six days per month in two to
three day increments, up to three months total. So it could be short
weekends in jail. I could also include restitution, community service,
fines, any of the other conditions are available to the judge but they
have to start at least with supervised probation. Now, if it&#39;s a
community punishment, it&#39;s even broader. There, the judge may just
impose a fine. Community punishments can be a fine only. They impose
unsupervised probation with certain conditions, or they could include
supervised probation with all the conditions I mentioned before, except
for the split sentence or drug treatment court. Those two are reserved
strictly for intermedate punishments. This really isn&#39;t the end of
it for the offender. Once they leave the court, this is a new aspect
that&#39;s coming to the Justice Reinvestment Act, it&#39;s enhanced it,
the probation officer also has certain conditions available to them to
impose upon the offender. Probation will get the offender, they do a
risk and needs assessment to determine what this offender might need in
addition to what the court&#39;s imposed, and then they have a list of
conditions they can add on to the offender&#39;s sentence. That may
include electronic monitoring house arrest, it may include some quick
dips in jail, various other aspects, vocational training, substance
abuse assessment and treatment, things like that that once they&#39;ve
got the offender and they can get to know them a little better, I
believe it&#39;s about a 60 day process that they spend trying to get
through their assessment, then they can assign these additional
conditions. That&#39;s available both for intermediate and community
punishments. Now, to take it just a little bit further down the road
beyond sentencing, if the offender is on probation and they fail to
comply with their conditions, then the judge has several options. If
they commit a new crime, if they abscond from probation, the judge can
revoke probation, send them to prison for their prison sentence. If,
however, they just violate some of these technical conditions, they
don&#39;t show up to their appointments, they have a positive drug test,
something like that, the judge cannot revoke their probation initially
but he does have a series of options that he can use. He can use those
quick dips we talked about, he can ratchet them up from a community to
an intermediate punishment. He could add a split sentence. He could also
impose what is called a period of confinement in response to violations,
CRV, you&#39;ll probably be hearing more about that as you go through
the process this year. This is a 90 day period of confinement, but the
offender then leaves that and goes back on to probation. So they&#39;re
not done with their sentence, they not done fulfilling their conditions

  ?? Back under probation. So they’re not done with their sentence.
They’re not done fulfilling their conditions. They simply get this
period of confinement. Now, the Division of Adult Correction has centers
where they send them to receive additional treatment and the
programming, and when they come out of there they go back into the
community, back under probation, and continue with their sentence there.
If they fail, if they receive two periods of CRV in a row, the third
time then the judge has the option of revoking their probation and
sending them to prison. So those are the types of sentences that the
judge has at his disposal there. The active or the suspended sentence,
intermediate and community if it’s suspended. The last thing that the
judge has to determine is the length of sentence. That’s represented by
all the numbers you see on the grid, and you see on the next page after
it as well. And we’ll break those apart, piece by piece here. I’m going
to draw an example out of this. We’ll take an offender who’s convicted
of armed robbery, which is a class D felony. And they have 12 prior
record points. You see, 12 puts them up in prior record level 4. So this
would be the cell that they would end up in, and this would present the
options available to the judge at sentencing. First you see three
different ranges there. All of these ranges, all of these numbers,
represent the minimum sentences that are available for the judge. They
could choose from anywhere within this range. There are some limitations
on if they will go over, but essentially with this example offender, the
judge is looking at an option anywhere from 58 months to 121 months, for
a minimum sentence. This also represents, the minimum sentence
represents the time the offender has to serve. There is no parole
release for these offenders. There is no good time awards that will
reduce that minimum sentence. Whatever the judge determines is the
minimum is the time the offender is then going to serve in prison.
That’s the truth in sentencing aspect of it. So the judge begins in the
middle range, the presumptive range. And they could start from there,
they could sentence from there. About 70%, almost 70% of the sentences
handed down in a year are in that presumptive range. Judge can pick a
number anywhere in there. If however, they find aggravating factors are
present – perhaps it was particularly atrocious, heinous crime, the
victim was particularly young or vulnerable, things like that – they can
move up to the aggravated sentence range. That gives the judge a whole
longer range to work with. Conversely if they find mitigating factors
are present – that they find that the defendant played a passive role in
the crime, or that the defendant’s age or mental maturity played a role
in that – then they can move down to the mitigated range. It gives them
another set of numbers to choose from. Whichever range they end up in,
they will select one number from that range. And it can be anywhere in
there. Taking the presumptive range here, it could be 78 months, 80, 85,
89, 92 or 97. Anywhere in there, they could pick that number. Again,
this gives the judge a little bit of an opportunity to tailor his
sentence a little more toward the facts of the case. As I mentioned
before, they would pick one minimum out of there, and that minimum then
represents the amount of time the offender has to serve. Now they will
also impose a maximum sentence. That’s on page 11 of your handout. The
maximum sentence is not discretionary. This is really automatic. It’s
just simply doing the math, imposing a sentence beyond the minimum. For
the class B1 through E felonies, the maximum sentence is basically the
minimum sentence, 120% of that minimum, plus 12 months for post-release
supervision. I’ll break that out in a minute. But they add 20% on, plus
12 months. If it happens to be a sex offender in class B1 through E,
it’ll be 20% plus 60 months added on. Whereas for the F through I
felons, it’s essentially the minimum sentence plus 20 months, plus 9
months for post-release supervision. So there’s a lot packed into the
maximums. Take some of the pieces out of there, first of all you take
the minimum sentence and it adds 20% to it. What is that for?

  <p id="35:00">
  That is a period where the offender can earn time off. If the offender
is in prison, they participate in treatment or education programs or
they work at a job while they&#39;re in the prison they can earn a
certain number of days per month off their sentence, but it comes off of
that 20%. It comes off mathematically so that the most that they could
earn would be down to their minimum, no lower than that, but then
there&#39;s also this period on top of that for after F through I&#39;s,
a 9 month period. The offender is originally released 9 months before
the maximum and less any earned time, but that is a period of
post-release supervision they will serve now. They&#39;ll go back into
the community, they&#39;ll be supervised by associate probation officers
a lot like the probation structure. They will have this 9 month or 12
month with B1 through E felonies sentence hanging over their head. If
they fail to comply with their conditions, the post-release supervision
and parole commission can work with the offender, they can add
additional conditions, they can revoke the offender for a portion of
that 9 months if they choose and then send them back out on post-release
supervision. So it&#39;s all factored into there. I think if you wanna
see, look at your chart, two examples that I find the easiest to look
at. If you look at 100 months in the B1 to E category, that&#39;s in the
third column there, you can see a minimum of 100 months, you can see a
maximum of 132. so that&#39;s 100 plus the 20%, in this case it would be
120 months, plus the 12, so that leaves up to 132, and that&#39;s how
the pieces fit together. The same thing with the F through I&#39;s, if
you look at the 10 month minimum, you see the maximum there&#39;s 21
months. Includes the 2 months which is the 20% plus the 9 month for
post-release supervision, so it&#39;s all included into this minimum and
maximum that the judge imposes in the court. That was really at a very
high, 3000 point model overview, but those are really the components of
structured sentencing. Those are the four pieces that make it up. You
can see, look at the full grid now, you can see the classes for the
criminal offence, the prior record level for the offender, they&#39;re
all classified based on severity, then once they get into the A cell on
the grid it tells the judge what options are available, active or
suspended sentence, what length of sentence are available. They&#39;ve
got the minimum and the maximum. Having that minimum gives them the
truth in sentencing principle, the principle that they were trying to
achieve. Having every offender classified by their offence and their
prior record level gives that level or consistency and certainty to it.
If you look at where the A&#39;s are on the grid as compared to the
I&#39;s and C&#39;s, you can see that the active punishments are up in
the upper level and out to the right to prioritize the prisons for the
violent offenders and repeat offenders using the intermediate and the
community for the less serious offenders with little or no prior record,
and using this grid, and know that this is used with every offender
throughout the state, and using our population simulation model, the
commission is able to project what the resource needs will be because
the sentences are predictable and we provide that to you on a regular
basis, what sort of prison beds will be needed and so on so that you can
keep the policies and the resources in balance. Before I move on to
misdemeanors do you wanna see if anybody has a question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Everybody clearly understand it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] Certainly. [??] to consecutive
sentences [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. When the judge has multiple
offences, multiple convictions in front of them they have three choices
really. One is they can consolidate the offenses and they impose a
punishment for the most serious offence and simply pick that sentence on
the grid. The second choice is they can run them concurrent. They
sentence for each one of them, put them in their appropriate cell on the
grid and select one for each sentence but they all run at the same time,
so the most serious one would then dictate how long they would be in
prison or on probation. The third option is running consecutively and
there is no restriction on that for felons. They can run multiple
sentences back to back. What they will do is add up all the minimum
sentences. They will

  active, pretty much the same idea available to the judge. Active here
represents jail time now, all misdemeanors are going into jail one way
or another. The I&#39;s and the A&#39;s are supervised probation.
I&#39;m sorry, the C&#39;s and the I&#39;s, supervised probation,
unsupervised probation, fines, so on. If you look down in the lower left
hand corner, a class three, levels one and two. This was a change the
General Assembly made in 2013. Those first two cells were limited to a
fine only now. So we can&#39;t even get probation down in those two
cells, the least serious offender, little or no prior record. I believe
that that was, in part, due to indigent defense costs and this was a way
of reducing the cost for them. As far as sentence length, we don&#39;t
have aggravation and mitigation, we don&#39;t have a minimum and a
maximum, we have one range for the judge to choose from in each cell.
This range represents days rather than months. But again, it&#39;s time
the offender must serve. They can earn a little bit off of that if they
participate in programs, treatment, education, or they work in the jail
unit, but it&#39;s a very limited amount. So, once again, the offender
will receive a sentence in the court and they&#39;ll get a time close to
the time that they will serve in the jail. As we mentioned before,
DWI&#39;s are not part of this structure but just about every other
misdemeanor comes under this structure. I will move to the last item
then. Staff asked us simply to talk a little bit about the effects that
structured sentencing has on sentencing overall, kind of three areas we
wanted to highlight. One of them is sentence lengths. This is something
you don&#39;t hear as much about now because it has been 20 years but,
originally, we heard a great deal about it. Prior to structured
sentencing there were some very long sentence lengths on the books, up
to 50 years sentence lengths available for the higher classes. When
structured sentencing was enacted, they looked a lot shorter. People
said we&#39;re cutting these sentences in half, we&#39;re reducing a
tremendous amount. They were shorter in most cases, not in every case,
they were shorter than what was in the books but, because of the truth
in sentencing aspect, because it was time the offender was going to be
serving, time served actually was longer. Felons going to prison were
serving more of their sentence and they were serving a longer sentence
than what they would have prior to structured sentencing. As you imagine
though, that would have an impact on prison population. Before,
offenders were being turned out pretty quickly in order to keep it
within the capacity of the prisons. Now you&#39;ve got offenders coming
for a longer time and they can&#39;t be released under parole release.
So it did have an impact on prison beds. Initially, the state had to
build for a little while to keep up with the policies that were placed
in the structure. We also had growth in the population. If you think
between 1990 and today, the state has grown a great deal. We&#39;ve had
a number of people come in, more people produces a larger number of
offenders, even if the percentage doesn&#39;t increase. Also, as years
go by, the General Assembly will enact new statutes. There are new
crimes that come up that will reclassify existing crimes. That all has
an impact. That&#39;s one of the four pieces that has an impact on that
structure. So throughout the first 10-15 years of structured sentencing,
as these forces were impacting it, the General Assembly was
appropriating money for additional prisons, keep the resources up with
the policies that they had in place. About 2009, the General Assembly
did change the ??. Remember, we talked about that in the beginning, they
changed some of the sentences, those minimum sentences, to make sure
they were more proportionate across the grid. They also changed the
prior record level to make sure the offenders were distributed more
evenly. The result of this, one of the results, was that it curved some
of the projected growth. We&#39;re looking at a large growth coming up
in the next ten years after that, and this helped to reduce some of that
projected growth, we curved that. At the same time, if you think back to
the last several years, crime rate was dropping too. That wasn&#39;t
something that anyone could have predicted or projected in any way but
we started to see a drop at that point as well. So this helped to reduce
some of the impact on the prison beds. Finally, the most recent change
was the Justice Reinvestment Act. As I said before, that had a lot of
impact on probationers and things that the Division of Adult Correction
was going to do with offenders in the community.

have that policies and have stimulation models and what to change ??

Speaker Changes:No it&#39;s good question prior to the justice reinvent
ct everyone over 90 days they would have on it now everyone is going to

every jail is independent ?? but we certainly herd judges says what
their jail capacity is think bout my jail ?? they disperse the across

they have so 50 jails so take they room visible ??? under 90 days that

  Other acts, like Justice Reinvestment, as a part of the structure, has
helped to reduce the population as well. It is down from its peak. Its
peak was about 2009, roughly 41,000. It is down now to about 37,000. So
the structure, as a tool, has helped to control that population. I look
to Susan to see if I&#39;ve missed anything on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Susan Katzenelson, Executive Director of the Sentencing Commission and
what I would like to point out about the structured sentencing is
it&#39;s a structure, it&#39;s a concept. It&#39;s as much a tool as the
content that you put in it, so, I have no idea what I sound like, but
the two main drivers of prison populations in the United States for the
past 20-25 years have been population growth and this state has been
very fortunate in growing from six-million-some to close to ten million
in that time period and the crime rate. The type of sentencing is a
second step that kind of follows behind that. So the majority of prisons
that had to be built is because we were just receiving more people but
an interesting number to mention here is our incarceration rate has not
increased. So we didn&#39;t have proportionately more offenders who
needed to go to prison, we just, we are more of us, all of us. So the
rate has been hovering in the middle of the United States&#39; rates and
the second lowest or lowest among southern states. So we&#39;ve been
doing well with that. I think what structured sentencing was emphasizing
more, two things, truth in sentencing, which was a public complaint that
we hear the judge announce the sentence at the courtroom and that&#39;s
not what&#39;s happening. At the end it was 17-18% of the time and the
victim of the families saw the person out on the street way too soon.
The other one is to do it proportionately, to think rationally. If we
have a limited number of beds, which we always do, who are the people
who we really want to be safe from more than other people and hence the
violent and/or prior records and combinations thereof. So the actual
population growth has been initially down because there we many more
intermediate options and the courts and the community accepted that if
you&#39;re supervised more closely and we put more conditions on it, it
might be also helpful to keep you in the community for rehabilitation
and for close supervision. I think what drove up the prison in those
middle years that John had mentioned is one of them was the, there was
some lack of ??, we have true life sentences now for homicide and so on.
So these people started to, what we call piling on and not coming out.
The other one was revocations, that people, the prison entry at any
given year was close to 50% people entering prison were not entering on
a new sentence from a new conviction but rather for a revocation of
their probation sentence. That why I think that justice reinvestment had
made the main, one of the main impacts on prison populations and
that&#39;s saying, &quot;We will try at least two more times working
with you in the community, if not more, before you get revoked.&quot;
That created a huge drop and it will maintain that. So it&#39;s not a
simple one on one relationship but the structure helps you control it.
Every time you look at legislation you know, within reasonable limits,
of what the impact of that will be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just look at the people, the revocation rate, the citizen rate of
people going back, climbing back into the system and the cost for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the recidivism part?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we&#39;re talking about once they get back into the system,
there&#39;s a cost for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right. It basically becomes a prison cost, which is way more expensive
than probation, and justice reinvestment really, that was one of the
reasons, trying to rehabilitate them with another. So the recidivism
part of that new approach is not in yet because it&#39;s too new. We
also have a mandate from you to track recidivism and so we will be happy
to, hopefully another two year cycle, to come back and say the ?? that
has been under structured sentencing, this is their recidivism, and
justice reinvestment, that&#39;s their recidivism rate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Johnson, are you good with that? As you can tell, Susan
is from, with her accent, she&#39;s from South Carolina somewhere.
