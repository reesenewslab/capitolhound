With the quorum in attendance, the House Committee on Transportation is
now in session. We would like to welcome our pages today, [Hanna
VanTreese?] from Rockingham cana-, county. [Kylon Bell?] from Forsyth.
[Sadie Forsythe?] from Mecklenburg, and [Caroline Fry?] from Johnston.
Welcome to transportation. Our Sergeants at Arms today are Carlton
Adams, Martha Parrish, Charles Godwin. The first bill, House Bill 356
will be displaced, we'll go to HB530, Buncombe NPO membership.
Representative Ramsey here? The gentleman is recognized to explain the
bill. Is there a PCS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There is. A Representative Moffitt moves that the PCS
be before us, without objection, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, this is a, a
fairly straightforward bill, it does two basic things. One is relating
to the French broad NPO that serves Buncombe County, right now the
Buncombe County Board of Commissioners has two appointments to that
board. What this bill does is to say that, of the two appointments that
the county makes to the NPO, have to reside in different county
commissioner districts. There are three county commissioner districts
right now. So it would allow the chairman to serve, who was elected at
large. And currently the way they're elected, you have two members
elected from each district, so there's a total of seven members, and
that's to ensure that there's a, uh, different views of the county are
represented on the NPO, and I know many of you understand how important
the NPO is in determining transportation projects. The second component
of this bill, uh, would allow for, uh, signs that were in existence when
the, uh, city of Asheville annexed that property on January 1, 2005, um,
or later. That if it was a nonconforming sign, that sign could remain in
existence. And under existing law that's not the case. They have an
amortization period that forces someone to remove a sign that's
nonconforming. So those are the two aspects of the bill and would, uh,
be willing to certainly answer any questions of any other members may
have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton's recognized for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. It, this could be for the bill
sponsor, Representative Ramsey or for staff. In the first addition of
the bill, this dealt strictly with NPO organization. And now, in the
proposed Committee Substitute, you've got sign ordinance regulations
included. Is the, section two of this bill germane to the first part of
the bill as it was filed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You wanna answer or have staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Um, you know, I guess my argument would be, it's
germane to the extent, there signs, signs are related to transportation.
It's a local bill, it applies to Asheville and Buncombe county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And this is a, this first part of this question's for
the bill sponsor. Has the city of Asheville asked for that to be
included? And the second part of my question will be for staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, the city of Asheville has, has not asked for this
to be included, what they have done, is, when they annex property, they
require that existing signs be taken down after a five year period
through what they call amortization.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up for staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh, well, yes for staff. Um, I, I've prepared an
amendment that eliminates the, section two of, of this, and that, I'd
like to have, um, considered and passed out please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Has the amendment been--[crosstalk]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] --and I'll explain it as it's coming out if, if you
want me to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Um, what's it look like?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Real short.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Well, let's pass it out first. Representative
Iler, did you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Yes sir, Mr. Chairman, I believe it's for the
bill sponsor. The NPO, Representative Ramsey. Right behind you. The NPO
is a federal designation. So is this in</p>

are signs that are part of the contract between the property owners and
the businesses that locate there and amortization goes out of calls a
breach of those contracts and the city has pretty much told of the

also told business owners that they would not support a variance and we
cannot get a big decision from City Council as to whether not democratic

observation DOT project Representative Queen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Representative Tolson cosponsored with me.  I
appreciate his support, but this is a bill 920 that I asked the
Department of Transportation and the Department of Agriculture to devise
a plan to minimize the destruction and damage of farmland due to
Department of transportation projects through or adjacent to farm
agricultural areas.  We've learned that agriculture is a very important
part of our economy in North Carolina.  We understand that food needs
are going to grow 50 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050.  North
Carolina has lost 6.6 million acres of farmland since 1970 and again we
had a little meeting of the tourist folks this morning for breakfast and
we realize our brand in North Carolina is natural scenic beauty and our
farmlands are not only important to our farm communities but also the
beauty of our state this bill just encourages the Department of
Transportation to work with the Department of Agriculture on their
projects when they go through farm communities  it’s particularly
important in the mountains where our valleys are narrow and the roads
have a high impact to protect our mountains and the alluvial soils that
are referenced  they are the floodplain souls of the mountain valleys
so, that's the intent of the bill agricultural department supports it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Our Representative Graham is recognized for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Tolson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Same thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That was going to be what I was going to say.  Also I
was going to ask if there not any opposition can we go ahead and do the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Alright Representative Ford is recognized for
question.  ?? question also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes Mister Chairman.  Don’t we already do this and we
involve ?? already.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  We really, the Department of Transportation doesn't,
I mean it’s sort of silos they honestly don't do it. I can give you an
example we did the nineteen, I was a senator moving from Madison County
to Yancey County, from Marshall to Burnsville we did a beautiful farm
Valley had great transportation project which we worked on very much but
the farmlands on the sides of the road were just sort of arbitrary some
of them got filled in.  What happens sometimes in these farm communities
particularly in the mountains they bring, because the road is above the
floodplain, so they fill in the alluvial farmland beside it and bring it
up to road level then it becomes sort of strip development in the
middle of your farm community.  It sort of changes the whole feel of the
community so, the community was for it, but there was no real strategy
so we look at these farmlands as valuable in this plan.   Hopefully
they'll take them seriously and work together, the department
agriculture, which has a good farmland preservation program, but it's
not coordinated with the department of agriculture, with the department
of transportation and their projects.  This asks them to develop a
strategy to do just that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Will this coincide with what's already going on or
will this farther delay transportation projects?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I think because we asked them to work together I
think they will both take the values of each department work together so
that is a win-win for transportation and agriculture.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Representative Wilkins was yours a question or
motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  I'm not opposed to the concept, but I'm
trying to understand exactly what we’re talking about because on line
eleven subsection one says provide for the mitigation of farmland
destroyed.  What we  all understand what has happened with wetlands when
the highway comes through a new story wetlands then they got to go out
and I got a buy more wetlands or they got to turn dryland into a
wetlands to  mitigate it.  So if you destroy an acre of farmland and
you've got to go out and buy  another acre or create an acre of farmland
somewhere and there’s got to be a</p>

Say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed. Motion carries, the bill as amended is now
before us. Further discussion or debate on the bill? Is there a motion?
Representative Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, I do have one more question
about this, this whole thing, this is, this bill is the kind of bill
that seems innocuous on the surface, but really this is a bill that
enables, that really makes it easier for, for Big Brother to watch you
everywhere and everything you do. And I have an issue with that.
[inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, you may respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Just a brief response. We're talking now about
public highways, state roads. We're not talking about private property
or anything. We're also talking about the ability of DOT to set out what
their agreement is with the technology that's going in the right of way.
So it's pretty well controlled.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I follow up on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [James?]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The thing is, DOT is going to negotiate with a private
company that they're contracting with and the average person's gonna
have no idea what they're really negotiating and what they're really
deciding.
[inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, this is the agreement between a municipality or a
county and DOT. It's not with private entities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Boles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A question for, probably staff. What is the status of
the red light cameras?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Perry? Or Ms. Carter?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The only ones that I'm aware of that are still
operating are in the city of Raleigh. I don't believe those have been
found to be unlawful at city DOT.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, and so this, and for the bill sponsor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So this could be that, a munic-, the DOT in the
municipalities could agree on red light cameras on state roads.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They, it would, they could do it if they chose to, it
would be up to them, in the conditioins of the agreement each side would
have to agree mutually.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carnan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. The, this bill is just simply
as he's, as Representative Faircloth has said, it's allowing the
department to enter into these agreements if they so choose. They don't
have to. If cities come to them and they wanna do this and they feel
there's a problem there they don't have to do it. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. At the time, do you have a motion yet?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We do not have a motion but...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, well I wanna understand what we're doing
here, and I'll address this to staff. Before if a municipality wanted
the red light cameras they had to come here and get the legislation.
Would this allow any municipality to establish the red light cameras
without coming to the General Assembly for specific legislation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, it does not expand the authority for red light
cameras.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just gonna comment. We had red light cameras on
our, some of our state maintained roads in Cary, and, I mean, the things
are as popular as the plague. And everybody's going away from them, and
it's an issue that's taking care of itself. We've gotten rid of them in
Cary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Further discussion, further debate?
Representative Carney is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm chuckling at the,
&quot;popular as the plague.&quot; You're right. I move for a favorable
report for House Bill 348.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As amended and report to the fore...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ...As amended...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Roll into a new PCS. As many as favor the motion say
aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In the opinion of the chair the ayes appears to have
it. The ayes do have it. Representative Moffitt, is 5:30 ready to come
back before us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is so Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right Mr-, House Bill 530 is before us. We were
debating the amendment offered by Representative Hamilton. But
Representative Moffitt is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, the bill sponsors have heard the
committee, we would recommend adoption of the Hamilton Amendment, which
strips out section two and keeps this bill related only to the MPO.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, further discussion, further debate on the
amendment? As many as favor the amendment signify</p>

SA and the opposed the amendment is scary the bills before says amended,
I had Representative Corey was lasting two , 12-foot back to the first
to 530, Galina Rogers was taken to cater to the bill's sponsor for
disrupting its sense of good they can, and ready to give a favorable to
the theory that a week, motion for a favorable report: house bill 530 as
amended are the discussion for the bank all in favor say I oppose nine
basic areas will be reported to the four house bill 920 is ready to come
back to four's pages two, up to shake the personnel from our local
sponsors of a single some dignity and the wall and Ron Carey for joining
us with the nine deputy chief mans talking about all what this bill
would do again this bill is to pass the department of transportation
department culture to develop the body of a program that doesn't respond
into the implementation bill they will come back to what spoke with are
, to report full concurrence on what that would be we think it would be
a general letter of understanding kind of thing what options or, to move
forward and they got their work in their planning in their deliberations
in the end in Rome will all come up with fat, playing so well (SPEAKER
CHANGES)  I think it's from the department of banking and agriculture in
the apartment education OK with it so out of the committee as a
compromise like the jurors are not have a with the bill as a man but the
reps $100 and four are again that the unneeded as a potential the core
of the cost of an old hand five farmland for example if you can define
its lack of farmland only to be active or are winning jacket 30 years
ago which followed L yet committed for the a min is a lot of questions
but that this was discussed the department to department to be working
together a plan and they would obviously have to bring the use of the
proposals and cost estimates by conventional someone for offer much more
to get considerations so as it stands on the day a problem with the
assistance would represent or that she had a memo that was consultation
on the swings are callable through the day the way with the weekend by
Davis and that's proved so what is before us now on representative for
price motion I'm sorry to your spread of gambling question for staff
alone or moved from an as (SPEAKER CHANGES)  I read the bill which says
that the two department shall jointly devise a plan to minimize
description of damage or one on and it says the program which additions
to plan shall provide for mitigation of the farmland four impact and
place the highest priority on preservation of forming an alluvial 4
hours where is languishing here that says that god is not an affect on
an obligation on these departments searching only two their reporting in
the words 400 clients don't suggest what happens if we don't concur in
the same thing here that says any if you got confirmed in this is what
happens on Friday understand how this is a working whether we're
basically pruning from require much clearly employees for the mitigation
and the development of this plan in my mind seeing but were believable
and certicom leaders to be a weather by a committee of the legislature
is going too concur in the planning and symphonies for deletion of IBM's
sleigh or to 49 what if we do what are the two until we can call our
county falk's on that can help clarify my confusion that you can

<p id="45:00">
You wish ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Address it to staff if they want to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Rep Blackwell, I would say in reading it the
lack of the word implement would indicate that it is merely to device
the plan not to implement it or put it into place, and that would be
strengthened by the provisions of section two.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you’re comfortable that Representative Torbett’s amendment about for
concurrence would name that nothing would go into effect or be binding
except the development of some sort of plan unless the committee of the
legislature said we agree.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not see a mandate to the department to implement this plan, just to
devise it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Assuming the committee concurs, it doesn’t have to come back to the
legislature, it would go into effect at that point?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would not interpret it that way. I would think that further action
would have to be taken by the general assembly to implement the plan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Terry, I believe I had you from earlier to speak on this
same bill, didn’t I? And Shepard and Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Fine. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to speak cautious with this. I think this is a very
expensive bill. If you’re going to direct the transportation to go ahead
and devise the plan and make the preparations to do this, then you had
better be willing to absorb the cost when they come back with the plan.
But, look at on line 11, number 1. Provide for the mitigation for
farmland destroyed. When you widen the road, when you improve a road,
and you destroy an acre of farm land, to mitigate that they have either
to go out and buy another acre of land or create another acre of
farmland. You restore basically the same condition that it was. It’s
just like your wetlands. And that can be very expensive. Then look on
line 13, number 2. Place the highest priority on the preservation of
farmland. So you’re going to improve a road, or make a road, and it’s
coming through a farm. So now, you’ve got to reroute that highway to go
around that farmland because they are instructed that they’ve got to
preserve it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes. I hate to interrupt you but we are out of time.
So we’ll not be able to vote this bill today. Thank you committee for
your attention. We are adjourned. Representative Carney, we will correct
the record. It was Representative Graham that offered to make the
motion, not you. I had my list confused. I apologize.</p>
