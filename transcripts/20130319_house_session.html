you a Baptist, Methodist, Buddhist or Catholic? Are you a Seven Day

denominations, oaths or restrictions. Your love is not based on our
membership in any church or synagogue. You love us all. Likewise, we
know that the resurrection as explained in the gospels happened, and
that the resurrection happens in our hearts every day, and every minute,
and that is the real meaning of Easter. Even when we think we are too
smart or too powerful to need your love, you continue to speak to us as
you make us, and then you walk with us silently out of the night. Amen.

Representative Baskerville please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
Speak on the bill.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman’s recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker this is a good bill. I wanna thank Representative
Hurley for putting the time together to try to address an issue. Right
now if individuals have three prior DWI convictions that occur within 10
years and they catch another DWI that person can be charged with a
felony for being a habitual impaired driver. Now sometimes folks might
have 3, 4, 5 convictions and have been convicted as a habitual DWI, but
those convictions occur more than 10 years in the past. And so they
therefore will not be able to be charged again with habitual DWI unless
they commit 3 within a 10 year period. So this eliminates that loophole
like Representative Hurley Says. And the way that I look at it if
someone has 3 DWI convictions and they are convicted as a Habitual DWI
and then later on in the future they get another DWI, that person has a
serious driving, I mean a serious drinking problem. And then putting all
drivers at risk that are on the road. I talked about this bill with some
of my colleagues from my time in the district attorney office, and they
appreciate this tool in their box to use. It's not a mandatory thing the
district attorney still will have to indict this individual with a
felony charge. And even though I'm probably gonna take some blow back
from the defense bar on this, I think this is a good bill, and ask that
you support it.
[Speaker Change]
Representative McNeill please state your purpose.

To debate the bill.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman’s recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Change]
I can't really add much more then what the Representative Baskerville,
and Representative Hurley had added to it. It is a good bill, just like
Representative Baskerville said, if a person has done 10 years in prison
and they get out and they have another DWI, they definitely do have a
habitual driving problem. This is a very, very good bill. This is
probably not anyone in this room who hasn't been touched by a family
member, or a friend who has been in an accident involving someone that
was driving drunk. It is something that we should have a zero tolerance
for in this state. No one has the right to get drunk and drive down the
road and put your family, or my family in jeopardy. Thank you and I
commend the bill to you.

[Speaker Change]
Representative Baskerville mentioned whom I respect a great deal that
you still have to indict, but we all know how easy it is to indict
someone. And the line about you can indict a ham sandwich if you need
to. I've worked in the courtroom quite a bit with DUI cases, DWI. And I
do feel this bill is a bit harsh. The bill that we have right now I was
told was actually crafted for a reason, the 10 year period. And it was
crafted by people on both sides of the aisle, to give an option for
people to get back their license and have a livelihood after a great
deal of time has passed. A decade can be argued not reasonable, possibly
irr-easonable. We can debate whether that is but, the way the bills
written now, 40 years could pass. It could be a 20 year old that's not
just an alcoholic, DWI is also prescription drugs it could be any type
of impairment. It could be a very young person that made a mistake and

has a family that's done everything right for 30, 40 years and still
won't have the ability to get a license and support their family. So for
all these reasons I think this bill is a bit  harsh and I urge you to
vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask, i guess Rep. Baskerville a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Baskerville, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me understand this. You get convicted three times for driving while
impaired under the current law, you are then classified as a habitual
offender. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How does he get convicted as a habitual offender?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are convicted of 3 DWIs within 10 years of catching a fourth DWI. If
you are convicted of the fourth DWI, you can be punished as a habitual
DWI driver, which is a felony. So you've got to get three priors within
a 10 year period and then get convicted of a fourth before you attain
this habitual DWI status.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, you're correct. I knew that. But, once you have attained that
DWI habitual offender status after having been caught the fourth time
within a 10 year period, any other offense after that you are still
considered a habitual offender. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill gives the district attorney the option of indicting that
individual as a habitual DWI. Yes, any DWIs after that point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It gives me- It gives them the option rather than- are you saying it's
not mandatory?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct, it gives the district attorneys the option.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House, it sounds like it's a
fair bill but it really in effect it could not be unfair. For instance,
you're in school, you're in college, and everybody knows how college
people act. You get a couple DWIs  while you're in school or something
like that. Then you come out, you live your life and you go out on your
wedding anniversary within that period of time and you take a little
drink of wine or something, and you get picked up and get convicted of
DWI. That's your third one. 7 or 8 years later, you come back within
that 10 year period, and you get picked up the fourth time. Then you got
a problem. But then, even though you've been then declared an habitual
offender at that point, you gotta- and you serve whatever time is given
you, but then you come out and begin to live an exemplary life and
somewhere down the line, you pick up another charge maybe 20 years down
the line,  and you pick up another charge, and you got a real vindictive
DA just sitting there waiting for you to do something wrong. Or  it
doesn't have to be, it could be just the rule of law in that particular
case. You could be convicted again and sent away for a long time after
having been straight for any number of years after that. This bill, I
think, really needs a little bit more work on it if you're gonna do this
to folks. I'm not one who believes that drunk drivers ought to be on the
road, but if there is a real good reason for them who, those who have
tried to make restitution, those who have tried, have served their time,
those have tried to just do the right thing, then why maybe 30 years
down the road, when they get picked up again should they have to go
through this? I think this bill needs a little more work on it, and plus
the fact- one other thing, I'm looking at the incarceration note on
this. Somewhere along the line is 168 bids involved in this situation.
Since this has not been something that we have had in the past, then
it's something that we just need to really take a look at because we
really don't know what the outcome is gonna be and how that
incarceration is gonna affect our prison system. I suggest you think
long and hard before voting on this bill.

<p id="020:00">
[Speaker changes.]....the bill. Drunk driving is a serious problem in
this state.  Now in the last session, we revisited the issue of habitual
drunk driving and we made some changes and this is a loophole that was
created inadvertantly.  We're trying to tighten the law up.  The
newspaper just had the article this weekend about the couple that was
killed by the fella' who was driving drunk, down the wrong way on Wade
Avenue. He had been charged with three DWI's but convicted only once.
It's difficult in this state to get a conviction of somebody who's
driving drunk because of all the opportunities that a person has to have
the case thrown out of court.  If you've been charged with three DWI's,
you've driven drunk a whole lotta' times, you just happened to get
caught three times and be convicted. Three DWI's is almost unheard of.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] Would Representative Starnes answer a question?
[Speaker changes.] I yield.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman yields.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Starnes, you sayin' you get caught
three times but it's get thrown outta' court, where's the guilt or
anything in there that that individual has been drivin' drunk three
times without ever havin' been convicted of it?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Michaux, you're a clever attorney and
you know how to get your defendants off.
[Speaker changes.] Another question, Mister Speaker.
[Speaker changes.] I yield.
[Speaker changes.] Gentleman yields.
[Speaker changes.] Also a citizen can believe in the constitution...that
until you're convicted of a crime, you're innocent.
[Speaker changes.] Does the gentleman have a question? The gentleman was
recognized the second time to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] I'm sorry.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Starnes has the floor, thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Ladies and gentlemen, you know good and well how hard
it is for these judges to hand down tough sentences on drunk drivers.
We do our best to pass laws in this body, that will address the issue of
driving drunk but it's hard to get the convictions.  We need to go in
the direction to make it tougher on drunk drivers...really what we need
are some judges that will enforce the laws. But anyway, this is a good
step in the right direction and I hope you'll vote for the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To debate the bill, Mister Speaker.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker.  I'm trying ...in
listening to the debate, because I had some differing views coming in to
the floor and expressed 'em in our caucus, that I had some concern but I
really do think the debate has actually eliminated some of my concern
that I had, like Representative Michaux...and here's why: I think in
Line 11, where it has &quot;has been previously convicted of the offense
of habitual impaired driving&quot;, if I'm not mistaken, and
Representative Hurley or Representative Baskerville might be able to
speak to it but I think I'm right.  That's a fairly new offense and so
there aren't gonna be that many people that Clause ii is gonna' pick up,
that Clause i hasn't picked up. Because it's a pretty new offense. And
what my concern was is how we dealt with all the people who had those
DWI's twenty years ago and then make a mistake now and that's not gonna'
be caught...that's not...they're not gonna get caught in the vice of ii
right now. This is more a prospective bill in many respects and for that
reason, I've changed my mind based on the floor debate and I'm going to
be voting for the bill. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Speciale, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] When you're driving two tons of steel down the road
and you don't have your full faculties, you don't deserve four chances.
I think this is a very lenient bill. In some countries, your first
offense, you go in front of the firing squad so I think it's a very lean
bill...lenient bill and I think that we need to vote for it.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
(Gavel.)
[Speaker changes.] To debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Well, it's hard to follow that...laughs...and I
concur. I just wanted to let the body know that we...I don't know...I'm
sorry I had to speak with some superintendents, that's why I was
late...but the...I will say that working with Representative Hurley was
probably the best process of this whole thing, she taught me so much and
she's such a stateswoman. And I was really glad...it was really good for
me to meet Representative Hurley at eleven o' clock at night in our new
station and, when they brought this to our attention, and we were able
to come together and work on the bill, I said..she said &quot;who you
wanna' lead?&quot; and I said &quot;you gotta lead because I don't know
what I'm doin' yet!&quot; And so, she had... she lead it and I was
really pleased to do it and this is a great bill...all this does is....

propose to the jury I mean the judge to go back and look at a record we
should be looking at. I mean we should know if you had 5 or 6 or 7 or 8
DWI's, we should definitely know and account for the fact that you
killed a whole entire family and so the way the current law works right
now, this gentleman in Winston-Salem, he killed a family and they are
dead.  Name me one law in the world where you can kill a family and
nobody goes back and looks and sees that you killed a whole entire
family and this is the loophole that we have, that judge, after he came
out of jail, after 10, I think it was 13 years, he came out of jail and
the law that we have currently now, he got 2 more DWI's and they were
all misdemeanors because they could not go back and look at his record.
I can see the look on everybody's faces, it is absurd and I hope you

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you.  Just to allay some concerns expressed by Representatives
Glazier and Michaux and the remarks by Representative Starnes, I
couldn't agree with Starnes more that these DWI cases often times are
difficult to prove, it is a very high standard, a lot of rules of
evidence regarding what can come in and be accepted as evidence and what
can not and for that very reason, seeing how hard it is, if someone has
convicted, not just charged or had the case dismissed or they were found
not guilty but were convicted three times and then they catch a fourth
DWI, I think they have had several bites at the apple.  It is
convictions, given how hard it is to convict, 3 prior convictions,
additionally to Representative Glazier he is actually correct, this
habitual DWI is a relatively new charge so the handful of folks like in
this particular situation like Rep Hurley was discussing, they would
fall under this new provision that if someone was previously convicted
of habitual DWI you can be also charged and convicted with habitual DWI
now it catches a handful of folks like this particular circumstance she
is talking about and the fiscal note attached says we have more than
enough beds in the DOC to accommodate this. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Larry Hall please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Just wanted to come to the defense of our
district attorneys and our judges.  It seems like their reputations got
a little besmirched by comments that the defense attorneys are smarter
than our judges and maybe smarter than our DA's and it is not often you
are going to hear me stand up and come to the defense of the DA's having
been in the defense bar myself but I think we do understand that our
judges are as alerted and skilled as the attorneys who are on the
defense bar and that our district attorneys do have the resources and
the power of the state behind them when they get ready to seek a
conviction so I don't think we should take this bill lightly and presume
that there is somehow some unfair advantage first of all.  Second of all
it may be unfortunate in the order the bill appears on the calendar or
order they were filed as we see we have another bill on the calendar
that will affect the impact of this bill as we vote on it.  I do think
it is important that we understand how serious this is as we go forward
and I realize that ignorance of the law is no excuse but at the same
time we understand that driving while impaired, this is not driving
while drunk, this is driving while impaired, so anyone who may have a
violation as a result of prescription drug or some other thing involved
they too would be subject to this;  no matter how late in life, this is
a lifelong bill.  This is a bill that will count your convictions
whether it is for a substance that is a prescription or not; if it is an
over the counter substance that you might have taken for a cold or
whatever or whether it is alcohol, it is driving while impaired, not
driving while drunk, meaning drinking alcohol, so I do want to make sure
as we vote and consider this, we consider those facts and not get off on
some other idea.  I think the other question is, are the standards that
we use in convictions the same, are the people the same who are in the
courtroom representing the defendants and do we go through the same
amount of care.  I heard Representative Michaux talk about the
constitution and he believes in it and I believe we should have that
opportunity for everyone</p>

for the charges, whether there’s some bias involved, whether there’s a
vendetta, or whether the person has a drinking problem. But certainly
that’s what we rely on the court for. I think in light of the subsequent

Representative Jackson’s bill reduces the number of prior DWI offenses
required to become a habitual DWI from three to two, so that the third
DWI within a 10 year period would be a habitual DWI, instead of the
fourth.
And this bill does not address the concern about the guy who was
imprisoned for 10 years, and we need to make sure that he’s just not a
misdemeanor out there, he should be a habitual felon. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Duane Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want to clarify one thing about looking back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve been in the sentencing phase quite a few times,
and the judge now has the ability to look back on these sentences. A
judge now can look back not just at convictions, but charges and any
part of the person’s record in the sentencing phase.
It was also mentioned that his gives the prosecutor and option, but
again I’ve represented thousands of clients. I’ve never seen a
prosecutor once that didn’t charge everything he could and then some.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Deborah Ross, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative Tim Moore a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Moore. And these are
friendly questions, but I think that they might help the body and maybe
help us weigh all of these things. We have two DWI bills on our calendar
today that affect each other. And they both have incarceration notes.
And so I would just like to know why they didn’t both go to the same
Judiciary Committee so that the policy could be considered together? And
why they then didn’t get referred to the Appropriations’ Committee,
because together they will take up 250 prison beds a year. And whether
or not we have the beds, we still will need to feed those people and
give them medical care and do whatever.
And I personally have no problem with either of the bills now that we’ve
kind of narrowed down the first one. But it just seems like this is a
big issue with a lot of hearts that come together, and maybe they should
have been considered in committee altogether, and then let our
Appropriations’ folks think about the fiscal impact and then brought it
back to us as a package. Is there a reason why it’s all kind of hodge
podge like this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I don’t know that it’s hodge podge, but I would
say this with respect to the bill referral. We do referrals on several
things. Number one, generally criminal bills will go to B, Judiciary
Subcommittee B. However, if a member of a committee is a, or a bill
sponsor is a member of another Judiciary Committee, we will often send
it to the Judiciary Committee where they are a member. So that’s why it
went to two different J Committees.
As far as the Appropriation impact, it’s not a lot of money that’s
affected in looking at it. I was actually, when you asked me to yield to
the question, I was taking a look at the fiscal… Both bills do appear to
have fiscal notes, so they meet that criteria.
So I think this is simply a matter where the House decides from a policy
standpoint what it wants to do. But the budget impact is very minimal in
the big picture.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask a follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, there is a fiscal impact, however, so for both
bills. And if you put them both together then we’re going to have even
more people. And so I guess my next question is how much of a budget
impact does there have to be before we look at it. Not to say that we
wouldn’t pass them again. I am not against these bills. I just want to
know for the future, you know, how much money do we have to spend before
the Appropriations…</p>

Speaker: Welcome and thank you for all your work, on behalf of all the
citizens of NC. [clapping] Representative Jones, please state your
purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I will be brief. I had not
intended to speak on this bill, and then I started thinking a bill about
my 16 year old daughter, who got her driver’s license last week. Then I
started thinking about families I know, constituents of mine, that are
broken hearted today because their young people were killed in car
accidents. Then I started thinking about the fact that almost half of
the auto fatalities that take place are alcohol related. Friends, I
would say that it is an opportunity for us, as I see it, to take a step
in the right direction. It troubles me sometimes to hear comments like,
well, they are just going to do it; they are expected to do it; all of
us were young at one time. I think we need to quit making excuses. I
think that it is important that the citizens of this state, including
the young people of this state, see that the general assembly believes
in personal responsibility. If you are going to operate a motor vehicle,
you have a responsibility to not drive it while impaired. It is as
simple as that. If you are going to choose to use alcohol, or some other
drug, you need to not operate a motor vehicle. I cannot say it better
than Representative Starnes and some of the other Representatives, but
this is a good bill. I commend it to you.

Representative: To speak on the bill.
Speaker: The lady is recognized to speak on the bill.
Representative: House bill 32 increases the allowance of an estate for a
spouse from $20,000 to $30,000, many of you know that in my former life,
I was a clerk of superior court in Ardell County for 18 years. Many
times, when a spouse comes in, they are devastated. This year’s
allowance is what they depend on to make the administration of the
estate simple. If there is only this amount of personal property then
this definitely makes it easier for that spouse to handle those
devastating circumstances. This amount, increased to $30,000, would
generally take care of a car, maybe a bank account, and they would not
have to go through all of the formal administration. This is a good bill
and I appreciate Representative Hurlein sponsoring it with me and I hope
that you will support it.

Impaired Driving. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Jackson, please state your purpose.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
To speak on a bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, we've heard a little bit
about my bill but I'm going to explain it in a little more detail. First
I want to commend the sponsors of House Bill 31. I think it was a good
bill. I want to explain a little bit what wasn't explained. I wasn't
going to stand up and talk about somebody else's bill because of mine.
But I just want you to understand  when you get a habitual DWI, you lose
your license permanently. At least it used to be permanently. And a few
years ago, over some objections from some of us that were here, we put a
provision where you could get your license reinstated under certain
provisions after ten years.
So if you got a habitual, you went ten years without another one, then
you might could get a license back if you put an intoxilyzer in your car
and you had to have that for seven years. And that provision that allows
the license coming back expires in 2014 and I hope we will not renew
that. I just want to let you know, it's a long way out, this period of
coverage and somebody shouldn't be driving basically without the
machine. They shouldn't be driving at least seventeen years. They
shouldn't be drunk driving at least seventeen years after getting a
habitual. And so this was a loophole and I appreciate Representative
Hurley and Brandon, Baskerville for addressing that.
One of the questions was asked, why didn't we work together? Well, this
shows you legislative confidentiality really works. She was having a
bill drawn up, I was having a bill drawn up and nobody told us we had
each others bill. They got introduced I think the same day, maybe the
next day. And that's how we want it to work. I introduced five bills and
the reason why they're not all together, I understand that about let's.
I can write a bill. I you want to really make a difference in fatalities
in North Carolina, I can write that drunk driving bill. But you know
what will happen if I put everything that needs to be in that bill? It
would get buried in committee because somebody would have a problem with
this part and somebody would have a problem with that part and so it
would never get passed.
And so what I did was I broke my bills up into individual pieces and
this is the first one of them. And it addresses a problem which I saw
looking, how can we address driving while impaired and specifically, the
fatalities. And so I looked at other states and what I saw was North
Carolina is somewhere in the middle about how we treat habitual DWI
offenders. And I looked for the two states that really jumped out at me
that had a lot fewer DWI fatalities. And I said to myself &quot;What do
they have in common?&quot; And one thing they had in common was, they've
treated the trigger. Well, it moved from a misdemeanor to a felony or
into some type of enhanced sentence, much fewer. Some states do it on
your second offense, believe it or not within a time period. This bill
would move it from fourth in ten years to three in ten years. I don't
think that's a drastic change.
There will be a fiscal impact, as I had told the members in Judiciary
Committee A in committee. I think there's one hundred eighty something
beds in the second year. What that tells me is there will be one hundred
eighty something people who are drunk driving on our roads that won't be
on our roads for at least twelve months and I think that's a good thing.
The couple that got killed went to church in my district. They got
killed on Sunday. They were on their way home from church. They went to
an earlier service than normal so they could go watch the Carolina
basketball game at home. And they were killed by somebody at one o'clock
in the afternoon who had been charged three times. And one of the issues
that he had was that he had had two charges dismissed.
And Representative Michaux made a point about issues that go into that
and so one of the bills I have would address that because an office
didn't show up and so the state had to take a dismissal on that charge
and of course, this happened. But some of these things can be prevented.
We can't prevent every one of these fatalities but we can make a
difference. This bill is just a small step in that direction. The
Sheriff's Association did come out in support of the bill and I'd
appreciate your support.

Representative, just one question. Since we just amended this same
statute and yours reads ten years, would the changes we made a moment
ago affect yours? Would yours now be for lifetime or would the way it's
written, ten years, still be in place with yours?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Representative Hall. No they would not change. Our bills do
not impact each other in that they don't change. My bill makes it the
third is going to be habitual and once you get a habitual, 31 will make
every charge after that habitual.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members of the House.  As the Reading Clerk
stated, this is a provision that came from the program evaluation
committee in the--in Session log 2010--and the program evaluation
division did study how local education authorities assess direct and
indirect costs to their individual nutrition program.  And, these
charges are allowed by the Federal government, and also by state law, to
cover school direct--school districts' overhead--but are levied by the
--at the discretion of your local LEA.  The General Assembly was
reacting to complaints from the school nutrition directors that the
administrative costs allowed--[pause]--The General Assembly was reacting
to complaints from school nutrition directors that the administrative
cost--allocated charges--were causing the programs to have a very
serious cash flow problem within the local school systems.  And the
program evaluation division found that an average school lost money on
each school meal, and were generating revenues to cover costs by selling
the less than desirable a la carte French fries and doughnuts, and the
things that were certainly not very healthy.  But, they created a higher
cost and helped to subsidize the program.  The evaluation found that 52
of the 115 programs statewide operated at a loss.  That 67 of the 115
did not have the one month operating balance that the Department of
Public Instruction required by policy.  However, 30 of the 67 programs
that did have the one month's balance--did not have the one month's
balance--were charged indirect costs by their local education
authorities in spite of the policy that was in place at the Department.
So, actually, what this bill will do--because the DPI policy was not
working, the Committee voted, and this bill went to Finance and just
came out.  Program Evaluation recommended that the General Assembly
require a minimum of one month operating balance by law before a local
education authority can assess indirect costs to their school nutrition
programs. With that, Mr. Speaker, I'll stand to answer any questions,
and I would ask for your support on the bill.

Speaker:  Representative Conrad, please state your purpose.
Representative: To speak to the bill.
Speaker: The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. The purpose of this bill is to
clarify that any proprietary computer code, written either by an agency
or subdivision of the state or local government, will not be on public
record. We already have a general statute, 132-1, that defines what is
part of the public record, such as documents, letters anything that is
part of business. All this bill would do is add computer code, the
binary program language, to that list in the specific exclusions. There
are two reasons for doing this. The first is rather obvious and that is
for security reasons and to prevent cyber attacks. The second reason was
proposed to me by the county manager of my county, Syke County, was that
this computer code could have a marketable value. This computer code,
developed by in house IT staff, could be licensed to private businesses
and negotiated with contract agreements. The public would benefit from
these agreements by any financial considerations that would be included
in the contracts. The bill passed unanimously from the judicial
committee, and also, since this particular bill is part of the public
record, I have not had any objections from the citizens or the press. I
would commend this bill for your approval.

Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, house bill
150 simply clarifies that municipalities in counties do not have the
authority to regulate the aesthetics of single family and two family
residential homes as it applies to the planning or outside of exterior
roofs, the planning of an individual home, porches, nonstructural
exterior ornamentations, the window styles and garage doors and types of
rooms and interior lay outs of homes. This bill provides a number of
exceptions to the aesthetics rules. First and foremost, this bill does
not regulate aesthetics that a municipality or county may seek to
regulate, in terms of multi family construction, or commercial
constructions. It does not impact historic districts, or historic homes
whether those are on national registry, or whether it is a local estate
or national. It does not exempt anything that would be involved with
respect to safety, manufactured housing trailers</p>

[Speaker changes.] national...anything that complies with National Flood
Insurance and obviously it does not in any way impede municipalities
from being able to regulate the height, bulk, orientation and location
of a structure, a home on a particular lot. It doesn't effect screenings
and buffers, and it does not in any way, effect homeowners' associations
or covenants that have been agreed to. What this bill is...the purpose
of this bill, I think, is very straightforward. We have had a number of
municipalities across this state that have taken the zoning regulations,
the clear, plain language of the zoning provisions of this state where
the General Assembly has spelled out what that grant of power is under
160A and they have taken it far afield. And, in some cases, to the
absurd, which I think a coupla the speakers may allude to in a
moment...and give you some examples.  What we are doing is we are
restoring the balance so that individuals have the ability to be able to
have some choice in their housing and what that housing looks like.
Now...this is supported obviously by the home builders, it's supported
by the North Carolina Realtors Association, but it is also, as important
as those groups, this bill is strongly supported by the North Carolina
Housing Coalition...and those are the folks that, among other groups,
they work with Habitat for Humanity and they have had tremendous
difficulties in a number of areas around the state, a number of
municipalities, being able to do projects because of cost considerations
involving simply matters of aesthetics. And that should not be. So what
we are doing in this legislation is we are bringing back the statute to
the original meaning.  We are making sure that there are plenty of
exceptions so that we do not upset planned developments, we do not upset
historic districts but we do provide both for choice...consumers, people
looking to buy homes, and this bill will also provide in the long run,
more choices for the working families of this state.  You talk about
teachers, firefighters, policemen, others...working people deserve to be
able to afford to live in homes like everyone else. So, with that,
Mister Speaker, I believe that Mister...Representative Moffitt has a
clarifying amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Moffitt, state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] Send forth an amendment, Mister Speaker.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized, the Clerk will read.

&quot;or modular&quot;.

is a technical correction, simply stated the exception regarding
manufacturing housing which is regulated by HUD stands on its own, and
when you include &quot;or modular&quot;, which is regulated under
building codes, it is inappropriately placed in the bill in that area.
Appreciate your support.

amendment? Several members with their lights on.  Any...further
discussion, further debate? If not, Representative Moffitt's amendment
is before us. Those in favor will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no.

Committee of Great Reform even though I’m on great reform. In one
instance there was a subdivision that was started with a builder and was
not completed. And someone took it over and the building as I understand
it, that was being proposed for the finishing of the subdivision wasn’t
up to par with what was originally started. And people were real
concerned about their property values being damaged. And actually the
builder, I guess because of these types of ordinance enforcement were,
was brought to code or to the satisfaction of the neighborhood. I’m
assuming by the municipality. What kinds of protections are there going
to be with the removal of the or passage of this bill in a situation
like this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To answer your question Representative Avila, Developer Agreements which
are covered under 160A-400.2, I think and following, those agreements
would continue to be in effect for the subsequent owners of the property
or further individuals that would either buy it in foreclosure or buy it
and wanna to continue to make to develop those agreements that were put
in place by the municipality would continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So clarification on that. Let’s say the quality, just simply the quality
of the building materials. Can they under the code that you’re talking
about. Are they that specific that they can say you need to put in pella
windows instead of others. I mean that’s the kind of thing that a
subdivisions is being advertised as?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, if there’s an negotiated agreement, whatever was in writing
obviously  and agreed to by the municipalities and by the parties would
continue to survive. So as far as specifics in a given agreement, I
don’t know. But if it’s in the written in the agreement, it would
survive.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the proposed legislation there are areas of a historic nature in the
registries and things of that nature and in the one, you talk about the
local registries. Sometimes areas don’t really go through a process of
having it formally identified as a historical area. And if they. Let’s
say a downtown area wants to maintain a certain flavor or certain
appearance and everything. Would that be possible with the passage of
150?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, yes on two fronts. Because. Of course if you got a downtown that
involves commercial, then obviously this bill doesn’t affect commercial
development. But if you’re talking about a downtown neighborhood, they
can, those neighbors can get together and agree and have a neighborhood
if every, all the property owners agree. They can have a neighborhood
overlay district that would govern them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Final question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The other case I know we do have some
municipalities that have carried this to the extreme or we wouldn’t have
the bill here. There are others; however, have been very judicious in
how they work with builders and with neighborhoods in the development of
aesthetics. What would, what would a municipality be able do in the case
you got somebody who wants to build something that just doesn’t fit in
the neighborhood. It’s very aesthetically jarring, maybe whatever. But
they have no control and the neighbors aren’t happy with it and it’s not
a pretty situation. What do we do in a case like that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, if you’re talking about Enfield where there's no neighborhood
overlay district, where there’s no homeowners association, where there’s
no convenance. I would just say this, number one, if it’s a builder
building a house, they’re gonna want to build something that going to
sale. And in addition to that, the municipality continues to be able to
regulate those things in zoning and in terms of the location of that
structure on the piece of property, the height, the number of stories.
All of those things that are provided for in current law would in the
statues, they would be able to enforce. And beyond that, if a particular
municipality wanted to do something beyond what is provided for in
statute, they could certainly bring a bill to the General Assembly and
the General Assembly could consider that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you,??</p>

Representative Holley, state your purpose [Speaker Changes] speak the
bill [Speaker Changes] Again the lady has the floor[Speaker Changes] I
personally have no problem with part of this bill but I think that this
bill in some ways effects my community in another way. We don’t have
communities of protective ??. When you’re living inside the beltline of
the city where you have neighborhoods that don’t have protective ?? ,
the uniformity of look of the neighborhoods and things like that are
extremely important. And this bill will kind of destroy the unified
development ordinances that many communities have developed and cities
and town have developed. That’s one. The second one which is more
important, is this interior part that I have little problems with. If
you living in areas; say NC State University, you have those big
beautiful homes over there, there’s nothing to keep you from putting in
four kitchens. For every kitchen you put in you can have four residents
and this ends up being rooming houses and multiple family dwellings in
what is historically a single family home community. And that’s where
I’m against the bill. I think it goes too far. Thank you [Speaker
Changes] Members we have with us in the gallery, we’d like to extend a
courtesy of the gallery and a welcome to Austin elementary school from
Wilmington. If the members of that school; the students will stand and
let us welcome you. Representative Faircloth, state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] ask a question to the bill sponsor [Speaker Changes]
Representative Dollar, do you yield? [Speaker Changes] I yield [Speaker
Changes] Thank you representative Dollar, I had a constituent that
called and is from one of our smaller communities in Guilford County.
The community made up of a lot of historic structures and what have you.
And the question he had is that a part of their community is included in
the scenic byways project of the state and he wondered what effect this
might have on structures within that scenic byway. Now I not that
familiar with scenic byways but it apparently does have some historic
structures on it as it goes through the state. [Speaker Changes]Well, I
know the scenic byways are designations that were put in place. For
example of a stretch of roadway that is viewed as being scenic and they
want to designate it as a scenic byway primarily to encourage tourism.
There are requirements like for example if you’re talking about the Blue
Ridge Parkway at least as far as the parkway controls the territory;
they’re able to control anything in it. And of course, as you know, one
of the problems they’ve had there is that things beyond their control.
In this situation I don’t think the scenic byways, somebody can answer
the question better than I. But it’s not; to my knowledge the scenic
byways does not actually control developmental law it’s just it’s just a
recognition of a nice road to drive down. [Speaker Changes] ?? Have a
question [Speaker Changes] Does the gentleman yield? [Speaker Changes] I
yield [Speaker Changes] If there were a historic structure in the scenic
byway, does the language in the bill that speaks to historic structures,
would it apply to that? [Speaker Changes]I don’t think the byways would
be controlling at all. However in lines 11 through 15, it does address
structures located in areas designated as local historic district;
structures listed on the national registry of historic places or
structures that are individually designated as local, state, or national
historic landmarks. So if it’s historic, it should be covered in some
way in this bill. [Speaker Changes]Thank you [Speaker Changes]
Representative Glazier, state your purpose [Speaker Changes]debate the
bill, Mr. Speaker[Speaker Changes]The gentleman has the floor. [Speaker
Changes]Thank you very much. This is sort of a classic reminder to me
that sometimes we can all get lost in our ideology and stake out
positions early on without, sort of  listening to the other side. And
often, it may be useful to do that and to read the law. And in this
case, early on when I first saw the bill filed, my initial inclination
was to be opposed because I’ve spent a lot of time in the last two years
on the floor suggesting that I had respectful disagreement  on an
overreach with regard to limiting local authority. But it would be
helpful</p>

<p id="075:00">
I think as a reminder to all of us, it certainly was to me, to go back
and before you do that, read the bill and read the law. I was reminded
of that in this case so I did go back and read the bill and read the
law. And I have changed my opinion and actually feel strongly about the
opinion.
I am going to be supporting the bill for a couple of reasons. Number
one. The North Carolina supreme court in the Lanvale case written by
justice Jackson, I think last year if I'm not mistaken or middle of last
year, made it very clear that the points that representative Dollar said
are accurate. There are a number of municipalities, mine included, who
are engaging in what may be very important decisions with regard to
aesthetics that do benefit a community. But they don't have any
authority to be doing it and that's fundamentally the problem.
In the end, it may be very good policy. It may in fact be what we ought
to consider as representative Dollar suggested in a bill later this
session to look at perhaps expanding the authority to get it exactly the
issue representative Avila raised and because there isn't a good answer
for that right now. But the answer can't be for the municipalities to
create these ordinances when they have no authority under the statutes
of the state to be doing that. So that's a policy decision we will have
to make. I don't think this body is ready to change the laws that exist
but it seems clear that a number of municipalities are violating the
law.
I got a letter, as we all did I think, inundated by emails and letters
in the last week on this bill, and this highlights the point to me. This
particular municipality who I think is trying to do wonderful things
talks about how this bill would negate the ability of them to create
ordinances to deal with location and architectural stylings of windows
and doors.
Well frankly, I don't think it is any of the municipalities' business or
government's right what the architectural style of my door ought to be;
nor frankly, absent unusual circumstance, the color of the brick I use.
I think there are complete ways for municipalities to do this.
Number one. If it is in subdivisions, the bill creates a full exemption.
When people move in subdivisions, they agree to a particular covenance.
They don't have to move there but when they choose to I think it's
perfectly legitimate and I think the bill preserves all the private
contract rights that it has to for those people to have to obey whatever
the restrictions are including the color of the house and the garage
door. But that's a private contract. That is not the government coming
in and telling me I have to have a green door.
Third point I guess I would make is, back to the home owners
association, home builders association and the realtors. Aside from the
six exemptions that exist in the bill which are pretty broad including
the safety one and the private contract exemption one which we've talked
about, all of us know in here there are ways outside of that, that
municipalities will be able to enforce an awful lot of regulation. They
can do it through their zoning power and through their ability to zone
and their ability to approve particular subdivision capacities.
So let us not fool ourselves that they don't have a power to do that. It
may be more indirectly but they do have that. So it's not outside of
their capacity to do it. They may not like how they get there to do it
but they do it and they do it all the time. So I don't view this as an
all or nothing proposition.
I do view it as a leveling of the playing field in a sense. And I do
view it as stating what the law is. I will say to the home builders and
realtors, from my perspective, be careful what you ask for. You're about
to get it. And that is you will have municipalities, I think, using
those other means in more indirect ways. And so I think there is an
incentive for both the home builders and the realtors and communities to
work with their municipalities to create appropriate ordinances. That
there can be agreement on community standards about. And I think that
there will be pressure and there ought to be on us to re-look at the
zoning laws we have to make sure we can answer representative Avila's
question and that we don't allow things to happen in our inner cities
that would really deplete economic capacity there or deplete home values
in the community.
That having been said, that's all about talking to each other. That's
all about community standards and working together. And one thing that I
think this bill highlights and why I am going to support it is because
the only option that doesn't exist is to illegally impose something and</p>

the written amendment of course, from third reading, that would
essentially limit it that you have been quoted in the press as saying,
basically disturbing to you about cities telling in new subdivisions
what colors to use, and this and that. Would you support a bill that
limited that and not interfered with what neighborhoods in Durham are
asking?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well Rep. Luebke, I think that the bill is well written as it stands,
and addresses those aesthetic elements that need to be addressed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House.
I will say that for our city, and I think for others in our area, this
is seen as a very much intrusive bill that's undermining the work of
what I know our city council is doing in protection of our
neighborhoods, our older established neighborhoods, and at the request
of those neighborhoods. And I will say in particular among those lines,
in last Sunday's Herald Sun, our Durham paper, the home builder's
association of the Triangle Orange Durham Chatham county,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess our part of the triangle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Orange Durham Chatham was asked how they felt about this bill and they
said they really didn't ask for this bill, didn't need this bill. They
didn't feel there was any problem in any of the three counties. And why?
Because what the cities are doing, and I'll be specific about Durham,
what Durham is doing is not messing with new subdivisions with their
policy, they're protecting older established neighborhoods. And again,
to disagree with my friend Rep. Glazier, there is something that is
appropriate about a government, at the request of a neighborhood, saying
what kinds of housing are not appropriate. Imagine a set, a whole
neighborhood of 1920s, 1930 houses. And in comes somebody who buys a
couple of those houses here, you know, first house, fourth house, eighth
house, out of 20 house or 15 houses, tears them down, and wants to put
up a house that has a 3 car garage in the front. Totally, totally
disrupting the aesthetics, to use that term, of the neighborhood. Those
houses have nice front por- We all know what those houses look like
built in th 20s and 30s. Got front porches because there was no air
conditioning, everybody sat out on the front porch. All of a sudden,
that neighborhood is disrupted by a house here, a house here, a house
here, that has a 3 car garage in the front.  Now in Durham,
neighborhoods have gone to our city council and said &quot;Protect us
from that. Please protect us from that.&quot; And they have. And another
example. It would, I know that Rep. Foushee is quite aware of this, but
I'll go ahead and mention it because it was in the paper, the
African-American neighborhood of Northside, many of you may know if you
went to Carolina, that neighborhood is in danger of really being
undermined by speculators who bought houses and were turning them into
dorm rooms, in effect dorm rooms, for Carolina students. The
neighborhood did not want itself disrupted, and it didn't want itself
really destroyed by the intrusion really of rooming houses. They went to
their town council, the town council basically put a overlay on that
part of Chapel Hill and said &quot;You can't have multiple unrelated
people living in these houses&quot; in order to save the neighborhood.
Those 2 examples I've given, one from Durham one from Chapel Hill, the
city council, town council can no longer do that if this bill passes the
way it is. And I think that most of us, if you think about it in those
terms from a perspective of neighborhood protection,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
could not support this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanted to see if Rep. Luebke would yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
Rep. Luebke, where did the city get the authority to do that anyway? I
mean part of why we're here is  because the Supreme Court said they were
far exceeding their authority, so where did they get their authority
anyway?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well Rep. Stevens, you're an attorney I'm not. But I know that- I know
what our city's been doing, and I think it's good policy, and I'd be
glad to work with you, we've still got time, we'll put in a bill that'll
allow the cities to protect the neighborhoods. Will you help me on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But you indicate that they don't have the legal authority to do it. So
you want
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No Ma'am. I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will wait until the question has been asked.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So I'm asking you where they got the legal authority to tell independent
home purchasers what they can or cannot do with their private home
property.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I'd say first, Rep. Stevens, that you're not addressing what I'm
addressing which is about neighborhoods protecting</p>

sales. We're not talking about individual homeowners. If you're gonna
deal with the individual homeowner that's one thing and that part of the
bill Representative Stevens that part of the bill I would support. But
what is of concern to us in Durham, Chapel Hill and where the home
builders don't even have a problem with it in Durham Orange Chatham is
these protections for established neighborhoods. This bill completely
eliminates that and if you represent that there is not protection under
the law that there's no statutory authority then I again would ask you
whether you and I could put a bill in and get it through this general
assembly because without your support I ain't getting it through. So
that'd be my comment. So to speak finally on the bill members I think if
you draw a distinction between individual homes or new subdivisions
where cities what I would say exceed good sense and established
neighborhoods you see we have a problem with this bill. Cause if it's
the one on new subdivisions and not saying you can't paint it pink or
whatever you want to paint it that's one thing. But to not allow
neighborhoods to protect themselves and note that this bill looks like
it protects those older neighborhoods but it only does if they're on
historic they have the historic status. There have some kind of
neighborhood preservation status. If they don't have that legal status
they're just in an old neighborhood from the 20s and 30s they're not
protected by this bill and those homes no longer will be able to get the
protections they now have from my city and the town of Chapel Hill for
example so
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under those circumstances I urge you to vote no on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Luebke would yield for
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are you familiar that there are neighborhood overlay districts and that
it is provided for both in the bill and the continuing statute that
those neighbors those homeowners could get together and create a
neighborhood overlay district that would resolve the issue that you've
been talking about. Aren't you aware of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar. I'm aware that this has been a point of
controversy for the neighbors who have asked that this bill be voted
down, for the city council that's asked this vote be bidden down, for
the city planning department that's urged it's voted down. So maybe you
and I can talk between second and third reading and try to show those
folks in Durham who are contacting all of us in the Durham delegation,
show us where they're wrong. Not reading the bill right and or maybe we
need a clarifying amendment. But from what I'm hearing from my
constituents this will harm neighborhoods and is not a good bill. Thank
you. Urge members to defeat the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Terry please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. This has been somewhat of a conflicting piece of
legislation as it relates to some of the same issues that Representative
Luebke was just debating. But my concern is about the in fill and
looking at I think in the committee Representative Dollar did address
the issue about in fill. Neighborhood friendly development really does
require that the people in a municipality have some input as it relates
to the new things that are coming. And in the area that I represent
there is a lot of opportunity for infill. And I have to preface this by
saying that I am neither I am never anti development nor business
because I understand its value and I realize that we have to have it in
order to have the great state of North Carolina that we do have. But I
am eminently interested in insuring that there is an opportunity for
input from the citizenry as to what comes into a neighborhood and a
development where there are miles and miles of spotty development
opportunity for in fill development that will keep cities in that inner
core aesthetically valuable and resellable if you will. And the idea of
this legislation does cause me to be concerned regarding exactly how we
can bring forward an opportunity for this without destroying the
opportunity for the developer to develop and for the people who live
there to be able to live there in what I consider to be a neighborhood
friendly environment. So in</p>

Co-sponsored with Representative Jordan and Representative McGrady, and
has unanimously passed the JB Committee and State Personnel. It does
exactly what it says, which is, we currently have a mandatory retirement
age for judges and judicial officials, Court of Appeals, Supreme Court,
Superior Court, District Court, but the magistrates were not included in
that. This is to put them in the same position as all other judicial
officials. If we decide one day to change the age, it changes for them
all. Otherwise, everyone's in it. It also didn't put it into effect
until January 1st, 2015, which is the next reappointment date, so that
no one would be caught off guard. But, and Mr. Speaker I know of no real
opposition except for a few of the magistrates that are 72. But
Representative Whitmire, I believe, has an amendment which will cure all
of that and I completely consent to his amendment and you ask you
recognize Representative Whitmire. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire moves to amend the bill on
page one line 12 by rewriting the line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Before we begin the debate on the amendment the chair
is happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to students, teachers,
and parent chaperons from Hasty Elementary in Thomasville, Davidson
County. Please stand and let us welcome you. Representative Whitmire is
recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The House will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. The amendment does two things. One, it
allows those who reach the mandatory retirement age within their term to
simply finish out their term. And two, for counties, especially smaller
counties, it allows them ample time to look to the future and make sure
they have candidates to fill those positions. I ask that you support the
amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak briefly to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, I completely
consent to the amendment and believe it, sort of, does the
grandfathering that Representative Whitmire wants. And with that I think
there will be no opposition to the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the amendment
sent forth by Representative Whitmire for the House committee substitute
for House Bill 161. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. Clerk will op machine record the vote. 116
having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative, the amendment
passes. We are now back on the bill. Further discussion, further debate?
Representative Lewis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I will be as brief as I can. I
concur with the gentleman from Cumberland that this does treat
magistrates the same as it does the other, the other judicial officials.
However, each year that I pass the sun one more time, I become a little
bit less convinced that it's wise to impose an age restriction on
someone who is able and willing to serve. And, while I, as I said, I
agree that this bill does treat magistrates the same, I will vote no
because I don't believe that a restriction based solely on age should
should be put in place. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Duane Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Mr. Lewis just said it exactly as I would
have, probably better. It's, it's, I hate to use the word ageism but
there's so many people I know over 72 that are way more than qualified.
I think that should be 100% irrelevant if they're qualified to do the
job. Quite a few of the legislators in here, I think, that are getting
close to 72. Unless we want to have an amendment that says there's also
mandatory age here, I'd urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the House committee
substitute to House Bill 161 as amended on its second reading. All those
in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. Clerk will open the vote.</p>

[speaker changes]
Committee substitute for House Bill 189 the bill's been titled, enact to
amend the laws regarding information provided to non custodial parents
subject to wage withholding orders under the laws pertaining to child
support. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[speaker changes]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[speaker changes]
To explain the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized.
[speaker changes]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. This is a bill with Representative
Stevens and representative Hall requested by the family law council
within the bar  association. Essentially, the current statute lists
required contents of non 4d child support orders that contain an income
withholding requirement and a 4d child support order. It lists out a
series f things that have to be included and complied with for each
requirement. The statute was unclear and it now makes clear that all of
the requirements of the statute have to be complied with and then
additionally, it was negotiated and this was a part that was worked out
with a series of stakeholder meetings that Representative Stevens got
together and that is to make sure that under some circumstances where
there has been essentially a court order that the child support
enforcement agency has to provide the party owing support with the
address of the custodial parent or child because members of the bar have
been requesting that information hadn't been able to get it. HSS is now
satisfied with the bill. All of the stakeholders are satisfied. I know
of no objection to the bill. And it passed unanimously from JC. Thank
you.

To speak on the bill.
[speaker changes]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, this bill also comes to us
from the bar association and its for two specific requests. One, in a
domestic violence protective order, we used to do consent orders all of
the time, but the court of appeals said you can't do that. You have to
have a finding of fact of violence unless the legislature amends its
statute. Here we are amending the statute to say you can do a consent
order without having to find a specific finding of violence between the
parties. The second part is under 50c orders where neighbor takes
neighbor or somebody's mad at their friend or whatever. This provision
simply-the amendment simply allows the court to assess attorney fees if
it feels like the action was frivolous on either party's part. That's
all this bill does.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is the Governors pick for to go on to the

That should be enough. But if you need more, Mr. Bailey is a civil
engineer. I guess a third positive thing is he did graduate from NC
State. That’s a good thing also. He is a general manager of ATI Allvac.
They’re a medical urgical company works in super alloys. A lot of
technical stuff that I don’t think I understand all of it. He has spent
