local bills. Second reading, Senate Bill 95. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 95. Tabor City Election.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Walters is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. What Senate Bill 95 does is
simply provide the city of Tabor City a procedure to fill midterm
elections. This comes from a court request from the city council of the
Mayor. I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Walters asked for your support. Is there any
further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the passage of Senate Bill 95 on its second reading. All in
favor will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no. The ayes have it. Senate Bill 95 passes
its second reading without objection and will be read a third time.

will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The ayes have it and Senate Bill 95 passes its third
reading and will be sent to the House. We're moving on to the public
bills now. This is the third reading of role call bill for Senate Bill,
for the, actually the Committee Substitute #2 to Senate Bill 76 as
Amended. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 76. Domestic Energy Jobs Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, would you like to explain anything
further about the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it's all been said, but I'll be happy to
answer any questions. I commend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is the passage of the Committee Substitute #2
to Senate Bill 76 as Amended on its third reading. All in favor will
vote aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting, and the clerk will record the vote. 39 having voted in the
affirmative and 7 in the negative, the Committee Substitute, the
Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 76 as Amended passes its third
reading. The amendments will be engrossed and sent to the House. We're
now going to move on to the second reading of public bills. Senate Bill
43, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 43 Studied Savings for Administration of
Claims.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, Mr. President. This bill, and the next two bills,
come from the Joint Legislative Committee on Worker's Compensation,
Insurance Coverage, Compliance and Fraud Prevention and Detection. A
long title. What this first bill does, it asks the Department of Public
Construction and the Office of State Budget and Management to study and
make recommendations regarding the management of worker's compensation
claims submitted by state and local government employees. In the
committee, we found out that over the past few years that worker's comp
claims had risen, had risen by quite a bit, and we felt like we needed
to study this issue. I can get into detail of the bill if you'd like,
but that's basically what the bill does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Is there any further discussion or
debate? Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird, you can ask your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, on line 33 through 35 it says that
you're going to have strategies to return injured employees to work as
soon as possible. Is this a possib-, is this a problem? Are you finding
malingering? Why is that in there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird, part of the lies, that I think, in
worker's comp claims is that we don't look for ways to put employees
back to work. And I think part of this study will look at how we can do
that, and it should help in the claims process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is the passage of Senate Bill 43 on its
second reading. All in favor will vote aye, opposed will vote no. Five
seconds will be allowed for voting and the clerk will record the vote.

[Speaker Change]
Further notices or further announcements. Senator Apodaca, for what
purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President, if I might, I need to deliver a Voice Committee Report.
[Speaker Change]
Senator, you have the floor for your Voice Committee report.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President, members. Last night the Aux Committee met and
it was a long and tedious meeting. We went through the history books and
we looked back to see if in the history of the Senate if there ever had
been a freshman that moved so quickly toward receiving the Aux Meter.
Now Senator McKissick was meteoric because he went from an amateur to a
professional quicker than anybody in the history. So he’s not eligible.
But it must be something about my hometown Durham because the Bull City
has created some great folks. And they have sent us a new one this time
who has been awarded the Aux Meter as the fastest recipient, as a
freshman, in the history of the North Carolina Senate history. Senator
Woodard, we are proud to present this to you and we hope you enjoy it.
[Speaker Change]
Congratulations Senator. Do we have any notices or announcements?
Senator Soucek, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
To send forth a committee report out of order and afterwards to make an
announcement if I may.
[Speaker Change]
Senator, you can send forth your committee report out of order. The
clerk will read.
[Speaker Change]
Senate, Senator Soucek for the Education, Higher Education Committee,
submits for passage. House Joint Resolution one thirty eight. Set
community college and election date, favorable.
[Speaker Change]
House Joint Resolution one thirty eight, calendar. Senator Soucek, you
are recognized for your announcement.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President. The Republican are reminded about our three
o’clock ethics training at room twenty one twenty six.
[Speaker Change]
Any other notices or announcements? Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do
you rise?
[Speaker Change]
Announcement please.
[Speaker Change]
Senator, you have the floor for your announcement.
[Speaker Change]
Members of the Select Committee on UNC Board of Governors, we will meet
in ten minutes after session in our usual room. Room ten twenty seven.
Senator Nesbitt, did they explain what has happened? Let me explain.
We’re going to have to reopen the nominations for a short period of
time. Some erroneous information was given by the Ethics Commission, of
all folks, on the forms that should be turned in so we’ll go over that
in the meeting. They said a short form was fine. It should have been a
long form. So, thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Nesbitt, did you want to make an announcement?
[Speaker Change]
Yes. Thank you Mr. President. To make an announcement.
[Speaker Change]
You have the floor Senator.
[Speaker Change]
The Democrats will caucus immediately after session.
[Speaker Change]

You have the floor Senator.
[Speaker Change]
The Judiciary Two Committee will meet at ten o’clock in eleven twenty

Any other notices or announcements? Is there any further business to
come before the Senate? Senator Newton, do you want to make an
announcement. You have the floor.
[Speaker Change]
I was just going to announce the Judiciary One Committee is meeting
tomorrow with some interesting stuff.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Senator. There’s no further business to come before the
Senate. The Chair recognizes Senator Berger for a motion.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President. If I could, just a statement before I make the
motion. Senator Rucho from time to time has had a big smile on his face.
One time when the Redistricting Bill passed, he had a great bill smile
on his face. But I don’t think I’ve ever seen him happier than today
when he lost the Aux Meters. So. And, with that Mr. President, I move
that the Senate do now adjourn subject to the introduction of Bills and
Resolutions. The receipt, referral, and re-referral of committee reports
and the receipt of messages from the House and the Governor, to
reconvene tomorrow, February Twenty Eight, Two Thousand Thirteen at
eleven am.
[Speaker Change]
The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn subject to the stipulations
of Senator Berger, to reconvene February Twenty Eight, Two at eleven am.
Seconded by Senator Soucek. All in favor say aye. Opposed no. The ayes
have it. The Senate stands adjourned.</p>
