feet.  Oh Lord we sure do need your help today, here.  We need your

heavenly Father, hear us, be attentive to our pleas for mercy. If you,
Oh Lord could mark inequities, who could stand before you? But with you,
there’s forgiveness. And with you, there’s relief. With you, there are
head waters of refreshment.  With you, there is everlasting refreshment.
Teach of us during this time.  Teach us how to press on.  I pray in the

industrialist of Aluminum Francais and its subsidiary Southern Aluminum
Company. In whereas in 1913 the French engineers began development of
hydro electrical power potential on the Yadkin River at Badin.  And
whereas the Badin township received its name from the Aluminum Francais
General Superintendant, Adrian Badin. In whereas the garden city
designed ?? streets of Badin were named for Native American tribes,
indigenous trees, and United States Presidents and Generals, and whereas
in 1913 Badin had its own water distribution facilities, waste water
treatment plant, and electrical distribution system,  and as Badin was
and remains architecturally unique because of its French design.
quadroplexes, cottages, bungalows and clubhouse. Badin was also Stanly
county’s home for their first hospital, opera house, golf course and
aluminum shelter  Whereas  2013 marks the 100th anniversary of the town
of Badin, where many events have been held this year to celebrate the
town’s abundant natural and deep cultural history.  Therefore the town
of Badin deserves recognition on its 100th anniversary.  I’m honored to
recognize the town of Badin, congratulate them on 100 years and wanted
to ?? Mr. President,  would appreciate opportunity to acknowledge those</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Rabin, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To speak on the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator
Rabin, you have the floor to speak to the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 490 is a local bill.  It applies to Lee County only.  It
passed the House as written.  There was some controversy, but we believe
the majority of the people in Lee County support the issue.  I strongly
recommend the Senate vote for the bill without any amendments.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  To speak to the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Kinnaird has
the floor to speak to the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  To say there was no
controversy is an understatement.  First of all, this was ostensibly
introduced for transparency in the elections in Lee County.  But the
author of the bill didn't tell the Lee County school board they were
going to introduce the bill, didn't tell the Sanford city council they
were going to introduce the bill.  Furthermore, when the school board
found out about it, they passed a resolution against it.  They also
appeared in the House to object to this bill, and saying that they did
not want this bill.  In fact, five of the seven school board members are
Republicans, and they asked that we do not pass this bill.  They have a
resolution.  They say, &quot;Whereas the Sanford city council did not
request this local bill and has not had an opportunity to be informed on
it prior to introduction, and whereas a change in the election process
will add expenses to the city to provide for the cost of one or more
primary elections, be it resolved that the Sanford city council opposes
the passage of this bill and in the alternative requests amendment to
delete that section relating to it.&quot;  The board of elections says,
education, sorry, &quot;Whereas the board of education never requested a
change to the method of election from nonpartisan to partisan, and as
far as can be determined, an overwhelming majority of the citizens of
Lee County have approved and accepted the nonpartisan concept of
electing members of the board of education as the best way to keep
politics out of the public education system.&quot;  So, they go on to
say they were never consulted or given notice and were surprised and
astonished to learn that this bill, on its own, without any discussion,
was introduced, and they oppose it.  So, if the folks of Lee County
truly want this, they have asked for a referendum.  And at this point,
Mr. President, I'm sending forth an amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you can send forward your amendment.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Kinnaird moves to amend the bill.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Senator Kinnaird is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. President.  What this bill would do is
have a referendum for the people of Lee County for or against changing
the Lee County board of education from nonpartisan to partisan, and the
same for the city council, for or against changing the mayor and council
of the city of Sanford from the nonpartisan to the partisan method of
election.  I believe that this amendment should pass, and I believe that
the people of Lee County should have the opportunity to comment on this,
since they haven't had, up until now.  And I would ask that you approve
this amendment, thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Apodaca, for what
purpose do you rise?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak to the
amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  This is a Lee County local issue.  The
Lee County folks in this chamber would like to have it, so with that
being said, I do move that the amendment do lay upon the table.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. President.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator
Brunstetter, for what purpose do you rise?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  To second
the amendment.  To second the motion.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator
Brunstetter seconds the motion.  It's nondebatable.  We have to vote</p>

On the motion, the question before the senate is thew motion to lay upon
the table. All in favor will vote aye, opposed will vote no, five
seconds will be allowed for the voting, the clerk will record the vote.
Tucker aye. 32 having voted in the affirmative and 17 in the negative,
the motion to lay upon the table passes. The bill under-mended is back
before the body. Senator Stein for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the bill's sponsor will yield for a
question. Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin do you yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. You said in your opening remarks that you
believe that the majority of the people in League county support this
initiative. We just put to a side an amendment that actually would have
given the people of League county the right to vote with the referendum.
So my question to you is since no one person is able to divine the will
of the people, would you be open to considering putting it to the town
council and the school board, the bodies that have been elected by the
people to debate this issue, to decide this issue?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I make no claims on divinity sir. I will tell you that
I think the referendum has already been accomplished. Sixty thousand
people voted in League county and the majority by far elected
Representative Stone to represent them. Some of the facts presented
earlier might be a little bit off-base. The school board vote was four
to three and all four of the members who voted are up for re-election.
The county commissioners who represent the 60,000 people in League
county have a resolution that they signed and unanimously support the
resolution. And the last point is that the city council never did sign a
resolution in that regard. I think that the amendment is not a good
idea. I think the bill should go as it is and I hope that answers all
your questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin do you yield for a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The city council did not take a position on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They stated a position, they have no written
resolution, on the other hand the county commissioners by unanimous vote
did sign a resolution and send it forward. They represent all of the
people, not just the city of Sanford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So the - follow - up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin do you yield for a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So your position is that the county commissioners that
represent the county and may come from jurisdictions other than Sanford,
it's appropriate for them to decide what's appropriate for the people of
Sanford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I think that they represent all of the people
including the people in Sanford, that's the county commissioners, and
the people of Sanford are part of the electorate who elected
Representative Stone, and I've had at least four town hall meetings up
there where this has never been an issue. And I have almost daily emails
from there, by far the majority of my emails support the bill the way
it's written, and any office calls I've had, I've had calls from both
sides and I've listened to both sides. I still am against the amendment,
for the bill as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Brief comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. We all get emails on a lot of issues, we
all get phone calls on a lot of issues, and I think that sometimes we
feel that from that we can determine what is the will of the people.
That is not a precise way to determine the will of the people, the
precise way to do that is a referendum and you all rejected that today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird you can speak to the bill a second
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am holding in my hand a resolution signed by
Cornelia P. Olive, mayor, the city of Sanford. Where it says that the
Sanford city council opposes the passage of the bill. It's a resolution,
it has the seal on it from the clerk. I have a similar one from the
board of education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt you have the floor to speak to the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Members of the Senate, this
is a local bill and I'm gonna speak to a little bigger issue here.
earlier in the session we've seen a tax on some of the larger cities,
Asheville in particular, Charlotte. And comments have been made that
cities  were just getting too powerful and they needed to be - I've
forgotten how it was put, brought down a notch or massaged or however
you want to call it. And now apparently...</p>

We're going after little towns or smaller towns.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Nesbitt would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt would you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A lot of times we listen, you give us pretty good
history lessons. Could you take us back to 2010 on house bill 1717?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, I can't do that, I don't know 1717 from
1111.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Lets see if I can help you out a little bit. It was an
ABC state wide bill where I ran an amendment that I, county
commissioners and a delegation were against having my county put in that
state wide bill, and you voted against us locally. Do you remember that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I certainly do not but if you say so I'm sure it's
probably so, it seems to be etched in your memory.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh it is. And Senator Kinnaird and Senator Stein also
voted when you all were missing, in local elections. The delegation
wants this, let them vote for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt you still have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My point in this is that apparently we in the
legislature, or the members in the legislature are descending on the
city and the school board against their wishes, and it's a local matter,
you can continue to do that but it's no different than descending on
Ashford, it's no different than descending on on Charlotte, it's no
different than descending on Raleigh. My point is now we're going down
to the smaller towns and cities. And I think I know why Ashford is
disrespected, I'm not sure why Sanford is, for the life of me, that's a
nice little town down there that's doing pretty well. And I just don't
understand  the purpose of all this to go after them and disrupt them
when apparently they're doing fairly well.

bill to senate bill 385. The bill will eliminate arbitration caps in
district court, it will make clarifications to court fees. It amends the
motion fee exemption to clarify that the motion fee is only paid on the
filing of a notice of hearing on the motion. It exempts motions to
exempt property from a judgement and motions filed by a child support
enforcement agency. It requires counties and municipalities to pay all
costs and fees when making a filing within 45 days. Provides priority
for the payment of criminal costs and fees. And the senate has included
a technical change to the flood plane mapping fund. I appreciate your
support.

personnel on this bill.  They gave us a lot of input and we have worked
very hard to, wrong bill?

Well, my faux pas.  The Nursing Home Bill. Excuse me, let me switch
gears.  Pretty much the same thing, thank you.  Excuse me, members of
the Senate, thank you for your indulgence. Let me get to the Nursing
Home Bill. I’m kind of set teed up on the other one, but the Nursing
Home Bill, they have not raised fees since 2004. The Nursing Home Bill
also takes an administrator that applies to be a nursing home for
licensure from  a four–year degree. Or if you are a nurse administrator
and want to be a nursing home administrator you can go to, have a 2 year
AB degree with 5 years of experience, and also those who are managers of
nursing homes now and they do not have the 2 year or 4 year degree are
all grandfathered, the fees have to go through rule-making. There was no
opposition in this bill. Thank you.

you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] A moment of personal privilege. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Goolsby has the floor for a point of personal
privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, you’ve had handed out by the pages
on your desk an article I wrote this week about a program that
apparently goes on in our state called home leave. We currently have 139
convicted criminals that are released on the weekends, and get to go
home and be with their families, golf, in fact that’s how this whole
thing came about. Someone saw one of these individuals on a golf course
and thought, I thought he was in jail. Only to find out that he is in
jail but he gets out on the weekends for this program that the DOC has
had for many years called home leave. We can thank the new president of
the conference of DAs, Phil Berger, Jr., who brought this to light. And
actually after several records requests, were able to get the
information on who these individuals are. For all the members if you
would like the list, so you can go through it and see how many people in
your home counties actually are on the list, that are getting out on the
weekends, I’ll be happy to provide that to you. In addition to a
breakdown on all of the individuals in each county that are actually
released. Of those 149 people, I actually in the second paragraph note
that Raymond Cooke, if you recall the doctor who killed the ballerina
here in Raleigh a few years ago, drunk driving. Former doctor. He’s on
that list. If you go to the DOC website, you can see that he was out
this last weekend. You can also see that Lee Hatch and Chad Lee, two
former lawyers who obstructed justice and altered numerous DWI court
records in Johnston County, are on that list. You can also see that
Cassie Johnson, confessed killer of a Raleigh police officer right here
in this town many years ago, she murdered Jimmy Adams. She’s on that
list. Robert Pollard, he actually was in an execution along with his
girlfriend at the time, of a 17 year old girl and a 23 year old man,
shooting both in the head, dismembering and burning the bodies and then
hiding them underneath the house in which they lived for many years. And
lastly, just to point out, Scott Quillen. He’s convicted of murder and
first-degree burglary. And he actually maintains his own website and has
reported that he’s been receiving home leave for at least two years.
Many of these people on this list are first-degree murderers, given life
sentences. They become eligible when they’re twelve months away from
quote parole eligibility, under the old fair sentencing act. This is an
outrage. The DAs conference has sent a letter to the Governor, asking
that he stop this program. I would encourage all the members to please
contact the Governor, and state the same. That we’ll monitor this, and
hopefully this will be stopped before this week is out and anyone else
can take it. And if not, I would of course urge this body that we take
action, if we need to, to stop this. Thank you for the time, Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Senator Newton, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] An announcement. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Newton has the floor for an announcement. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Members, I just want to remind
everybody, if you signed up and if anybody didn’t they want to take

items and raffles, and the food will be very memorable. And sorry, Stan.

There. And there was a target shooting contest. And I put $100 on King
against Bingham. Well, they shot twice each and Bingham said I owed him
$100. Now before I paid him, I did some checking. But I wasn’t going to,
I actually refused to pay him I believe. And I said ?? owed me $100 and
