you have known me and you have searched me. You know when I sit down and
when we rise up. You discern our thoughts from afar. Before a word is on
our tongues or a thought on our minds, you know it. May these public
servants know your joyous and patient presence. Seeing in that your love
for them, your abiding presence and your mercy. May they ever walk

anyone had a chance last night to look over what was going to be in it.
Also, this morning, I made sure that everyone received a copy of the
conference report, and I've spent the last 30 minutes discussing this
with the leadership from the democratic caucus. So, I hope we're all in
agreement to support this, I think this is an excellent conference
report, and working with the House with it, I think we've come up with
some provisions here, they're gonna help industry and help us move
forward in this state, and I would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade asked for your support, is there any further discussion or
debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the motion to
adopt the conference report for Senate Bill 734. There will be one
electronic vote, all in favor vote aye, opposed will vote no, 5 seconds
will be allowed for the voting and the clerk will record the vote. 35
having voted in the affirmative and 1 in the negative, the conference
report for Senate Bill 734 is adopted and the House will be notified.
That concludes our calendar, do we have any notices or announcements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moment of personal privilege out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn, this is the perfect time to do it so- you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I see, good, thank you, Mr. President. My dear friend today is
celebrating a birthday, Senator Ralph Hise is 38 years old, I'd like to
take a second to try to put that in perspective a little bit. Do you
know that Ralph was 4 years old when Senator Allran began to serve up
here at the North Carolina Legislature?
[LAUGHTER]
And I would say Senator Hunt, that you probably can't even remember
being, when you were 38 years old, but then again you don't really
remember that much of anything these days.
[LAUGHTER]
And I just think it's great that he's up here serving, he's a great guy,
he has a great family, good family man, one of the finest people I've
ever met, and a dear, dear friend, and before we all give him a round of
applause for being 38, I would like to note if Senator Tillman would
yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I certainly will not.
[LAUGHTER]
Well, on second thought I will, because it'll be better than him
speaking, I'll take his question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well Senator Tillman, I was wondering, could you verify that in fact you
have several pairs of shoes that are older than Senator Hise?
[LAUGHTER]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I wore the shoestrings out on 'em, but I still have the shoes, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Hise, happy birthday to ya, you're a dear friend and
colleague, and we're just glad you're up here. Happy birthday.
[APPLAUSE]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm gonna recollect something happened early on in your time here, and
you've not been here long, I've got grandchildren almost your age and
I've got children much older than you. But early in the session, you
looked like a sort of a big old doughboy, mountain guy that maybe was
sort of on the dull side, and Senator Stein thought so. I know that one
of the fine moments that I have is when Senator Stein first took you on
and it dealt with some numbers, and some math equations and got into
things that were certainly over my head. But Senator Stein wasn't happy
with that first time, and you all recommend about a week later, he tried
him, one more time, starting to ask you various questions, pointed
questions, lawyerly Harvard-type questions that, pretty good questions.
But Senator Hise, I think you grew up a lot, and I think Senator Stein
learned a lot, I've not really seen a whole lot of pointed questions to
you, and you're only 38 years old! I'm amazed at that, but that's some
fond memories I will take from here, Senator Stein, and you helped with
those, thank you.
[LAUGHTER]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Tillman a question.
[LAUGHTER]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would love to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This question is really directed to Senator Hise, but I've learned I
don't ask Senator Hise, I only ask people who I am confident cannot give
a good answer</p>

You gonna pay for this one. You gonna pay. Senator Tillman, well you
have a good adjournment. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See folks, he didn’t want to try me either.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. Senator Burger, ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr President, before this gets out of hand I would like to make a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator you have the floor for your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move that the Senate now recess subject messages from the House and
the Governor, the referral re-referral of bills and resolutions, the
receipt of conference reports and the appointment of conferees to
reconvene today at 11am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate will stand in recess until 11am this morning.
Senate will come to order.
Sergeant at arms close the doors. Members go to your seats. Members of
guests to the gallery, please silence all electronic devices.
Senator Burger is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. At this time we need to go into another recess
until 12:30. And I think at that time, during that recess I’d like to
make an announcement, Republicans will call ?? in the recess.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK so senators we will stay at recess until, or go back into recess
until 12:30. 12:30.
Senate will come to order.
Sergeant at arms close the doors. Members go to your seats. Members of
guests to the gallery, please silence all electronic devices.
Senator Burger is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. If I could, before I make the motion if I
could just make a short announcement.  And I know it’s a near empty
chamber, and hopefully someone is listening that wil hear this but there
are 5 people that I have failed to recognize for their service to
members of the senate over the years and I just want to make sure that I
did it in an open meeting. A number of our staff folks or LA’s are
retiring and I just wanted to say that the Senate thanks them for their
service. Gail Bishop who has been an LA for Senator Jenkins. Kathy Davis
for Senator Hunt. Carol Goodan for Senator Apodaca. Tracy Hines for
Senator Clark, and Carolyn or Carol Walker for Senator Allran. We thank
them for their service and I apologize for the fact I didn’t do it at a
time when either they were or we had more people in the chamber, but I
wanted to make sure that it was taken care of.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tank you, Senator. If you would, before you make your motion, I just
want to mention the other absences we have for the day here in the
chamber. Senators we also have excused absences now for Senator
McKissick, Senator Stein, Senator Van Dein, Senator Tarte and Senator
Gunn.
Senator Burger, you’re recognized for your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members we are going to recess to a skeletal
session at 5:00 today, at that skeletal session we will, if necessary,
ratify any bills or resolutions, hopefully the adjournment resolution
that the House passes today. If the House does not pass an adjournment
resolution that we can ratify this afternoon, we will at 5:00 today
recess or adjourn to Monday for another skeletal session. Our plan is to
have skeletal sessions until the House passes one of the 3 adjournment
resolutions we sent to them. As you know that could change and we will
obviously keep you updated if it does change. But with that, Mr.
President, I move that the Senate now recess subject to messages from
the House and the Governor, the referral and re-referral of bills and
resolutions, the receipt of conference reports and the appointment of
conferees and the ratification of bills, to reconvene today at 5:00
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motions the Senate do stand in recess until 5 pm subject to the
stipulations stated by Senator Burger.
Sergeant at Arms will close the doors, members will go to their seats.
Is there further business to come before the Senate? If not the chair
recognizes Senator Rucho for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President I move that the Senate now recess subject to messages from
the House and the Governor, the referral and re-referral of bills and
resolutions, the receipt of conference reports and the appointment of
conferees and the ratification of bills, to reconvene on Monday August
the 18th 2014 at 4pm.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Seconded by Senator Blue. All in favor say aye.</p>
