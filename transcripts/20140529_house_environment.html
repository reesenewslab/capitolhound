We’ll call the environment committee to order. I’d like to thank the
sergeant at arms for getting the room ready today. Beale Bass, Joe Cook,
Martha Gadson, and Charles Goodman. Thank you for the job you do. We
have some pages today. Samantha Naler from Sampson county,
Representative Brisson’s her sponsor. Greer Paulson from Wake County.
Representative Stam. Minasia Smith from Gaston County, Representative
Earl. Courtney Jo Sampkins from Henderson County, Representative
McGrady. The first bill we’re going to have today is House Bill 1166,
clarify gravel underwater storm water laws, Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee,
this early morning, those of you who are also on ERC have seen some of
this before but you get to see it again. Last year in House Bill 74, we
took this substance called gravel, normally referred to as gravel, and
it had been previously designated as built-upon area in the language in
our statute. And we moved it and said, well you know, it’s not always
impervious. Sometimes it’s pervious, so let’s not call it built-upon
area. There were some of us that dissented to that, and so we said in
the meantime we’ll do that but we’ll have the ERC study it. So the ERC
broke up into some task force. Senator Brent Jackson and I were assigned
the task force of studying gravel. The first thing we learned is when we
showed up for our first public hearing and task force meeting was this
is a really hot subject. Because we had I think 15 different groups show
up to tell us their thoughts on what constitutes gravel, whether it’s
pervious or not, and how it should be regulated. And then the second
thing we learned was that this stuff that I have grown up all my life
calling gravel is not actually gravel. It is aggregate. And that there
is a very narrow definition of what constitutes gravel but it’s sort of
like Kleenex and facial tissue. We’ve all gotten in the habit of calling
facial tissue Kleenex and we all sort of know that’s what it means. And
so as we went through statute, we found out that the word gravel even
when it’s meant to imply aggregate, is actually always used as gravel in
statutes. So we decided okay, we’re not going to argue with changing the
word gravel to aggregate, but we are going to have to deal with when is
it pervious and when is it not pervious? So step two was to start to
figure out when is gravel able to let water pass through it, so that you
don’t need to do much in terms of storm water remediation, and when does
the gravel really acting more like a rock or a other hard surface and
not allowing the water to go through it, and therefore it does need
storm water provisions. So we went out and we did I think three or four
days of on-site, every conceivable thing, in sunny days, rainy days,
everything we could think of. And what we concluded was that no one’s
ever done a study to determine exactly which applications will allow
water to go through and which applications won’t allow water. But the
one thing we did conclude was that there are times when it needs to be
concerned a built-upon area and times when it does not need to be
considered a built-upon area. So what we have in front of you is a bill
that takes gravel, which we now all know is any form of this aggregate,
and moves it back into the built-upon area calculation. However, it’s
only going to be calculated for built-upon area to the degree that it
actually does allow water to go through it. But since no one’s got a
really clear study on that, we have also charged NC State to do a study
to measure when is it actually going to let water go through it and when
is it not. And it’s going to include things like the most important
thing, which is what is the dirt like that’s under it? Which is why it
works better in sandy soils than it does in clay soils. How deep is it?
How is it applied? How is it maintained and what’s going over the top of
it on a regular basis? So the bill before you basically says gravel is
not always pervious or impervious so therefore we’re going to call it
built-upon area and we’re going to do a study to help determine for
those people who are applying it or who are inspecting it to have some
sort of sense of how they need to measure it for storm water purposes.
And staff, if I missed something, because it’s early in the morning and
I did a lot of yard work this morning before I got in here, that did not
involve gravel or aggregate. Did I miss anything?</p>

Questions.Any questions from the committee. Representative Harris.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. At the appropriate time, I’d be
delighted to give a motion for a favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
other questions? Representative ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Representative Samuelson, I thought I understood this bill. And I
thought it was going to eliminate ?? and actually it ?? built-upon area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct. What we determined was that, the reason it
had at one point thought about eliminating this built-upon area because
there was a misperception that gravel is always pervious. One thing that
everybody who we met with agreed was that gravel is not always pervious
and therefore there are times when it’s going to have to be considered
built-upon area. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, that brings up two questions.
My house was built 15 years ago. The first thing is, my gravel driveway,
which is almost the same area as my house, in front of my house, I don’t
believe I would ?? build a house on that small lot I have, and it is
sandy soil by the way, at the beach. So you’re saying in this bill,
would make it, it would double the size of my built-upon area and may
prevent people from building on a lot that’s a certain size. If this is
considered a built-upon area. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually, in that
particular case, it would help you. Because one of the things we had
when we passed the bill that changed it to non-built-upon area last year
was people who do redevelopment said but wait a minute. If we used to
have, they were using the example of old mills but we could use your
example of a house. If you had a house that’s clearly impervious and
built-upon area and gravel that had been for storm water purposes
considered usually built-upon area and now you said it’s not? And you’re
going to go redevelop? Then you’re redeveloping your standard that for
built-upon areas only the house, which means you’re then more limited on
redevelopment, particularly in-fill. They found urban in-fill all of a
sudden what was constituted as previously built-upon so they were
grandfathered, got cut in half. Does that make any sense, because rather
than both the structure and the gravel area being grandfathered as
built-upon area so that if you flatten it all and want to go up, all of
that constitutes built-upon area, all of a sudden the change in the
language said the gravel portion is not built-upon area, and if you
flatten it, you’re going to have to put storm water procedures in place
for this previously graveled area. So what we actually found were people
who were redeveloping were saying that it was hurting them to call it
not built-upon area. Now if this new development, if you’re going in a
new development and you have an empty lot, and you want to not have to
count the gravel areas as built-upon area, yes this could count as
built-upon but that’s what was being done anyway. And so what we’re
actually offering is an opportunity for not all of it, particularly if
it’s on sandy soil, to be considered built-upon area. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. So what I’m understanding is
that what I’m reading is not what actually happens. In other words, it
says that gravel is not, built-upon area does not include gravel. Part
of this bill. I’m really confused now. So, then ?? area not including.
?? so it will include gravel. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It will, to the degree
that it is impervious. So if you have got gravel on an area where the
water is actually able to percolate through there and come off, then it
is not treated as built-upon area. If you’ve got gravel installed in
such a way that it acts more like an asphalt driveway, then it’s going
to count like an asphalt driveway. So that’s why we’re doing the study
at NC State, to determine when is gravel allowing the water to go
through, as though it were dirt, and when is the gravel stopping it and
acting like asphalt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One more follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So, what you’re saying is, this
won’t impact my 15 year old house and it would not impact new
construction. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It will not impact your 15 year old
house. It could impact new construction but it would be better than the
way it was say two years ago. Before we had the bill last year. Before
the bill last year, gravel was uniformly treated as built-upon area.
Okay? No matter how you installed it, unless it was in landscaping, it
was being treated as built-upon area. And you had to put in storm water
provisions. So that’s why some people said we want to move it over here
and say it’s not built-upon area. So last year we moved it from total
built-upon area in effect, to total non-built-upon area. Well that also
wasn’t correct. Neither way was really correct.</p>

<p id="10:00">
It’s not always correct here, and it’s not always correct here. And so
when we went this way, we created another whole new set of problems. And
so what we’re doing now is saying, look, let’s recognize that it’s
aggregate and sometimes the water goes through it and sometimes the
water doesn’t go through it so let’s find a way to count it for what it
really is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay one last follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Did one of these groups that spoke to your
committee, from the development community, and what was their opinion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Every opinion that we got said that depending on how
it’s installed and maintained, it depends on how pervious it is. And we
had Jeff, you can probably tell him all the groups, but we had I think
every industry I can think of and some that I wouldn’t have expected
represented at the group, which included the development community.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Clarifying follow up. And they were for this bill?
That community was for this bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Yes. Because
what they found out was originally they thought they liked the new way
we did it because it allowed them to have more built-upon area, more
area that did not need storm water remediation. But what they found out
was that it was killing their ability to redevelop. It was helpful in
some areas but damaging in other areas and so in the end, they all
agreed, let’s figure out how pervious is it, so let’s count it the way
it’s supposed to be counted. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. One thing I want to point out to
the committee here is that in terms of lines 8 and 9 where it says that
to the extent that the partially impervious surface does not allow the
water to infiltrate. The existing statute is just fine for the purposes
of what actually gave by way of the actual change that happened in the
regular reform bill. If the department was actually allowing the ability
to things that truly infiltrate to not be counted as built-upon area and
therefore not make the new developer or someone who redeveloped to be
actually treat that storm water because again if it’s not truly running
off the site, and it’s infiltrating, therefore it shouldn’t be under the
actual statute authority of the department. So again, I think what’s
being done here is good. I have a friendly question here. I see that
there’s a study that’s being implemented. My question is, is that if
that department was originally enforcing the statute as needed, there
wouldn’t even have been this whole aspect of the whole ??. Therefore is
there any direction to the department to actually enforce the statute
properly, and are they going to wait until after the study is done or
are they going to do it in the interim? Because the whole issue is that
there’s been a history of them treating gravel, whether it infiltrates
or not, as fully impervious and as a result there’s also been if you
drive across dirt that has been deemed compacted, there has been a
history of they treat that as impervious as well. So as a friendly
question, is there any direction to the department to actually enforce
the statute properly? But I do support what you’re doing here. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well, we all know the department is always supposed to enforce
the statute properly and what we got back from them was, for instance
with pervious pavement, a study had been done to tell them when you have
pervious pavement, here’s how you’re supposed to do it. So they were one
of the ones who said we don’t have a way of knowing and so we always
defaulted to it’s totally impervious. And so they were supportive of
doing the study to give them more direction and the study’s supposed to
take about six months and so they should have it in before this becomes
an issue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? for
Representative Samuelson. When the study is done, it’ll be reported back
to the ERC and it’ll be in our hands to actually direct them to actually
implement the study. The actual results of the study by way of policy
changes or potential rule changes. Is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If
you feel like that’s needed. The way it’s written right now, they’re
supposed to enforce the statute as written, and we are going to with the
study give them the tools to enforce it as written. If you come back
next year and decide that somehow or another they need more direction on
that, you’re free to do it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Jeff can add
something to that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’d just
point out that in addition to the results of the study going to the
department, they do also come to the Environmental Review Commission on
January 1st.  So before the long session, the General Assembly will also
have the results of that study. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d just like to address a couple of points. From the
point of view of the development community, we have dealt with this from
the watershed protection, now from storm water. What we’ve had is just a
mess. We’ve had interpretations in our area that said</p>

. . . gravel was impervious. Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. We
accepted it when it was, and we fought it when it wasn't. I mean it's .
. . it's all subject to interpretation. It's time to apply a little
science to this process. When we instituted the watershed regulations,
and most of my community is in a watershed area, because somehow, in
that interpretation, water that flows from storm water from runoff into
Lake Hickory somehow swims upstream to get into the Lake Hickory water
intake. That's another area where we could use a little science. What we
found is, for instance, if I wanted to build a parking lot that had peak
loads:  fifty percent of the time it was only at fifty percent used. So
you had a peak load, I wanted to build pervious pavers with a gravel
base. The regulators treated that as pervious. I got no credit for
putting in grass filled pavers. That was nonsense, still is nonsense.
This is a step in the direction, whether we're talking about pave- let's
encourage people to do the right thing. Whether it's pervious pavement,
or gravel, or pavers with, that are grass covered. We need to be getting
people the tools they need to do the right thing. This may not answer
all the questions, but this is certainly a step in the right direction,
and I support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] :  Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask a few
questions of the sponsor to maybe clarify, in my own mind, what I think
I've heard, if that's OK. The statutes refer to gravel, and
unfortunately, it's used for both gravel and aggregate, which have
different characteristics in the way they allow water to pass through.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  They have less differences in the way, absolute
differences, in the way they allow water to pass through. They are
different substances, but the study will look at all of it; like my bags
here, and there is someone from the the aggregate industry back here.
Each of these bags is going to allow water to go through differently,
and none of these bags is gravel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Got you. May I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] : Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  So the way the law, or the environmental regulation,
originally treated the various substances referred to under the phrase
“gravel” was to assume that water would not pass through but would flow
off, and was therefore impervious. We then changed the law, to say that
we're going to treat gravel, and all of the substances we're referring
to, as if they are completely pervious and the water's going through,
and what we're trying to get to is, we''re going to look at the specific
instance of what we have on the ground, and if water can pass through,
we're going to say it's pervious, and if water's going to flow off,
we're going to call it impervious. Which is to say we're actually going
to reflect what's happening on the ground. Is that where we're trying to
get to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  You're ninety percent correct. A hundred percent
correct on where we're going. The only tweak I'll say is that before the
change we made last year, the statute was actually written to do what
it- what we're trying to do now; but they didn't have the data to do it.
But nobody realized that. And so, what happened was they were enforcing
it too far to one extreme, even though it was written probably
correctly. So, we're going to back- we're going to also write it
correctly and give them the tools to enforce it correctly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Harrison is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] : Thank you Mr. Chair, I'd like to move for a federal
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: You've heard the motion, all in favor say “aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Opposed, “no”. The ayes have it. The bill be so
reported. Thank you Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Next we'll have house bill 1081, Review- Agency
Review of Engineering Work. Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chair, members of the committee. This
bill was heard yesterday in Regulatory Reform, and from a little
research, it appears that a very strong majority, probably three fourths
of you all, are on Regulatory Reform. But I will briefly go over the
bill for those who are not. What this bill does is exactly what the
short title actually articulates, And of course the summary as well. And
that is what's it's looking to do is reform the actual way that our
regulatory agencies approve compliance with regulation. Even though that
this is the review of engineering work, please understand, that each and
every one of your constituents who desires to turn the dirt on their
property, to expand their business, or to create a new business, an they
have to go through any regulatory permitting agency, this bill is
directly affecting them</p>

<p id="20:00">
in a very positive way and all that it's requiring to do is, to say this
very simply, is that if the regulatory agency needs to distinguish
between what is required by their authority in order to receive a permit
from what they actually recommend from some possible changes or some
corrections. So the idea of it is to uphold our protection, our
regulatory protections to our environment, but to do so in a way that is
both effective and efficient on behalf of the benefit of your
constituents. If you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them but
I definitely appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Your questions for the bill sponsor. If not, let's hear a motion.
Representative Catlin recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Approve for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You've heard the motion, all in favor say aye. Opposed no. The aye's

removed from the calendar and that concludes our business and we stand
adjourned.</p>
