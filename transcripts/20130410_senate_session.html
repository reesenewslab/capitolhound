<p id="15:00">
But as I was speaking with Billy Graham's staff, something that is
amazing about him is how long the people that have worked with him have
worked with him. It says something about someone's character. Something
stuck out in the long conversations when he said, Billy Graham says he
sees himself as just a messenger. I think that type of humility is rare
in this world. Humility is understanding your place and your role and
not rising above that. The Scripture that came to mind as I was
contemplating this statement was Micah 6:8. It says: &quot;He has shown
you, O Man, what is good and what does the Lord require of you, to act
justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.&quot; I found a
couple of quotes from Billy Graham which I think typify this type of
attitude in this statement. One thing he said was &quot;The Christian
life is not a constant high. I have my moments of deep discouragement. I
have to go to God in prayer with tears in my eyes and say 'Oh God,
forgive me' or 'Help me.'&quot; Another statement he says which I think
is a great perspective is &quot;I'm going to heaven just like the thief
on the cross who said in that last moment 'Lord, remember me.'&quot; I
don't know if there's a greater way to honor someone than to honor that
which he values most. One statement that typifies this is, Billy Graham
said &quot;My one purpose in life is to help people find a personal
relationship with God which I believe comes from knowing Christ.&quot;
And in honor of Billy and his wife Ruth and the entire Graham family I
would like to conclude this statement with a verse that he has shared to
literally billions of people around the world and that is John 3:16
&quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. I
urge your support in this resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Senator. Any other discussion or debate? Senator Nesbitt for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. To speak
on the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President and members of the Senate, it has been
my distinct honor and pleasure to represent the Graham family in the
House and the Senate for over 30 years. I think the word that I heard
from Senator Soucek [sp] that all of us in our mountains up there would
echo would be humility. He's very much been a part of our community,
investing in our hospital, doing charitable work throughout the
community but most of all being a humble soul and just being there. You
can feel his presence throughout our community out in the Montreat area
of the Black Mountain area there seems to be a reflection of him in some
way. And I think if I leave you with one thing that tells you how proud
we are of him, in 2012 he was listed on the 10 most admired men in the
world for the 56th time in his mid-90s. That tells you all you need to
know. I urge you to support the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Senator. Is there any other discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question for the Senate is the adoption of Senate Resolution 196. All in
favor will vote &quot;aye&quot; opposed will vote &quot;no.&quot; Five
seconds will be allowed for the voting. The Clerk will record the vote.
48 having voted in the affirmative and zero in the negative, Senate
Resolution 196  is adopted. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Soucek for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you have the floor for your
motion.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that the words shared here be spread
upon the journal.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] So awarded. On the motion of
Senator Dan Soucek of Watauga County the chair is happy to extend
courtesies of the gallery to the family of the Reverend Billy Graham and
Ann Graham Lots, daughter, Danny Lots, son-in-law, Rachel Ruth Lots,

Mr. President?

House bill 224 calender. Senator Brunstetter, with what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
With a motion related to today's calender.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator you have the floor to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. President, senate bill 334, which is on page 2 of your calender,
vintage auto inspections. I move that it be removed from today's
calender and calendered for next Tuesday, April 16.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Without objection it's ordered. Senator Daniel, with what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To send forth a committee report.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
You can send forward your report, senator. The clerk will read.

bill 603, clarify issuance of plates, ceritficates, ?? favorable ,

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senators, we're gonna move right into public bills on the second
reading. Senate bill 124, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senate bill 124, shot gun inside to insight fear.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Brunstetter is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, members. Senate bill 124 fills a hole in our current laws.
Right now it's a felony to shoot right into a billing, but once you walk
across that threshold and make the very same act it is no longer a
felony. This makes discharging a firearm within an inclosure, with the
intent to insight fear punishable as a class E felony. The bill was
requested by local law enforcement, it's supported by the North Carolina
Sheriff's Association, North Carolina's Association of Chiefs of Police.
A few points to make, this does not affect the castle doctorine, or any
other defense under the law, it does not affect accidental discharges. A
shot must be from inside of the building, while standing inside of it.
It does not affect hunters in trucks or tree stands. There was no public
comment at the first discussion of the bill in J1. I'm not aware of any
significant opposition. Thanks for your report.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
for the senate is passing judgement. Committee substitutes senate bill
124 on it's second reading. All in favor will vote Aye. All opposed will
vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will
record the vote. 49 having voted in the affirmative and 0 in the

Senator Jackson is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the senate, we've seen this bill
before in the previous session. It passed unanimously, it got over in
the house and had a few hiccups, so we've worked on it. I believe in
trying and trying again until you get it right, and hopefully we've got
it pretty close to perfect this time, which is not to say there's still
not some opposition to this bill, but actually</p>

bill is endorsed by the North Caroline Farm Bureau and it has received
the ?? Stamp of Approval on it.  Basically what this bill does is
plainly states that if water is wholly on your property whether it be an
impoundment, a pond, a well, that water you have the right to use that
water. It's your water. Now if water is passing through your property,
comes in and leaves your property you do not have the same right as you
do as if it's wholly on your property.  I ask that you please support
this bill and I'll be glad to answer any questions. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 234, Hunter Education Apprentice Permit
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.  Colleagues, this is a fairly
simple bill.  We've identified that there is a real decline in hunting
in North Carolina and one of the things that seems to be an impediment
is that for folks to get a license they have to take their hunter
certification program and there's nothing wrong with that but what we
wanted to do was to lower that a little bit and allow folks to basically
be an apprentice hunter.  In other words, like we do with our youth, we
would allow people to go on a hunting trip with someone who is a
licensed hunter and hunt with him under their supervision and then later
on, hopefully if they're interested, they'll go get their hunting
license and after get their safety certification program and
certificate.  There's no opposition to this bill. This is recommended by
the Wildlife Commission and others.  I understand that similar measures
passed unanimously from the House.  It was well vetted in the Ag
Committee. I commend the bill to you and I'm happy to answer any
questions.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate?  Hearing none, the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin, Hartnett County, is recognized to
explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill was not new legislation.  It's simply
corrects a mistake that was made in 2011 when responsibility was shifted
from the Department of Health and Human Services to the Department of
Agriculture Consumer Services. It shifted responsibility for doing
inspections of bedding material but forgot the authority to go in and do
the search that was necessary to do the inspection.  I know of no
opposition to the bill and ask that you pass it.

that the community college system celebrates almost 50 years. I went

I mean if you should you that our community college service as a second
change that education for many of our citizens in North Carolina in the
2010-2011 academic school year our community college is enrolled 115,312
students in the basic skills programs and it estimated 800 and 40,000
students enrolled in 58 community colleges which accounts for one out of
nine North Carolina citizens 18 years or older in our community
colleges. In many of the communities, our community colleges serves as
economic engines and it used to be maybe years ago that when a student
chooses a community college or technical institute as many of us known
is sort of had a statement. Today, many of our high school graduates
choose to go the community college first and then out to the university
system. And one of the students that had the honor and privilege of
going to a community college and then transfer into the university
