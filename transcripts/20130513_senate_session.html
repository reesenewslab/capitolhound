gracious and all-loving God, ?? every week we return to this place, and
you are waiting like a father, to embrace us and turn our hearts back to
the service of our fellow citizens.  The tremendous blessing that we
have to serve our state in this refined capacity.  Let us begin this
week as you tell us to in the words of Psalm 40.  I waited patiently for
the Lord.  He inclined to hear me, to hear my cry.  He drew me out from
the pit of destruction, out of my miry bog, set my feet upon a rock,
making my steps secure.  Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his
trust, who does not turn to the proud, to those who go astray, after a
lie.  So we do come to you tentatively tonight, frail tonight, and we
ask you to place us upon that rock that is higher than I.  Build this
house, Lord, we plead.  Of putting a new hymn of praise in our mouths.
Praise you, God, for what you have done here and what you are doing
here.  You have multiplied, oh Lord, my God, you have multiplied your
deeds, and they're wondrous.  Your thoughts towards us, none can compare
them with you.  It is in Jesus's name we pray.  Amen.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]

substitute bill titled an act to amend the voting safety act by

676, Finance.  Senators we'll move right into the calendar today
starting with Public Bills, roll call. Second reading, roll call bill,
Senate Bill 399. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 399. Criminal defendant may waive jury
trial.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter is recognized to explain the bill.
 Try that, Senator, and see if that works.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will steal Senator Hunt's.  Sorry Senator Apodaca.
Senate Bill 399 is a constitutional amendment that allows a person
accused of a crime with the consent of the trial judge to waive their
trial by jury and be tried by the judge alone. This bill was initially
conceived to help ease the growing burden on the Superior Court system.
It's been reviewed and supported by the Conference of DA's, by the
Advocates for Justice. This is something that's already being done in
the Federal Court system and currently from what I can tell only North
Carolina and South Carolina are the only jurisdictions that do not allow
this. That being said, Mr. President, a good point was raised by Senator
Kinnaird in Committee about capital cases and I'd like to send forward
an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You can send forward your amendment, Senator.  The
Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe it's up front.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter is recognized to explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. This amendment makes it clear
that this ability to waive a jury trial in a criminal case applies only
to non-capital cases. So capital cases would still be tried by jury.
Happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is  the passage of Amendment 1.  All in favor
will vote aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for

Speaker changes: Senator.
Speaker changes: Senator Brock is recognized to explain the bill.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. President, members of Senate, I said
those seventy three does one simple thing . It requires local workforce
development boards to use  a competitive selection process  by July 2014
to designate values of adult and dislocated worker services. That’s what
it does, no more and no less . A national survey in those states uses
comparative process for these kinds of situations. We have, there is a
much better likelihood, a statistically valid likelihood of getting more
folks in jobs quicker ;in adult dislocated, the values themselves can
..the current folks who do these work can bid?? Public entities can bid,
private and non-privates entities can bid, I would recommend it. I am
glad to answer any questions.

the impression that they will not be able to operate any of the programs
but they will have to contract everything out. Can you clarify that
please?

operation. If they have actually the best bid, they can operate the
program.

several of our community colleges and throughout  the system  this

they may be able to bear any circumstances themselves as well. It is
discerned to create a circumstance in which the  best folks who can

[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President. As many of you know I've been working on this
regional concept for a long time, and I've probably produced 20 or 30
maps, I'm not sure how many. And I've worked with every agency I think
in state government for it made sense to, to try to combine some of
these services and get some agencies working together. And I think I've
come up with a pretty good idea on this one was I've worked with Deaner,
and Commerce, and Transportation, and Community Colleges on this
reorganization. I'll start with the bill. Part one of the bill just
establishes 8 geographic zones for the purpose of facilitating
coordinated planning and use of resources, improving cooperation with
government and non-profit entities at the local and regional level.
Facilitating administrative efficacies within state government to the
extent feasible established you know, one stop source in each region for
citizens and businesses seeking state services at a regional level. What
section two of the bill does is it would abolish the statutorily created
regional economic development commissions, and authorizes them to either
reorganize as non-profit corporations that serve the same purpose as
under existing law or wind up their affairs. And section 2.2 of the bill
would transfer the department of these power, department of commerce to
do the functions of the commissions as they stand today. Part three of
the bill would require them by October 1st, 2013 the departments of
commerce, deaner, and transportation each have at least 1 employee
physically located in the same office in each of the zones to serves at
department liaisons. The departments would jointly select the office and
the community college system office, Masala's would designate at least
one representative from the community college, or the system offices
serve as a liaison in the, in each of the zones. Section 3.2 of the bill
just sets out the duties of these liaisons. And finally section four of
the bill creates an 8 member study commission to review the reports
submitted by the department of commerce, deaner, and transportation, the
community system. The commission may also study and make recommendation
to the 2014 regular session of the 2013 generally assembly regarding
issues related to enhancing inner-agency cooperation. Masala aimed
programs to streamline services in requiring the establishment of
inner-agency one stop shops in each of the zones. And reducing barrier
space by citizens and businesses and assessing services. With that, I
think that explains the bill. And I'll try to answer any questions.
[Speaker Change]
Is there any discussion or debate? Senator Hise for what purpose do you
rise?
[Speaker Change]
Send forth an excuse for voting under rule 29.
[Speaker Change]
You can send forward you excuse Senator. Senator Walters for what
purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Walters has the floor to speak on the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President. I, I just want to address the body tonight in
the fact that, and Senator Brown I appreciate your efforts and all this
hard work you put into looking at these partnerships and how we move
forward with that. But I, I have some huge concerns about how we work
through this logistically as well as in rural North Carolina. 'Cuz these
partnerships in rural North Carolina serve a huge part of our economic
development. I've had calls from all my county, local economic
developers today. With huge concerns about how they will move forward
without the help of the partnerships as we go forward. And we get in
counties like Robinson, and Scotland, and Columbus, and Blaiden, and
Brunswick and a lot of the eastern counties. They, they really struggle
and don't have the ability or the resources to put together the economic
recruitment that we need in these poor rural counties. And they often
tell me that their referral was ?? from economic partnerships. And
that's, as we grow and we talk about in this body how to improve jobs
and, and grow our jobs in North Carolina. I just think we need</p>

<p id="20:00">
Take a step back and take our time, and look at what we're doing to our
poor, rural counties.  Because I think that is a huge move on our part.
And also, I look at the bill and have some concerns about the logistics
of it.  And the bill becomes law effective July 1 in establishing the
eight geographic zones to be known as collaboration for prosperity
zones.  But above that, I see it requires agencies to report by January
1, 2014 on how they plan to abolish administrative regions and transform
them into prosperity zones.  So there's about a six month window there
where we do away with economic zones or partnerships and we're kind of
left in no man's land, if you will.  And that's a huge concern.  So I
would ask if we move forward this that we consider at least waiting
until 2015, and give us time to work through that without abolishing
these partnerships and then have a study and move forward with that.
That's a huge concern of mine.  I'd like to hear, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll try to respond to Senator Walters, some of his concerns.  First of
all, I have talked to several people from the Commerce Department who
quietly told me some statistics.  And they've told me that of all the
leads that commerce have gotten in the past probably 10 years, only four
percent of those that come in the economic development regions.  Only
four percent.  Also, to address the small county issue that you
mentioned, I've got Jones County that I represent.  Well, Jones County
spent about $70,000 trying to lure a small company to come to Jones
County.  And they had it pretty much tied down, until all of the sudden
the eastern region got involved, and decided to get Lamore county
involved in it and Lamore County paid them a little bit more, so a
little business that was coming to Jones County, my little low wealth
county, ended up going to Lemoore County because of what the eastern
region did.  So what we found with the regions is most of the county's,
my county, Jones county has a committee of 100.  I think pretty much
every county in the state has got a committee of 100 that works on
economic development.  So what ends up happening is most of those
committee of 100's work with commerce to try to bring any kind of
business they can to their counties, and the eastern region or south
east region or whatever it may be is supposed to be someone who helps.
But whatI have found, through time is that they end hindering the
process more than they help the process.  A person I talked to from
commerce, I asked them well what does the region do for you.  And their
response to me was they offer a place for us to meet a client.  That's
basically what they do for us.  So, to me it's another layer that his
kept commerce from being more involved in the recruitment process.  What
this bill will do is it will make commerce get out of Raleigh.  And make
commerce get out in these counties that you have concerns about, and be
involved in working with each individual county to find out what their
strengths are and work with them to understand what businesses needs are
and some of these low wealth counties and get them out.  Right now,
commerce is kind of stuck here in Raleigh and doesn't get involed like
they should get involved, in my opinion.  Plus if you look at what's
happening last few years, I think I may be right or wrong about this but
I think I'm right Caldwell county has someone has introduced a bill to
get Caldwell County out of its region.  There's a bill in the house
right now toget Craven county out of its region.  So the partnerships
are falling apart today as we speak, because of what's been going on.  I
can tell you in Oslo county, my county, has got absolutely nothing from
the eastern region and I just told you what happened to Jones County.
So they have done nothing for my two counties in my opinion.  I think
this bill does a lot to get, commerce out n the community and really to
see what's going on. It gets our agencies finally working together to
streamline a process, for permitting.  You know how many times can you
get commerce, ?? transportation and workforce development in the same
office talking to</p>

Representative: …right, to streamline a process to get somebody to the
state. That is what I think this bill finally does, and it is something
that we have needed for a long, long time.
Speaker: Senator Clark, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To speak on the bill.
Speaker: Senator Clark has the floor to speak on the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. President. I know that Senator Brown is
aware of what I am about to say, so I do not think it will be news to
him. I want to speak on a point of the bill, then inquire of the chair
if he would yield a question to that. I think he knows very well that
regional partnership that operates in the part of the state that I am
from, predates all the statutory commissions, and was established
voluntary by the local entities themselves with an awful lot of buy in
and ownership taken by the cities, the counties, and the businesses in
that region, because they came together on their own and formed a
nonprofit corporation and, very largely, funded privately, without state
dollars, but through business contributions and contributions by the
local government. They have been very proud of that and the track
record, and success they have been able to achieve. I know that, that is
going to continue under your bill. So that is not the issue I speak to,
but again, because of those habits of 20 years, of working together as a
group, they have come to identify as a group. I noted, in the
organization of the new zones, that some of the core and key members of
that partnership, have moved away. The one that is most notable to me is
[xx] County, which, economically and in every respect, is really,
functionally, part of the same region as McClemburgh, Gaston, Lincoln
and Caberas. It really is not part of a different region, it is part of
that region. With that statement, Mr. President, I would ask if Senator
Brown would yield for a question.
Speaker: Senator Brown, do you yield?
Representative: I yield.
Representative: Senator Brown, in the study commission you got, part
four has a lot of duties. One of those that it does not have is the
ability to make recommendations about reconfiguring the zones. Would you
be amenable to considering expanding the scope of the study commission’s
authority to give it the ability to bring back recommendations about
reconfiguration of the zones to address some of the questions I just
posed, for example, [xx] and Rowan counties, especially, that have been
integral parts of our region. Senator Ahran may have his own view about
Catoba, but Catoba is also, historically, been a key player in our
region. Would you be amenable to having that within the scope of the
study commission’s study?
Representative: Senator Clawfield, I think I would as long as we could
have eight regions because, as part of the process I worked through, I
looked at seven regions for a while but, constitutionally, we have eight
education regions. So I knew that if I was going to include education, I
would need to have eight regions, which is why I came up with the eight
that I did. As far as moving counties around to make sense, as we move
forward, I think that is exactly what probably should happen, to be
honest. It is just that you have to start somewhere and trying to draw a
line, no matter where I draw the line, someone is not going to like the
line, so this was the start.
Speaker: Further discussion or debate? Senator Jenkins, for what purpose
do you rise?
Representative: To speak on the bill and ask the bill ask the bill’s
sponsor a question.
Speaker: Senator Jenkins, would you like to speak first or ask your
question first?
Representative: Speak first.
Speaker: Senator Jenkins has the floor to speak on the bill.
Representative: I would just follow up on some comments I made in the
commerce committee about it. One specifically in our area that Senators
Bryant and Newton, and that all three represent is the City of Rocky
Mount. Rocky Mount is divided into two counties and has always been a
bone of contention about that division and railroad track. We worked for
many, many years to resolve that bone of contention and what we are
doing now, is dividing Nash and Ashcomb into two separate economic
regions, which will only create further problems within there. I
reinforce what the previous speakers have said. The governmental budget
is already cut golden leaf funding for rural NC. It has cut the rural
center for rural of NC, which has been very strong for us, and now we
are cutting back on economic development. I would be hard pressed to
tell you that the department of commerce has ever brought down there to
it – it was not for us looking around and kicking every rock we find to
kick, we would not have what we got. So, I don’t rely much on Raleigh
coming down to help me. I think it is just another example of Raleigh</p>

I appreciate you bringing this bill for this estate is intrinsically the
idea of having one-stop shop makes a lot of sense. I also put our
regional economic department kids have the most part than a good job. I
mean certainly some of the more effective than others in reading your
bill. it appears to indicate that the existing regional economic
development commissions and if they would like to.they can reorganize as
non profit corporations to continue serving the same areas that they
serve today is that a correct reading. that is exactly right. and then,
in your face. I think yours is a non profit,so they can continue to
operate just like it does for the belt. did the only thing that would
change is that the new energy if they chose to establish one would not
be eligible for state appropriations, etc. correctly a saccharine to
your call thank your partnership since he started preparations for that.
so that really didn't change anything for the summer partnerships and
most of the world and disrespect ours. but there is a mapping in order
must have really got been a lot of activity. my example judge him all
up, Mister President. synergy is a bit of it. it could you share with us
what the current level of state funding is if you are aware of its
underground or these regional development Corporation says it wasn't
last year 's budget. if you know what it was in the governor] yes to put
some context. what were talking about Jessica. I don't want to guess is
that I have those numbers with me. I'm sorry I think is the number
eighty three for the discussion of a server farm for first draws on that
latter question, just underground video  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you very much, underground, not also growing. thank you for the
good work him the lease description. I share the concerns about the
impact that it could have on our rural communities represent my question
is open. perhaps you know this within hearing about the governor 's
efforts to privatize the Commerce Department reorganized, apartment of
these districts, regions that are being set up a date in sight, in
coordination with what the governor 's plans. I would hate for us to be
developing regions of other religions or been developed under plans
being developed by the ties that this impact as it relates to the
coordination of those two entities. I personally conversely, what with
all the agencies all these reasons,and I have signed all these reasons,
so that have been involved in this process. therefore, the discussion
they centre Nesbitt Burns yours identifies the state unveiled soon as
good as a fourth degree criminal by humans as an anonymous the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think there is some merit to send her bounds. I failed about locating
these agencies and get my Raleigh when it comes to the regional economic
development conditions. I'm just been sitting here listening, they must
have a silent and all the rest armored on the job and if you must arrive
it has. I think you should, but for the rest of us.it's his only hope.
we got out there in these rural counties. when you get a wife, mom and
this concept that this is not clear the deck so that Raleigh can come
and help you. here follow for their review same probably rushing out to
help you do anything. that's why we fell with him, and when you know I
run a Mac and you still have layers. I will send it with five times they
have banks that equations another's input of the money to building

there that I know I haven't been a stand and they directed by the

&lt;h3&gt;These large companies, these large industrial companies that
will back such a thing you said. And this started back in the 90's. I
was fussing because we weren't getting any prospects up our way.
Secretary of commerce came over and sat down and said what do you want
me to do. And I said I want you all to refer some people to these rural
areas and to the outlying areas of the state. And he said ok, who do you
want me to send them to. I didn't have an answer. I didn't have anybody
sophisticated enough, in a number of these counties, to send them to. We
sat down and formed these regional commissions to create something with
our people. For him to work with these prospects. And the concept wasn't
for them to go find prospects for commerce, it was for commerce to go
find prospects for them. And I wanted them to be his worst nightmare.
And I told him that while we were creating it. He wanted absolute
control over them and I said no, I want these people out here to be able
to be self-governed so they can tell you what to do. You need to bring
some prospects to the rest of this state. Now that's what's happened
over time, and you've heard from various members here that it's worked,
to some degree. UP my way, they went in and they went out across the
land and catalogued every county, got all the demographics, created a
computer program on all the counties so they could show the labor force,
the prevailing ways, the education rate, etc. They started a thing
called certified site, and told all the counties if you give a site to
this level, we'll put it on our list of potential sites. Well everybody
got to going. I don't know how many we got in the west now, probably 50
or 100 or so, they're scattered all over the western part of the state
now. All the counties that participated in. And it has brought us to a
point that we can recruit as a region now, where we couldn't do it in
the early '90s when this program was started. And I know, in talking
with Chuck Hase here, who does the research triangle park area, he will
tell you his job is not to not be judged on how well he does in the
research triangle park, he said it's going to take every cell. His job
should be judge on how well he does for the outlying counties, where
they need jobs. Now, all of you are going to be asked the question
&quot;what have you done for jobs?&quot; I think that's what everybody
sent us down here to do this time. Is bring some jobs out here for our
people. Our unemployment rate, last I heard, was 5th highest in the
country, Ours was going up when the rest of the country was going down,
and I'm telling you out in some of these rural counties it's 15% plus.
And if you go in to Golden Leaf, and you go into the rural center, and
you do away with these regional economic commissions, I want you to tell
them what you're going to do for them. Because they're going to ask you.
And we're going to ask you. Are you going to tell them? Are you going to
stand in front of your constituents and tell them that you're going,
that the people in Raleigh are going to take care of them. Senator
Raven? In these rural areas where you're not getting any help from them
now, are you going to tell them that that's their hope? I don't think
you'll get away with that. And I don't, for the life of me, understand,
this is a very small amount of money, I don't know what it is it's less
than 5 million dollars or even less than that, maybe 2 or 3 million now,
to help these rural areas have a chance to help themselves, the old
bootstrap thing. Remember? My people back home right now are wrestling
with this new, big government Conservatism that you all are putting on
the people of this state. And the whole idea of this is that we'll just
centralize all the power in Raleigh, and we'll put a little tentacle out
everywhere and then Raleigh will take care of you, you don't need
anything to take care of yourself. And your local governments don't need
a -&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p id="45:00">
New power, will administer that in large doses from Raleigh. And you'll
just be fine. Now I'm telling you, you're getting, I'm from a town of
??. And the last quarter the Asheville area produced more jobs than any
place in the state. Now that was after you took our airport, and while
you're taking our water system we were still number 1 in the state the
last quarter and the production you need jobs per capita. In the far
west they have figured out how finally to get some jobs, largely through
the Cherokee nation. But I think all of those people up through that
region would tell you that an advantaged west is a great partner in
helping them promote that region and, and bring the industries that we
bring in, in Senator Apodaca’s area, Sierra Nevada. They helped in that,
I was involved in trying to land a manufacturing company that
manufactured airplanes to go out there to our airport. We didn't get
that one, but nobody else did either. They ended up going back where
they come from once they had their labor business worked out. But
they're very much a central part of the hope of these rural counties to
get any help. And they feel like they feel like they're stuck out there
in the wilderness and nobody cares about them. And these people do, and
now you're doing them in. And in these rural areas they do not have the
money to recreate this thing. Now then you're gonna have a situation
where you got commerce and I don't fault my friends from the large urban
areas for beating the brains out of us in the smaller urban areas, and
certainly all those in the rural areas. But commerce is gonna be
bombarded by those three urban centers for all the jobs that they can
find. They're gonna have people stationed down here finding out when
they come in, they know the day they got here, they know the day the
call came in. And they aren't gonna let it through their sieve to get
out here to the rural areas. The only way you’re gonna get it out in the
rural areas is have somebody from your place that's up here saying I
want some too, and helping to facilitate it. And if you do away with
these now you will be giving a death meal to any opportunity these
people in these rural areas have of getting any new jobs. They'll all
get stopped way before they get to you.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Rucho for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
To debate the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Rucho has the floor to speak to the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you sir. I think it's important to stand up now and discuss and
try to set the record straight a moment. Senator Nesbitt who I have a
lot of respect for was talking about a number of things. First of all
the important part about this bill and what we've done in the last two
years. Let's talk about what we accomplished you know, when this body
made some decisions on economic development last session, we made some
tax cuts that actually provided about 2.3 to 2.5 billion dollars’ worth
of money in the working families, and the small businesses. And all of
this talk about results, well let's talk about results. I spoke with Mr.
Boardman the other day and he shared, but they contributed mightily
because we expected to get roughly 15,000 to 19,000 of them for the
first two years and 50,000 over the next five. And so what we have done
is moved in the direction because what this body should be focused on
and what we are focused on is the fact that all of North Carolina should
be prosperous, not just just the urban centers. And we're working for
that effort. And just as a reference point the 179,000 private sector
jobs that were established. If you compare the other states in the
southeast, specifically South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee,
and us. The only state to beat us in that was Tennessee a state that has
zero income tax. The other states are a point in a half to two points
behind us. So Senator Nesbitt when the time comes for us to bring tax
reform forward, and to work with these efforts.</p>

<p id="50:00">
I want you to stand tall with us, and support tax reform so we can bring
some good jobs to this state, instead of as I was listening to recently
when senator Berger presented his plan that all I heard was whining
about this or that.  Let's stand tall, Senator Nesbitt, we'd love to
have you with us so we can actually create jobs and put eveybody back to
work.  That is our effort.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't even know where to start here.  Senator Nesbitt helped make the
argument that the regional partnerships aren't working.  The rural areas
in Western North Carolina have the highest unemployment rate in the
state, have had it for quite some time, and I'm afraid the future
doesn't look that bright.  It's interesting to me to hear our friends
from the metropolitan areas like Mecklenburg and Durham talk about how
great the partnerships are.  While that's kind of like, selling ice to
people in Hades.  I mean anybody can do that.  We ain't reinventing the
wheel here.  The bottom line is that rural partnerships, or economic
partnerships are not getting the job done in the rural areas.  So, if
something's not working, why don't we try something else?  Instead of
trying to talk about how good it is, and make believe it's good, in
reality it's not.  We hold the governor accountable in us as we have
talked about for jobs, employment, and why not set up a Commerce
Department that is responsible for that, and hold them accountable for
what happens?  Now we have had some phenomenal growth in our area, as
Senator Nesbitt mentioned.  We have some of the lower unemployment rates
in the state now, and so I don't read in the Asheville Paper, I try not
to read it, but said we haven't done anything. Well, we have.  And we're
in discussions with five or six large companies right now that are
looking to coming into Western North Carolina.  I 26 corridors popping
up on maps.  Now we're not Mecklenburg or Durham or Wake yet, but we're
making good progress.  And I talked to my local economic developers, and
they tell me that most of the work on the ground is being done by them,
not Advantage West.  So, if they're not helping there, and if we're not
seeing a lot of action in the rural counties, let's do something else,
and see if we can make that work and be better.  So, I ask for you to
support senator Brown's bill.  I think it's a step in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill, or actually I would like to ask a question of the
bill's sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, senator Brown.  Senator Brown, if it wasn't for the rural
center an the Golden Leaf and Advantage West, Western North Carolina
would really be hurting.  As has been mentioned, Graham county has got I
think about the worst unemployment rate in the state, at about, the last
I heard was about 16 or 18%.  And having been in partnership with Golden
Leaf and Advantage West, and the rural center, I understand that you are
trying to address a sickness that we've got.  Help me understand how
this is the remedy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The dollars from Golden Leaf and the rural center hopefully will still
be there for you.  But I think you answered the question as far as
unemployment goes in some of your counties.  If Advantage West was doing
such a great job for you, why would you have 15% unemployment some of
those counties?  You know it's nice to say Asheville has got low
unemployment, because that's where it's all going.  It's all going to
Asheville.  It's not going to your county.  They get it all, the way the
systems set up now.  What I'm saying we do is let's create a system
where we've got a one stop shop, where I get commerce out of Raleigh
into your counties, talking to your local people, trying to figure out
what the needs are that your counties need to help your counties recruit
someone.  I know in Jones County, 10,200 people in Jones County, one of
the poorest counties in the state.  The eastern region has done nothing
but take one business away from them.  And I'd argue the same thing is
happening to you in Asheville</p>

<p id="55:00">
That's what happening in your region. What I am saying is let's try
something different. Let's create a situation where commerce out in this
regions get on working with ??, transportation and communicologists. So
when the ?? comes to your county, thinking about moving there, you can
get him together and sit down with his plan and try to recruit him to
your counties. That's what I am trying to accomplish with this bill.
Because the old system is not working, it's obvious that it's not
working.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion and debate. Senator Wray, What's the purpose of
your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wray has been recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I realize I have been sort of ?? and ?? here for about 60 days and for
that I apologize. But I'm finding things getting sort of Bizarre. When
the party of change is preaching status quo and we have confusion
between what's regionalization and what's the party of centralization,
that's kind of out of the ball park to me. I think we have to be a
little bit more clear what we are doing here. My experience and industry
tells me that when you take stove pipes out and put it in Horse's anal
in aggression, you are going to do a better job. My experience tells me
that a plan is a start point, all the people who don't know where we are
going, anybody with a plan will wake up in the morning doesn't know
where we are going to be at the end of the day but having a start point
and a place to go forward from is important. I know of no time when
regionalization hasn't at least caused or created some savings but the
?? is usually. The stove pipes usually create a great deal of wasted
resource. We are in a position where we have to move forward with a new
plan to do new things as a group and stop worrying some of the things
that haven't happened before. Regionalization and consolidation of
forces is a good idea and ought to be tried. I thought we support and
vote and ask any of the people who think I have any credibility, go
along with me.

consensus bill. I totally accept for ?? them which will talk more about
later I'm sure. I'll be more than happy to get in the detail with you
but let's just say it has been worked out amongst the dealers and
manufactures and there is nothing worth shattering in the bill, just
some minor tweaks and basically dealing with dealer's activity and sorts

[Speaker Changes] Senate bill 465, prohibit use of tax dapper software
[Speaker Changes] Senator McKissick is recognized to explain the bill
[Speaker Changes] This is a pretty straight forward bill and I would not
be worth hitting our position and I would be running a brief amendment.
It’s  a minor one. But as Tax apparatus it ables to buy businesses and
purchase would allow the business owner to do is to basically keep a
duplicate set of  records for their cash registers or receipts. It’s
basically like a little memory card that you might be familiar with that
can be taken put in to your cash register at the end of the day and
adjust the total downwards so that the actual cash receipts shown are
less than what they truly were and you can adjust them as you choose to.
It’s basically a method to evade taxes. We have about 5 different states
 that have already made these devices illegal. So that’s what we would
be doing here in North Carolina. What I would like to do is to sent
forth an amendment.

will read.
[Speaker Changes] Senator McKissick moves to amend the bill
[Speaker Changes] Senator McKissick is recognized to explain the
amendment
[Speaker Changes]  The amendment is pretty  straight forward. The only
thing it does is basically say is if there was a violation it’s not only
be a felony but allow the judge to assess a fine of $10,000 and I would
ask for your support.

Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion relative to the calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 468 is our next bill, Aligned inspections. I ask that it be
removed from tonight's calendar and re-referred to the committee on

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 553. LME/MCO Enrollee Grievances and Appeals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate. The purpose of this
bill you have before us is two-fold. Number one in dealing with
grievances and appeals for LME/MCOs, this changes the state regulation,
particularly those that apply to the offices of the administrative
hearing to make sure that they comply with how the federal government
would deal with managed care entities as compared to our convoluted and
questionable system we come to have now as to which law applies, it also
creates, for individuals a new grievance procedure which can be filed
against LME/MCOs and lays out the procedures and others for how those
actions will move forward. I’d be happy to answer any questions any
individuals may have on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the gentleman yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Senator Hise, and I apologize to you. This was a committee
substitute and I’ve not had a chance to look through it so some of the
questions I have are about the original bill if you’ve changed them,
just tell me and I’ll be fine with that. Did you still eliminate
mediations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. Mediations are still the option...hold on...let me get...There’s
still the options for individuals, it is the changes in the continuation
of service that does not continue in mediation, but they still have the
option of having mediation in the period.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Was that added by Ken in the committee substitute?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To my understanding that it was. And I’ll find the…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We got confirmation from Hartsell that it was apparently put back in,
that’s a good thing. Thank you sir.

Senate Bill 626. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 626, Recodify Animal Shelter Law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s a pretty straightforward bill. It basically takes certain laws that
already exists today, it strengthens them, but it transfers them from
the Department of Health and Human Services where they are today and
transfers over to the Agriculture Department which has an Animal Welfare
Division. The Commission of Agriculture, commissioner Troxler supports
the bill in its entirety. I’m unaware of any opposition. In terms of
some of the pertinent provisions in terms of changes. It would not allow
for pets that are picked up by animal control to be sold to
institutions. It would require photo ID for adoptions to take place.
Right now there’s a 72 hour holding period. That will remain in effect
for those pets that are picked up if you put them on the website.  If
you don’t put them on a website it’s now 96 hours. I want to thank
Senator Wade for her assistance as a veterinarian who brought some very
thoughtful...</p>

insights into things we could do to also strengthen this bill, including
allowing a provision in there that now says if a pet has somehow been
involved in a biting incident and an owner’s surrendering it to an
animal control shelter or an animal shelter, that you have to sign a
statement saying that it hadn’t occurred within a ten-day period. With
that said, the only other language I can say that’s in here that was not
there previously is one that basically says that if a shelter has a
scanning device for microchips, that now they will use that scanning
device to see if the pet in fact has some type of ID. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Bill 683, Safe Harbor of Victims of Human Trafficking. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby is recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. This is the second bill that comes before you
that deals with sex trafficking. The first bill you all passed
unanimously a few weeks ago, and that turned sex traffickers into sex
offenders for registration purposes in North Carolina. This bill is the
comprehensive bill. We’ve discussed it twice in Judiciary 1, passed
unanimously this past week, and it does a few things that I’ll tell you
just briefly, and I would remind you of the caveat that North Carolina
is currently in the top ten of the list of shame as one of the top ten,
actually number eight of states for sex trafficking, and this bill will
hopefully help take us out of that position. It does several things. It
increases the punishment for involuntary servitude – that is placing
someone in involuntary servitude or in sexual servitude. It establishes
a first offender conditional discharge program for prostitution – that
is for prostitutes themselves. It treats minor prostitutes as victims.
It increases the punishment for solicitation of prostitution and for
soliciting a minor. It also sets up an order for expungements of victims
of sex trafficking among many other things. I also, Mr. President, have
an amendment that I’ve handed up to the Clerk earlier. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can… Clerk will read the amendment. Thank you, Senator. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Goolsby moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby’s recognized to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. This amendment does a couple of things. The
first is it takes away something we originally had in the bill that
allowed an affirmative defense for a mistake in patronizing a minor or
severely mental disabled person in prostitution. It actually takes that
out. That was an affirmative defense that was originally in the bill. We
had a number of people raise concerns regarding that. And then second,
based upon an observation by Senator Blue, it also changes to motion for
appropriate relief to the court of conviction, which was a concern that
Senator Blue had in the bill. So it was originally going to the court of
appeals in order to file a motion for appropriate relief. I’d appreciate
your consideration in passage of Amendment 1 to the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is there any discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the passage of Amendment 1. All in favor will vote
aye. Opposed will vote no. five seconds will be allowed for the voting.

Senate Bill 132 Health Curriculum Preterm Birth.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel, would you like to speak to the bill?  Is there any
discussion or debate?  Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  No, I’m sorry.  I’m on the wrong bill.  Oh yes, 132
was taken off.  Yes, I would like to speak to this, please.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Senator Kinnaird has the floor to speak to the bill.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  We had quite a discussion last time and I did ask about adding
one more condition, but as I looked back, what I really cannot agree
with is that this is a cause, and that when we put language in to teach
our students something, it should be factual, and in this case it is
not.  I was surprised when the child fatality test scores actually
endorsed this language, but I found that they did not.  The subcommittee
meeting was contentious and the vote was not unanimous.  Further, these
groups objected.  They do not recognize a causal link between legal
abortion and future preterm births.  The American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the
American Public Health Association, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Royal College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the World Health Organization.  So,
because of this, I asked what some of them, there are many causes of
preterm births.  The one I spoke to last time, which is that doctors and
patients, women, decide that it isn’t convenient on the date that the
child is due and actually schedule a preterm induced or Cesarean
operation.  But there are many, many causes, and many, many risks.  And
risk is different from cause, but some of them are the woman is too
young, we know teenage births really are one of the serious problems,
they are too old, drug use, alcohol use, and others.  So I am very much
disturbed that we are teaching nonfactual information material to our
students and, therefore, I am going to vote again against the bill.
Thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Daniel, for what purpose do you
rise?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  To speak to the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel has the floor to speak to the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the senate.  Over the weekend, we
did a little research and we went to the Department of Health and Human
Services and we asked them for some of the documents that they had
regarding investigations of abortion clinics, and as my staff went
through these they found an interesting document, and this document is
from public record by the way from the Family Reproductive Health Clinic
in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 700 Hebron Street.  And in the course
of the investigation that was going on with this particular clinic, a
document was provided by the clinic to the department and it is
basically what is a medical waiver, that they would provide this
information to the client.  When the client comes in, the client is
advised of certain medical risks and is asked to sign this document.
Here is a section and it just happens to be called Risks of Abortion,
and I am going to read some of this to you.  This is verbatim from a
document provided by an abortion clinic to an abortion clinic client.
Cervical incompetence.  I understand that the abortion procedure or
repeated abortion procedures may result in cervical incompetency, which
means that I may have problems maintaining a pregnancy.</p>
