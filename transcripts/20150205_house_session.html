  Nationally with the American Heart Association. Friday February 6 is
national wear red day and just a few comments that I would like to make
you and statistics to let you know how important this fight is not only
for women, but for men in this chamber and and our state, but today my
comments are about women. In 2003 the American Heart Association and the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute took action against this
disease that was claiming the lives of nearly 500,000 American women
each year. A disease that women are not paying attention to, stemming
from that action, National Wear Red day was born. It&#39;s always held
on the first Friday in February every year to raise awareness of heart
disease being the number one killer of women. Tomorrow marks the 12th
anniversary of National Wear Red day, since that recognition started,
nearly 90% of the women in the country have made at least one healthy
change towards their heart. More than one-third have lost weight, more
than 50% of women have increased their exercise, six out of ten women
have changed their diets, more than 40% of women have checked
cholesterol levels, and one-third are going to their doctors. Pretty
empowering isn&#39;t it? 8286 women have died from heart disease in
North Carolina since 2013, we&#39;re just at the beginning of 2015,
that&#39;s 20% or one in five death among women, 2635 women have died
from stroke in North Carolina alone since 2013, overall 11,000 women
have died from cardiovascular disease in North Carolina in 2013.
That&#39;s over one out of every four deaths among women, so I&#39;m
asking you today to stand with me, it&#39;s time for us to get stronger
and I&#39;m not speaking to just the women in this chamber and the women
in the gallery that all the women that are listening, but I&#39;m
speaking to the men about the women in your lives and about your health
and your heart. Get your numbers checked, ask your doctor to check your
blood pressure and cholesterol, you can do that in the Walgreens, the
Rite Aids, in the CVSes. I don&#39;t want to leave anybody out, but they
all have those little benches you go in and check your blood pressure.
And your lifestyle and stop smoking, lose weight, exercising, get
healthy. Raise your voice and I&#39;m asking you to do that today, that
wearing red tomorrow. Advocate for more women related research and
education. Educate your families and your selves. Don&#39;t be silent,
tell everyone women you know that heart disease is the number one
killer. Raise your voice with me today and help us all to recognize
tomorrow as the kickoff for the month of February and it&#39;s go red
day. I will tell you that with my journey over the last six years I have
gone through a lifestyle change myself. the most important thing now
from me, the journey I&#39;ve been on is to recognize how blessed we are
to just even be standing here today in this chamber all of us and the
power we have among our-self collectively to raise this awareness issue.
It is huge and I don&#39;t know that I paid attention to it until six
years ago, I&#39;m being brutally honest, but I&#39;ll tell you if any
of you know me I will tell you to put down your salt shakers you all
know that. Get rid of the sodium in your diet, cut it back as much as
you can, but exercise. An important part is leave the stress behind,
when you feel your shoulders becoming very heavy, that&#39;s not just a
feeling that&#39;s a sign that your body is saying your heart is saying
you&#39;re doing too much go to your office sit down. Walk over there to
the Capitol grounds and sit in the park, look at the fountain. It&#39;s
a lot you can do to relieve stress. So I ask you again and please join
with me and thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you to our Roles Chair,
representative Louis for allowing me today to take a little extra moment
on this point of personal privilege. Thank you.

House Bill 3, by Representatives McGrady, Stam, Lewis, and Goodman, An
act to amend the North Carolina Constitution to prohibit condemnation of
private property except for public use to provide for the payment of
just compensation with right of trial by jury in all condemnation cases,
and to make similar statutory changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Henderson, Representative
McGrady, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, colleagues, House Bill 3 proposes a constitutional
amendment to the North Carolina Constitution to prohibit the
condemnation of private property, except for a public use. Requires the
payment of just compensation for property taken and requires the
compensation to be determined by jury trial if requested by any party.
The bill also includes some statutory changes consistent with the
constitutional amendment and Speaker Pro Tem, Representative, Stam, will
be addressing those he speaks on the bill. For many of us, this bill
probably seems very familiar. The reason for that is that a nearly
identical bill passed 110-8 in 2013 and identical provisions were
included in an omnibus bill, Senate Bill 636 last year, that passed
103-10. So this bill has been before us before in essentially the same
form we see it today and it comes to the floor upon a unanimous vote of
the Judiciary 2 Committee. I&#39;d say that suggests that the bill has
had rather consistent and broad bipartisan support. Section one of the
bill is the heart of the bill, it provides for the constitutional
amendment and I&#39;ll explain the details of that in a moment. Section
two provides the amendment shall be submitted to the voters in the next
state-wide election on May 3rd of 2016, that&#39;s in primaries. Section
three explains how the amendment becomes effective upon certification by
the secretary of state. Sections four and five are the statutory
provisions, which Representative Stam will be disucssing

  <p id="15:00">
  In section six provides the effective date. Now, this bill relates to
eminent domain. In other words, the forced sale of land to the
government. Most basically, the proposed constitutional amendment says
that private property shall not be taken by eminent domain except for a
public use. So what is a public use? Obviously roads, schools, sewers,
courthouses, and it&#39;s also public utilities acquisition of rights of
way. Even though they are owned by a private entity because a utility is
by definition something to which the public has a right to attain
service upon a payment of fee. Now, the concept of public use, that
sounds simple. So, the question is, why do we need a constitutional
amendment. Well, aside from the public use test, there are two other
tests or phrases sometimes used when deciding whether a government can
use the power of eminent domain. Sometimes courts have talked in terms
of public purpose or public benefit and with time the test frankly has
gotten rather fuzzy or has morphed. This became really clear when the
U.S. Supreme court decided a case out of Connecticut, the so called kelo
case. Surprisingly, in its very unpopular decision, the U.S. Supreme
court said that a public purpose was sufficient under the U.S.
Constitution so that a Connecticut town could force the sale of property
by one private land owner to the town which in turn sold the property to
another private land owner. In that case, a developer. Fortunately in
kelo, the Supreme Court said that the States were free to restrict
eminent domain more than that under their constitutions and that is
precisely what we are trying to do with this bill. We are trying to
clearly establish a constitutional standard under the North Carolina
constitution. Now, I will tell you that I really don&#39;t view this
standard as any different than what our current law is. We&#39;re not
trying to make new law here. We&#39;re just trying to make sure that
North Carolina law stays what it is and doesn&#39;t sort of morph back
to a lower standard that has been established by the U.S. Supreme court.
Now I guess we could debate the different between public use, public
benefit, or public purpose but I don&#39;t think that is critical for
you in thinking about this bill. What is critical for you to understand
is what this bill would do, assuming North Carolina voters approve the
proposed amendment. First, as already suggested, the bill will mean that
a public use does not include the taking of property in order to convey
an interest in that property for economic development. The use of
eminent domain as approved in kelo will not be possible in North
Carolina if we pass the bill and the voters approve this constitutional
amendment. Second, it puts language in our constitution specifically
saying, quote, just compensation shall be paid. Well, these five words
have been determined by the North Carolina supreme court to have been
implicit in our law of the land clause which I&#39;m guessing dates back
to the Magna Carta. We are one of the only states that doesn&#39;t
actually have that in our constitution. Third, we are the only state
that does not require in its constitution that the issue of damages and
condemnation cases be decided by a jury. The sponsors of the legislation
believe that a jury trial in eminent domain cases is so fundamental that
it should be spelled out in our constitution, and forty nine other
states do that. So, I recommend the bill to you. Obviously it is a bill
that has had broad support in the house. I don&#39;t think it changes
our law based on the case law that is out there. It does fix some
language

sort of move in a direction other than where North Carolina has been and
so I ask your support for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam,
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, members of the house, I&#39;ll address the statute toward
changes in just a moment. I put on your desk an article from The
Economist a few years ago that explains the nail households in China. If
you Google nail households you&#39;ll see some really strange things,
highways that split just to go around a house because the people in the
house refused to move and so they go around them. Normally the way they
take property in China is, when people are gone, they just bulldoze them
down and if you look at the second page of this article, at the very
last paragraph, they have an ill-defined public interest criteria which
is very similar to the public purpose or public benefit test that
we&#39;re trying to get rid of. The reason I put this out here,
we&#39;re addressing a universal, world-wide desire that people have
that their property, particularly their homes, but that their property
not be taken from them forcibly by an improper purpose. I believe that
if we put this before the people we will have overwhelming support. We
have it at a May Primary Referendum so that nobody thinks he/she will
get an advantage in a November election. Secondly, this bill is, after
26 years, hopefully finally coming to fruition and from the beginning it
has always been bipartisan. I remember Senator Dan Blue, when he was a
representative, was a primary sponsor. Representative Goodman is a
sponsor this year, and one time we had 96 sponsors to try to get the
then speaker to bring the thing out. Now, why do we want to make the
statutory changes in this bill? We could have constructed a
constitutional amendment that would have taken two pages to completely
explain all the nuances of it but that&#39;s just not really appropriate
for a constitution. Instead, by putting the statutory changes in the
same piece of paper that you vote on, we are establishing irrevocably
what the legislative intent is. Frankly, a lot of utility companies,
cities, and counties were very concerned with the original drafts of the
constitutional amendment because they thought, incorrectly, but
nevertheless they thought that it would stop the use of imminent domain
for utilities and it&#39;s not designed to do that at all. But what it
is designed to do is to make sure we&#39;re talking about public use and
not benefit purpose or public interest. Now, there have been hundreds of
years of cases from the appellate courts that have discussed this and
frankly their conflicting, confusing, and some of them could be
interpreted to mean that we are using the public benefit test. But,
about 80 or 90 years ago, when that phrase was first put into the
statutes, &quot;Public use or benefit,&quot; the benefit was used as an
additional restriction on condemnation by imminent domain. It was not an
alternate test. They didn&#39;t have proper grammar lessons from their
English teachers. They thought the subjunctive and conjunctive were the
same thing. But it, in more recent years, has morphed into people, some
courts in North Carolina, thinking that a benefit would be enough. So
this makes clear that it&#39;s just the public use. Then we modernized
some of the language about utilities. For example, instead of telegraph
and telephone we used communication facilities. This, frankly, was at
the request of a lot oft of the utilities. There was some discussion
about the phrase, &quot;distribution of natural gas,&quot; being
included in here. Representative McGrady and I have tried to figure out
why some people think this has something to do with fracking. It&#39;s
our opinion it has nothing to do with fracking. This is the distribution
of utility natural gas and there had already been a court of appeals
decision in 2011 that said the distribution of natural gas

  Is proper for condemnation. Now, I need to make one clarification that
Representative Michaux asked me to make, and I&#39;m happy to do it,
because in terminology, there&#39;s an ambiguity. The word condemnation
is used in two completely different ways. This bill talks about
condemnation by imminent domain, that is the power of the state, which
has been in English law for 7 or 800 years, I think. Doesn&#39;t go back
to Magna Carta, Chuck. Little, little more recent than that. But
that&#39;s the taking by the government of, of property upon payment of
compensation. There&#39;s another usage of the term condemnation and
that&#39;s under the police power. That is if Representative Cleveland
here, and I&#39;ll use him as an example because I&#39;ve been to his
lovely home, and I know this is counterfactual. My explanation, but just
suppose that all the building codes were violated in his house, and it
was a, a site for, it was an eyesore and inspectors came along and said,
you can&#39;t live here anymore, George. This is not safe. And they put
up a condemnation sign. Do not enter. You have to fix it or we&#39;re
gonna tear it down. That is not imminent domain. They give you an
opportunity to fix it, usually. If you fix it, fine. If you don&#39;t,
they can tear it down and charge the cost of tearing it down to you.
It&#39;s a lien on the land, and you might lose your property because
you don&#39;t pay the lien. That process would not be affected by this
bill at all because that has nothing to do with imminent domain. I
encourage you to vote for it. I&#39;m very optimistic that this will
come through to fruition after 26 years, and I really appreciate the
hard work that Representative McGrady has put into this. Thank you
mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Michaux
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That 26 years ago that Representative Stam referred to was probably when
I was chair of judiciary committee and had the bill before us at that
time, indicating that this question has been before this body and before
this state for a long period of time. Condemnation, particularly of
private property has always been a problem. After the Kelo case had come
out from Connecticut, it gave the states an opportunity at that point to
make clarification. And after all of the legal lease that you&#39;ve
heard on here, it&#39;s very simple. You cannot take something that has
happened in the past, a lot of condemnations have resulted in the city
or the utility or whatever taking private property under condemnation
authority and then selling it back to a private developer. This has been
a distinct problem, a distinct problem in this state. This bill in my,
in my estimation clarifies that situation that they cannot do that at
this time. The other thing, if you really wanna put it into perspective,
it does not stop a city or county from declaring an area blighted. I
asked Representative Stam to explain that to you simply because that is
one of the fears that many citizens, counties may have is that they
cannot go in and declare an area blighted, and under condemnation
proceedings take that area. They can, they still, under the other
procedure can do that, and cause you, and then that property can be
taken because you don&#39;t pay the lien as a result of what they have
done on that. Now, but we just wanted to clear up the fact that you just
can&#39;t go in and take property and then sell it to a private
developer for a lesser price so that they can make a  profit. We need
this. We need this for clarification, and I hope that you will support
it.

Pittman arise?

use

conveyance to a third party interest for economic development.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman, thank you for the question, and indeed in
several past drafts of this bill in many other sessions, that was
specifically added in. It&#39;s not here because it&#39;s not necessary
because if it&#39;s for private development, by definition it is not a
public use. That is my position and the position of all the sponsors
which we hear state on the record.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative. I have a few just for clarity&#39;s sake.
Could a municipal or governing entity take a piece of property for
public good to run a sewer line, let&#39;s say that was along a creek
bed in the back of my property?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister Speaker. Could a, a governing entity in this county,
county, state, take a piece of property, maybe around a creek bed on the
back of my property to implement a walking trail, greenway, or something
like?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, probably. A greenway is typically viewed as a park, and a park is
public use. And potentially that&#39;s possible, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister Speaker. Representative, would, would it be available
for a municipality or, or county government or state government to take
a piece, a partial of land to, to erect a utility, but inevitably take
more than is actually needed for that utility, thereby having more than
needed property that would be in turn sold back to another entity?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I might, I can&#39;t really give you a yes or no to that, because I can
think of two situations that would lead to different positions. The
utility or the municipality could acquire property that it thought it
needed for its public use, and it turn out to be more land than it
needed. But at the point of time that it was acquiring it, say the train
station was gonna have this footprint and then they redesigned the train
station and it got smaller. And so yes, they could end up with
additional property, but that situation is actually sort of what
we&#39;re trying to avoid here. One of the things that had been
suggested, whether it&#39;s in relationship to an airport or a train
facility is that well, the municipality will obtain a large tract of
land for airport purposes or for rail, and by the way, we&#39;re gonna
add a little more land so that we can put in some nice restaurants and
stores and other things. No, they, they&#39;re not in a position to
acquire property for what is now has, is not a public use. And so again,
I&#39;m sorry to not be able to give you a good answer yes or no, and I
suspect that if a municipality went, moved forward to condemn land for,
truly for a public use, but under the guise of getting more land for
nonpublic use, that would be challengable in a court. I think a court
would see right through that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question, mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yield for a further question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can a city, county, or, or state governing entity acquire a piece of
property with the intent in the future to apply a, a utility, or, or
said, if so, what is their timeline for such a use? Thank you, mister
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Speaker, maybe I can refer that one to Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, do you yield to answer the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would. The case I referred to earlier regarding distribution of
natural gas, town of Midland versus Morris 2011 specifically, I think
it&#39;s this case. It may be another case. Specifically said it can be
used for a future use, but it has to be for a future use for the
utility. It can&#39;t be a situation

something else.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover, Representative
Catlin, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to ask Representative Stam a question if he
would yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, this is a clarification for public use and private benefit,
or benefit. If you are looking at properties that have limited public
access, like state ports, or an airport, or a military base, would that
still be considered public access for eminent domain acquisitions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, yes. Yes. Now, I&#39;ll give you an example. A cartway, you all know
what a cartway is, an involuntary way of getting into property to
harvest some timber, that&#39;s been justified by our supreme court,
upon payment of compensation, because theoretically the public can use
that cartway even if it&#39;s just to a track of land in the wood. It
doesn&#39;t mean that every single member of the public can necessarily
use it but if public entities or public agencies or public ports can use
it, certainly I would think that would be public use.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yield for a follow-up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Clarification, so the ports can use eminent domain, an airport can use
it if they want to expand a runway, or the military can use it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Now, let me just, for information, elaborate and give a nuance
because this bill is intended to affect a particular use that was used
by an airport one time. Piedmont Triad Airport wanted to expand so that
FedEx could have a particular location and they essentially took private
property so that FedEx could own land but for the hub, the runways, the
roads, yes, that&#39;s a public use.
One more follow-up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Who makes that decision?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, all cases like this ultimately would be decided by courts. This
case, this bill gives tightened guidelines so that the courts are much
less likely to find public use than if we did not pass the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Union, Representative Brody,
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, could I ask Representative Stam a question please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, I wanted to just inquire about the extent of the
definition of the word taking and in particular what I would call, it
may not be a legal term, but what I would call temporary taking that
would ultimately cause an adverse effect on the property. Would that be
included and would just compensation be allowed under this provision to
allow for temporary taking and if you want I can give you an example.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not just allowed but required. Under our current law, temporary takings
of land require just compensation as much as if it&#39;s permanent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Richmond, Representative
Goodman, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative McGrady a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, in reference to the questions that
Representative Torbett asked about the creek bank and the sewer line and
the greenway, can&#39;t government entities do that under current law?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This amendment doesn&#39;t change that in any regard, we&#39;re not
trying to change the law at all. Governments have the ability to condemn
for public use and all of those were public uses, and I might add thank
you for your co-sponsorship of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does this bill, in any way, expand the government&#39;s ability to
condemn property?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.

  what purpose does the gentleman from Gilford, Representative Faircloth,
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a question of Representative McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative McGrady, has there been any input
from the local governments on this particular bill, and if so could you
enlighten us on what it might have been?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To my knowledge neither the County Commissioner&#39;s Association or the
League of Municipalities has formally taken position on the bill. There
are municipalities that are concerned that this, in some way, restricts
them from things they would like to do. That may be possible if they
were thinking about using eminent domain for economic development
purposes but, to my knowledge, none of the associations and none of the
municipalities or anything have come out in opposition of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Floyd, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I want to know if the bill sponsor will yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, this is your bill and I think it&#39;s a very
good bill and we&#39;ve had a very lengthy discussion on it and so could
you do the appropriate thing at this time please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Since this is the first day of the session and the first bill that
we&#39;re taking up of a substantive nature and because it&#39;s a
constitutional amendment, which makes it more important, I&#39;m not
going to do that inappropriate thing at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bumgardner, do you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I still have the same question. I&#39;d like to
ask Representative Stam a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I still have the same issue with this bill. I support this 100% except
it seems like on page two, line 6 we&#39;re saying, &quot;Not less than
50 feet and not more than 100.&quot; We&#39;re saying if you&#39;re
going to take somebody&#39;s property you have to take 50 feet, and if
we&#39;re going to take property let&#39;s take as little as we need,
and for any liquid purpose. So if you want a sewer line across somebody
else&#39;s property to get to another piece of property, you don&#39;t
need 50 feet, ten would be plenty, but I&#39;m just, other than that I
have no problem whatsoever with this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bumgardner, that&#39;s in a part of the statute that is
not changing. Why 50 feet was there could have been for safety reasons,
I don&#39;t know, but we were not trying to change the law in that
section at all and there will be other bills later on on condemnation to
which an amendment might be appropriate if you contact the relative
utilities to see why that 50 foot was in there to start with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions, further debate. If not, the clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will record the vote and close the machine. 106 in favor of
the bill, five against the bill. The bill passes first reading.

Objection being raised, the bill will be carried over.

Mr. Speaker, I would also like to be recorded voting yes, Richardson.

Mr. Speaker, I&#39;d like to be recorded as voting yes but the machine-

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.

The gentleman will also be recorded as having voted aye. For what
purpose does the gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Speaker I have a motion pertaining to the third reading of House
bill three.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may, is recognized for his motion and then to debate the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. I would move that the third reading which
would normally be held at the next House session which is February ninth
instead be held February tenth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, so ordered. Members, for planning purposes and
I&#39;m glad Representative Lewis made that motion, the, the plan for
Monday is is that we will have a no recorded vote session. As you know,
we changed the rules on the resolutions and have allowed those to be
done by voice vote now. There will be a resolution heard honoring the,
the boy scouts, and we have a number of boy scouts here. I know
Representative Jones is very active and involved in this process. The
session will be at four o&#39;clock on Monday. So if you can&#39;t be
here then and you&#39;re worried about missing a recorded vote, you
don&#39;t have to worry about that. There will be no recorded votes. We
did try to see about moving it to a day later in the week but the, the
logistics just wouldn&#39;t allow that to happen, so I just wanted to
make sure that folks understood that session on Monday will be at four,
but again it&#39;s not a recorded vote. But if you can be here and you
are here, the chair would certainly encourage you to be present for that
session. Members, we had, we had our pages with us this week. I would
ask the pages to please come forward. Pages, on behalf of all the
members of the House, we want to thank you all for being here this week.
This is the beginning of session so there&#39;s not as much activity as
there is probably in a, in a few weeks, but you&#39;ve actually had the
chance to observe a lot of operations and probably had a little time,
hopefully, to have had a good time while you&#39;re here this week. We
certainly hope so, and I certainly want to thank you for taking time
away from your families and from school to be here. Members, if you
would, please join me in thanking our pages this week. You all may
return to your posts for what is hopefully going to be a very brief
remainder of the session today. Members, for the record, the recorded
vote which was previously done on House bill, House bill 3. The question
was put before the second reading for the purpose of the journal. That
vote was, I believe, what was the total of the vote, madam clerk? After
the changes? I&#39;ll let the, I&#39;ll let the clerk finish her math
over there, then we&#39;ll announce that for the record. Notices and
announcements? For what purpose does the gentleman from Rowan,
Representative Ford rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to speak for a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. On this day in 1885, General Johnston Jones
introduced a bill before North Carolina&#39;s legislature that provided
a new model for the state flag as we see it today. May 20, 1775, one of
the dates on the flag, the Meck Dec. The others, April 12, 1776 and when
North Carolina authorized delegates to the continental congress to vote
for their independence from England, the Halifax Resolves. So today is
the day that the bill was introduced in 1885 that gives us our current
state flags. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wayne, Representative Bell
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege.

Thank you mister Speaker. And members of the body, I wanted to thank
everyone that participated in the sportsman&#39;s caucus reception and
breakfast we had yesterday. I do not know who won the shootout on the
lawns, so I&#39;m gonna go ahead and claim victory for the House since
the Senate delayed in getting us an answer. But I want to thank you for
participating in that. It&#39;s not too late to join the sportsman
caucus and I look forward to participating with you in that

Members, the vote on House Bill 3 with the adjustments on second reading
was 111 in the affirmative and four in the negative. The clerk will note
that on the minutes. Further notices and announcements? For what purpose
does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Hall, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For an announcement, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Due to the change in the time in Monday&#39;s
session, Democratic Caucus will not caucus on Monday an hour before
session as normally done. So we will not be caucusing Monday. Thank you
very much.

For what purpose does the other gentleman from Durham, Representative
Luebke, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I&#39;m interested in the schedule for the House Finance
Committee next week, and I wondered to which of the chairs should I
address my question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would defer to either Representative Saine or Representative Brawley,
whichever one&#39;s quicker on their button, if the gentleman would like
to direct his question to Representative Brawley, I&#39;m just going to
call on Representative Brawley. If the chair would like to direct his
question to Representative Brawley, I think he&#39;ll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, can you tell us when the first meeting of the
Finance Committee will be next week?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It has not yet been set, as you are aware the committee staff was not
named as of yesterday so we have not been able to meet with the
appropriate staff for the introductory sessions to educate the new
members as to the duties, responsibilities, and scope for the committee
on finance. That will be done as expeditiously as possible. I, like you,
look forward to the exchange of ideas that we always enjoy on Tuesday
mornings.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I agree with that. I have a follow-up then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you expect there will not be an Finance Committee meetings to take up
bills next week?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do not expect to take up bills next week at this time but I&#39;m not
aware of a bill that we may have to take up next week but that does not
mean there will not be one. But at this time I&#39;m aware of none we
will need to take up next week.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, there is a possibility that an economic
development bill may be sourced through the Finance Committee next week.
It&#39;s still being drafted. We&#39;re still consulting with a number
of folks on that but we frankly haven&#39;t determined. It&#39;s just a
matter of trying to see where everybody is on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Further notices and announcements. If not, the gentleman from
Harnett, Representative Lewis is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I move that the house adjourn to
reconvene Monday, February 9th at 4:00 P.M. Representative Lewis moves,
seconded by Representative Setzer, that the house adjourn to reconvene
Monday, February 9th, 2015 at 4:00 P.M. Those in favor will say aye,
opposed no. The aye&#39;s have it, the house stands adjourned.
