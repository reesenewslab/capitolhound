Senate will come to order. Sergeant at Arms will close the doors.
Members will go to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery will
please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is
the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplin. All members and guests in the
gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Please pray with me. My lord Jesus, it's with fear and trembling that I
come before you, not a righteous man, but a man who needs help. We are a
people that have clung to idols, as I have. We may have multiplied many
of our own desires, and we might smell of sweet perfume. We've tried
many things in life that has gone nowhere. Take us under your wing
today, Lord. And Jesus intercede for us. May we quickly end fighting
here on Jones Street, and receive help from the words of the prophet
Isaiah;
When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you. The wind
will carry them away, a breath will take them away. But he who takes
refuge in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain.
Jesus help us, deliver us, and give us the hope that only you can bring
through your resurrected son, and it's in your name that I pray. Amen.

Speaker: Senator Raven is recognized.
Representative: Thank you Mr. President and members. The house bill 101,
this bill attempts to create a transparent process for the addition and
consideration of special license plate. We have looked at several other
states, and sort of used them as a blueprint, as to how to do this. We
have worked hard to make sure no additional burdens are put on DMV in
doing this, and we are making sure that the general assembly has the
same discretion on these plates that we do now. We are simply assuring
that those who want a special plate, or a special background plate, can
do that by following the same methodology every time, so that every one
is treated the same and fairly. It really is a simple process, and a
good process, and it brings transparency and ease to the system we now
have. I will be happy to answer any questions if you have them. Thank
you.

Senator McClinton, Senator McKissick has the floor to explain amendment
two [Speaker changes]
This particular amendment I've worked on with Senator Goolsby and I want
to thank Senator Goolsby for his cooperation and working with me on
this.  It simply maintains the ability for an individual to get a
deferred prosecution, in addition to the new the language that allows
for conditional discharges.  It's somewhat technical in nature, but I
think we both believe that this would be in the best interest of those
who practice law in this area. I appreciate your support. As I said,
Senator Goolsby supports it as well.  [Speaker changes]

yes, i do [speaker changes]
he yields [speaker changes]
So, I just saw this and a class H or I felony will be eligible for
deferred prosecution, on this. Is that correct? [speaker changes]
What this basically does is maintain the language and conditions which
exist today as it relates to deferred prosecutions, so it would not
change anything dealing with deferred prosecutions today [speaker

Thank you Mr. President. In section10 of the bill, there are some
counties that are asking for an exemption from a current statute. There
are about a dozen counties in North Carolina where BB guns are
considered dangerous firearms and can't be in the possession of children
under the age of 12. Those are listed in this section. Part of what
we're doing in this bill would be to exempt five or six counties from
that. My amendment would request that Caswell County be included in that
exemption. [speaker changes]

So that we can have a commission to look at how we can do that in the
states so we can protect children. And he's been able to get it in this
bill and I wanna add the amendment what it does is under the Human
Trafficking Commission at several other associations so they could have
involvement in developing what that process and what that curriculum is.
So what this does is add, as well as add the National Association of
Social Workers, is also it adds the National School Boards Assocation
and DPI since whatever curriculum that will be developed will have to
come through those entities. It also includes that as a commission is
researching information and coming up with proposals that they'll
receive reports and testimonies on childhood sexual abuse from
individuals, agencies, communities, organizations, as well as across the
state, so that that will be available for the next session of the
General Assembly. Senator Goolsby and I have talked about it a lot, and
I aks for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on Amendment 4, Senator Goolsby. What
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I do appreciate Senator Robinson's efforts in this area.
Just to remind the members, this is Aaron's law, and it deals with the
issue of child sexual abuse. Most children are abused not by strangers,
but by people that they know. And what we are doing with the Human
Trafficking Task Force, is to not create another task force that'd have
to deal with this issue, since we already dealt with human trafficking,
sex trafficking last year when we created the task force. This adds some
members that are necessary so that they can develop the proper
curriculum so that these children can be made aware of what sexual abuse
is, and how to report it. It's very important. I think this is a cost
saving measure to have all this wrapped up in the Human Trafficking
Commission instead of creating another, and would appreciate your
support in adding these additional members that we think are necessary.
Thank you Mr. President.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members, this is a local
bill that will solve a flooding problem that we have in the Cotswold
Village, which is adjacent to the village of Pinehurst. They're asking

Any significant rain down there causes a huge traffic problem and a
flooding of streets and has to be closed off until the water finally
subsides and as you know, like the sandy soil they have have in
Pinehurst, it doesn't subside that quickly. So, I ask your support on
this bill.  It did pass the House 117 to 1 and there was not a single NO
