develop these resources because we want the jobs, and we want to develop
our economy, because this is about the future. And what we don't want is
to have a patchwork of impact fees across the state, and we certainly
don't want those impact fees to be used as a backdoor way to try to
block the development of these resources. So while I'm not the
amendment- I'm not offering the amendment, I just want to make it clear
that I would oppose any kind of additional
language like that, as far as how we deal with the impact to local
communities, they will of course get revenues from these efforts of the
development. There'll be a lot of economic development involved in it
and I think we need to address that in  a different way from a different
revenue stream other than having impact fees so we can have certainty
for this sector.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Newton, and I'll ask staff to please expound on that a
little.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for the committee's information, I did want to make the members
aware that senate bill 820 enacted last session. Does does direct the
mining and energy commission in cooperation with the league of
municipalities and the county commissioners to study impact fees and
impacts to infrastructure and what funding they might need so that study
is ongoing, and is due to the general assembly October 1st of 2013.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
Sen. McKissick?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, and this is related to the same issue that Sen. Stein has raised.
It would seem that perhaps an amendment might be appropriate to allow
impact fees if allowed by the general assembly. So it would give the
general assembly a opportunity to take a second  look at each particular
situation where it might be thought necessary by local government. It
may be some that felt like it wasn't necessary, and others where you
might have others who sanction impacts, but Sen. Newton, would you be
open to the idea of allowing impact fees if approved by the legislature
general assembly? I guess that's traditionally a route you might take to
get that authority in any case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Well at the general assembly, it approves that it's a different
situation, but I think it's premature to talk about impact fees as staff
just pointed out, it's going to be studied in the commission and we'll
receive the result  of their studies and we'll receive that judgement
then. We're really premature talking about impact fees today when the
earliest that anything - that any permits would be going on would be
after March of 2015.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
I mean if we're amending it to clarify local property taxes, impact fees
are something local governments will use as a mechanism for funding
adverse impacts from development. It would seem appropriate to do it at
this time but perhaps we can talk about that before it goes to the floor
to see if that is a possibility, it would seem appropriate if this body
openly has a say so over it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To respond to that, we're going to wait for the results of that study to
return and we'll make the decision at that point as to how the general
assembly should manage that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Warren?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess this is a question for Sen. Newton.
On the emergency management fund that's allocated $10 million, can you
just explain how that number came about and was there discussion about
whether that was adequate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? staff
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is on the bill, so if you want me to withhold the question until
later
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah I'll be glad to cover that when we're up to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
My question's for staff. We have the existing pipe natural gas tax, if I
remember right that's a state levied tax but isn't part of it locally
shared?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And so my question, if that's correct, if my memory's correct on that,
that's a state levied locally shared tax, I just want comfort from you
that drafting of this does not nullify the existing local distribution
out of the existing pipe natural gas tax. That's all I want.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not believe</p>

<p id="15:00">
00:00
I'll take a closer look at that I don't think it should because it's a
state [??] tax.
Mr chairman I'm comfortable with the amendment moving forward here but
if for any reason the staff should find [??] if staff should find that
there's I don't think the intent is to change that I'm sure the intent
is not to change that but if the staff finds that the language needs to
be tweaked on that I may suggest a tweaking if that's necessary.
that'll be fine and you know as we move forward we'll have to have to do
that thank you senator Tillman.
mr chairman are you ready for a motion on the amendment or do you need
one senator [??] amendment.
I think that would be in order yes thank you.
I move the amendment.
thank you the motion is [??] to move the amendment is there a [??].
[??].
how about senator [??] do you have a point of order.
okay thank you those in favor of moving the amendment please say aye.
aye.
opposed no okay so thank you any other questions or comments from the
committee senator Clodfelter.
Mr chairman another point I think this can get cleaned up I know [??]
got other places to go so no need to hold it for this point here so I
direct really the point to the staff you've got on page seven the
deductions from marketing costs item number four the cost of delivering
the gas to the purchaser I think you wanna see there the first purchaser
if I'm correct because otherwise they'd allow the entire distribution
cost down to the retail customer I don't think that's your intent so you
wanna tie it back up to the A section where you talk about the first
purchaser and Mr chairman I think it get done as the bill goes through a
committee substitute probably later on.
fine thank you senator Clodfelter anymore questions from the members of
the committee.
I have a second one for information purposes and again I know you
probably don't have it right on the spot but it doesn't have to be right
on the spot I'd be very interested in seeing a chart the fiscal note
refers to what other states do I'd be interested in seeing a chart on
the [??] tax structures and the other states that impose them just
really I'd like to see it to get some sense of whether the what's being
proposed here in on the high end or on the low end or somewhere in the
middle.
senator [??].
thank you Mr chairman senator Clodfelter I really appreciate your
questions and your comments specially about clarifying that earlier and
I appreciate this question very much this is something that I wanted to
talk about in the presentation here first if I could let me just say
broadly the reason why this bill is before you in my view is that we
have abundant natural resources here in North Carolina our country needs
the energy and North Carolina needs the jobs we need the economic
development and we're talking about the future of this state we're
talking about our future potential in reaching it one of the reasons why
we've put the [??] tax or suggested it in this bill this way is to be an
incentive to industry to send a clear signal that we want you to come in
North Carolina sooner rather than later to answer your question
specifically these tax rates are designed to be competitive compared to
other states basically my understanding is in other states they range
anywhere from one percent to almost ten percent okay so what we've done
is we've tried to create on the early years a very low tax rate in order
for the incentive rise to come now not wait to 2020 or 2025 come explore
come check us out come see what's here we believe there's five to
fifteen trillion cubic feet of natural gas at a minimum here in esprit
wide range but we have a lot of exploration left to do the really key
feature that I wanna share with you about [??] taxes is and when we
talked to various folks in the industry that operate across the country
they really liked what I'm gonna [??] in the out years 2020 and out when
the tax rate goes up if you'll notice it has a floor essentially if a
two and a half percent and a [??] of six percent and it's gonna float
with the price of million cubic feet excuse me per thousand cubic feet I
keep thinking the m is a million but it's a thousand in industry our
feedback was that they were like that's novel that's not what's been
done in other states in other words if the price is high or relatively
high they don't really have a problem with the six percent tax rate
which isn't at the high end of the spectrum it's there're higher tax
rates if the price is low and they've gotta forward two and a half
percent that's a.

<p id="20:00">
it’ll go, but if the price is $2 or $2.5, then a 2.5% tax rate is very
reasonable to them. They found that very appealing and very attractive
and we hope that that’s the effect that it has is to put us on the map
and for them to understand that this a good place to come and look and
invest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, I appreciate the explanation, I do, and I’d still like
to see the chart, but I’ll take your word for it. But what your
explanation prompted a question to is I like the slide scale idea, why
not do it for condense sites and oil?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, the first question I’ll ?? to is that my understanding of all I’ve
learned in this industry is it compensates for much more valuable
commodity, plus it was technically going to be very difficult to set
that sliding scale on the price. We couldn’t figure out how to do it and
it be clear. Now, we’re open to ideas on that, but… because the concept
we like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, several question. I’ll start out first with this issue relating to
the floating rate. Are there any other states that use a floating rate
as a model, because in information that I was able to review and obtain,
I didn’t see anybody else out there using this sort of floating rating
methodology for taxing natural gas or for anything else, so you could
share some insights with me in terms of why we went this direction when
I’m not aware of any other states out there doing it this way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I was trying to explain to Senator
Clodfelter, and I appreciate getting the opportunity to hopefully say it
more clearly. No, there are no other states that we’re aware of that are
employing this method. The purpose behind it is to make North Carolina
tax rates to the industry than the other states and other places where
they have other plays and other places. Industry in natural gas is
basically dry gas with very low prices. It’s hard to take risks and
gamble about new exploration plays. We’re unknown. We’ve not been in the
business. Unlike Texas, which been in the business for a hundred, we’re
unknown, we haven’t really been on the list, so to speak. The purpose of
having that sliding scale is to still make North Carolina attractive,
even when prices are low, because we want them to come and develop this
because we want the jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate that explanation, Senator Newton, I guess the thing that I
don’t know much about is why these other states that are out there that
have far more experience with natural gas exploration have chosen other
methodologies. Perhaps at some point if we could get some information
from staff about that, it certainly doesn't’ have to be today, that
would be helpful. The other issue I’d like to move on to are these
variables relating to marketing costs. Of course there’s one, two,
three, four, five of these variables. Are these variable the same types
of variables that might be used in other jurisdictions when they do a
deduct for marketing costs, before you tax what the value is of the
commodity that’s being extracted. Are these the same variables, are the
different variables? At what extent have we talked to our Revenue
Department here in North Carolina to determine if this is something they
would find easy to monitor. I suspect at some point somebody has to do
some auditing of some of these cost expenses. We don’t have much
experience with that in North Carolina so if our Revenue Department had
a chance to take a look at these specific provisions to either give it a
good housekeeping seal of approval or to express concerns about how we
may do it differently.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. There’s a couple of questions in there. One, let me
start with what I think what is the last one. I’m not sure if we’ve
checked with the Revenue Department on their view of it, but the intent,
and what we understand is is that how we drafted this is very
consistent. Really, identical, hopefully to how it’s done in other
states. We were trying to make that part standard so the industry was
familiar with what was expected of them and we would have models to draw
from about how to audit or other things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One last follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. You may Senator McKissick, but I want to remind you and
everyone that we want to allow time for the public to comment so if we
can speed it up as much as possible.</p>

<p id="25:00">
it would certainly be appreciated. A couple of other Senators do have
questions, we would like to have some time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, and I guess-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow up, and that's the offshore emergency management fund. I
know you have it there at $10 million, and that's going to be used
unless there's some type of hazardous condition that develops where you
need to go out and do some sort of emergency remediation. It seems like
that would be woefully underfunded in terms of what the costs might be
in the event of some sort of potential catastrophic condition. So has
thought been given- I think at one point it was up around $50 million in
some earlier discussions, or maybe in a prior legislation, so could you
explain why this figure seems to be at this level, the 10 million level
this time, because it does not seem to be what a drop in the bucket if
you really needed to use it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator.
I think that was- was that your question too, Sen. Daniel? Sorta? Well
not necessarily in that way, but let me try to answer his and then I'
was hoping to kill 2 at once, but...
The answer to your question is that $10 million honestly just seemed
like a good amount to start with, but what we wanted to make clear was
we intend to have an emergency fund. And we wanted to make it clear that
the first dollars  that come out were to go to that emergency fund. As
far as when we- offshore is a lot farther down the road then what our
onshore gas production potential is. We obviously have to reckon with
the federal government, we don't know what  our revenues will be,
revenue sharing with the federal government, we don't know how the
compacts may be developed with- Gov. McCrory as you know is very
supportive  of that, I'm happy that we're hopefully working in the same
direction with him on this, so we have a lot to figure out about that.
We just wanted to set- there is going to be a fund, we want to put a
sizable amount of money in there. I don't know that $10 million isn't
enough. But that's something I think we can take up down the road when
offshore seems like it's more  likely to happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Newton.  Sen. Daniel?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And Sen. Newton, I did notice in the bill that it's got a $10 million
onshore  emergency management fund, and a $50 million offshore emergency
management fund, so there's 2 funds which may address some of Sen.
McKissick's question.
My other question relates to the transportation highway trust fund, and
I notice that in the offshore formula that 10% of those revenues to to
the highway trust fund, but in the onshore drilling portion of that,
there's no money allocated  to the highway trust fund, and it seems to
me  that you'd have more impact from onshore drilling in regard to our
highways, but yet we're not allocating any money to the highway trust
fund and  highway fund from onshore drilling activities. So just wanted
to I guess use that as a questio nand maybe something you would want to
look at, and  as a transportation co-chair, it certainly is a concern of
mine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly glad to take a look at it.  We want to make sure the roads are
well cared for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One quick question: Obviously jobs and stimulating the economy through
energy independence is absolutely critical, from my brief homework on
the topic, there's absolutely a number of safe ways to do  this. But
within the bill, have we addressed the safeguards required to protect
our state's water tables?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. ??
Sen. Tarte, thank you for that question. Senate bill 820 addressed that
significantly, and this is a follow on essentially to 820. The
commission has until October of 2014 to develop those rules, and in fact
part of what this bill does is to shift a little bit of money to DENR
because they need some help with some contract work, putting those rules
together to speed this process along. So yes, we don't know what the
rules are yet until that report comes, but they are mandated by law to
present that by October 2014, and that's an important part of this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Newton. We're going to move ahead now and ask for- open
up the floor for public comments. Again, I will ask you to address those
comments or hold those comments to the finance portion of this bill and
limit your time to 2 minutes, if everyone or anyone who wishes to come
forward  would please state your name, and if your represent a group,
please tell us which group you represent. So</p>

<p id="30:00">
With that the public is welcome for comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. My name is Elizabeth Ouzts.
I'm the State Director for Environment North Carolina. We're a statewide
citizen funded environmental  advocacy group and I appreciate the
opportunity to comment on the finance portions of the bill. To echo I
think some of the concerns raised by the committee in section 5 in terms
of both the severance tax that is accessed as well as how then those
funds are distributed to address potential water and air pollution
problems. Really without the mining and energy commission's work being
complete yet and without rules having been produced for this legislature
to review it's really difficult for this body to have any basis for
knowing whether that severance tax is sufficient and whether the funds
allocated towards again mitigating the environmental harms that are
inevitable with fracking if the you know if the assessment is
appropriate. So just as one example we've seen in Pennsylvania that it
costs $109,000 dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me we want to hold to the finance portion of
this bill. Not to be nasty you may discuss those or have that discussion
when it goes to commerce. But please feel to discuss the finance portion
of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just was stating in terms of the finance and the
allocation of cost we saw in Pennsylvania that it cost $109,000 to
repair water systems for just 14 households. This was in Pennsylvania.
So again we would encourage the committee not to make premature
assessments about what is a proper tax and how to assess it without
having full information. Similarly on the offshore drilling revenue as
is stated in the bill summary that of course is premature. We don't know
you know whether we will have revenue sharing. We don't have it now and
similarly we don't know how best to allocate funds to an emergency
