Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures. He leadeth me besides the still waters. He restores my
soul. He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his namesake. And
yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear
no evil for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, thou
anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.
Now let me say a short prayer. Thank you for every person that’s in this
room tonight that’s here because you said so. Thank you for helping us
go the right way and do the right things. What we believe in our hearts
are the right things to do. To lead our state, our nation, our

Amen.

Mrs. Baker remembers how many of you in here can remember your first

the official collard Festival of the state of North Carolina that I know
there a lot of people that look at this type of presentation on the
floor in the debate that we do and see it. maybe sometimes it's a little
bit of silliness, but maybe we need a little bit of silliness sometimes
down here that it's not actually that silly when you think about how
important it is for those people and eight at the part of their

let me be the one of them, and the salamander why you would ask that I
decide to do that. it was simply because I was visited by young lady who
is probably as passionate as any PhD researcher anywhere on eighty
campus could be about the future of our test system and how amphibians
play the role that they do their actual Hopkins has already had the
wrong date declared in the state and she felt like that it would help if
you and I could understand how important these amphibians are the health
of our ecosystem, those of you who were in committee in rules when she
presented. I'm pretty sure were as impressed as I was the first, matter,
but the passion and the desire to make a difference that she she didn't

than their own particular bill. They have followed it through knowing
that other students are also involved in this. So, I do ask for your
support in this and I am honored to know that our students are very
interested in knowing what is going on here in the general assembly. I
hope that you will support this bill.
Speaker: Representative Algore, please state your purpose.
Representative: to speak to the ibll.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Representative: The part of the bill that I would like to address is the
designation of clay as the official arcmedium in NC. Our clay and
potting history is quite rich in this state, starting with the native
Americans who created their pieces by hand and then pit fired them, to
the settlers coming and looking for the banes of clay in the areas
around Seagrove, Cataba Valley and  areas around Sanford and Asheville.
Even the moravions in Winston – you can see a beautiful exhibit across
the street at the history museum of the work they put forth. I even
brought a little piece from my areas – this was created in the 1920’s.
These utilitarian pieces were essential to the agricultural economy we
had, here in this state, but from there it has evolved to beautiful art
pieces, created by artists throughout the state now, like Walter Fleming
here from Statesville. The potting history has made our state really
recognized across the state for all the potters. We have more potters
per capita in this state than any other. So, I commend the bill to you,
declaring clay as the official art medium.
Speaker: Representative Martin, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill.
Speaker: The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you. I am honored to stand before you and
recognized the famous [xx] Gates and Bala Simpson, who is in his 90’s.
There is a handout on your desk for those of you that are not familiar
with our now world famous wirly gigs. You may have seen this on a small
scale, but I invite you to come to Wilson where you can see them on a
large scale – they are the size of street lamps. Representative Jean
Butterfield, who I think is not here tonight, and I would love to host
you and give you a tour where we are renovating this incredible art. We
are getting ready to open up a new wirly gig park – it is part of our
downtown revitalization project, and we have some representatives today.
So I am excited to share with you this unique folk art and I commend the
bill to you and thank you for your support.
Representative: Be glad to answer any questions anyone may have about
this assessment bill. I appreciate your support.

representative Wray please state your purpose.
to speak on the resolution.
gentleman's recognized to debate the resolution.
thank you Mr speaker and members of the house ladies and gentlemen I'm
just a simple guy from Northampton county you barely ever see me get up
on the house floor and speak that's how I operate people'd run their
mouths all the time that's fine I'm just a simple guy just like Ed Jones
I never wear a bow-tie I've worn a bow-tie three times in my life I wore
it last year in honor of my friend when he was here I wore one the
second time the day they buried my friend and I wore one today Christmas
time my wife I have twin boys will be 16 this week Christmas time I got
two presents from my family from my wife and my two boys one of them was
a picture of Ed Jones and this bow-tie that was very special and very
dear to me we have a lot of freshmen members that are here lot of
democrats more republicans than democrats but let me tell you you heard
the resolution Ed Jones was a simple man that came from the Ashford
community when he was a African american and he'd come a long way Ed was
very dear to me in your life in your lifetime you meet friends
throughout your whole life you can always count them on one hand the
ones that you can really call through thick and thin in the day that my
friend [??] to God was one day that I lost one of my good friends
throughout the general assembly we all here just a passing just making a
difference Ed Jones never saw skin color he never saw age we were in a
group of people and some children to decide he would go to the children
instead of speaking to the voters that's just the kind of gentleman Ed
was I came in 2005 Ed came in 2005 John Hall passed away John Hall sat
in seat 60 right here and Ed came as on April 6 is my birthday and I had
a fundraiser back in [??] and Ed went back as a house member from [??]
county and his first vote was on the North Carolina lottery and that was
a special day for him because he was one of the deciding votes here in
the state house and so Ed and I started becoming friends and we would
talk and we would talk on the road and next thing you know as years go
by Ed senator [??] was re-elected Ed was re-elected in the house and
senator [??] passed away it was unique in North Carolina we had a state
senator and a state house member pass within a week or two of each other
and so I'd involved in politics and Ed said well I want you to be the
senator I said Ed I don't wanna be a senator I said I want you to be a
senator and Ed said well I want you to be the senator and so congressman
Butterfield called from Washimgton and said look I'mma fly down to [??]
airport to meet you and senator Jones I said you know you stay in
Washington we got this under control and so Ed and I talked and I said
look Ed I'm a young man I got my life ahead of me I said you know you
[??] older than I am but he always joked about that but Ed was truly as
fitting for him to be a senator to represent the people of the district
that he represented Ed was a highway patrolman and he represented that
part of the state and so Ed [??] a lot of the people so it was just a
better fit for him but I represented Northampton [??] county and a lot
of times Ed would be down further down east and I would be [??] county
and we call each other on the phone where're you at I'm [??] so where
you at but we had great memories and we had a lot of good times we
talked about our family and that's one thing as a young man Ed bestowed
upon me about how important your family is politics is a great thing you
help a lot of people that can't help themselves but family is one of the
most important things I've always known that I've got two special boys
just like everybody else [??] children and grandchildren no matter what
but Ed was so look you need to get home to your family you know don't
worry about that you know I said Ed I need to go there he said no..

One day he called me and said, where you at? He said, where you at? You
supposed to be at church, they got you on the program. All I can tell
you man is I’m up at the baseball field. He says, well I got your back.
That’s one thing I can truly say about politics. Republican, Democrat,
Independent, it doesn’t matter. One thing I can truly say about one of
my best friends in my life, is like a firefighter, it’s like a marriage.
You never leave your partner. I touched my left, Ed was there. I touched
my right, Ed was there. I backed up Ed Jones was there. I never left Ed
Jones. Ed Jones never left me. I told him, I said, you’ll always be my
wing man and vice versa. We were on the governor’s crime commission. I
won’t get too elaborate about this. We were on the governor’s crime
commission and we were going down to start a path one night. Ed, we were
driving, and I said, Ed I’m getting kind of hungry. Well, let’s try to
get to Wilmington. We got to Wilmington about 11 o’clock or a little bit
after. Ed said, where you want to eat at? I said Ed it’s 11 o’clock
there only so many places open. I said I know one place though. He said,
where’s that? I said Hooters. He said, what is hooters? I said well
let’s got to Hooters and eat. We went to Hooters and they do have good
cheeseburgers and good wings. Then we went to another meeting to
Atlanta. Ed had never been to Hooters before. We went to Atlanta to a
meeting. Ed went the day before I did. Ed called me and he said are you
still coming to the meeting? I said yeah. Why? He said when you coming?
I said tomorrow. He said you aint' even gonna believe this. Right across
from the hotel is a Hooters. I’m going to wait until you get here. I
don’t want to elaborate a whole lot. I want you to know that God has,
when Ed Jones told me, this was in April last year. When Ed Jones called
me on the phone and told me he had pancreatic cancer, I have experienced
a lot of things in my life. I can tell you some major things. I was a
young man. I pulled up on an accident. A car just caught fire. Next
thing you know, another car was on fire within seconds. I couldn’t save
those three people. Fires were blowing. People were hollering,
screaming. And, I watched three people perish to death. There was
nothing I could do. That was one moment in my life. But then, I had twin
boys, and I had one have heart surgery and has gone through a lot of
heart surgeries. He’s been on life support two times. He has to have
heart surgery again this upcoming June. When Ed Jones told me he had
that dreadful thing, on a Monday. I was in church on Wednesday night and
I was on church on Sunday. I was in church on Sunday night. I tell you,
that’s how much I truly loved Ed Jones. And, his family knows that I
love them and I will always be there for you. Ed will always be there
for you. Ed’s father left him at an early age. That’s part of life. Ed
told me in some of the last days of his life. He said, look I don’t want
to leave my daughters. My wife and my daughters, and my grandchildren. I
said, well Ed, God’s ready for you. You can go on home when you’re
ready. I went to Chapel Hill to see him. I went there one Sunday. I
called up Maryanne and she said you need to come here if you want to
come on up here if you want to see him. I went up there to see him. Then
I went back the next weekend. And, the next weekend I went to see him.
The first thing he told me was, you need to go home to your family.
That’s what he always thought about. Others and thought about him. Think
about your family. You all need to think about this. You up and down
this row trying to make a difference in North Carolina. But, your family
will always love you. No matter what. I’ll start winding down. Ed also
when he gave his closing statements in the Senate. Which he knew his
time was getting close. He had some young children ask him why were all
the African Americans and why were all the democrats sitting on the back
row. He told them that’s how politics was. This with you also. Whether
you’re republican or democrat we’re all North Carolinian. The slogan
that we have in our community: is working together works….</p>

...and that's the only thing we can do to move North Carolina forward.
So I'll leave this with you. I'll see my friend again. And the day I
spoke at his funeral was really, really tough. But again, in my
lifetime, I hope I can continue to be like Ed Jones and tough the people
of North Carolina, because that's what life's about, making it the best
place to be.
His legacy was, it's time about the time we pass; it's about the job we
do. I commend the resolution to you.

Rep. Earle: To speak on the resolution.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: The lady's recognized to speak on the
resolution.
Rep. Earle: Thank you.
Mr. Speaker and Members, I want to talk to you about my friend. When Ed
came to the legislature, Representative Palmer and I kind of took him
under our wing, if that was possible. You know, back during that time,
you could go out to dinner and not be criminalized for it, but we could
go out to dinner, and very often I had opportunities to put together a
group to go out to dinner.
So we would always include Ed. And you know when you would go out, there
would only be a small group, so you don't spread the word around to
everybody that we're going out to dinner, because everybody wasn't
invited -- five or six or seven people would be invited, so you don't
spread the word around, you just go.
Well, somehow or other, Ed didn't understand the protocol. And he would
tell everybody, ask somebody, you all going to dinner? You going with
so-and-so tonight? And so many times I had to pop his hand or give him
that look that you know, you should not do this and I used to ask him,
Ed, are you a slow learner, or is this just an Enfield thing? You know,
from the Enfield.
And he just never quite got it. I know one time we went to NCSL in
Washington state. So a group of us were invited to go across the water
to the island, and then another group was invited to go out to dinner
later on after we got back. So of course, everybody that went on the
cruise did not get invited, because I was putting together the dinner
for that night.
Well, we ended up with about four or five different people on the dinner
that night. The restaurant was packed, overflowing because we brought
five too many people along with us, because of Ed. And like I say, he
never quite caught on to that process. And I miss him so very much.
I really missed him when he left going to the Senate, but I thought it
was a good move, and I told him right away that this is what you should
do. Ed was a kind man, he was considerate, he was just a good person.
And he would always come to the races in Charlotte, the Memorial Day
race, and even up until the last, I think Mary Ann said he drove all the
way from Enfield to Charlotte for the race. And oftentimes, when we
would go to the conferences, in the very beginning, Mary Ann didn't go,
so [??] and I were kind of responsible for him. So then, later on, Mary
Ann started going, and we would always ask him and try to make sure that
he knew everything that was going on.
And he really loved his wife and his daughters, and he talked about them
quite often. Also, I just want to say, Ed liked sporty collars; he
always had a sporty collar. I used to tease him about being in a midlife
crisis. He had a Corvette one time and then another sporty, so he always
kept a sporty, nice shiny car, and when I heard that he was...</p>

You know, really, really getting down low. I called Maryanne to see if,
if we could come down and we were planning to go. Planning to be there
on the day that he passed. And I really miss him. I really do. I miss
him from being in this chamber and missing, missing, seeing his face
around, around the campus. And I just regret that many of you did not
get the opportunity to meet him because he truly was a good person. I
commend the resolution to you.

[Speaker Change]
Ed Jones was clearly a unique gentleman. It was a privilege for me to
work with him as he served in the House and in the Senate He was always
supportive of the Legislative Black Caucus and the Legislative Black
Caucus Foundation. He was always well dressed. Pressed and dapper.
Distinguished in his bowtie. And I always commented to him how good he
looked in it. He was committed to, to education and to children as
you’ve heard. During the last Legislative Black Caucus Foundation’s
event in last year, I had talked to him about serving as one of our
presenters and I knew that Ed was sick and I didn’t want to put too much
on him. But he called and said I’m happy to do it, I’ll be there. He
came and he presided and he stayed all day and participated in all of
the events. And even on that evening, I remember at the banquet, we, the
Foundation Board made a decision that we would dedicate, in his honor at
that time, all of the funds, the one hundred plus thousand dollars that
we issued to the HBC used in North Carolina in his honor. And he was
really moved by that and very grateful. He made his comments to the
audience that night, poor folk that didn’t know he was ill and this was
probably going to be the last time he said that I’ll see you. But I want
you to know that I was so privileged, and I’m so privileged to have been
honored by the residents of my district, to have been able to serve
them. He was always genuine about his service and very committed to
doing very good work. So I was just pleased to have some times to
actually talk with him. He was always encouraging. I remember going to
Elizabeth City State to meet him there. And I said if you don’t feel, he
says I’ll be there and he met me there. And we actually made the check
presentation to Elizabeth City. It was in his district. And made a
special contribution to a student majoring in criminal justice in his
honor. So I’m very pleased to say that I miss him, we truly miss him.
But he was always very kind and very genuine, very unique gentleman and
we miss him and I commend the resolution to you.

Thank you, thank you Mr. Speaker. I won’t take long and I can’t add much
to what’s been said but there’s an old saying that goes, if you’re
really good at something you don’t have to tell folks how good you are.
And Ed Jones was a good man. He was a man who would always take time to
speak with you. To ask you how you were and actually cared what you what
you said when you replied back to him. There are people that each of us
will serve with and will reflect upon our time with and will have
realized that we have benefited from knowing them. And for me Ed Jones
is one of those folks. Thank you Mr. Speaker.

Much has been said about Ed Jones and all of it has been true. I got to
really know Ed pretty good because he would come, I would eat breakfast
in the morning. I would come over a little bit early and I’d go down
stairs to eat breakfast and he would come by and he would eat breakfast.
And we had a little bit of a relationship because when he served on the
highway patrol up in the mountains, he said he ran across a couple of my
folks up there. And I said, well what did you do with them Ed? He said,
I gave them a ticket but.</p>

...he said, I didn’t know you at the time, but I guess it wouldn’t have
changed my mind. He said, in fact, I might have given him two. But Ed
was the type of person that you were just drawn to him because he was
sort of a quiet individual and he was always inquisitive. He would ask
me a lot of questions, a lot of times I could answer, but sometimes I
couldn't. The outstanding thing about Ed Jones was what Ed had to face
when he found out that he had pancreatic cancer and that his days were
numbered. Not many of us can really take it in stride like Ed took it in
stride. We would sit down at the table downstairs. He said, yeah, you
know, I’ve had a good life, I’ve had a good family, I love my family. I
hate to leave my family, but I know I’ve got to go so in these last few
days that I’ve got left, I’m going to do all I can to make up for them.
I think that was Ed’s bucket list was his family. That was the only
thing on his bucket list was his family. It had amazed me how an
individual, when it comes time for us to meet the man upstairs, whether
we know it or not, we’ve got to be prepared for it. Ed was prepared for
it, but for the life of me, I could not understand how a man who has
had...who knows that he’s not going to be here but so long to still be
the same type of person he was three days before or even before he know
what was happening. I always asked Ed, well, look, you deserted us in
the House, you went over to the Senate and I always wondered why you
would want to lower yourself to that because...he said, you know Mickey,
he said, I’ve been around a whole lot. He said, I was the mayor and all
of these jobs that he had, he said, I’m just fulfilling my destiny. He
said, if the President’s job becomes available, I’m going to go for that
too. Ed was a good guy. One of the best guys. I’m just sorry that most
of you did not have the opportunity to know him. As I said before, the
thing that stands out to me about Ed is how he could face life the way
he did knowing that his days were numbered. If all of us could even
reach that point, even if we don’t know when our days are numbered, but
we know we have served mankind to the best of our ability, then we can
all become at peace with ourselves. I commend the resolution to you.

Members of the body, I...if you didn’t know Ed Jones, and those of you
that are new here, you missed a real in treat in knowing a fine
gentleman. He was quiet. He was my seatmate. Sitting here beside of him,
I got to know a lot about him and what he did and his work. I didn’t
know he was a highway patrolman until he was here as my seatmate. We had
a lot of conversations about his work in the highway patrol. He
thoroughly enjoyed being a representative. He looked forward to going
home and talking with his people and working with them and seeing how he
could make their lives better. All of the things that you’ve heard here
tonight, there’s no need for me to say them again, but he was that kind
of an individual. To take the news that he received about his health in
the manner in which he did. I’ll never forget the day that I found out.
We were sitting in a meeting in Rocky Mountain and a very casual
conversation, he told us about his condition. I thought, you know, gee
whiz, how in the world can you sit here that calmly and talk about
something that’s probably going to take your life? But that was just the
demeanor of the man. I just can’t say enough good things about, and I
won’t for long, but he was one that loved his people He loved his
family, he talked about his family quite a bit. It was a joy to serve
with him and when I found out he was going to the Senate, I was...what
is there something wrong with me? I’ve had too many seatmates that
either left or going to somewhere else. He was that good and he knew he
wanted to be in the Senate and he did a good job in the Senate.
Excellent Representative...</p>

Many of you have said many kind things about Ed Jones but I’m going to
share something with you that you probably didn’t know and that is that
Ed Jones was a true blue red-blooded American.  He loved American
folkways, American politics and most of all, he loved American food. I
had the pleasure to take a trip with Ed. I believe Representative Tim
Moore and I were on that trip with him, over to Singapore and we were
eating Singaporean food breakfast, lunch and dinner. After about a week
or so Ed said, “You know Marv, I’m beginning to lose weight over here
eating all this stuff over here. I checked…” The bus drove into another
restaurant that night he said “ I tell you what?  You all go in there
and eat but I’m going to go around the corner. I’m going to find me a
hamburger joint.” He left and I guess he found a hamburger joint but he
didn’t get back to the bus in time. He missed the bus and I was worried
that night sitting up in the hotel. Where in the world is Ed? Here comes
Ed about an hour later in a taxicab. He came and he said, “Marvin you
all left me but I got my hamburger.” I commend this resolution to you.

Ladies and Gentleman, before we return back to the top of the calendar,
we are going to take up the next matter on page 2, House Bill 220, the
clerk will read.
House Bill 220, a bill to be entitled to enact designated July the 22nd,
of each year as North Carolina Fragile X Awareness stage. General
Assembly of North Carolina enact.
Representative Fulghum, please state your purpose.
To debate the bill.
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. There aren't many people in this body, or any
group of people I've ever known, who didn't have contact with autism.
Autism is what this bill is really about, and it about the fragile X
syndrome. X chromosomes are made up of everybody in here. Men have an X
and a Y, and women have 2 X's. We can usually tell the difference. What
happens in this syndrome, though, is the X chromosome is injured. Its a
genetic problem. In an extraordinary number of cases in which this X
syndrome is injured, the child is born with a developmental disorder
involving brain function which is described as autism spectrum disorder
or autism itself. Very difficult to diagnose other than behavioral,
until recently. Now there are genetic tests being done and chemical and
biological tests that are actually probably gonna find why this happens,
and most importantly, how to stop it from happening. North Carolina
Autism and Fragile X people have been reactive in this area and this
resolution or designation is simply to bring attention to that fact. To
bring attention to the people who are working on this and to honor them
for doing that. We're honored to have a group of people who are the
autism supporters here this evening, and I urge your adoption of this,
recognizing July 22nd, as Fragile X awareness day.

that they the gentleman that the chair was asking for objection. the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
the speaker of rule thirty eight D talks about when to go to finance
this bill does not of the following that doesn't raise revenue, reduced
revenue levy a tax authorize levy the tax assessed Murphy authorize the
issue upon for that. it's civil procedure bill, rep. if hours post of
the bill, said Blackwell is the lead sponsor of it passed. I believe
unanimously from judiciary and a week or two ago. it's ready to go draw

night on talking back and forth to our fiscal staff, and I just got an
e-mail from those states that have described the building.their message
back to me is that, yes, the buildings that have given funny. that's the
reason for the young motion

there's nothing in the bill that raises taxes or fees that would

the bill by send it to representative Howard's own committee and I would
urge the body not to agree to the motion
at Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ross procedure purpose to speak on emotion and sentiment immersion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you, Mister Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to say
for the record that the bill did not get unanimous support in the
Judiciary a committee that there were questions that were raised about
the Bell and what implications it might have, not just for the treasury,
but also for the court system.given that it would open up on utility is
sued to a whole bunch of different people and on in ways that they've
never been able to do before without any penalty for frivolous lawsuits,
and his body has been putting lots of penalties on frivolous lawsuits on
the past few years, but this would certainly invite many of them, and I
think Representative Howard and staff on our appropriate and having it
take a dip in finance presented similar procedure purpose of a fashion
don't recognize the great emotion,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Speaker just said that I agree with the with the representative

also, the attorney for the state or the county. so that's really not an
objection. secondly, if you look at committee summary on the bill, which
you probably have never gotten there yet. you'll say that the
challenging wrongful expenditures has been a while for a long time and
yet we don't have a lot of frivolous cases challenging expenditures you
know from your discussions of that policy that PAC sexpenditures are
really just appropriations by another night so the same policy that
applies to expenditures should apply to tax policy as well. the

Please vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore is recognized for a period not to exceed three

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Hall. Members the reason that...this is a
complicated bill and it is not a simple easy bill. There are arguments
that it may or may not lead to moral litigation. There are arguments
that it may or may not cost the state money, that it may or may not
reduce revenue. It certainly has the potential to do all of that. The
fiscal note reflects that and this bill because...if you look at rule
38B it does potentially reduce revenue. If more folks are granted this
granted this standing, more awards of attorney's fee’s potentially
awarded. This is something would cost the state, this is something that
would, in fact, reduce revenue. This may be a great bill, I don’t know,
but the point is that this bill should at least go through the Finance
Committee and I would think that the safe thing to do is to not rush
through, put a bill on to vote, put a bill on the floor tonight, take a
vote and then find out after the fact that there’s an issue. You’ve
heard from the Finance chair that her finance staff has reviewed it, has
found that there is a potential finance impact, and this bill would go
through Finance. Both Representative Stam and I are on the Finance
Committee, the Finance Committee can hear the bill, and of course,
Representative Stam knows very well that if the bill sets there a while,
there are ways that the bill can be removed from committee at that time.
This is not a death sentence for the bill, this is a we just don’t need
to do it now, we just need to run it through the proper committees.
Members, I would ask that you vote yes in favor of the motion, thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, again, by rule, there may be some members that wish to ask a
question or comment, but by rule, the time was limited to those two
speaking. Now we’re about to take up the motion to re-refer. This motion
would require a simple majority to re-refer House Bill  457 to Finance.

The House Committee Substitute to House Bill 532 has passed its third

to be entitled ‘An Act to Reduce the Seating Capacity Requirement and
Eliminate the Population Requirement for In-Stand Sales of Malt
Beverages and to Direct the ABC Commission to Adopt Rules for the
Suspension of the Sale of Alcohol Beverages During Professional Sporting
Events’. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hardister, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The House will come to order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Current law provides
that only athletic stadiums with a seating capacity of 60 thousand or
above can allow in-stand beer sales, which means only the Carolina
Panthers can do it. This bill would allow the state’s other professional
sports teams to offer their fans the same service. This is an issue of
consumer convenience. It allows fans to stay with their family and
friends instead of having to wait in line at a concession stand. This is
also an issue of allowing more control for the private sector. Under
this bill, vendors would not be allowed to verbally shout the sale of
beer. Stadium vendors would also be responsible for training their
employees to properly serve alcohol. This bill would also direct the ABC
Commission to adopt rules on suspending alcohol sales in the latter
portion of athletic events. This is not a requirement; stadiums could
decide whether or not they want to participate. And with that I commend
the bill and would appreciate your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Duane Hall, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, to ask that I be recorded as voting yes on House Bill 330

CHANGES] I just wanted to basically say I support the bill and my good
friend Jon Hardister from Guilford County. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ya’ll are
going to probably hear me talk a lot more than you want to hear about
alcohol a little later in the calendar, so I’ll just say this. There’s a
reason why law enforcement when they pull you over to the side of the
road on a probable cause or believing you might be driving while under
the influence, there’s a reason why they ask you to get out of the car.
Requiring people to walk to the beer stand is just one more step we take
to make sure they have not drank too much that day and they’re not going
to be leaving there drinking and driving. It gives the people who are
selling the alcohol the chance to observe them and make sure it’s not
time to cut them off. I’d ask you to vote against this bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the bill please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I debated whether to talk on this bill, but I’ve decided to do that. We
are spending a good portion of time this session toughening GWR laws and
increasing penalties and decreasing BAC levels and talking about
ignition interlocks, and then we have a bill that seeks to greatly
expand the number of people likely to drink and drive. Let’s face it: In
the smaller venues, just like the larger venue, the vast majority of
people who are going to these smaller venues are driving there, and
they’re driving with their families and their friends, and we want them
to drink because that’s the purpose of the bill, to allow that
opportunity, but we know as a matter of empirical data that the vast
majority of people who take a beer there are going to be in cars a few
hours later.</p>

doesn't play training of those who would be selling alcohol to determine
how many drinks a person has had andwhether or not there I have had too
much to drink, so there is a portion of their training where they have

necessarily about encouraging everyone to drink or making it easier if
you look up silly like Bojangles Coliseum in Charlotte, which would now
be eligible for this type of thing in the Charlotte checkers were in
town. there's a lot more seats and are parking spaces. so I think we
have to assume that art that people that are driving a car. hopefully
they're not drinking anyway, regardless of how they get. this should
really be about the three or four passengers in the car, which is more
likely to record occur then the driver of the bill, a driver of the car

ladies and gentlemen of the house. what we have in North Carolina is an
AVC system stands for alcohol beverage troll, we are quickly turning our
stadium through is a system of IDC worse alcohol of beverage convenience
and I don't know that we necessarily want to adopt the state wide policy
where we just make it convenient for you to drink. I don't think it's
unreasonable for us to have to ask people if they choose to drink
alcoholic beverages at a sporting event get from their seats and walked
to the window and purchase their alcohol now some of you under the
impression that this applies that outdoor stadiums. this applies to
arenas and indoor venues as well. anything three thousand seats or more
is one of vector stadiums and arenas in your neighbourhood. it will
affect arenas and stadiums in my neighborhood. I just think that we need
to send the message in this state that if we're going to allow you to
drink you have to drink responsibly. yes, there is a provision and hear
the JVC congressional have to establish some rules regarding the way

the integrity of the voting process. Many states enter into data sharing
agreements with other states to help ensure that their voter lists are
what they should be, that voting records are what they should be. The
only thing I would point out to you if you read the bill and you look at
lines, I believe it's around 19, 20, 21, where it talks about the
statutes and having other states to comply, just to answer any questions
 that might come up that came up in committee about that, what that
applies to is sensitive information such as social security number or
other information that might be used in- that would not be appropriate
information to be shared, that might be a identity theft issue, that's
what that has to do with. Members, I would appreciate your support for
this bill.

Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I just wanted to remind members that during the committee, we received a
letter from the NAACP and they were concerned about the large number of
voters that might be inappropriately excluded from the voting rolls as
happened in Florida where there are thousands of voters that were
expunged from the voting rolls there in Florida incorrectly, and I think
they might have some concerns that the same thing might happen here in
North Carolina, so I'll be voting no. Thank you.

I'd like to ask the sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Jones, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Jones, in looking at this, we've got the NVRA, and it has set up in
it certain methods,  means, and ideas for states working with each other
on it. What I'm seeing in here is, for instance, they have to comply
with our laws rather than us complying with their laws, is that what I'm
seeing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Michaux, what I see is that we are requiring the other states to
comply, we are saying that any data sharing agreement that we enter into
with another state would require our state, their state just as our
state would, not to share sensitive information that could be used
inappropriately as an identity theft issue. I believe that is the area
that I see that talks about other states complying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield? He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Where does it specify &quot;sensitive information&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Michaux, it is my understanding that the general statutes that are
referenced on line 21 are there for that purpose, and that was actually,
this was a committee substitute that we added that language just to make
sure that there was no inappropriate information that would be shared.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I'd like to check the third reading on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair anticipating an objection will carry the bill over.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.

Mr. Speaker, this is the so-called growler bill, and for those who don't
know what a growler is, it's a refillable and resealable glass jug that
carries about 64 ounces of beer. And to give you some sense of that,
that's less than a 6-pack. And growlers are sanitized, filled straight
from the tap,</p>

<p id="120:00">
sealed and then labeled. North Carolina law presently allows growlers to
be filled and refilled at breweries throughout the state. But what this
does is simply allow growlers to also be sold at off-premises retail
locations that have the appropriate permit, and under certain
specifications. This is really directed at the craft brewing segment of
the market. You may not know that North Carolina, or maybe you do, has
one of the largest craft brewing sets of businesses in the United
States, and a lot of those businesses don't can and bottle their own
beer. And in this way, those craft brewers could sell their product in
these containers called growlers. I would add that other states,
adjoining states, have this same provision, meaning they allow growlers.
I was surprised when the folks that were interested in the bill came to
tell me that for example, the Piggly Wigglys in South Carolina are now
selling growlers. So I would recommend the bill to you. It is the
product of a lot of communications by a lot of different groups. We got
near unanimous recommendation coming out of the committee. And again, I
ask for your support.

him, I thirty seven in efforts to protect the rights of individuals to
abide by heart and lost on me, and to increase penalties on those who do
not come assets without represents are not really abalanced approach to
these issues. I will be having one hand, if the forefront law
enforcement community. I'm notably the North Carolina sheriffs
Association. I come out in support of this bill in its current form
today on it. we also have the support of our Second Amendment advocates
on what to do, along with representative burns in a non- work on this as
well. I take you through section by section and now I'm good to take to
begin with. he ever laid a law enforcement pieces and then Everton a
person to amount of the Bell South. I personally have here out in
infection for altering attention to that. I'm concerns of access for
young children to firearms, etc. it makes it a criminal offense for any
person to provide child under the age of twelve to have access to or
possession of a dangerous firearm without parental permission and adult
supervision to be a class C misdemeanour's criminal. all of this only
applies to parents, but what would we do under the spell of it. I do any
person at section five really is very important, important section
increased penalties are for gun crimes, but that doesn't increase
increases the penalties of various kinds in which a firearm is
used,displayed, or its use or display is threatened current law right
now only applies to class a three companies and if there is a fire arm
that is used in connection with a crime, and there is a minimum sixty
month increase out what we are doing in the spell here is that for class
a through E felony, or increasing the sentence by seventy two months. on
the one are all sitting infections that we are expanding the class and
the families that would incur this type of penalty. I felt the class
after he thought him increase of thirty six- minimum and in class. that
class. each drive colonies, there would be an increase out of a minimum
of twelve months and I'm going to the Isabel had a huge section on our
mental health section. very, very important man, and the request of law
enforcement as well.section seven eight have to do with our reporting to
mix the national instant from a background check system, beginning here
in these mental health section. this is really getting our laws out to
the standard with what federal law requires that we had no one are doing
is requiring the transmission to be made within forty eight hours of
when the mental mental health education has occurred on and also
instructing the administrative office of the courts to adopt rules to
make sure that transmission of the report is done in a uniform manner.
I'd also see in the elders of the laundry list of the specific, specific
judicial determinations that will require a report on the Internet and
the frame and develop an end. the last major sections, sections nine
through twelfth- ten restoration of rights possessed firearms on
identity, making them clarifying changes are statutes getting at getting
in line with with federal law. I'm also making sure that the profit that
we have to make any findings and then for restoring his right arm is
uniform and applies to all determinations and findings of that is what
we refer to live at the law enforcement. he said this on what one person
has specifically requested, and uncertainly support so without allowing
the balance reps are related.

Thank you speaker. I would like to add some reputation information run
through the sections of the bill that expanded in Australia and Second
Amendment rights of first starting back on the main page of the bill in
section one of that section language in the statute at a person with a
consumer group home. it may have that handgun in a closed compartment
and a lot be all that is in a parking lot owned or leased by state
government, section two, the bill will make changes to this statute
prohibiting file forms on educational properties in order to allow
certain individuals to possess handguns on certain educational
properties under certain conditions, and are run through those witty of
horses, employees of colleges and universities and of boarding schools.
he reside on campus on a campus in a detached single-family dwelling
where only they and their immediate family reside may have a handgun on

him all the second piece of that in our runs. anyone with a concealed
carry permit out to have a handgun while in a vehicle on a public or
private college or university, and again it it gives her the often opt
out and we talk about the college. this is includes community colleges
and universities as well. here is my opinion. I believe the pain of a
lot of North Carolina. instead, students, parents and faculty have the
right to protect themselves when they are in a campus parking lot and
when they are commuting back and forth from home to school or from home
to work or from there did the parking lots to their jobs are late at
night a week for the a lot lately about you know that the parking lots
on school grounds or dangerous place and that if so please tell me why
in the world. we want to prevent law-abiding citizens from protecting
themselves against those who choose to break the law makes no sense to
me, and I think that you and know that students are going through their
exams right now, we've heard a lot of issues. I did see, say a recently,
it's been in the news with the violent sexual assaults and robberies on
campus and I even offered a few of the students from.they are cited,
even when they call to try to get a police escort them from the library
that is a long way and they don't even have the ability to escort the
students to the problem to their cars as they yet they claim they can
and do there there backed up, obviously so I why we would not allow
those you choose the father law, be able to protect themselves. I don't
know. I think this is provision of the bill.this section will correct
data. make sure that when they get to their cost that they can do so
again this doesn't allow them to cure in the classroom is simply allow
the student or anyone else to leave this a conceal carry weapon in also
they may have. it is a commute back and forth. the third section. this
bill would authorize a person with the joker from it. a yet concealed
handgun in the assembly,where emissions. these charts like a theater and
any establishment such as a restaurant to serve alcohol, as I believe
forty three or forty four other states already permit and that that is
obviously unless they give us in his consuming alcohol, which is already
illegal in the state and continues to be driven so. a permit holder and
have that weapon on you. it is again has a lot to do with
propertyrights. this is returning the individual property owners right
back to him to make the determination whether or not he wants allow and
so. in his property versus government is saying you can't allow even if
you so choose, and this allows them to make that decision on their own.
this doesn't say they have to allow for soaker permits holders to have
their weapons in their own their property. it is simply says it's their
choice, and they cannot post a sign prohibiting that is, if they so
choose, and section six of this bill clarifies local governments
authority to prohibit concealed carry by defining specific areas where
provision is allowed in reference to recreational facilities. this
addresses an issue that came up two years ago where we allow concealed
carry could be expanded to parks and communities and as some local
municipalities and begun abusing the current statutes of this is simply
clarifying and defining what we intend the term recreational facility to
me and I specifically include, exclude certain areas such as a Greenway
in designated biking or walking past that they had started labeling as a
recreational facilities where they played sports. you can find is always
set out in subsection B a in of the entire bill continues, the General
assembly 's efforts to protect the rights of law-abiding gun owners and
expand those rights and ensure that those who would not should not him
us off by increasing penalties on violators and strengthening our mental
health reporting requirements to prevent the mentally ill for being our
purchase guns at its widest deal is supported by many in the law
enforcement community, including the Sheriff 's Association, and many of
those on the other side who support expanding and keeping your second

Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'm really ashamed of this chamber tonight. I did
the members in here a very big courtesy and sent amendments to them the
day before the voting judiciary. We were allowed to let a lot of people
from a lot of organizations get up and speak on this bill in committee,
which was 2 hours after hearing John Blust speak for years about how the
Democrats treated him. They then ran out the clock and didn't even allow
me to have my amendment heard in committee. The same

The lady's point may be well taken if the gentleman may take that into
account as he precedes with his comments. The chair will not take that
point well at this time. The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. So I had an amendment here today. We've had
amendments that weren't allowed to be run in committee, and now we can't
even have an honest hearing on something as important as background
checks on the floor of this house. And before you stand up to me and
tell me that we're talking about your second amendment right, how about
reading the case law.</p>

<p id="145:00">
That is not what the Second Amendment says. It’s here, written by
probably — I guess after the ACA was decided last year. If I was to ask
you who your favorite Supreme Court Justice is, most of you would tell
me Scalia. Well let’s hear what Justice Scalia has to say: Like most
rights the second amendment right is not unlimited; it is not a right to
keep and carry any weapon whatsoever, in any manner whatsoever, and for
whatever purpose. The court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt
on longstanding prohibitions on firearms by felons and the mentally ill,
or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as
schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and
qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Millers' holding that the
sorts of weapons protecting are those in common use at the time find
support in historical tradition, of prohibiting the carrying of
dangerous and unusual weapons. This Bill is not about the second
amendment, it’s a policy issue that’s proper for this floor to hear and
debate.
Despite what you read in your emails the last few days, my favorite of
which have been the ones that compared my amendments to those in Nazi
Germany, I am not anti-gun, and I am not anti-second amendment; I grew
up with firearms, I own firearms. I just have the good sense to know
that just as alcohol and driving don’t mix, alcohol and firearms don’t
mix. Our current policy prohibits concealed weapons in restaurants and
bars the serve alcohol, and this policy is a 180 degree change to that.
Instead of saying now they are prohibited, now they are allowed. And I
just think it would be some good sense for us to discuss that policy
before we have a vote. In three terms, no single restaurant owner has
ever asked me for this right. And maybe some property owners do want the
right to allow firearms in their businesses, I don’t know why they’d
want to assume that liability, but maybe they do. And just like you may
choose to only attend or go to dinner at restaurants that allow you to
take your weapon, I’ll choose to stay out of that. What I do know, is
that I don’t fear like the emails try to say, I don’t fear a return to
the Old West. That’s not my problem with firearms, that’s not it at all.
But I do fear an escalation of disputes. You know, just this past
weekend at Smithfield's, two ladies got in an argument in a bar, a
sports bar about 1:30 at night over a man. And one of them went out to
the car and got a firearm and shot four people. Now I realize that this
prohibition would not have prevented that from happening, but it’s a
good example of why some people believe that alcohol and firearms don’t
mix. That’s based on my strong opinion of being seventeen years in the
legal practice and seeing some crazy things people do when they’re
drinking. And weapons just don’t go with it.
Now, Representative Pitmen a few weeks ago gave us a handout, earlier in
the session, and it talked about the results of Virginia passing this
type of bill, and I think it makes a good point that they have not any
mass shootouts or anything like that in bars, but they have had
individual incidents, and that’s what I worry about. When I go out to a
restaurant with my family, I don’t want to have to worry about the guy
next to me if he’s had too much to drink. I’m already worried about
being out to late, that he might run me over, but now I’ve got to worry
about how he’s handling the firearm that he’s got stuck in his sock. I’m
going to send you an email that shows you the second point of my concern
with this bill. And it’s just — accidents happen. In the email you’ll
see incidents of three accidental shootings that have happened just the
last few months. In Kansas three weeks ago, a man accidentally shot his
wife when he reached into his pants pocket and accidentally discharged a
small weapon. He had a valid, carrying a concealed weapon permit. A few
weeks later, a family eating inside a Chinese restaurant in Colorado
nearly missed being shot when a man inside a restroom accidentally
discharged his weapon. According to the news report he too also had a
valid weapon and had not been drinking. And of course, there was the
incident here, well, it was nationwide — we had three in one weekend,
but we had the gun show here in Wake County where we had an accidental
discharge and a couple of people were shot. And that’s the main problem
I have with the bill, is because an accident happened, and the more
places we have guns the more accidents we’re going to have happen. If
you don’t believe me, tonight or tomorrow, maybe tomorrow, stop by the
Verizon store and ask them how many people a day drop their phone. I
think you’ll be surprised how many people come in there to get their
phone replaced. Ask them how many of those people drop their…</p>

following in a bathroom. And that's where you see all of these
accidental discharges happening. The New York City police department,
they actually keep a statistic, I guess that they have so many officers
they have this happen a lot of times. They keep a statistic on how many
purely accidental, non-provoked discharges of weapons they have by their
trained officers. It was 21 in 2010, it was 15 in 2011, and I remind
you, these are people highly trained and skilled, taught every day how
to store and shoot their weapon and yet accidents still happen. I'd ask
the body tonight to really consider about the policy that we're
changing. And have an honest debate, don't let a few people sending you
a hundred emails speak for your constituents. Use your common sense. Ask
yourself, do you want the person next to you drinking and handling a
firearm? And don't vote for this bill unless the answer to that is yes.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak briefly on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the House.
I wasn't going to speak on the bill and I really don't intend to, now
I'll leave that to others, I did just want to respond as far as
Judiciary A committee I chair was brought up. We did have a full and
thorough hearing on the bill. One of the regrettable things I think
every member of this body incurs, is committee time is limited when you
have members filing a lot of bills and a huge committee agenda, there
often isn't-  there aren't hours upon hours to have a hearing. But we
did thoroughly hear this, and when Rep. Jackson brought up 5 amendments,
I asked him clearly, can you put- and we might- and I told him we might
not be able to hear- the time might not permit to hear all of these, do
you have any particular order, can you prioritize them and he said it
did not matter, so to come into this body now, and complain that one
amendment wasn't heard, is just somewhat misleading to the body. By the
time we got to the final amendment, we had 2 minutes left and I had
announced earlier we would take a vote, we have to be out under the
rules, but 10 minutes til the hour, we had been in there almost 2 hours,
and there was not time in my judgement to hear another amendment and
vote on the bill in 2 minutes. So I just don't like that not- like that
implication- or not implication, said plainly, and I do think, members
in here, that if you say something loud and with vehemence you ought to
be able to yield to a question and back up what you tell the body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, it is the intent of the chair to take the vote on
at least second reading tonight, and if there is objection we will carry
it over. According to the rules, we're to end business til 10:00. The
chair, at the appropriate time if there is objection, to continuing past
10 it requires simple majority to suspend the rule and move forward, but
at this point the chair does intend to remain here as long as it's
necessary, to take third- to take at least second reading on this bill.
Rep. Ross, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker.
This bill, just to remind the public that might be listening, I'm sure
there might be something better on TV, but the public should know what
this bill is going to allow. This bill is going to allow guns that are
currently prohibited from being certain places, in these places. And so
let me just remind you where those places are: As Rep. Jackson said,
they're going to be allowed in bars and restaurants. They're also going
to be allowed on green ways, and in park areas. They're going to be
allowed in certain stadiums. And they're going to be allowed on the
campuses of our colleges and universities. Well, I think that's a
mistake. I have all four of these types of establishments in my
district. And probably more than any single one of you. But Raleigh,
just this year, was voted one of the safest places in America. We don't

in places where they already feel safe. this is not something that makes
this state a better place. it's something that puts us on Stephen
Colbert and we've been on cold there a little bit too much lately.
please vote against this bill presented in as good a place that your
purpose debate the bill is recognized and ready to go. thank you, Mister
Speaker, I cannot let each other the house that we currently have a
statute about storage of firearms to protect minors. it reads any person
with the first. sorry person who resides in the same premises of the
minor owns or possesses a firearm and start early in the firearm, a
condition that the firearm can be discharged in a manner that the person
knew or should have known supervise minor would be able to gain access
to the firearm. we had that provision because we understand that might
or should not have access to a firearm in a person who has the firearm
have the responsibility to make sure the minor can't get over there are
lots of other people to do that we think should not have a firearm, a
person is a fugitive from justice by justice one who's been adjudicated
mentally incompetent. one is an alien or illegally in the United States.
someone is every renounce their United States patients. yet, the list
goes on. but because you were unwilling to hear an amendment because it
is not. it is not illegal for a person who has a gun to bring and keep
these people who work should not have it from gaining of as a reason why
we shouldn't have an honest, open debate about issues and eight. it is
very objectionable that the debate would be cut off like that when this
is a question important bill. we should not I can understand why anybody
would want him gone accessible on a college campus when there are
hundreds of people around. I suppose that you think someone could run to
a car after a shooting stars run to the car and get a guy as many people
would probably do you do that with a dozen people and go in with guns
who were they shooting it doesn't make any sense at all to Hennepin and
find on a college campus committees, colleges have elementary schools
and middle schools associated with them. your opening this up not just
to college campuses that the students who are younger than that to

I believe we already have provisions in your layout to be drinking
alcohol during web as we concealed your permit and to allow someone with

not allow that person to the consuming alcohol. so that's not make that
person a more dangerous. the idea about the weapons on campus.
personally I feel that the new something was saying it again locked up
in the car on campus. some I might break in a stale and I would say best
way to do that is loudly cheered in the classroom and now then you have
one test unit out a car, but I do agree with Rosetta Berlin don't at

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representetor Blasier place your purpose of the patent bill must just be
known as recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you, Mister Speaker. well I'll talk for a minute about the Second
Amendment, but I don't know they'll do it much more eloquently than than
represent Jackson did what I am sure. regardless of the effect of the
second amendment is that the First Amendment is taken a big hit tonight
when I am also sure is that the Second Amendment does not provide a
right to carry concealed firearms or present. Jackson is right for those
read the Heller case all about McDonald versus the city of Chicago. a
provide for the clear right under the Second Amendment were someone to
have the right, individually to keep and bear arms, the Supreme Court as
long as known as eighteen ninety seven, said specifically an exception
to that right was the right of present or the laws of this country
prohibiting the carrying of a concealed weapon and four weeks ago the
tenth circuit of the United States at that exact position. so, the
policy matter this before us tonight is a policy matter, but it is not a
constitutional and there should be no mistaking one for the other
for me. I disagree with the provisions of the bill. the deal with
restaurants and green ways, but where I fundamentally disagree the most
and what causes me the most concern is the University provision in a
state that both as a father who had kids on campus but also as a
professor on campuses in representative in the last thing I wanted
someone to have it done in my class on the tough we really don't want to
see that happen. I am, but in all candor, regardless again, the policy
merits both ways. we knows one thing and that is that every UNC
Chancellor of every institution, every chief of police of every UNC
campus every community college president who's made a public statement
and the community college president of the private colleges. the people
who we charged with the duty of caring for the children and the students
on those campuses. we can't we give them the duty to run those campuses.
they are the ones who know their discipline issues. they know their
mental health issues on campus than other security issues on campus and
not a single one of them. a persistent, so regardless of my judgment, or
your judgment one way or the other we ought to let leases to that
provision of this into every single voice that's out there who runs
these institutions. we says take this provision now
and yet we don't have the courage of our convictions tonight will allow
a vote on that provision that is really not an acceptable way to deal
with a huge public policy problems and a huge problem that says to all
of those people who run those institutions on something as critical as
this following new town, were not going to listen to your judgment. we
know better we all know that despite the collective wisdom of this body,
not the whole font of knowledge does not exist in this room and we at
least on this issue, or to listen to the unified voices of every
president and chief of police is spoken on this issue and for that
reason, among others, I'm going to vote against this bill and I am
really quite sorry that we are operating out of fear tonight because we
legislate out of fear. we don't do a good job Cicely were doing this
