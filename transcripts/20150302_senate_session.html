[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister president. Colleagues, we had previously scheduled a
sportsmans caucus meeting on Wednesday at 4 o&#39;clock for those of you
who are interested in that, but due to the joint session that we&#39;ll
be having this week with the chief justice coming over, we&#39;ve had to
reschedule that. So we&#39;ll be having a sportsmans caucus meeting
tomorrow at 3:30. You should have that in your inboxes. All members are
welcome, especially those that are interested in outdoor, wildlife, and,
and sporting activities. I believe the room is 423, but that may change.
Just check your email. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any other announcements? Senator Davis, you&#39;re recognized
for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks mister president. And to members of this chamber, it&#39;s been
somewhat tradition over the years that we would pause in the chamber to
recognize black history month, and the contributions of African
Americans and those who&#39;ve been committed to diversity in our state.
Last session, we recognized through a resolution all the African
Americans who had actually served in the general assembly. Although
we&#39;ve been hampered by inclement weather, I feel compelled to stand
before you this evening and to share a few thoughts and reflections
about black history month in keeping into this tradition. A little over
a week ago, members of the East Carolina University board of trustees
unanimously, unanimously voted to transition the name of Governor Aycock
from one of our dormitories. On this matter, brought students, faculty,
administrators, those from across our community together. Many supported
the action of the board, and there were some who did not support that
action. The matter at hand dealt with the desire to embrace heritage,
but yet also the desire to embrace a new future with those who are
sensitive about which direction we would head. East Carolina has a motto
and it says tomorrow starts here. In spite of the motto, or in the
spirit of the motto, I must believe that the board wrestled and
struggled to acknowledge heritage, but at the same time to embrace our
future

  <p id="10:00">
  We see here the very challenge with race relations. How do we work with
each other? How do we live with one another? How do we get along? What
important questions. As I reflect on this, clearly Governor Aycock made
contributions to education and established a clear framework here in the
state of North Carolina, but on the other hand, whether the result of
political pressure or a product of time, I acknowledge that I would not
have served in the general assembly during that time simply because of
my race. For this reason, I believe we must always be reminded that we
are sons and daughters of complex times, and yet rich history. It is up
to us, then to write the future textbooks or now, ebooks about North
Carolina which will be the direction, a direct reflection of our service
and what we do and why we come to Raleigh. And we must continue to
search from within as we find words to write and add to this textbook.
Again, there, as I said last February, and I&#39;ll be very clear,
there&#39;s been no mandates from any political party. Obviously not the
Democratic party, not the Republican party alone, not third parties.
Therefore I conclude that it&#39;s up to all of us to see the obligation
to meet therefore, the challenges of the time in which is, is before us.
Last session, there was discussion after the resolution, and we&#39;ve
passed a resolution unanimously, but he question was about, well, we
have record number of African Americans now in the general assembly. I
must admit that many in the African American community and others, at
times, yes we use numbers to reflect success. We have 11 now versus four
or seven or three, but you know as I really think about this, and I try
to understand it better, if history holds true, and we&#39;re just
counting numbers, perhaps a good deed was done. But on the other hand,
as I wrestle with this, I don&#39;t know that very, just sheer numbers
are the very indication of success alone. Why? In reality, there could
be 50 members of the North Carolina general assembly, all African
Americans. Is that success? I don&#39;t believe so. It&#39;s not
diverse, if anything, and it&#39;s not inclusive. Well, then I&#39;m
compelled to believe that the only true way to then measure success, it
must be the measure of our hearts and how we truly embrace one another.
While numbers may matter, or at least we place significance, there&#39;s
nothing that matters more than a loving heart. The Scripture tells us,
love the Lord with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all
your mind. This is the first and the greatest commandment, but then
what&#39;s after that? It goes on to say, and the second is like it
  </p>

  <p id="15:00">
  Love your neighbor as yourself. All the law and the profits hang on
these two commandments, so I must believe then that when our hearts may
match our numbers, whatever that number is, then there&#39;s a true
reward that&#39;s waiting for us, not in this chamber, but at a greater
place when the words can be said, well done. So during this recognition
of black history month.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, excuse me, points of personal privilege are, are three minutes
by your own rules, and you&#39;re well over six. You can keep on going,
go ahead, go ahead and conclude. I just want you, if you could go ahead
and wrap it up please. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister president. During this recognition of black history
month, we are reminded of these commandments, and as we hold onto these
commandments, there will be no doubt in my mind that North Carolina will
indeed be better off, and that our history will, indeed, reflect such.
As to transition of ?? name was a defining moment for Eastern North
Carolina and our university? We too will face defining moments as
members of this chamber, and we must strive as part of our challenge,
then to look and then to embrace the future. To hold onto the words that
tomorrow starts here, and in essence, black history month to me is not
about holding onto the past, but actually about embracing the future
together. My dear colleagues, it&#39;s indeed our, an honor to serve,
truly an honor to serve with each and every one of you and to write this
book together of North Carolina&#39;s history. I leave you with these
words penned, in closing, with William from William Gaston. Then, let
all those who love us, love the land that we live in, as happy region as
on this side of Heaven, where the plenty and peace, love and joy smile
before us. Raise aloud, raise together the heart thrilling chorus.
Hurrah, hurrah, the old north state forever. Hurrah, hurrah, the good
old north state. May God bless you. May God bless your families. Thank
you for listening, and may God bless the old north state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Any other notices or announcements? Any further
business to come before the Senate? If not, the chair recognizes Senator
Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister President. I move that the Senate do now adjourn
subject to the standard stipulations set forth in Senate rule 24.1 and
the ratification of bills to reconvene on Tuesday, March 3, 2015 at 2
PM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion is that the Senate now adjourn subject to the standard
stipulations and the ratification of bills and resolutions to reconvene
Tuesday, March 3 at 2 PM. Seconded by Senator Apodaca. All in favor say
aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it. Senate stands adjourned.
