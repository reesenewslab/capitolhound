Members will take their seats. Visitors will retire from the chamber.
The Sergeant at Arms has closed the doors. Members and visitors will
please silence all electronic devices. The prayer will be offered by
Representative Michael Wray.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let us pray. Dear Lord, we give thanks for this day and the many
blessings you have bestowed upon us. We ask for your guidance for the
leaders of our state and our country. We pray, God, that you direct them
to the right decisions for all citizens they represent. We ask that you
heal those that are sick and suffering and give comfort and strength to
those that have lost loved ones. We ask that you be with those less
fortunate than ourselves. We pray, God, that each of us this day and
every day and help us make the right decisions for our lives. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Pledge of Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to
the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.
Representative Murry is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, the journal for August 6th has been examined and found to
be correct. I move that it be approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry moves that the journal for August 6th be approved
as written. Those in favor will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those opposed say no. They ayes appear to have it. The ayes have it. The
journal is approved as written.
Petitions, memorials, or papers address to the General Assembly or the
House? There are none. Chapter bills will be noted. Notices and
announcements. First, before I do that, I’d like to extend the
courtesies of the floor or gallery to a Representative’s wife, Cory
Wray? Kay Wray. Where are you Miss Wray? Welcome.
And unless there’s objection, I’ve extended the courtesies of the chair
to grandson number five, Mr. Tobin Stam. Any objections? His great
grandfather was a chaplain of the House in 1995. Notices and
announcements?
Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. For an announcement after a question about
session on the 14th. Do you have the schedule…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Question regarding, do you have the schedule for the 14th and any
estimation of whether it will be a two day session?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The potential motion to adjourn would be for four o’clock on Thursday
and if you’ll just give me just a second. Representative Hall, as far as
we know, there’ll be no votes on Thursday, but if you will stay tuned
and if I find that there will be votes on Friday, I will personally let
you know as soon as I know. And will give you at least 48 hour notice
when there will be votes, if any.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question for session starting at 12 on Thursday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. Four o’clock on Thursday. And that will be a skeleton session. No
votes. And we will give you personally 48 hours notice if there’s to be
votes on the subsequent day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you, Mr. Speaker, for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please, you are recognized for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to update the notice to Democratic caucus. We were scheduled to
meet an hour before session on Thursday. We will not be meeting an hour
before session on Thursday as it is a non-voting session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Other announcements? If none, Representative Murry is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I move that the House adjourn subject to ratification of
bills and resolutions, messages from the Senate, committee reports,
conference reports, re-referral of bills and resolutions, appointment of
conferees, introductions of bills and resolutions and modifications to
calendar, to reconvene on Thursday, August 14th at 4 PM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry moves, seconded by Representative Holley, that the
House adjourn subject to ratification of bills and resolutions, messages
from the Senate, committee reports, conference reports, re-referral of
bills and resolutions, appointments of conferees, introduction of bills
and resolutions, and modifications to the calendar to reconvene
Thursday, August 14th at 4 PM. Those in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed say no. They ayes have it and the House stands adjourned.</p>
