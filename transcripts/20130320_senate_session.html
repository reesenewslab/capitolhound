[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth a report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forward your report. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] North Carolina General Assembly Select Committee on
UNC Board of Governors, to Members of the Senate from Tom Apodaca,
Chair. General Select Committee on UNC Board of Governors, RE University
of North Carolina Board of Governors nominee, date March 20, 2013.
Pursuant to Senate resolution 46, this minute as amended by the Senate
resolution 141, the Senate Select Committee on UNC Board of Governors
has met and voted on the following slate of candidates to be submitted
to the Senate. The Senate will elect eight individuals from the slate to
serve on the University of North Carolina Board of Governors.
**S. Lawrence Davenport, nominating senator, Senator Brown; Jim
??Yakuman, Senator Daniel;
William Kotis, III, Senator Wade; Scott Lampe, Senator Soucek; David N.
Levinson, Senator Rabin; Steven B. Long, Senator Barefoot; Joan G.
MacNeill, Senator Apodaca; Robert Hill Mulkey, Senator Barringer;
Therence O. Pickett, Senator Brunstetter; Robert Sterling Rippy, Senator
Goolsby; Harry Leo Smith, Jr., Senator Pate; John Craig Souza, Senator
Brown; R. David Sprinkle, Senator Tillman; Steve Franklin Warren,
Senator Tucker; Linda Faye Tate Williams, Senator Robinson; Michael
??Whiton Wilford, Senator Meredith.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca is recognized to explain the procedure
for the election of the University of North Carolina Board of Governors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President, Members. I think we're all
familiar with this now, as many of us have been here years before, and
the new folks that are here this time have got to experience this. But
just a little background. This year we received 22 nominees for election
to the UNC Board of Governors. Committee met to consider these nominees,
and produced a slate of 16 nominees to present today to the body. The
Senate is required to consider a ballot containing nominees equal to
twice the number of open slots, therefore we came up with 16. We did go
to the math school at Carolina and they helped us. We have 8 slots to
fill today. You'll see 16 names on the ballot. Before I discuss the
rules, let me give everyone a little heads-up on the process to occur
after the ballots are voted and collected. Without objection, I've
already asked Senator Nesbitt to designate a member of the minority
caucus to join me...</p>

<p id="10:00">
And members of the principal clerk staff to actually count the ballots.
When we have a result, the Senate will electronically vote those names
and then we'll confirm also, with a voice, voice vote. The rules for
today: There will be no nominations from the floor. The 16 names in
front of you are the names you'll have to choose from. Winners must have
a majority of the votes. Senators must mark eight names for their ballot
to be valid. And you also must sign your ballot, for it to be valid. If
the need of a runoff occurs, if eight nominees receive a majority of the
vote, a runoff for unfilled position, if fewer than eight, excuse me. If
fewer than eight nominees receive a majority of the vote, a runoff for
the unfulfilled position will be held among the nominees. The number of
nominees considered in the runoff will be twice the number of positions
to be filled. Last but not least, if there is a tie between two
nominees, or eligible for the, okay, a tie for the last position between
two nominees who are eligible for the next runoff, both nominees shall
be included in the next runoff ballot, even though there will be more
than two nominees for unfilled posi-, for an unfilled position, unless
the deciding vote is cast by the providing, presiding officer in
accordance with 11 section 13, which will not apply because the
presiding officer is also a member. So, let's just hope we don't have a
tie. And we'll leave it at that. I'll be happy to answer any questions.
And while we're doing that, we'll pass out the ballots to each member.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, it would seem to be appropriate once
the ballots are handed out for us to take a recess. Do you have a
suggested amount of time for us to recess while the ballots are being...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we should be able to count in 15 minutes, Mr.
President. I would hope. Madam Clerk. 15 minutes, if we could?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could I have Senator Tillman, Senator Rucho, and
Senator Allran here at my desk to help pass out the ballots, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Once, once the ballots are passed out and collected,
we'll then take a recess for the count.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Senate will come to order. Senator Apodaca is
recognized to report to the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members, I am proud to
announce the accounting firm of Robinson and Apodaca have independently
audited the results of the election, and we're happy to report the
winners as follows: William Cotis?? III, Scott Lampe, Steven B. Long,
Joan G. McNeil, Terrence O. Pickett, Robert Sterling Rippy, Harry Leo
Smith Jr., and John Craig Souza. Mr. President, I move that the body do
hereby electronically vote to approve the winners of the official
ballot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Senate, at this time we will take two
votes. The first will be an electronic vote. The second will be a voice
vote. The question before the body is the election of William M. Cotis
III, Scott Lampe, Steven B. Long, Joan G. McNeil, Terrence O. Pickett,
Robert Sterling Rippy, Harry Leo Smith Jr., and John Craig Souza to the

and it was probably designed to be a simple bill. After session
yesterday, we did have a conversation with D.P.I., and they shared that,
indeed, the data is being collected, monitored, and recorded as it
pertains to at-risk students, as well as monitoring progress and that,
in essence, the data that's being collected and used at this point is
not sitting on a shelf, but is even more extensive than what is before
us here, and therefore they deemed this obsolete. I'm simply standing
before you to say, &quot;Welcome back, Senator Tucker and thanks for
allowing us to object. For those, the willingness to get this clarity,

For personal privilege.

You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. It's been a while since I've stood up to make
any comments on the Senate, and I just wanted to bring a little short
story that I had to tell that happened. This was relative to the
Daylight Savings Time that happened of recent. We had a meeting in
Davidson County in the Thomason Chamber of Commerce. We had to get up at
about 5:00 in the morning to get to the Chamber of Commerce meeting, and
getting up I was stumbling around downstairs, and as you all know we
take pills for various things, blood pressure, and various et cetera. I
have a German Shepherd that weighs about 80 lbs now and the veterinarian
had recommended that we give it some tablets for hip dysplaysia. I
didn't realize I had opened that bottle and gotten one of those pills
out and took it along with a blood pressure pill and something else, but
my wife came down and said, &quot;God blaze! What are you doing taking
Fuzzy's pills? Those pills are expensive, you can't be taking Fuzzy's
pills!&quot; So, I went over to the Chamber of Commerce meeting and told
them that if I started barking or scratching that I was still going to
be okay. I just wanted to share that with everyone and thank you, Mr.
President.
[Speaker changes]
And Senator Bingham, we won't ask you how your hip is.
[Speaker changes]
Mr. President.
