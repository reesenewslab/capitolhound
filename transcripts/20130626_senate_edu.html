<p id="00:00">
Good morning. I'd like to call this meeting to order, so let's go ahead
and take our seats if we could. Let me begin by introducing our
sergeants at arms. We have Billy Fritscher, Steve Wilson, Ashley
Mitkins,  Ed Kessler, and Hal Roach. Steve Wilson will be in the back of
the room if anyone would like to, anyone from the public would like to
speak on any of these bills, please sign up with him. We're limiting it
to two people for and against on a bill and two minutes, but if you have
an interest please get with Steve Wilson. He'll be in the back
momentarily. We want to thank our pages who are working feverishly right
now, so just continue to do your job as I announce you. We've got
Michael Walker from Senator Hartsell, Jacob Dubois from Senator Apodaca,
Jacob Fuqua from Senator Apodaca, Mackenzie Armies from Senator Brock,
A.J. Smith, Senator Hartsell, Taylor Dozier from Senator Brock, and
Ashley King from Senator Brown. Thank you for, not only for your
service, but the work you're doing as we speak. We do have three bills
before us, and we are actually gonna go in reverse numerical order on
these, so we're going from bottom to top, highest number first. And that
would bring us, that would start us with Brass to Class, and we do have
a PCS for that, so if I could have a motion to adopt a PCS, so moved by
Senator Stein, all in favor say aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it, and
we have a PCS before us. We have Representative Murry, I believe, to
come up here, and if you could, and we already discussed this, if you
could just let us know the changes and updates to this. Appreciate it,
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. The, the substance of change to the proposed
committee substitute is that we've renamed the legislation after a,
after corporal, corporal Pruitt Rainey. He was killed in action on July
13, 2008 in the battle of Wanat, Afghanistan. And he wanted to be a
physical education teacher. He wanted to be a PE teacher. And that's
what this bill is about, is to help our well trained and competent
servicemen get into the classroom so they can take that excellent
training and expertise and help teach our children in school.
Substantively, additionally, the it, it provides some student teaching
stipends for, for members of the armed forces to be able to enter into a
new career in teaching, and it reduces the license and requirements for
military veterans who are pursuing a teacher or school administrator
license.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry, we have, do we have some questions or are people
looking for a favorable report? Senator Daniel you have a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. I guess for Representative Murry I just
wondered, did you have to come up with the title that rhymed so you
could get it past the House?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, whatever helps, whatever helps. But this passed, I believe
unanimously, and I don't think it was because of the rhyme.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Senator Jenkins is, was making a motion to a favorable report but if
we have any questions before that, I'll entertain them. Senator Davis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chair, thank you, and to the members, I just wanna let you know
this, I believe is a terrific bill. It's, in many ways a reflection of
my own, of my own career path, having served in the air force and then
going into education, and I think many others, and I just think this is
an outstanding bill and also glad to see a, also a former air force
academy person standing in with all these west point people today. So I
do ask everyone for your support on this bill today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say this has been a collaboration with the Department of Public
Instruction. Doug Taggert and Rachel have been extremely helpful. The
North Carolina Chamber of Commerce has been interested in this
legislation as well as the Association of Educators and the, the
Professional Educator Association as well. So it's been a very
collaborative effort, and I appreciate all those involved. And
Representative Whitmire has been an excellent resource for me. I'm not a
military guy, but he's told me, I've learned more about military
certifications through Representative Whitmire than I thought I'd ever
learn as a House member.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well thank you. We do have a motion for a favorable report. Any further
questions? Seeing none, this is a motion for a favorable to the PCS,
unfavorable to the original bill. And all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed no. And the ayes have it, and the motion passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you members of the committee. Thank you Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Curtis, okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wonderful, Senator Curtis will head on down to the Senate floor. The
next bill before us we've got is 269, Children Disabilities. We have
Representative Jones. Now we do have a PCS</p>

<p id="05:00">
guess i need a motion for adopted pcs. Senator newton all in favor aye,
opposed no, the ayes have it and the pcs is before us. Rpresentative
Jones your recognized to explain this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] mrs chairman, members of the commitee i stand fbefore
you again and i know that we have discussed this bill before but just as
a way of reminder this is the children with disabilities scholarship
grants bill. It is current law that the general assembly passed two
years ago that children with disabilities may recieve tax credits, or
families with children with disabilities will recieve educational tax
credits up to 3000 dollars per semester for tuition and special
education and related services for each eligible dependent child who is
a resident of north carolina and so forth. What this bill would do would
be to basically change that to a scholarship grant so what it really
does is extend this oppurtunity to the poor citizens if you will. Those
that dont necessarily pay that amount of money in taxes, would still be
able to recieve the scholorship grants, that is the gist of the change,
its pretty simple, and i would be happy to stand for any questions, i
think qwe have other bill sponsors on the way, including representative
Stan who is probably more able to explain than i am, but we will give it
our best, and there may be some others that wish to speack mr chairman
but i will be happy to stand for any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] great thank you representative Jones, do we have any
questions or comments from members. I do have a motion for a favorable
report, but what we will do is do some quesitons so we will hold that.
Senator Portman please
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes thank you mr chairman, when we havd the
discussion, i had been asked by some of my constituents to try to
deteermine how many possible studentys will be served about this, is
this a limit, can this be a limited number of students that recieve
these grants. Just based onj the age, the number of years that a student
could attend under this grant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator if i may
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The bill does not limit to the number of people that
reciece it but they would have to be eligible under current law
basically, but i would be happy to defer that to staff
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes go ahead
[SPEAKER CHANGES]What is the total amount of funding for these grants,
scholarships?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]It would be 6,000 dollars in a year, up to 3,000
dollars per semester, up to 6,000 dollars per year
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Chris Norstrom do you have any information regaurding
that question that you could add?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Sure Chris Norstrom from fiscal research. Senator
parmen given your question the number of students who woulkd be limited
by the dollars available so there is i believe aproximately 3 million
available for the first round for when they convert to scholarships, so
the number of scholarships would be liumited based on the 3 million
dollars available that first year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]If i could just add one thing , that dollar amount is
designed so as to keep the size of the program consistent with what we
have seen within the tax credit program created by hoiuse bill 344 in
2011, the 3 million is not meant to be an expansion of the program,. its
just meant ot be a continuation of the program as it currently exists.
Just switching from a tax credit to a scholarship
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you do you have a followup
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes and this may be for staff. So your saying the
funding amount is 3 million dollars. I think the concern from my
constituent was that if a student starts is currently in sixth grade and
this grant followed him through high school and till they are 21, that
would be a way that other students couldnt get in if say we had a number
of students that continued on these grants. Each year, the same students
will be eligible to recieve the grant, is that correct? as long as they
are in school
[SPEAKER CHANGES]If they recievd the year the prior year, assuming they
meet the other eligibility criteria, they could continue the grant.
Ofcourse the general assembly could always.</p>

To get it after they document it.
[Speaker Change]
??
[Speaker Change]
But my third question would be. If it came to be that there was some
misrepresentation fraud, something where it was not the person actually
didn't do what they were supposed to do. Do we have a way to get the
money back?
[Speaker Change]
The change. May I answer?
[Speaker Change]
Yes please.
[Speaker Change]
The change is that instead of Department of Revenue treating it as a
matter of tax fraud, it's a matter of SEAA which is a long standing
state education assistance authority. Then I don't know for what it's a
right word, but approving receipts and proof and if you look on page 2
lines 44 to 47 of the bill. If a parent fails to cooperate with
verification efforts they should revoke the award. Now that's for the
income eligibility and if they don't produce proper documentation of the
expenses, they just don't give em the money
[Speaker Change]
Follow up.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up.
[Speaker Change]
What if the documentation is later found to be somehow inadequate,
fraudulent?
[Speaker Change]
The state would have a claim against that parent for the amount of, just
like all other fraudulent activity.
[Speaker Change]
OK, one other follow up.
[Speaker Change]
One thing I wanna be careful about though is we have a bill before us
and we're not talking about existing law we wanna make sure we keep on
topic as ?? to the bill before us. And we're starting to go towards
important things, but things that are current law, and that may not be
appropriate here. So let's be careful on that.
[Speaker Change]
Well I was trying to set the stage for that by explaining Mr. Chair just
by way of standing up for myself. I was trying to set the stage by
explaining what I knew about the current law and trying to get a clarity
on how the new law compares. So I was asking about the new law, the
current bill before.
[Speaker Change]
OK let's go ahead.
[Speaker Change]
?? law not the old law. I was only using that as a reference point.
[Speaker Change]
Let's go ahead with your question.
[Speaker Change]
My final question in this new arrangement. Is there any standard of
accountability for the provider, whoever is providing these services? Is
there any monitoring of that? Do they have to meet any kind of
improvement goals? Is there any requirement that we have, that the state
be assured that these services are at least comparable or accomplishing
the goals for the child?
[Speaker Change]
No different than current law. And that would be of course if they're
not providing the proper education for their child then you have truancy
laws, you have abuse and neglect laws. What the bill does is not change
any of that. What the bill does 99% of what it does is take a program
that is only available to parents who pay income tax and make it
available to parents who don't pay income tax. It's expanding Senator
Bryant the existing program to the children of the poor, that's what
this bill does. There's a couple other minor technical changes, but
that's what the bill does.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Stein and then Senator Panger.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I thought we just heard from staff that there's
actually no expansion. And it's the same number of children served this
year.
[Speaker Change]
They're now in the pool that they can qualify.
[Speaker Change]
Follow-up.
[Speaker Change]
As Senator Parmon noted if you're in 6th grade, you get in 7th grade,
and you get it in 8th grade. So the only way to achieve what you said is
to dramatically expand the amount of money that's put behind this and
that is not in this bill.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Stein.
[Speaker Change]
It doesn't require dramatic expansion it just puts them on a equal
footing with the others.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Barringer.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I'd like to ask a tax question. I'm trying to
understand the interplay and perhaps I've oversimplified in my own mind.
I wanna just make sure I understand. The interplay between the current
tax credit and this scholarship grant they're mutually exclusive, you
get one or the other. And then is there any income for example, if you
were a high income earner already getting the credits, and the next year
you decide you'd rather do the application. Could you go in that way? Or
how do they interplay?
[Speaker Change]
Yeah you don't have an option for the current year’s tax credits and
then the next year it's scholarships. But there are, and this is why
there's some additional money required for the bill for the first couple
years. There are people who qualify for the tax credit but had to have a
carry forward for their credit because they just didn’t', they had
income but not enough income. So essentially part of the</p>

cost of this bill is paying for the program in prior years, but the
program in prior years saved money, but your just getting some of the
cost in this year
[change speaker]
follow up one
[change speaker]
follow up
[change speaker]
so what your saying is that they'll all be put in the same pool going
forward, so that it would be the folks, the haves, and the ones who are
in need will all be in the poool together
[change speaker]
and this is really important also, because of change in federal tax law,
the fiscal cliff, ya'll remember that bill, reduced the ammount of
credits that special needs parents could get for this kind of education.
So this is partially making for that change in federal tax law, I know
your a tax expert so you may be familiar with that
[change speaker]
senator brownch you have a question?
[change speaker]
thank you mr chairman, representative stam, im trying to work some
numbers on 3 million it looks like, at roughly 6000 a year, thats 500
kids if you do the math i guess you could say and im trying to figure
out, and I know that could vary, I understand that, but I would think
theres going to be a lot more than 500 kids that may want to take
advantage of this, i'm just trying to think, how do you pick and choose,
how are you going to decide who gets it and who doesnt?
[change speaker]
excellent question, the average in the prior years has been about 2500
per child, now the ones that go to private schools, presumably for the
full year will take the full 6000, but this particular program was also
available to homeschool kids, and in a lot of cases they will not get
the full 6000, because they don't get it for the homeschool, they only
get it for the actual services obtained, the educational services that
their reinbursed for, so many cases they get 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and
not the full ammount, but to answer your question, I hope we spend
100000000 on it ten years from now if it works, I have never gotten,
I've never passed a program to representative jones and he'll testify
we've never had a program we got so many postive love letters from
parents, but also complaining hate letters from parents who didn't
qualify, because they didn't have the right income limitation or for
some other reason. This is making a real difference in the lives of
children who need it.
[change speaker]
Senator, just a follow up real quick mr chairman
[change speaker]
yes follow up
[change speaker]
I guess thats the concern I have, I think families are going to really
take advantage of this, I think a lot of families, I think what you'll
find is once a family gets on, you're not going to get them off, I think
they are going to love the program, so expanding the program I think
will be a true program, as it becomes a budget item, i think thats the
issue im trying to get my arms around, how are you going to do that?
[change speaker]
representative jones?
[change speaker]
mr chairman, if I could just speak to that, I look at this to, i really
think this is a win, win, win situation, we've pointed out and the big
win quite honestly is for the student and for their families, but this
is a win for the taxpayers and its a win for the public schools, because
the 6000 dollars is less than we're paying now per student in the public
school system and certainly its a win for taxpayers. When representative
stans says &quot;I hope this goes to 100,000,000&quot;, I don't think he
should take that to mean that I hope we're adding this much more to the
budget, I think thats going to be saving taxpayers money in the long
run, and its going to save the public schools money, because they are
not going to be having paying the expenses that they currently pay for
that student, that is right now in the public schools, I think thats an
important fiscal net for ya'll to appreciate.
[change speaker]
chairman
[change speaker]
yes, senator tillman
[change speaker]
a lot of works been done on this, and a lot of folks think this is a
good idea, and I don't see it costing additional dollars if we're giving
them less than it costs the state to educate this child, I make a motion
for favorable report
[change speaker]
so we have a motion for a favorable report, but i did have two questions
and a member of the public, so if we could ask questions briefly,
because we do have another bill and then we'll move to the public and go
to a vote
[change speaker]
thank you mr chair, I do have two and they arent about the total cost, I
just want a clarification on one and I have another one. You mention
that the tax credit is based on income, but this would be regardless of
income, is that right? Clarify in terms of that
[change speaker]
thats right, but the tax credit is an opposite income eligibility</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, as I said, 99% of the bill is what is explained. There is a couple
of changes. One change is that they only have to be in the…remember the
published school is a gatekeeper to give the I.E.P. Under current law,
they have to be in public school a year to get the I.E.P., under this
bill, a semester. So that is a slight change.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The ayes have it, and the motion passes. Thank you very much for your
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. And, Senator Tillman will carry that on the floor. And final
one before say is House Bill 250. We read…a motion for a PCS do we have
a motion? I do from Senator Newton. All in favor aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed no. The ayes have it. The PCS is before us and Representative
Hardister, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. House Bill 250. This
bill, there's two sections to the bill. And if you don't mind I'll
briefly discover the two sections, I'll make this as brief as possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cook do you have a-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Why don't we go over the bill and then we'll offer that amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'll make this very brief. Essentially section
one just gives charter schools more flexibility in how they conduct
enrollment procedures. Section two allows charter schools more
flexibility in how they expand grade levels. And Section one basically
we're expanding the definition of siblings to include half and step
siblings and so this way whenever a sibling applies to a charter school
their half and step siblings can apply together, get into the charter
school through the lottery, but only if the siblings live in the same
household. We're allowing charter schools to give enrollment priority to
the children of all full time employees, but these children cannot
exceed 10% of the school's enrollment. And we're also allowing
enrollment priority for a student who leaves a charter school for a
period of less than two years but only if they leave to study in a state
special academic program which is defined in the bill. Or if they child
leaves the school as a result of their parents having to relocate due to
vocational opportunity. As I said, Section two essentially just gives
charter schools more flexibility in how they expand grade levels and
that's laid out very clearly in the bill summary if you have it in front
of you. With that, Mr. Chairman, I'd be glad to take questions and I do
know that Senator Cook has an amendment to send forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, let's, has the amendment been passed out. It's being finalized and
being passed out. Senator Cook, you are recognized to explain the
amendment. Let's handle that first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to let the bill's sponsor explain it if he would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Representative Hardister.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Cook. Mr. Chairman, essentially, this amendment, this
was brought to me from one of my colleagues in the house, Representative
Dennis Riddell who is here today. And, what this pertains to is when a
child goes into a charter school and their surname sibling which we're
actually expanding the definition of that in of siblings and how they
enter charter schools in this bill, but essentially what this does is if
the children are years apart, like say they're 10 or 12 years apart the
siblings are, and older sibling attends a charter school, completes the
highest grade level, and has been at that school for at least four years
then the younger sibling, who would not be enrolled at that school at
the same time, would be given priority enrollment to enter that school.
That's essentially what it does and I do know that Senator Wade is going
to run this amendment for me this morning. She couldn't be here. So I
appreciate Senator Cook allowing me to send out that forward and I'd be
glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman does give a motion for a favorable report. Do we have
any questions? We have Senator Clark.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, a clarification on this amendment. Are we basically creating alumni
status? That if you have an alumni of the school, their family gets in?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hardister?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman -
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p id="35:00">
I don’t see it that way. I will trust the wisdom of the committee. Again
I think that the situation, Senator, is if you have children who are
close to the same age and they were being in school at the same time
then that’s one situation where the children can be together as a
household but sometimes parents have children that are years apart where
they would not be in school at the same time. To me it seems sensible to
allow them to have...but the way the bill is written, the elder sibling
would have to complete the highest grade and be there for at least four
years so to me it’s sensible to…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Clarification or follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So we’re basically saying there isn’t a sibling
enrolled at that time. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry could you restate the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you saying that for the consideration of a younger
sibling who actually doesn’t have a sibling enrolled at the school?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct. The siblings would not be enrolled at
the same time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks. I understand the siblings at the same time
because you are driving. You have to take your kid to one school then if
you take the one kid to one school and then you inconvenience the other
child and the parent by having to shuffle to multiple schools but
charter school slots are filled by lottery and it’s something that
everybody should have an equal chance to attend and if the inconvenience
part is no longer a factor because the original child is out of the
school then it really is an alumni provision and I don’t know that we
should be giving entitlement to families because they got lucky once
that they should have an advantage over somebody else who might want to
get luck five years later. I just don’t think that it’s fair and
consistent with the purposes of the charter schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Hardister.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Senator I understand that
concern.  Again, I can see this both ways but personally, I think that
it’s a good amendment that will just allow those parents to put their
child through the same school that way the education can be uniform.
Gives parents a little more flexibility and, if I’m not mistaken, I may
ask staff to clarify for me but this does not require charter schools do
this, it just gives them the flexibility to the board of directors to
choose whether or not they want to do it this way. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff would you comment on it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff affirms that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator do you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman. Just a brief comment. I would
say that we have really come a long way when we have reached a point
where Senator Stein acknowledges that it is a lucky family who is able
to escape the traditional public school and go to a charter school.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have that in 49 counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [laughs]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like just one brief comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I always been in favor of giving parents the choice
and I don’t think that escaping public school is quite the right
characterization. If somebody wants to apply, they should have an equal
shot to it and my point earlier is that it should be an open shot to
everybody and so that if somebody wants to do it, it shouldn’t be about
transportation and food and all that, as Senator Tillman remembers. What
we’re doing is we’re just giving an advantage to somebody because they
got lucky once and that just doesn’t seem right to me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Senator Tillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to see how Senator Stein votes on these charter
bills when they come to the floor and see how big of a supporter he is
or he is not and I’ll be noting that as I always do his votes. They’re
interesting to me. Secondly, how in the world many could this be talking
about? Families now don’t have more than two or three kids.  Normally
they’re not 16 or 18 kids and how many are going to complete four years?
We’re talking about a very miniscule number and it’s very sort of a
harmless bill. I think we ought to vote it one way or the other and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. We do have a motion before us. All in favor
of the motion to put in the amendment say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’ll say the ayes have it. Thank you. We have a
motion before us for a favorable report to the bill. Any questions
regarding that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Who PCS…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry
[SPEAKER CHANGES] …as amended, in favorable to the written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. Any further questions? We do have members
of the public who we’d like to hear from. I see nothing from members. I
will first have Leon Winter, if you’ll step up please, identify yourself
and you have…</p>

Two minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, I'm Leanne Winner with the North Carolina School Boards
Association. I had not planned to speak on this bill today until the PCS
came out. We had no issue with the bill as it came over from the House,
but we do have some issues beginning on line 47 of page three of the
bill, which is the part that allows the charter schools to grow without
going back to the state board of education, and specifically we have
concerns about little three I, there doesn't seem to be a four, and then
on page four, five, and six. What this would do is it would allow
charter schools to expand their grades without going back to the state
board of education for approval. This could have a vast and profound
impact on your small and mid-sized districts. This is, this immediately
would probably have effect in Pamlico County where an application to
grow their grade spanned for High School for their charter school at a
Arapahoe was denied this year. It is in court right now. I know that the
representative of the office of charter schools, Joel Medley, is here if
there are questions about that, but that was denied specifically because
of the profound impact it would have on the LEA. They were gonna have to
shut down their high school if that was approved. So we would ask that
those three parts be removed from this bill, and then we would have no
objection to the bill. I'd be happy to answer any questions, mister
Chairman, if there are any.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Great thank you Ms. Leanne.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We want to thank Leanne Winner, she's always up on these issues.
However, if you believe in choice, if you believe in the marketplace, if
you believe that the kids will go the place that meets their needs, then
the parents will take them the place that meets their needs, some school
systems are gonna be adversely affected. Yes, in poor, rural, small
school systems they will be elected. Why would a charter set up in those
districts? It's very simple. They set up there because they know that
they can offer something that the parents need and want for their
children. That's why we have choice. That's why I think that section of
the bill is okay, and I don't think they have to go back for approval. I
think that the market will determine whether those public schools or the
charter schools survive.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. We do have another member of the public. Please identify
yourself. Two minutes, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. Debbie Clary with the North Carolina Alliance
for Public Charter Schools, and I'm also the chairperson of a charter
board in Cleveland County for Pinnacle Classical Academy. Senator
Tillman just stole my comments there, so that shortened them quite a bit
Senator, but we do support this section of the bill because it is a
cumbersome process as you come back, and what you're really doing is
you're serving your families as they've reached the sixth grade, and you
have a K through sixth charter school, then you need to have your child
at that charter school and you need to expand to that seventh grade and
the seventh and eighth grade. And it is a very cumbersome process to
come back to do that expansion if your initial charter was only for the
K through sixth, or a K through four, for example. And I think many of
the charters applying now are learning to, as mine did, to apply for K
through twelve to begin with. But some of the older charters are caught
up in this, so basically it's trying to catch up some of the older
charters that need to keep their children and keep continuity with those
families. Thank you mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Do we have any further member, comments from the members.
Seeing none, we do have a favorable report to the PCS as amended,
enrolled into a new PCS, unfavorable to the original bill, favorable to
the new PCS. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The ayes have it and the motion passes and thank you for your time. The
meeting is adjourned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman, members of the committee.</p>
