  They we go.  Ladies and gentlemen, your one minute warning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It took you two minutes to give the one minute
warning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Now you got it on, turn it off.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee of Finance, Committee will come to order.
Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d like to welcome you all here to the Finance
Committee, like to introduce our Sergeant-at-Arms today.  First, Reggie
Sills. Marvin Lee, Terry McGraw, Chris McKraken, and staff we have here
with us today is Heather Phenell, did I pronounce that right, C.D.
Everitt and Trina Griffon.  At the request of the bill&#39;s sponsor,
House Bill 40 is being displaced, so we have before us House Bill 41,
and the Chair recognizes Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We have a PCS that was
properly noticed, I&#39;d like to move the PCS-B before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So noted, will you second?  If not objected, PCS is
properly before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The original bill on the
revenue law&#39;s technical changes came out of revenue laws in 2014,
there were two versions, a Senate and a House version.  Both were
hijacked for other purposes, in fact, the last iteration that was on the
floor was House Bill 1224 which had a less than stellar reception, so
these technical corrections were left over.  Since then there were a few
more minor corrections which were included in the technical corrections
amendment that was included in your packet on Tuesday.  The purpose of
today&#39;s PCS was to roll the technical corrections amendment into the
technical corrections bill.  Staff has also discovered that there was
one other problem that has been brought to us by the public staff of the
General Assembly, or the public staff of the Utilities Commission, so we
have a technical corrections amendment to the technical corrections PCS
to the technical corrections bill, so we&#39;re gonna be technical
today.  I think Representative Hager was going to offer that, but in his
absence I would like to put forth the Amendment ATD-6d1, and ask staff
to explain that.  We also have representatives of the public staff and
the director here today for questions if necessary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] With the amendment before us, would staff please brief
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you.  The amendment should be at your desk,
it does say Representative Hager, but Representative Brawley has agreed
to run this.  This is a change to section four of the bill, this is one
of the new sections, it was not included last year.  As you recall in
2013 the General Assembly passed 2013-316, which is commonly referred to
as the Tax Reform Act, and in that bill the franchise tax on electricity
 and piped natural gas was repealed and it was replaced with a sales
tax.  However, that bill also did other tax changes, including lowering
the corporate income tax rate.  The bill directed the Utilities
Commission to pass on the savings from the repeal of the franchise tax
onto the rate payers.  The commission did that in May of 2014, it also
passed on the savings from the corporate income tax to rate payers.
However, in October of 2014, the commission reverse its first order and
allowed the utilities to retain the savings from the corporate income
tax and not pass that onto rate payers.
What this bill does is it clarifies that it was the intent of the
General Assembly to pass through those savings and the taxes to the rate
payers.  So what the amendment does is it adds more language to that
same statute to make it clearer that it was the intent of the General
Assembly back in 2013 to make that change, that&#39;s the first change
you see in lines 1 through 6.   The second change lines 8 through 14
just adds language to clarify that the tax here that we&#39;re talking
about goes back to tax year 2014.  So that&#39;s the amendment and how
it relates to section four of the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion, further debate of the
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a question for staff related to that.  Does the
second part of what she just explained mean that our rate payers are
going to get some kind of retroactive reimbursement for what the
Utilities Commission has allowed the utilities to withhold from them,
basically contrary to our will for 2014?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Representative Collins, I should note that all
the electric public utilities except for Dominion, and all of the
natural gas utilities are already passing on these savings.  There&#39;s
only one utility that&#39;s not doing this and that is Dominion, and if
this were to be enacted, the commission would open a docket and they
would refund the over collection from that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion, further questions?

  The amendment is properly before us. All in favor say aye. All opposed.
The amendment carries. Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister chairman. At this point, I&#39;d like for staff to
explain the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister chairman. Heather and I will tag team on this. As you
know, from being in, in the general assembly, the revenue laws committee
typically has a technical bill. This technical bill is from last year.
It&#39;s one of the first times it hasn&#39;t actually been enacted, so
many of these changes in this bill have some retroactive effective dates
because they were seeking to clarify things that you did in the last
biennium. Most of the sections in here are purely technical, deleting
obsolete references, changing references, but Heather and I will note
the few that are a little more involved. In section one, you will recall
that last year you passed a bill that made changes in regards to
retailer contractors. This section just makes it clear that the
legislation is prospective only. Section two is also clarifying
something that you did last year. If you recall, the golf tournament
that was in Southern Pines and the occupancy tax statutes and their
applicability to private residences. You passed a law pertaining to
that. Section two just clarifies that it, it does only apply to private
residences.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section four is the section I discussed with the amendment. I won&#39;t
add anything unless we have further questions. Section five is regarding
the new tax on vapor products that becomes effective June 1, 2015 that
was enacted by the general assembly last year. What this does is it
makes it clear that manufacturers in North Carolina who are
manufacturing vapor products can continue to collect the tax on vapor
products they sell on the internet without being required to collect the
tax on retail sales. Typically the retail sales tax is collected by the
wholesaler or the retailer. So it relieves the manufacturer of that tax,
but that tax will be collected. Section six clarifies when the credit
for renewable energy property can be taken. The federal credit relies on
the credit, just states that the property must be placed in service. The
state credit states that the credit must be placed in service by the
taxpayer, and this has created some confusion, so this conforms with
current Department of Revenue practice, and it allows, whether the
lessor or the lessee places it in service, the credit may be taken by
the taxpayer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moving down to section 13, this has to do with the exemption for
farmers, the sales tax exemption for farmers. As you recall in the tax
reform legislation, there was an income requirement added, so that to be
eligible for that exemption, a person had to have at least $10,000 of
income from farming operations to qualify as a farmer for purposes of
that sales tax exemption. Section 13 makes several clarifying changes.
The first thing it does is to say that in determining whether or not
that $10,000 threshold has been met, it will include sales plus all
other amounts used to determine farm income. We realized when we looked
at the federal farm that it&#39;s not, it&#39;s based on net sales
instead of gross sales, so this just says it&#39;s based on gross sales
plus any other income. So this in fact makes it easier to reach that
income limit. Second, it clarifies that the exemption expires upon the
earlier of a person ceasing to be involved in farming or when they fail
to meet the income requirement for three consecutive years. It makes a
similar change with your conditional exemption certificate for new
farmers. It also provides for those new farmers who have a conditional
exemption certificate, they are supposed to show, each year, their
federal return, and right now it requires that they give that return
within 90 days of when the tax year ended or by April 15. This just says
that that would also include a time for extensions, make that clear.
Third, it makes a change to it when it has to do with contractors,
performance contractors. In the old sales tax laws, there was an
exemption that if you built, if you were a performance contractor and
you built a facility for a farmer, then the materials you bought were
exempt. Now that we have the income limit, we learned that when
contractors went to use that exemption, they couldn&#39;t. So what this
does is to provide that whoever&#39;s building that building for the
farmer isn&#39;t, may use the farmer&#39;s exemption number to buy the
materials, and it also provides that for everybody who&#39;s paid sales
tax in the meantime, there&#39;s a refund process put into place.
We&#39;ll move to section 17. Last

  ...last year the legislature provided for the central assessment of
mobile telecommunications property for property tax purposes. As you
know, property is typically valued at the county level, but that
property has become so involved that there was a policy decision made to
move the assessment of that property to the state level through the
property tax division. There was no intent in making that change to
shift the value among the counties, and so what this does is that it
provides that, once the department determines the value, it will
allocate that value among the counties where the property is located.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 18 is regarding the privileges tax. Cities have been prohibited
from imposing a privilege tax on utility related businesses. In last
year that specific prohibition language was repealed. Repealing that
prohibition doesn&#39;t mean that they can now impose the tax, but it
has created some questions so this just simply restates that in a
statute to make it crystal clear that they do not have the authority to
impose the franchise or the privilege tax rather on utility related
businesses. Section 19 is also related to the franchise tax on
electricity, pipe natural gas as I discussed earlier. That was repealed
in 2013. Part of that tax is distributed to local governments - to
cities. When the tax is repealed it also repealed the authority to
distribute the last quarter so this makes it clear that the department
of revenue can use the new sales tax revenue, which was the tax that
replaced, the franchise tax and make that final distribution to the
cities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They&#39;re two more sections we&#39;ll just go over briefly for you.
That is Section  22. It repeals a reference to, it removes a reference
to a repealed  statute and in so doing clarifies that the income of a
partnership that is apportionable to multiple states is allocated and
apportioned in accordance with our apportionment formula, and I mention
this to you because of the current statute refers to a ratio rather than
the rules of apportionment and allocations so that has been corrected.
The last section I&#39;ll go over with you is Section 24. This is a
section that has been added in this PCS. It is a section that the Senate
adopted, and the Senate Finance Committee to the companion bill Senate
19. The reason it was added to the bill was there was some time
sensitivity that has to do with the tax treatment of payments received
by airline employees from an airline company when it is in bankruptcy.
The federal government provided that some of the roll over money that
has been put into an IRA would not be subject to tax at the time it is
put into that investment account. It would be taxed when it comes out of
that investment account. By conforming to the code, through the IRC
update which you all are doing, state law conforms to that. However,
Congress acted late. Congress extended the Federal Statute of
Limitations to allow taxpayers to amend their past returns, remove the
money from gross income. This makes a similar change in North Carolina.
It extends our Statute of Limitations to allow those few tax payers, we
know of less than 5 - we only know of 1 or 2 - there&#39;s a very small
number, to file amended returns so their income will be treated the same
at the state level as it is at the federal level otherwise that income
will be taxed twice at the state level: once when it&#39;s put into the
account and again when it&#39;s removed. So this provision extends the
Statute of Limitations for a brief period of time. Anyone who is
effected by this would have to file request for refund by October 15th
of this year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that very detailed information. Are there questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d like to move for a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would appear this is the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move that we approve the proposed committee substitute to House Bill
41, unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As amended by Representative Hager correctly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The full report to PCS. This is a tough one. Why&#39;d you have so many
amendments. Roll into new PCS unfavorable to the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which did it really?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All in favor say, Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
AYE
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed say, No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion carries. All business being conducted. Committee is adjourned.
