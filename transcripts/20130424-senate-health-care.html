Thank you members of the committee, Ladies and Gentleman of the public.
Welcome to our City Committee on Healthcare. I will start by saying that
we will have Open to Public Comment on Senate Bill Four Seventy Three.
You will need to sign up with the Sergeant at Arms in order to speak on
that bill. Comments will be limited to two minutes per individual. As we
begin today I want to start by recognizing our pages this week. We are
going to start with Caleb Sanders Senator Daniel. Thank you. Natalie
Brown Senator Pate. And Briggs Mantis Myself. Thank you. Hope your
having a great week this week. Sergeant at Arms are Ashley Mccinns,
Donna Blake, Billy Fritzer, Ed Kesler and Steve Wilson. Steve was here
somewhere. Thank You. Members of the committee we will begin start by
going through Senate Bill One Thirty Seven. We'll move through that so
we can hold the remainder of the time for Four Seventy Three. Senator
Tillman you will be recognized as ?? bill. Thank you for attending
today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Its good to see this HHS committee. It's one
that I've asked many many times not to be a part of. I can't understand
it, Senator Hise I know you can I'm glad that I'm on education. I
appreciate you hearing my bill first. This bill simply says that if you
are a Medicaid provider in a pharmacy business you will not give away
the prescription medication. What's going on in some places in the state
is that providers, pharmacists are waiving the co-pay on prescription
medications in order to get their business. And that is an unfair
business practice. It does not comply with Federal law, this does. This
makes them responsible if they do that. The penalty is possible loss of
their license to do business with Medicaid and that would be a severe
blow to anyone. There are possibilities of waiving it for someone that's
truly in need. Those are exceptions rather than a rule. In most cases
they are expected to pay and the pharmacist is expected to charge and
collect on those Medicaid prescription drugs. That's basically all the
bill does and I'd be glad to entertain questions if there are any.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before we move to that PCS and Senator Pate will move to bring PCS
before us. All those in favor say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed. The Ayes have it. We have the PCS before us. Any questions or
comments?
Senator Wade has moved for favorable report to the bill. Unfavorable is
to the composed committee so ??. Unfavorable is to the original bill.
Any other comments? Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize for running in a little bit late and first I want to commend
you on having a good bill here Senator ??. Four Seventy Three.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you repeat that son? I didn't hear you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it's a good bill. Good bill. I want to commend you on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator I will let you know that we are on Senate Bill One Thirty Seven.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So we've already gone through-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. We are doing One Thirty Seven first and the remainder of the time
will be on Four Thirty Seven.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize, my thoughts were on the next bill. I didn't know we had
changed the agenda.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator. Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick is a great man. He's the only man I know that has a
question
about a bill while he's in the hall and he asked it when he got here but
he's on the wrong bill today Senator. Very seldom will I catch you in
one like that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other comments on One Thirty Seven? Hearing none all those in favor
committee ?? say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed No? The Ayes have it. We will now move Senate Bill Four Seventy
Three. Senator Rucho will be ?? the bill. We do have a committee
substitute. Senator Rucho will move for the consideration of the post
committee substitute. All those in favor say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed? The bill before us Senator Rucho and Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I know everybody's just waiting for this one. I
think this is a good bill and I think it's had a lot of press and I
think we'll do a lot of good things and I'm sure there will be a lot of
questions so let me just try to get into it. Section One of the bill
just establishes the health care cost-</p>

<p id="05:00">
production and transparency act is basically all that does. In part two
of the bill creates new reporting requirements for hospitals and
ambulatory surgical facilities on pricing for the fifty most common
episodes of care in each of these facilities. It also requires these
facilities make their policies on charity care and their annual
expenditures on charity care, bad debt, and uncompensated care available
to the general public, a posting on their premises and the internet. The
bill charges the North Carolina health information exchange with
publishing on its internet website the information reported by these
facilities on the fifty most common episodes of care. Part three of the
bill prohibits hospitals and A S C's, free standing radiology service
facilities and physicians offices to provide outpatient radiology
services from charging more than eighty percent of the full amount of
certain outpatient radiology services for subsequent radiographs or are
only provided to the patience once during the multiple radiology
session. And I think most of you will remember there's been a lot of
information on this about double billing on some of this and being
charged twice for the set up fees basically. The next piece of the bill
prohibits the U N C health care system and its affiliates and other
schools of medicine, clinical programs, facilities and medical practices
affiliated with one of the constiuent institutions of U N C to provide
medical care to the general public from utilizing set off debt
collection procedures to collect outstanding debts from tax refunds and
lottery winnings of debtors. Only two are allowed to do that. There have
been several bills that have been introduced to allow all of them to do
it so I think that's going to be the debate. If you are going to allow
two to do it, do you allow all of them to do it. We think we shouldn't
allow any of them to do it. That the laws are there to collect and I'm
sure we will have that debate. Part five of the bill establishes fair
billing practices for hospitals and A S C's. These include readily
understandable bills, notice before a bill is sent to collections,
prompt refunds in the event of overpayment and the prohibition in the
use of wage garnishments or for sale of primary residence to collect an
unpaid bill. I think most patients, of course, I think if anybody's been
to a hospital and you get a bill, if you can understand that bill you
are better than I am. I think this will clean that up and try to get
these to where you can at least understand what the charges are. And the
last piece of the bill provides the department of health and human
services may not contract with C C N C unless it makes specific changes
to the board. So what we're trying to do is reorganize that board to, I
think, give a broader input on the issues. That's pretty much what the
bill does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you senator Brown and members of the health committee. This is
another step that the general assembly, and specifically the senate, has
taken- with moving forward last time we worked on health care reform
cost with med mal reform and tort reform, now we're trying to put some
light on the issue of the bills and as senator Brown eluded to, I know
that I received one for a three hour service from my son's surgery. I
probably would have needed a P H D in economics to understand it and
that probably that would have been ??. So what we are trying to do is
get to the point where the consumer, the patient, and the ones that are
paying the bills, whether they are buying health insurance and the like,
have the opportunity to understand and make comparison costs as if you
were going to buy a product elsewhere. You walk into the store and say
what's it cost me. Well then you will have a chance to do something
similar to with health care so that's why it's important that we do move
this forward. And I urge that you support the bill. I think we're going
to let the staff go through ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? ?? as we speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Adam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, senators Brown and ??, have asked me to go
through the bill in detail. As you know, section one sets out the title
of the act which is the health care cost reduction transparency act of
twenty thirteen. We move in then to part two of the bill which is the
transparency and health costs sections. Section one amends the purposes
of the North Carolina H I E to- as one of it's purposes is going to
provide current pricing information about the fifty most common episodes
of care in each hospital and each</p>

?? to a surgical facility on its internet website that is available to
the public.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chair, please translate the acronyms for us H I ?? information
exchange, excuse me. This is an anacronym rich environment here. Section
3 goes on to direct the H I E to publish this data on its internet
website. The second half section 3 part B essentially provides that C C
N C who owns the North Carolina H I E can not sell the data or any
analysis or product derived from the data to a third party. The
information is kept in house. It is the property of the disclosing
facilities and the state. Section 4 amends the North Carolina hospital
licensure act and this is where the guts of the transparency portion
are. A new 131 E 91 point one provides for disclosure on the fifty most
common episodes of care. And an episode of care is defined as all acute
care hospital services related to a health condition with a given
diagnosis from the three day period proceding a patient's first
admission to a hospital including readmissions through the thirty day
period following the patient's discharge from the hospital for treatment
of the health care condition. The term includes acute care, hospital
services, services by heath care providers employed by the hospital,
facility used by health care providers affiliated with the hospital,
ancillary services, room and board, and pharmaceuticals dispensed by a
hospital pharmacy or by a pharmacy owned or controlled by or under
contract with the hospital. The medical care commission is directed to
adopt rules establishing what those fifty most common episodes of care
are. Beginning on march thirty first twenty fourteen, the hospitals are
required to take this data and report, first of all the amount that
would be charged to an uninsured patient for each of the fifty most
common episodes of care if all charges are paid in full without having
an insurer or other third party paying for any portion of those charges.
They shall also report the average negotiated settlement on the amount
charge to an uninsured patient. They are to report the total amount of
medicaid reimbursements for each episode of care including claims and
pro rata supplements, the total amount of medicare reimbursements for
each episode of care and for the five largest health insurers providing
payment to the hospital on behalf of insurers, the range of the total
payments made for each of those fifty most common episodes of care,
hospitals and ?? ?? have to redact the names and identifying information
of the health insurers prior to providing that information. Last of all
there is, to provide the total amount of payments made by the state
health plan for each of the fifty most common episodes of care.
Hospitals are also obligated to provide this information in writing to
an individual who requests that within twenty four hours of receiving
the patient's request. The North Carolina medical care commission is
also charged with adopting rules to ensure that the new reporting
requirements are implemented by January first, twenty fourteen. And that
hospitals uniformly report these pricing information to the North
Carolina H I E. The bill does provide that the reporting requirements of
this section on transparency are not to be construed as requiring
hospitals to participate in the voluntary state wide health information
exchange network that is otherwise administered by the health
information network. The other piece that the hospitals are required to
disclose involves their charity care policies and amounts that are spent
on that care starting in January one, twenty fourteen and annually there
after each hospital must provide an annual disclosure to the public
about its charity care policy and its annual expenditures on charity
care bad debt and uncompensated care for the preceding calendar year.
This information is to be posted on the premises of the hospital in a
public area and available online on the website. Section five of the
bill</p>

Amends the Ambulatory Surgical Facility Licensure Act and provides
parallel provisions for ambulatory surgical facilities.  Section six of
the bill directs DHHS to inform hospitals and Am-Surgs by July 1, of
2013, of the new reporting requirements pertaining to the episodes of
care and charity care.  Section seven excludes from the definition of
competitive healthcare information, the information hospitals and
Am-Surgs are required to report under sections four and five of the
bill.  Section Eight of the bill provides that information hospitals and
Am-Surgs are required to report under four and five, that is included in
the healthcare contract, is not confidential and is considered a public
record under Chapter 132 of the General Statutes.  Moving on to part
three, part three deals with transparency in billing for outpatient
radiological services.  This is section nine of the bill.  And this bill
makes it unlawful for a provider of radiology services to charge more
than eighty percent of the full amount of what are called technical
components of an outpatient radiology imaging procedure, for subsequent
radiographs performed on a patient during a multiple radiology session,
if the provider only provides the technical components once during that
multiple radiology session.  Providers for this section include
hospitals, ambulatory surgical facilities, free-standing radiology
facilities, or a physician’s office, all which offer outpatient
radiology services.  Technical components, which are the things that are
generally only provided once during a session, include clinical labor
and supplies used by the hospital or Am-Surg to perform the imaging.
Clinical labor includes greeting a patient, escorting and positioning
the patient for the radiograph, educating the patient about the services
to be performed, and obtaining the patient’s informed consent for the
services and other things that are associated with the visit.
Contracts, provisions and agreements that purport to require a patient
to pay for these multiple charges are void and unenforceable.  Moving on
to part four of the bill, hospital debt collection, this is section ten
of the bill.  Section ten of the bill essentially says that UNC, or any
school of medicine, clinical program, facility or practice affiliated
with one of the constituent institutions of UNC, that provides medical
care to the general public, will not be able to use set-off debt
collection procedures to collect outstanding debts from debtors’ state
tax refunds and lottery winnings.  Part five of the bill, which is
section eleven, eleven A, B, and C, is what we’ve designated the fair
billing and collections act, and GS 131(E)-91 is amended, to provide
that hospitals and ambulatory surgicals, first of all, non-itemized
bills must contain a statement that a patient has a right to an itemized
statement free of charge, and that the patient may request an itemized
bill at any time within three years, or as long as the hospital or
collections agency is asserting that the debt is still outstanding.  All
bills have to be readily understandable by a patient, if medical codes
or terms are used, the bill must define those terms so that the patient
can follow.  If a patient has overpaid, a hospital or ambulatory
surgical facility has sixty days to issue a refund after receiving
notice of the overpayment.  Patients are not to be billed for charges
which would have been covered by their insurance had the facility
submitted the claim or necessary information within the allotted
timeframe given by the insurance company.  Hospitals and ambulatory
surgical facilities shall not refer an unpaid bill to a collections
agency or other entity while a patient’s application for charity care is
pending.  Hospitals and ambulatory surgical facilities shall provide
written notice to the patient thirty days before referring a bill to a
collection agency.  Facilities that contract with collections agencies
or other entities shall require the collection agency to.</p>

<p id="20:00">
Inform the patient of the hospital or ambulatory surgical facilities,
charity care, and financial assistance policies when engaging in
collections activity. A hospital shall require a collections agency or
other entity to obtain the written consent of the hospital or the ??
before filing a lawsuit to collect the debt, and finally, a hospital
ambulatory surgical facility, collections agency entity, or other
assignee of the facilities shall not use wage garnishment, a lien on a
patient's primary residence, or otherwise force a sale of a primary
residence as a means of collecting an unpaid bill. Section 11B simply
provides a cross-reference to the provisions that I just went over in
the ambulatory surgical facilities licensing act, because these other
provisions are actually put in the hospital licensure act. Section 11C
amends the insurance laws regarding, and requires health benefit plans
to ensure that the patient is provided current and accurate information
on providers' network status through their phone system or any online
system. It also requires a healthcare provider to provide a patient or
prospective patient on request information on the provider's network
status with a particular health plan. Section 6 of the bill deals with
CCNC governance, that's Community Care of North Carolina. This is
section 12. Section 12 prohibits the Department of Health and Human
Services from contracting with CCNC if the, if CCNC does not make
certain adjustments to its bylaws, those bylaws include, and I'm on page
9 of the bill. I don't know if you want me to read them all, but they,
they list the different parties that they would like to see represented
on that board. A health actuary, two representatives of the provider
community, a representative of the health insurance industry, someone
with expertise in health information technology, a business owner or
their designee. The board is also to be adjusted to have two persons
appointed to the general assembly on the recommendation of the Pro Tem,
president Pro Tem, at least one who shall be a business owner, two
persons appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, again
one who shall be a business owner, and two persons appointed by the
Governor, one of whom shall be a business owner. The provisions on the
board also ask CCNC to ensure that no more than two members on its board
directly benefit from the per member per month payments to providing to
participating providers, to ensure that no more than 25% of the members
of the board are providers or members of the provider community, and to
ensure that no member or immediate family of a member of the board is a
registered lobbyist, or is employed by a entity that lobbies on behalf
of the healthcare provider, healthcare provider association. The board
size is limited to thirteen members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank, members of the committee, I want to first begin by just asking if
there are any ?? that have any technical questions about the bill that
would be directed to staff? Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I guess the first thing is, when it comes to determining the 50 most
frequent medical procedures, is that gonna be unique for each particular
hospital facility? Are they doing that based on what actually occurs at
that particular hospital, or are they looking at a common group of 50
procedures which all these hospitals are identifying their cost and
frequency related to, it wasn't clear to me from reading it and perhaps
you could help me with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the North Carolina health information exchange is gonna help
identify those. I think.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually it's the Medical Care Commission is supposed to identify the 50
most common, so it should be a uniform set for hospitals, and then a set
for ambulatory surgical facilities. The Medical Care Commission is also
to look and try to get a cross section of both medical and surgical
procedures and diagnoses to include in that 50 most common episodes of
care.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chairman? If I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, it's designed to find the 50 that we can compare and
contrast the cost and all the other things with it, and therefore the
Medical Care Commission will help us determine what those 50 that would
be best, helpful in achieving that information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First, I think it's a great</p>

idea what you’re doing in here, and I think it will really be like a
bill of rights for patients to get this kind of information. Right now
it really isn’t available so people can conduct an intelligent
comparative analysis. Can I ask one quick follow up for the bill
sponsors? And that is what have we done to work with small hospitals,
because I know some small rural hospitals have somewhat limited staff
and limited capacity. Are we allowing any special provisions for these
smaller hospitals? Perhaps in rural areas. I think for the big boys,
they’re going to be able to handle it all, but some of the smaller one
will be faced with more challenging staff and resources.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, I have the same concerns. I have one of those and I
think the more information we can get, I think the more that we can
hopefully help those hospitals. I think this bill will get some
information to allow us to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excellent and at an appropriate time, I’ll move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senators, can I give you a process of what I’m going through. Right now
I wanted to see if we could get to staff for any technical questions
about what the bill does. I know there’s a lot of interest and a lot of
people are going to speak. We have two members of the of the community
that want to speak, we’re going to hear from those and then we’ll open
it up for questions and debate across, but at that time I anticipate I
will limit members to one question and one follow up coming from those.
We’ve got, in the time period allowed, I think that’s going to be very
necessary to make sure this moves through. Staying on the area of
technical questions, Senator Tucker, did you have…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, I’ll...I’ve got a series of questions to ask. Perhaps I can
get with staff later on, I’m not going to be able to do anything.I’ve
got a whole page of questions to ask. You’ve seconded one, I just can’t
do it justice with one question. Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Senator Bingham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. The 50 procedures that was mentioned. When can we
get copies of that? Or get some information? I’m very interested in
that, I appreciate the bill, but that’d be helpful in understanding this
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My understanding is that what we’re doing is requesting that from the
Medical Cares Commission to come forward. That’s part of all of this
collection of information. They will first determine what would be the
ordinary 50 episode and then from that point forward there would be a
data collection so we don’t have them yet because of the fact that this
all part of the process of setting up a system with CNCC and the HIE and
then subsequently asking the hospitals and the ambulatory facilities to
provide that information based on the 50 that would be considered across
the board basic procedures.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand. May I ask, when will we expect that? Are we talking about
two months, six years, or…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Medical Care Commission is supposed to have those rules in place by
January 1st 2014
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ve just...think this an awfully big subject and I’m just wondering,
are you intending to finish it up today or will this go over because
many of the question I don’t know about two pages worth, but the
question that he has might be questions that all of us would like to
hear answered and I’m just wondering if this is maybe a little big for
the next 20 minutes, especially since I know we’re going to hear from
members of the public who are interested in this and so I’m just
wondering are you intending only today? Or are you going to run over
into another area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, and I will say with once a week meeting to draw this
to a second meeting, there will be several bills that will not be
eligible for crossover and doing so, it is my intent that we will finish
this bill. It is also my understanding that this bill will be referred
from here, most likely, to finance as it continues its direction.
Senator Allran.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question that’s not so technical, or we still
on the technical.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ll come back to those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Seeing no others, the two members that we have from. Senator Clark.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know everybody does not want to hear from me on this topic today. On
the common procedure, the first question is, how did we did decide to
use episode of care as the unit of measure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As best I can tell you, this</p>

Not just like a procedure, the episode of care means coming into your
pretreatment into a hospital ambulatory facility, through the entire
treatment process and for a period of time afterwards. So there was the
episode of care rather than a single procedure so that we can follow the
patients progress and the costs that go with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe episode of care is a term of art used in
describing a block of procedures similar,. or I shouldn't say similar
but there have been...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ma'am I don't mean to interrupt and imply, I don't
mean no disrespect, I absolutely know what an episode of care is and how
it's defined. The question to be specific is how do we select that as
the unit of measure. The reason being because most hospitals I will tell
you in the state will not be able to comply with this on an episode of
care direct measure because for one we probably have this three days
before, 30 day limit. Half the episodes of care as defined, particularly
in chronic care events, hypertension, dialysis, those things, can go 60
days or 180 days, so we'd be requiring or requesting partial payment
information. Where a much better set would be for operations procedures
or DRG codes for doing things on an impatient, outpatient basis we'll be
using CPD hick pics [??] which are measured an compared right now and
you can get very specific for comparison purposes.
And then you've got the issues we talked about common procedures. I mean
common too, is there going to be an acute care facility, community
facility, is it going to be a tertiary care and academic medical center,
what about specialty hospitals? They're doing different things for
behavioral health, psych hospitals, children's hospitals, rehab
facilities, it would vary by season as strange as it sounds. Outer banks
with 19 beds is going to have a different set of common episodes of care
or procedures in the summer so that we're...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Look, the one thing I will say first of all is
episodes of care are common statewide and established for the year. They
don't vary, they don't change, they are the 50 that are established and
so seasonal factors will not change them within the internal. But I
think - go ahead...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It was looked at in trying to stay consistent with
medicare, and we had to have some kind of continuous thread through
these systems, that's why it was chosen in that way. Can it be adjusted
and refined a little bit? Of course, but that is the core thread that we
want to have so we consistency to make those comparisons.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman I have at least two questions and one
amendment. Now, which is..
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask your technical question first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It actually has to do with section six, identifying
community care in North Carolina. Community care networks is a private
non-profit corporation. We are directing the modification to their board
for whatever reason, and I'm not saying - it seems to me that and I hate
to use the word constitutional sometimes but we have a constitutional
provision relating to our directing certain kinds of corporations to be
established, we cannot do that other than by the general law. and doing
this is creating some kind of composite and I'm just trying to figure
out the mechanics of this and the appropriateness of [??] the context.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell we're trying to utilize existing
facility with CNCC and then they've already acquired HIE so they're all
under that umbrella. And am I correct about that? That's part of the
system, that's correct. And what we're trying to do is today CNCC is all
based on providers. what we're trying to find is putting some people int
here that pay the bills so that they can be part of that system and
that's where we're making some requests as to the change of the board so
that it could actually reflect what we're trying to do and that is to
get to the core of what the cost is of healthcare, and this is what that
effort is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman I understand that, my question has to do
with compelling the structure in a constitutional context because we're
actually taking a non-profit and requiring it to become a quasi [??]
public agency, which we may want to do but I'm not - and it says it's by
request or whatever and I'm just trying to figure out what that...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair.</p>

Senator Hartsell, I, maybe it will help, it's not a, they're not
directed to make these changes but if they want to continue to contract
with DHHS, so it's, they're using the contract. It's not a direct,
&quot;you have to change,&quot; it's, &quot;if you want to do business
with the state this is what we want you to look like.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand that's what it says but that's about as much as a mandate
as I've ever seen and my concern is, to the extent that it is that, does
it violate the technical constitutional provision relating to our
setting up private corporations, or however. That's my concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would, to the others that support that it is, as much as it is that it
is not, it is merely a directive to the department as to who they may
contract with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the chaos we have with the department, this, setting this up is
another, is a, I just, it's just a red flag is what I'm trying to-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, Senator Hartsell, I understand and we can sure take a look at that
but I think you see what we're trying to do and we'll just make sure we
do it the right way. So we can take a look at that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will remind committee members we have a House Committee coming in at
12:00 so we're staying on technical questions in regards to the bill
right now. We'll get to public then we'll get to the amendment and start
moving so technical questions, Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have one technical and one substantive, I hope that's alright, both
dealing with the same subject. Part 6, this Community Care Board issue,
is there, at what point does this have to happen? They're, they have
contracts currently and I don't see in the effective date where section
12 is contemplated. It can't happen instantaneously, so that's my
technical question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would assume the provision is effective when it becomes law, I would
assume that it ... is actually implemented when contracts come up for
renewal or other contracts are there to be let.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you. And my substantive comment on this is that CCNC works
because it is a provider-based system. You get all the different
providers together, creating a medical home for the patient and working
cooperatively to achieve a good health outcome for the patient, and
messing with the board might jeopardize the core of what that
organization is and so I just want to flag that as, I can understand
what your goal is about trying to get some more business representation,
actuarial skills, on the board but you run the risk of undermining the
entire organization by changing its composition. So it seems, at a
minimum, you would want a director to be an advisory board of people who
provide it to inform the newly constituted board if you continue along
this path.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the comments. When I look at the public speak-, Senator
Tarte?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you mind if I ask a couple-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll come back. We're going to make sure that we're coming back to
questions. Signed up for public speaking we first have Hugh Tilson. I
will recommend him to speak for a time not to exceed two minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Hugh Tilson, Senior Vice President
of the North Carolina Hospital Association. First of all, I want to say
that we are for transparency and encourage and appreciative of the
opportunity to work with the bill sponsors on the legislation. The bill,
the PCS you have before you has addressed some of our concerns and we're
grateful for the opportunity to work with you. With regard to
transparency, Senator Bingham, you can go to the Hospital Association's
website right now and get the top 35 DRG's on the inpatient basis in
terms of charges and things like that. You can also go to our website
and look at charity care policies, community benefits, and get a link to
hospital financial assistance policies. I say all that by way of saying
that we wish to continue to work with the bill sponsors and the members
of the committee to address some technical concerns we have with regards
to some specific things, many of which you all have already touched on.
We want to be able to comply with whatever mandates the General Assembly
imposes on us to be transparent even further than we already are. We're
concerned that some of the provisions we may not be able to comply with
and we look forward to working with you on that. Lastly, with regard to
billing and collections piece, just want you to know the struggle that
your community hospitals face as non-profit, community based
organizations we have a duty to help those who honestly can't help
themselves. We do that all day every day. We gave away a billion dollars
worth of charity care last year, it's our mission, we're proud of that.</p>

We also have a duty to the people who actually pay their health
insurance to try to make sure we’re seeking payment from those who can
pay, but choose not to pay and it’s a delicate balance. You’ve read
about that in a lot of the media. I just want to let you know that every
hospital in your community struggles with balance. To be there all day,
every day, for those who legitimately need that service and can’t
otherwise fend for themselves, but trying to work with those who can
have the ability to pay, but choose not to pay. To make sure that we are
collecting from them as reasonable as we can to minimize the cost that
are put on to those who actually pay their health insurance bills.
Again, appreciate very much the opportunity to work with ya’ll. We do
have some technical questions and will look forward to the opportunity
as this bill moves to address those. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next, finally we have Mark Flemming recognized for a period not to
exceed two minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Blue Cross/Blue Shield North Carolina, we also
have been a leader and have been working hard on the issue of
transparency. We are running TV ads on the issue. We have a website -
letstalkcosts.com, encourage you to go to the site. On the issue, and we
have enjoyed and appreciate working with the bill sponsors Senator Rucho
and Senator Brown. Our transparency tool that is available for our 3.7
million members, they can go online right now and compare costs on a
hundred non-emergency medical elective procedures at hospitals across
North Carolina. Members can use that data and compare costs and make
decisions on where they’re going to go to have their procedures done.
We’ve just gotten a copy of this new PCS, we still do have some concerns
with some of the language and we look forward to, and we’ll continue to
look forward to working with the staff and the sponsors. On the third
part of the bill on radiology, we do have some strong concerns about
that language. We are currently in litigation on the appeals process on
this radiology issue. We would strongly recommend that some of that
language should be changed because of the impact that it could have on
our litigation. If you will remember, this came about a couple years ago
because of a reimbursement policy that we tried to implement on multiple
billing on radiology issues, so again, we would look forward to working
with the staff and the members to correct that part of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Flemming. Appreciate it. Thank you, we have exhausted the
members who would like to have spoke on the bill. I will begin then by
recognizing Senator Hartsell who would like to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman. The copies up front will need to be distributed, we don’t
necessarily have our dashboards with us here at the moment that I’m
aware of. I have the original. It’s a fairly simple amendment that I can
explain fairly easily.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we’ll suspend while they’re being handed out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll be glad to try to explain it while they’re… Mr. Chairman if you
want me to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. What the amendment does
is simply remove the section involving hospital debt collection for the
UNC hospitals and essentially Pitt Memorial or ECU. The reason to do so,
and I understand and I’ve mentioned this to Senator Rucho, and I had...</p>

<p id="45:00">
Can't say anything to Senator Brown. The rationale for removing them is
that we need to put everybody in the same position. Well the fact of the
matter is UNC Hospital and ECU are state agencies. They are hospitals of
last resort in this state and they are different. And I would contend
that - the argument that comes back - and it seems to me that if we
don't prevent them to continue to do what they are doing now then we as
a General Assembly are going to be subsidizing folks that we could
otherwise pay from setoff debt collection with appropriation from the
General Assembly and it seems to me it's appropriate to get the payees
to pay it from the setoff debt collection otherwise. I'll say this from
a personal experience. If one were to go downstairs to my office you
would find a bill to me for some procedures that were done by my wife at
UNC Hospitals a couple months ago. I have a dispute with them about what
that is because I can't figure out whether they've said anything back
and forth but the fact of the matter is I'll do what everybody else does
and that's wait till the last minute, try to figure it out, contact
them, say &quot;Okay have you checked this? Have you checked that?&quot;
At some point it tends to be about a year before they ever get to it and
we work it out maybe one way or another. But the fact of the matter is
if I owe it it ought to get paid. And if it can be paid, and these are
state hospitals just like other state agencies that utilize setoff debt
collection, we ought to be able to permit them to do it and I submit
that it's appropriate for us to permit them to continue to do what
they're already doing or otherwise we're going to be subsidizing them in
a similar fashion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee I'll
respond to that amendment. We look at this seriously and we've also been
approached - I think it was last year if I'm not mistaken - Newhanover
County the hospital there asked if they could also get included into the
ability to garnish the income tax refunds and I hope there are enough
lottery winners out there to pay something but under that circumstance,
garnishment is the most extreme type of bill collection and as Senator
Hartzell alluded to, he's got a bill he's struggling with - I had a bill
for 26,000 dollars and tried to make ?? of what was included in there
especially for 3 hours worth of work in a outpatient setting - that was
a lot of money I thought, but under the circumstances it is confusing
and what our concern is that once as the time runs out as Senator
Hartzell alludes to it gets to the point where they can't get to some
agreement then that gets turned over to the ultimate collector and that
is the Department of Revenue. At that point if Senator Hartzell owes
10,000 dollars according to that bill he doesn't have a chance to
discuss the bill anymore it's a matter of putting the 10,000 dollars
down and what we're saying is every hospital in the state of North
Carolina who's also trying to take care of the patients should be
treated the same and we if we allow the ECU and UNC hospital as Senator
Hartzell say it may be, they're battling in a situation where they're
competing with a number of other hospitals that are trying to do the
same thing but they should follow the same rules as everyone else and if
they find they get to a point where they can't get the bill resolved
then it goes to normal debt collection and that's where it ought to be.
They shouldn't be using the power of the Department of Revenue with a
hammer to make those collections. It's not right it's not fair for the
consumer and we do need to protect the consumer as much as protect the
hospitals. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. We have 4 minutes and 40 seconds
remaining. If I might just say, I understand exactly what Senator Rucho
is saying and we disagree on other things, the fact of the matter is
though these are hospitals of last resort, they're state agencies. There
are processes for appeals for various other things and whether it goes
to the collections office of the hospital or the Department of Revenue.
There is a mechanism, it's actually not a garnishment, it's a process
that's out there and I wish I had a 10,000 dollar refund that we could
pay something and still argue about but I probably don't. I'm simply
saying that they are different, they are state agencies, they are
compelled by not just us but by the people of North Carolina to provide
certain services and if they're eligible for these kinds of set offs
then they ought to</p>

Forget them. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman real quick. Senator Hartzell
I don't think you can convince all these other hospitals that that may
be the case. Now it could be and it is I guess that you could argue that
but I don't think you could argue - I don't think my hospital in
Jacksville would tell you when that patient goes in that emergency room
that they have that option to send them to UNC or ECU necessarily. They
do but their first goal is gonna be to take care of that patient. And
they don't have that same right. And I just think it puts everybody in
the same playing field. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That the other hospitals don't
have the educational requirements, I mean they may have some educational
components. These 2 operations provide a lot of services through the
education and the residents and all these other folks don't have and if
we don't let the state agencies do their jobs we're gonna have to end up
subsidizing with the other ways anyway and the people who are actually
receiving the services may walk off scott and I don't think that's -
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartzell's move to the adoption of his
amendment. All those in favor will say aye, all those opposed no. The
no's have it and the amendment fails. Senator Tucker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry sir it's not enough time. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
McKissick has moved for a favorable report on the bill unfavorable to
the original committee substitute [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could just say
one thing. I have been contacted by my hospital, UNC. They're concerned
over the multiple imaging and it's a little unclear and that's why I was
hoping we could run this over. Since I have no time I just wanted to say
that I have been contacted by the UNC hospitals with great concern over
their multiple imaging schedules and I wish we were [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We made some adjustments
to that piece of the bill and I think we should have handled at least a
decent compromise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick has moved the
committee substitute unfavorable as the original bill. We will add to
that a referral to finance for individuals. All those in favor,
favorable report say aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it. Thank you.</p>
