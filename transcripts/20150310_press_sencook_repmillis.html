  Good morning. I’m Senator Bill Cook. Today with me are Senator Harry
Brown, Senator Norm Sanderson, Representative Chris Millis,
Representative Mike Hager, Representative David Lewis, Insurance
Commissioner Wayne Goodwin, Mr. Tony Smith, President of the North
Carolina Association of Realtors and Miss Emily King from the North
Carolina Homeowner’s Alliance. We are introducing legislation in both
the House and Senate today, SB 208 and HB 182 that is designed to
promote fairness and equity in property insurance rates here in North
Carolina. The bill requires insurers to provide detailed information
concerning their costs and revenues. It gives the commissioner more
latitude in setting rate levels. The bill gives insurers a more
efficient mechanism for responding to catastrophic losses in the state.
It emphasizes the commissioner’s rules governing consent to rate
situations and requires the rates to be based on sound actuarial
principles and finally the bill requires a study of consent to rate
policies as well as the entire property insurance rate making process in
North Carolina. Having said that, I’d like to turn it over to some other
folks. We’ll start with Chris Millis and then maybe hear from Senator
Brown. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Cook. I’m
Representative Chris Millis and it’s an honor to be with you all today.
First and foremost I want to thank my Senate and House colleagues as
well as the Department of Insurance as well as the Insurance
Commissioner for all the time, energy and effort that was put into this
proposed legislation. We are here today after having a joint effort to
deliver a thoughtful, vetted and meaningful reform to positively affect
the ability for our citizens to obtain affordable property insurance
across this entire state. Legislative action regarding the statewide
property insurance reform is well overdue here in North Carolina. We
believe that this legislation will provide greater affordability in
property insurance market for our citizens and a better market
environment for the providing industry. We believe the objective of
increasing affordability is accomplished in this legislation due to the
very statutory tools that the legislation grants to all those involved
with property insurance rate making. We look forward to advancing this
legislation into law for all the benefit of those affected and involved
and this is a great piece of legislation that I believe all North
Carolinians can be proud of. Thank you for your time today and I want to
turn this over to Senator Harry Brown for a few comments. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Chris. I’ll be brief. I think many of you know I’ve
been working on legislation for several years dealing with this. I think
this bill is very, very important, especially to our seniors across the
state. Many in my district and several of the districts around me, what
is happening in property insurance over the past couple years has truly
affected the probably more than anyone else. We’ve got situations now
where we’ve got seniors with no insurance because they no longer can
afford the insurance for when in particular, so hopefully this reform
will be something that will help the whole state. We feel like it will.
You know, for us on the coast in particular, we’ve seen rates triple in
the past 6-7 years. So I know it will help many of my citizens. For us
on the coast it’s the number one issue. The number one issue that we
hear from our constituents day in and day out, so this reform is
important to us and I appreciate the legislators across the state
getting involved in this and helping support this bill. I think it’s a
good common sense bill and can bring some certainty maybe to some rates
that will help us in the long run. So thanks a lot. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. My name is Wayne Goodwin. I’m our State Insurance
Commissioner. As our Insurance Commissioner, I applaud all the
legislators who have involved with this process and involved with taking
up this very important issue. As I travel the state of North Carolina
and ask people about the insurance issues that matter most to them,
homeowner’s insurance is always a topic of discussion. Now, no doubt, it
is a complex issue but it is important to people and it ought to be and
I believe that when it comes to homeowner’s insurance, North Carolinians
deserve fairness and they deserve transparency and that’s why

  To support this bill. It empowers consumers, making more information
available to consumer allows them to make better, more informed
decisions about insurance for themselves, and for their families. And
the more we study and understand our insurance market here in the
Tarheel state, the better equipped we are to improve it for the
industry, and the public alike. My staff at the North Carolina
Department of insurance will continue to provide their support and their
expertise throughout this process, and I’m extremely happy to work in
cooperation with our legislators to come up with common sense and
beneficial adjustments to our system. I’ll now turn the mic over to
Emily King, with the North Carolina Homeowners’ Alliance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, my name is Emily King. I’d like to thank you for
having me today. I’m a member of the North Carolina Homeowners’
Alliance, and I came to speak out in support of this bill. As the North
Carolina homeowner, my family is directly impacted by any increase in
insurance rates. Giving the commissioner of insurance the ability to
lower rates has the potential to lower homeowners’ insurance rates for
all North Carolina families. This fair and equitable bill will help
North Carolina families in an economy that is still recovering. Consent
to rate notices are a scare tactic used by insurance companies that
cause individual consumers to get consent to rate increases that
continue on over time. This bill will extend notice periods for consent
to rate notices, and also cause the companies to give notice of any
continued increases in rates. I’d like to thank all of the bill’s
sponsors for their support and help to North Carolina families like
mine, and I’d like to encourage wide bipartisan support of this bill.
I’d like to now turn it over to Tony Smith, he is the president of the
North Carolina Association of Realtors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Emily. As president of the North Carolina
Association of Realtors, I want to extend thanks and support to the
bill’s sponsors of behalf of the association. The long overdue changes
in this bill have been priorities of ours for years, and much needed to
insure that homeowners insurance is affordable. Our association is
committed to the grass-roots mobilization to support the bill, and I
encourage others to sign up as cosponsors in both chambers, and to
encourage quick passage of this bill. Over 30 years in real estate and
residential sales, there was a time when the insurance – property
insurance was not an issue to the transaction, and now the cost of it
can be a deal killer, so I really look forward to the passage of this.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Unless there’s somebody else who wants to speak,
that’s about it for us today. I want to thank you all for coming and
paying attention. If anybody has questions, we’ll field a few. We don’t
have a lot of time. Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How does this affect what the rate ?? is required to
do when submitting rate cases, does this go to what past bills have
done, regarding using historical data, and not just risk modeling when
it comes to making rate cases? Does it go into that at all?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not very much. We try to look at historical –
encourage them to look at historical data, but still allows for models
to be used. I always forget. That’s probably my wife and I’m in deep
trouble. Alright, yes ma’am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Curtis, so you mentioned when you were
introducing this, that it gives the insurance companies a little bit
more flexibility and how to respond to these? Can you explain that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, insurance companies are what they call a tower
of where they get their money from, for catastrophic events. They look
at retained income, first level, they grab that money to pay off banks,
and they look at reinsurance money. I don’t want to get too technical.
Insurance companies turn around and buy insurance to support their
insurance, so that’s the second thing we look at, are we going to give
them another level of bonding, they can sell bonds in order to meet
catastrophic events, which makes the requirement for reinsurance, which
is expensive. To the extent that we are able to --

  Reinsurance, we reduce the costs, which hopefully will provide for
smaller premiums for the consumer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would those bonds be government backed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you want to, I’ll answer this. Those bonds are not
government backed. Basically what this bill does is actually give, by
way of a bonding authority, the actual rate here, the ability to issue
tax-exempt bonds, so the full faith and credit of the state is not
behind these bonds. It actually established bonding authority.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alrighty—oh, one more?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, this is usually -- the insurance industry
wants to say something about a bill like, and they’re not here today.
Has this been discussed with the insurance industry? What has been their
response, and why aren’t they supporting this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I haven’t heard from them. I’m sure they’re aware of
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One quick follow-up, Representative Millis. Do other
states do this bonding authority?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, other states do. I actually have this authority,
this actual legislative tool, that their insurance providers can
utilize. I believe it’s been done in the past in the state of Texas, and
possibly in Louisiana, and some others. We definitely tailored this to
the benefit of our North Carolina citizens, as well as our North
Carolina underwriters as well, and we try to more or less glean from the
good and throw out the bad in terms of how to actually establish this.
We feel very confident in the way that we’ve put this forward, not only
with reaching out to the actual bonding commission, but also with a
dialogue from the part of insurance and the insurance commissioner on
actually how to do this the right way in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Seeing no more questions, I think we’ll quit. Thank
you very much.
