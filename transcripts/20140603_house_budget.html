The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the house. I have a constituent in
Union County that this Friday will celebrate his 83rd birthday, at the
White House with the President of the United States, and bring with him
some 60,000 signatures from across this state and this nation, to
encourage a bill in the legislature, in the Congress, to issue a coin, a
stamp, and a bond, the proceeds of which will go to support veterans.
Korean War veteran Mr. Garland-Kenny, I can’t believe I just forgot his
name, how can I forget that name? Garland-Kenny’s been working on this
project for six and a half years, almost seven years, with support from
the governor of North Carolina, Lieutenant governor of North Carolina,
governor of Virginia, the governor of Maine, the Governor of Wisconsin.
Over 100 cities and counties across this state have all passed
resolutions supporting this effort for the US government to issue a
coin, a stamp, and a bond, the proceeds of which will support our
veterans. Ladies and gentlemen, if you don’t know how important these
coins are to a veteran, or to an active duty service member, I’m happy
to tell you but not right now. I encourage you to support this
resolution. Let these guys know that we’re behind them all the way.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not
a question before the house is house resolution 1254. Over in favor vote
aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will
let the machine record the vote. 114 having voted affirmative. None in

printed. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, if you would direct your
attention to the first page of the calendar, there are three local bills
that could be grouped. They’re voice votes for second and third reading.
We’ll give you a couple minutes to look at them. We’ll go ahead and move
forward on to the public bills without objection, we’ll vote those as a
group. House bill 1032, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House
bill 1032 committee substituted ?? act to prevent the abusive use of
patents. ?? North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Strike that, ladies
and gentlemen. We have more amendments than we have bills on the first
three, so we will be taking those individually after we take up this
matter. Representative Murray, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you members of the house. This bill is entitled patent abuse bill.
It will add a new section to the unclear and deceptive trade practices
statute in North Carolina, to go after what we call patent trolls. Many
North Carolina companies are forced to spend thousands and sometimes
millions of dollars to defend themselves against abusive ?? of patent
infringement by patent trolls. This bill will add unfavorable or
deceptive trade practices to unfairly a search or patent rights in an
effort to shake down some of our most innovative companies. This bill
has passed the house commerce committee. It passed the judiciary B
committee, and it was a recommendation from the economic development and
global engagement oversight committee. Originally the bill as filed had
criminal penalties as well. We’ve removed those penalties. This is
strictly a civil action and it seeks to protect the innovators in our
state, to make sure that they know North Carolina is a great place to do
business and innovating your company, whether it’s a small business or a
large business, we’ve got support from the North Carolina chamber of
commerce, the North Carolina retail merchants association, the bankers
association, the restaurant lodging association, realtors association,
and large and small businesses like Google, Redhat, SAS, Krispy Kreme,
Epic Games all support this legislation so I believe Representative Stam

Amendment to this legislation that I am in support of. Representative
Stam can explain his amendment but in a nutshell it would make sure that
companies that follow litigation pursuant to this legislation in bad
faith are also subject to the penalties just like companies that assert
their patent rights unfairly are subject to penalties in this
legislation so it is a balanced amendment and it is supported by all the
stakeholders. With that Mr. Speaker I’ll be available for any questions

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of this chamber
here. The heart of this piece of legislation does this very action for
constituents that you represent who may decide to actually disturb their
own private property to expand their business or to actually propose a
new business. It actually requires a regulatory approval from one of our
state or delegated regulatory agencies.
It's at the heart of this bill actually is getting at the regulatory
purview of these agencies. While we want to uphold the actual
responsibility that we have as the General Assembly to actually protect
our health, our safety and our environment, we want to make sure we do
so in a very efficient process.
So this bill does not undermine any authority that our regulatory
agencies has, but it just refocuses them on their purview in order to
provide a faster efficiency for your constituents.
This bill was actually an interim study bill. It was actually had major
stakeholder input. It was vetted through the ERC, it was passed out
through the ERC and I definitely appreciate your support.

This is one of those that we have a study committee on. I have thought
about asking Representative Stam to give you an in depth description of
the Pete Wall plumbing case but I don't know that that's entirely
critical here. Basically all this does is says that you cannot if you're
a municipal body or a public body, you cannot enter into a contract with
a private person by leasing this in order to avoid the payment bond
issues. Because you can't get a lien on public property but you can when
it's an individual property. So the Pete Wall case involved going around
that by having a public private partnership. So that's really all ths
bill does is try to address the Pete Wall case. Be happy to answer any

does not make you an agent for any other purpose such as receiving a

we have a committee to study the foster care dependency system and as we
got into that and as various events  have happened in the interim, both
in Wilkes County that I represent, Yadkin County nearby and Gaston
County and Cleveland County, and some of the problems they had, we
discovered that it was a much more difficult problem than we could deal
with in four meetings. So we're asking that it continue to be studied in
the interim. It was a subcommittee of the health and human services so
we're asking them to designate a committee and setting forth those
things that are particularly critical. I'd ask for your support.

?? the House, this will be one of several APO recommendations I'll be
presenting to you this afternoon. This essentially clarifies the
existing rule readoption process. Last year during our regular forum
debate, the bill itself, we required a periodic review and expiration of
existing rules as a provision to Administrative Procedures Act. Now,
what this does is it would direct the rules review commission and
consultation with the agency to establish a date by which the agency
must readopt its rules. The agency can make amendments to the rules
during a readoption process; however, if there's no substantive change
to the rule itself, no fiscal note is required, and if the agency fails
to readopt a rule then it automatically expires. I'd appreciate your
support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion. Further debate. If not,

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen

Speaker and members of the House this bill comes to us with the
recommendation of the legislative oversight committee for health and
human services. As it says in the title, it is to improve oversight of
public guardianship and for those here and those that might be listening
just keep in mind, it has to do with public guardianship. That's not
those private guardians most of us will generally think of, but this is
just about public guardianship. And it basically does four things. It
requires the Department of Health and Human Services Division of Aging
and Adult Services to work with administrative office of the courts to
develop a plan for evaluating complaints concerning wards under the care
of publicly-funded guardians. Secondly, it requires the Division of
Social Services to study conflicts of interests in child welfare cases
as related to public guardianship. Third, it requires the Division of
Aging and Adult Services to consult with the name parties in this bill
and other interested groups to develop a model plan for transitioning a
ward to alternative guardianship arrangement if a guardian is no longer
willing or able to serve, and then finally, it requires DHHS to submit a
final report on these above issues to the joint legislative oversight
committee by October 1st, 2014.  I don't believe that there's anything
controversial here, and I'd appreciate your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

House Bill 1140, the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee Substitute for House Bill 1140, a bill to be
entitled an act to amend the requirements for carbon monoxide alarms in
hotels as recommended by the Environmental Review Committee. General
Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To present the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, this bill came out of the ERC committee. If
you may recall about a year ago there were some deaths in some hotels in
Western North Carolina due to carbon monoxide poisoning.
So in part of one of our bills last year during the long session we put
in a requirement that all of these lodging establishments put carbon
monoxide detectors in their facilities. And we also directed that there
be some more study of it.
Well, as the draw would have it, during all the snow weather this year,
every time we were supposed to get together to discuss this bill, it
snowed and we weren't able to do so. But the people who were advocates
for it all lived here in Raleigh.
So they all got together and resolved all the issues around this and
brought it to us and said, &quot;We have a mutually agreeable bill
here.&quot;
And basically what it does is it corrects the fact that according to the
licensing standards, it's not a detector it's an alarm. So one of the
things you'll change is, see is that we're changing it from detector to
alarm.
And then it had to do with issue of could we have plug in or did they
have to be hardwired. And it turned out the plug in ones are partially
wired anyways, so it's going to let them be plug in.
And then it also says, &quot;Well, who is going to inspect them? How are
they going to inspect it? And if I inspect it and it's not compliant,
what are the next steps?&quot;
And we got that all clarified so that if you have a facility and they
come in to inspect it and you don't have it done correctly, its got a
way to continue, to figure out when is it imminent danger and when is it
not imminent danger and to make sure that we have them inspected
correctly.
So the basics of it, it's going to work and it's going to save lives. I
have one small technical amendment if you would allow me to send forth
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson is recognized to send forth
an amendment. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson moves to amend the bill on
page 1, line 21, by rewriting that line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Basically is this is a
conforming change. Elsewhere we changed out the requirement that it be
OSHA approved because not all of them are OSHA approved. There are three
approving bodies that can approve them. And we forgot to take it out of
this other portion so this just simply makes it conforming to the rest
of the bill.
And I urge your support of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the amendment
sent forth by Representative Samuelson to the House Committee Substitute
for House Bill 1140.
All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the
vote.
The Clerk will let the machine record the vote.

aye? The lady will be recorded as having voted aye. One hundred and

4, line 28, by rewriting that line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, in regards to that
provision that we adopted last year regarding carbon monoxide detectors,
we directed the building code council to adopt a carbon monoxide
standard for new hotel construction.
They adopted the 2012 International Building Code and International Fire
Code Standard. Since that time, the IBC and the IFC has adopted a new
standard and essentially this would move them to the new standard for
all new hotel construction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Once again, this is all about making sure our
facilities are safe from carbon monoxide and I support the amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask Representative Moffitt a question, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt, does the gentleman yield? The
gentleman does not have to yield. The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, I'll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, so very much. Can you touch on
what the differences are between the 2012 and the new, what'd you say,
the new 2015 or whatever year they picked? Can you, what's the
differences?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do not know the difference. This actually was asked
by the Restaurant and Hotel Association and we cover it with the Office
of the State Fire Marshall this morning and everybody's on board with
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>

the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, this
bill will look familiar to you. We actually have passed this same exact
bill through the House in our previous term and it got caught up in
Senate Bill 10 last year. Essentially what this amendment does is it
clarifies a couple of areas under section 2. The bill terminates the
Committee on Dropout Prevention, which was originally created in 2007 by
session law. In 2010, the session law was codified by the Reviser of
Statutes as article 6B of chapter 115C, and this amendment just repeals
the codified law rather than the session law. The second part of the
amendment encourages the Chief Justice to abolish the Actual Innocence
Commission. In 2005, the Actual Innocence Commission was succeeded by
the Chief Justice’s Actual Innocence commission, which was established
by order of the court. This amendment rewrites the section to reflect
that the commission was established by court order rather than by the
Chief Justice. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Samuelson please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Members for those of you who have been in ERC or in
environment you will know this is really a very fascinating subject but
I’ll spare you all the details and just simply say that just as carbon
monoxide detectors are not the same as carbon monoxide alarms, gravel is
not what you think it is and it is not pervious; however, in bill 74
last year there had been some debate last year whether gravel should be
pervious or not pervious and therefore counted on ?????. We made a
judgment decision and then put it up for a study. After trouncing
through more fields, rain pits, storms and every other thing to figure
out how pervious gravel is we have determined that nobody really knows
how pervious gravel is. So what we’re proposing in this bill is that we
take gravel, which is actually aggregate and I have various bags of it
if you’d like to see the difference between gravel and aggregate, and
we’re going to define it as built upon area based upon which the extent
to which water actually does go through it which has to do with what the
subsoil is, it’s going to be different in the mountains than it’s going
to be in the coast or the piedmont, and then once you’ve figured out how
pervious it actually is based on how you’ve installed it then the amount
of built upon area counted against it will be based on that calculation.
In order to do that calculation since no one yet knows what the answer
is we have commissioned a study by NC state and some people who will go
through and actually do all these tests so that if you’re building in
the mountains or the piedmont or the coast you’ll know whether your
gravel counts as built upon area or not built upon area and to which
extent and that’s the most concise way I can define this bill and I do
urge your support. Thank you.

gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, we had this bill in committee and we
had a lot of healthy debate that left us sometimes with some questions
we want to go back and ask. I think it came up in committee that this
was a mandate, and what we want to do is look up: A mandate applies to
any new medical benefit which insurance companies are forced to provide
and drives up the cost, in turn drives up the insurance premiums. The
Optometrists’ Society, we don’t believe that this is a mandate on price.
We don’t want them to have a mandate on our price and we don’t believe
that there should be a mandate on anything you don’t cover. We got this
from four years ago, when you look at the dental bill. We did the exact
same thing to make sure that it wasn’t covered. I’m sorry, I’ve ??. I
look ?? my family, and I look to find out how it would affect me. In my
family, we just need to get our eyes checked once a year, and what we
found out, we would be covering costs for other to get sunglasses,
hunting glasses and fishing glasses. So if we didn’t have the mandate in

insurance cheaper for my doctor, so we’d ask that you support the bill.

I think we all have a pretty good idea what insurance is. Insurance is
pooled risk, and so if we all have a different medical condition’s
insurance, what we do is we pool all our money, put it in a pot, and you
might have a different risk profile than I do, and if I required
coverage for a certain thing for everybody and you don’t have that
condition, then that’s a mandate. And we’ve passed mandates before;
we’ve debated mandates on this floor. We’re not talking about insurance
here. This is not a covered service. My insurance card, I’ll pull it
out. My insurance card doesn’t say anything about optometric coverage,
even though my wife needs glasses, my ten-year-old needs glasses. A lot
of insurance companies don’t actually cover the eye care that patients
need, but they do negotiate this discount to be included in the network,
and so for folks in this network, you get a discount. Everybody outside
the network doesn’t get the discount. Everybody else pays more outside
the network than the people inside the network. We’re trying to fix that
with this legislation. Let me read a scenario sent to me by an
optometrist that I think will illuminate this. So there are several
companies that use small business dollars to fund their plans and
inflate their values at no cost to them. Many of the standalone vision
plans will approve overages and non-covered amounts. For example, we
might have a 130 dollar frame allowance, which is what a lot of state
employees have. They put 10 dollars a month away into a plan and then at
the end of the year or throughout the year, the can get 120 dollars
towards glasses. That’s not insurance. That’s just spreading your money
over the year to get a discount on glasses. And so what happens is you
get a 130 dollar frame allowance, they will reimburse the provider only
77 dollars, which is about a 40 percent discount. This is what’s
available in the contract. However, if the patient selects a 400 dollar
frame, the overage gets discounted another 30 percent, so then they
deduct 10 percent from any funds due…</p>

<p id="65:00">
to the provider, and in some cases the insurance company is actually
profiting on that discount because their getting it from two sources,
both the patient and the optometry provider. So, I think this is a way
to level the playing field to make sure that everybody’s cost goes down,
instead of just the folks in a selected network. So, that’s what this
bill seeks to remedy, and Representative Stone and I will be glad to
answer any questions, and I believe Representative Stam will like to
speak on this bill as well. If his lights not on.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just had a few concerns with the legislation,
and one of my concerns: I wonder if we’re not being dragged into what
boils down to a contract dispute between optometrists and insurance
providers. I also believe the passage of the bill limits consumer
choice. Why wouldn’t you want a discount, with whatever membership
you’re in, whatever group that you might be involved with? NFIB and [??]
chamber of commerce are opposed to this bill, and both have issued
alerts. And lastly, we’re prohibiting a discount program offered by
providers for their customers. What consumer discounts will we look into
next? Why are we involved in it? I get a discount each month at Verizon,
because I’m a state employee, I got it as a firefighter. It’s the same
discount that’s offered to other groups.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representive Sing, do you have any idea what the number of insurance
providers are a member of the chamber or NFIB?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have any idea how many members of the optometric society are
members of NFIB?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields to a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll yield, would you restate it please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you know how many members that we have from the optometric society,
that are members of the NFIB or the chamber?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not. And thank you, Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, and it doesn’t
really matter to me, because the principle is the same. I don’t know how
many folks take advantage of the Verizon discount, but I do know that
those groups do look after business interests and what’s good for the
state as we grow business in our state. So, it does concern me when they
issue an alert. And furthermore, other consumers may not get a similar
discount, that’s life. Why we have to level the playing field for
everybody, in every little instance, is somewhat beyond me and I’m not
sure that that’s our purpose for being elected here. They’re private
entities, their able to operate in a free market and negotiate contracts
as whatever why they want to. So, I’m a little concerned that we’re now
involved in this industry for the optometrists, and I just wonder what’s
next. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, it somewhat depends on what category,
you put a bill into, how you think about it.  And, if you think about
this as a mandate on insurance company. Mandate, that means: yes, no,
thou shalt not. So they think of it as a mandate, which is a bad thing.
But, if you think about it in another way, this bill is free enterprise,
anti-mandate. I’d like to go back, not too long, to Adam Smith and The
Wealth of Nations, you know, the capitalist, the free-trader, the free
enterprise system. But even under that system, we do not allow
monopolistic or anti-competitive activities. But we do that
prospectively and just as this bill does, it doesn’t apply to existing
contracts. It’s only contracts after a certain date. And we do that all
year long, we say after a certain date you shall not have contracts that
do certain things. Well, the category that I put this into is a tying
arrangement. In other words, well, you buy a left shoe and you’re likely
to want a right shoe for your right foot as well. So, most shoe places
will sell shoes as a pair, and that’s very good. Car dealers typically
will sell the tires and the battery and maybe the tire changer with the
car because it’s not really good for the consumer immediately after
getting that fresh new smell of the car to have to go out and buy tires
and a battery, do you see my point? Those things are really related to
each other for the benefit of the consumer. But here, you have things
that are really</p>

<p id="70:00">
And it’s a attempt to use the monopolistic or leverage power of the
party with the superior bargaining power to force you to do something
else unrelated. Now at one time, these types of things were per se
illegal. In 1917, there’s a U.S. Supreme Court case, motion picture
patents case, that involved ways that they tried to monopolize the movie
industry by patenting the projectors. And there’s been a whole series of
U.S. Supreme court decisions. And I’ll be frank to tell you that it’s no
longer per se illegal, a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, to do
tying. Instead now they do a Rule of Reason. But that’s the lens through
which I look at this bill. It is an unreasonable tying of two unrelated
projects, where one party, the insurer, always has a greater market
ability than the optometrist. I’ve never seen an optometrist’s office
that had more than half a dozen people with it. And their just not in
equal bargaining positions. So we say this is anti-competitive, its not
good for the consumer, the legislature prohibits it for the future.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I couldn’t understand a word you just said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My optometrist drove about three in a half hours to get up here. And
this is how he explained it to me. He said, “We have to take insurance.”
He said, “I loose money when I take insurance like on the eye exams.” He
said ,”The insurance companies might say, ‘we’ll pay you twenty dollars
for that eighty dollar exam.” He has to take it, otherwise he doesn’t
have customers. But then they have the audacity to tell him you’ve got
to give discounts on your glasses when you sell them. Even though they
don’t cover anything on the glasses. That’s the issue. And I ask you to
vote “No” on this thing. Or vote “Yes” on this thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t think there is anybody whose anymore opposed to insurance
mandates in this House than I am. There are probably some equally as
opposed to them. I doubt anybody is more opposed to mandates than I am.
I’ve consistently voted against insurance mandates. I used to rail
against them before I ever got to the General Assembly, when I was the
pack chair of the National Association of Insurance and Financial
Advisors for North Carolina. And it’s not because of my concern for
insurance companies.
I think some of my constituents have asked me, “Well is it because
you’re in the insurance business that you’re so concerned about these
things?” Well the answer’s yes but not for the reason you think. Because
the insurance companies are going to adjust their prices to make a
profit no matter what. And if our insurance commissioner’s doing his
job, which he does, he’s going to make sure they do that so that they
can remain solvent and pay their benefits. That’s a big concern for
everybody. So I’m not concerned about the insurance companies on any of
these bills. I’m concerned about my clients who pay insurance premiums.
The NFIB says we’ve passed something like fifty five insurance mandates
back down through the decades. And maybe a few of them are bogus ones
like this one, I don’t know. But let’s say the number is forty eight.
And let’s say, we always hear, “well this isn’t even going to raise the
price of insurance one percent.” Well, let’s assume that each one of
them just raised the cost of health insurance half a percent. That means
that our people in our state today are paying twenty four percent more
for health insurance than they would without those mandates.
I believe in letting them market drive what health insurance policies
cover and don’t cover. But let me tell you this, there’s no way, as
already been stated a couple of times, that this is a mandate. And if it
is a mandate, it’s a mandate that’s going to have the reverse effect of
every other mandate I’ve ever heard of. Because what this does is tell
the insurance companies, “you cannot claim to be providing a benefit
that you’re not providing. You cannot force the optometrist to take a
discount on part of a puzzle that you’re not covering.” Now think about
that. That means if I’m an insurance company, I’m offering, if this bill
passes, I’m now offering a product with a lesser set of benefits. So
what kind of pressure is that going to put on the price of the product?
Upward or downward? Obviously downward. Now, again, I’m not concerned
about the insurance companies. They’ll figure out how to do this.
They’ll price it and they’ll price it without the discount for the
glasses built in. And the price of vision insurance will go-</p>

...down not up. So, is this a mandate? I thought mandates drove prices
up. That's not going to happen. I also don't believe the argument that
our optometrists are just going to suddenly kill all of us on the prices
of eyeglasses. I believe the market will defeat that effort if any of
them are crazy enough to try it. Most people know they can go down the
street and buy their eyeglasses from somebody besides their
optometrists. And if my optometrist is charging an outrageous amount,
that he won't discount for any of us, and the optometrist down the block
is doing something different, well, I'll change optometrists and go to
that one. So, I think the market will take care of this. I'm like
everybody else, I don't like these turf war bills. I wish bills like
this didn't come before us, I really do. We hear them all the time. But,
it's here, and we've got to vote one way or another. I would tell you,
don't take the bogus argument that this is a mandate bill. It's not. If
anything it will put a downward pressure on the price of vision
insurance plans. And I don't think it's going to destroy anybody's
prices for eyeglasses. I just don't think our optometrists are out to do
that. I think this is a fairness measure. As we heard in the insurance
committee the other day there really are only four major providers that
have a significant number of insureds throughout the whole state. I
think it was five-hundred-thousand or more in that category. So there
are a limited number of choices for optometrists. They don't negotiate
these contracts. They're handed a contract, and they take it or leave
it. So I would encourage you to vote... as the insurance mandate hater
of the House, the North Carolina House, I would ask you to vote
&quot;yes&quot; on this bill.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. As Representative Saine
said there are people who currently benefit from these discounts, and I
have to agree with Representative Stam. This bill does not affect any
existing contracts. But you need to factor into your thinking every
health insurance policy in this state is an annually renewable contract,
and one year from now it will come under provisions of this bill, and
anybody with an existing contract discounts will lose it. (sic) Thank
you very much.

Administration with the passage of the 13th Amendment through the US
House of Representatives, it was one of the greatest pieces of
legislation ever passed within that body. It’s really short and to the
point, neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment
for crime whereby the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist
within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
Section 2, Congress shall have power to enforce this article by
appropriate legislation. That was when part of our declaration of
independence which said that all men are created equal and endowed by
their creator by certain inalienable rights was made true and I’m proud
to be a member of the party that was actually formed to abolish slavery
in the 1850s. That document received from the Congress signed by William
Seward sent to this body for ratification dated February 2, 1865 is
currently on display right now in the archives building next to this
building. I promise you when you look upon that and read it you will not
be unmoved. If you are not able to get there by 5 o’clock today, it will
be touring around the state so as we recognize the 150th anniversary of
the great conflict that nearly tore this nation apart we can also
