This bill changes none of this. All this bill does is allow the use of a
legal suppressor while hunting, increasing the risk of hearing damage
related to the use of firearms. Suppressors also allow hunters to wear
less ear protection, which increases their awareness of their
surroundings and improves safety. This legislation will benefit farmers
who need to hunt nuisance wildlife such as feral hogs and coyotes. These
animals are typically found in groups or packs and when using a normal
rifle, the animals will scatter after one shot. Suppressors will allow
farmers to fire multiple shots and take multiple animals without them
scattering. Currently, hunting with legal suppressor is allowed in 24
states. The bill is supported by the Lilac Resource Commission, and it
did pass the Senate Add committee and the Senate Judiciary One
committee. In closing, I would like to use the words of Dr. Phillip H.
Dater who writes &quot;It is easy to spot older, long time shooters.
These are the guys who can't understand a word you're saying while
regaling you with tales of the great hunts in exotic locations, the
competitions won, or the battles bravely fought. Some use hearing aids,
which are second choice to natural hearing. Others will be able to
understand you if they can see your lips move and their is little
ambiance in the room.&quot; I would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters, what purpose your aye's?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. I think this bill, this is not a second
amendment rights bill. We've heard today from the bill sponsor all the
guidelines that we have to go through to buy suppressor or silencer. I
don't think, that's not the issue. There's an issue that's far reaching
than hunters, and it's landowners, private property rights. As we go
forward, you know there's a thing, it's safety. Safety should be for
every North Carolinian. Not just the hunters in North Carolina. Because
living in rural North Carolina, when you live there day after day, and
you walk out in the morning, and you hear someone duck hunting, or in
deer season you hear deer rifles discharge, you know someone's on your
property. And you know when you've given permission or not. You can hear
them. And so as a landowner, you go and check on your property. But
also, you send farm workers out everyday. And a lot of places in North
Carolina, little farms, we travel across two or three neighboring
properties to get to a property in the back maybe. And we may not know
that someone has the right to hunt, but if you hear that gun discharge,
you stay out of that area. If you're working in the forest products
industry, in deer season, you understand if you hear a gun discharge in
the green ??, 660 acre block, which is a mile squared, you don't enter
that block, because you understand someone is hunting there. What the
next thing is is deer poaching, or night hunting. If you're at home in
the evening, and you hear a gun go off, you know probably someone is on
your farm hunting illegally. You can call the sheriffs department. And
we passed a bill in 2010, general senate, landowner protection. Where
you have to have written permission to hunt. Oh, 2011, thank you. Where
you have to have written permission to hunt. Those are the issues that I
have with this bill, it's safety and trespassing. And I think at some
point in time, we as property owners and family farms for generations,
we need protection as well. Hunting is a wonderful sport, I participate
in it all the time, have two or three hunting lodges; I understand the
joy and the privilege of hunting. But it is a privilege. And we have to
protect our workers, and our family farms.</p>

I think that this is such an important vote.  Wake County is the 16th
largest school district in the country.  We have the approaching 154,000
students.  It adds 3- to 5,000 students per year, and its been
consistently doing that for the last decade, decade and a half.  That
many extra students per year.  And the amazing thing about it until
recently, it was constantly rated as one of the one or two best large
districts in the United States.  And the other thing about it, I will
tell you about the students from Wake County.  You can check any of the
admission offices of any of the schools around the country.  The elite
institutions, institutions that are not so elite, and you find Wake
County students at the tops of those lists, whether you're talking about
the Ivys or any of the others, or you're talking about small college
somewhere in the United States anywhere.
Wake County students consistently by studies done, tend to do better in
whatever setting you put them in than other students.  Whether you put
them in the Ivys, or whether you put them in the state institutions or
anywhere across the country.  I'm part of an institution that looked at
30 plus thousand applications for less than a 1000 seats.  Surprisingly,
the county that provides more public school students and applicants,
then that school district is Wake County.  More applicants, more
admissions.  One year, nine out of the top scholarships of that
institution were offered to Wake County students.  My daughter graduated
from a Wake County public high school.  In its consistent now, over 2
million scholarships are offered to graduating seniors from the Wake
County high schools, a system that has worked very well.  And there's
several reasons for it.  When our kids were in the school, they went to
one of these magnet centers that Senator Stein talked about, Enloe high
school, which was one of the best in the state, and it was a school that
students attended by choice.  Before our kids started driving one
weekend, I'd be up north of Wake Forest, east of Zebulon, the next
weekend, south of Fuqua, 45 miles from one to the other taking the kids
to activities, and they got to know kids from all over the county, and
they still have those relationships and friendships.
Not only my kids, but kids from all over the county and their parents
decided that that's what they wanted.  So now, Wake County has 31 magnet
schools, one of the best magnet programs in the country.  When I talked
to Tony Tater when he was the superintendent here in Wake County he
said, &quot;The amazing thing that folk don't realize is that the magnet
schools answer the choice question in Wake County.  You don't need all
of the debate that's going on.&quot;  And he learned that after studying
it for less than a year.  And the voters in this county felt the same
way about it.  You can live anywhere in Wake County and go to any school
pretty much that your heart is set on.  Ideal for the real estate
agents, you don't have to worry about placing people in specific parts
of the county when new companies move in.  And why do I say that?
Because the realtors, the Chamber, and a bunch of other folk got
involved in this debate.  The Chamber of Commerce wrote Senator Hunt
wrote us in the delegation asking us not to change the way that we elect
members to the Wake County School Board, The Chamber of Commerce.  And
when you look at it, it becomes again obviously why.  Because they know
the success of the school district, and the they know what the issues
are when you got specific areas that people flock to because they think
that that's where their kids are gonna to go to school.  In 2006, we
passed almost a billion dollar bond issue to build new schools in this
county.  Right now, we're considering another bond issue of another $1
billion dollars roughly.  We need $2 billion to build the schools, but I
mentioned those bond issues because in 2007, people started clamoring
because there weren't schools in their neighborhoods.  Couldn't build
them fast enough.  The district was increasing students so fast.  We had
a school board that basically decided it was going to be arrogant.  It
was going to tell folk when their kids would get out of school early so
that they would disrupt their schedules, have to go pick them up, or
arrange daycare for them.  It was going to change their assignments and
to not let their siblings go to the same school they had gone to.  And
they paid for it.</p>

The voters scheme out in ??, voted them out and in 2009 elected a
republican majority school board. No body has paid much attention to the
make up of the school board before then, in fact one of the chairs of
the school board said since we created this school board in 1976 there
have been 6 republican chairs and 4 democratic chairs and 1 no body knew
what she was because it didn't matter. And that's important because it
takes the entire community to make school successful and that's
especially so when you consider only 30 percent of the tax payers in our
community really have kids in the schools. So you have to get support
from everybody including those who don't have kids in the schools and
when you start injection partition ship into that, you adversely affect
that support that you going to get. And that's what beginning to happen
in this, county to a greater degree. In 2009 when the new school board
was elected and I might add there was a democratic majority in the
senate and democratic majority in the house and a democratic governor,
we chose not to try to change the way the school board was elected to
make it democratic again because it shouldn't matter. The school board
?? of the voters ??. 93 percent of the parents in this county were
supportive of the decision that the school board has made with respect
to where there kids went to school. And once they found out that they
were being bus because you couldn't build schools fast enough. We need
40 new schools right now but you couldn't build schools fast enough,
they supported the pro policies and the new school board was trying to
reverse those policies and 93 percent of the people in this county
favored. So, in the next election after ??, ?? ??, He is my friend, ??
?? and I agree with ?? ?? ?? in a reasonably fair manner because he kept
communities of interest together. He didn't weird looking shapes and
designs and more importantly he didn't do something that really offends
me.?? ?? and it really ought to offend you too. And it offends me to the
quick, it makes me want to yell but I think at some point race has to
stop playing a rule in what we do. Look at this map and look at the bill
itself because that's what more instructive. It takes 3 pages to
describe the three pages that's being created here, 3 full pages and
consequently a ?? and that's district number 4 when you read the bill
itself because it goes through, it breaks down voter tabulation
districts of precincts as we tend to call them and it peels out black
parents and black citizens. We are talking about school boards, about
schools. It feels them out, packs them all into a single district and if
you look at district number 1 you'll see that it has a lot of voter
tabulation districts rather than precincts of broken down precincts
because you got to do something with the remaining people in those
precincts that will split. Those dealing with 2 districts out of 7 where
you have page and page and page of voter tabulation averages rather than
precincts introducing more confusion and you know that perhaps coupled
with the fact that we are messing with quite is for the benefit of over
150 thousand people really does get going. Every democrat on the school
board was up for re-election in 2011 and districts that were drawn to
favor one party over another but not outrageously. The chairman of the
school board was in the most republican district in the county,
overwhelmingly. Every single democrat won, every republican lost because
they were injecting partisanship into this election, into the selection
of school board members. People put their kids above petty politics and
I hope you'll help us put county kids over petty politics. Now I think
that if it's not in ethic to inject brace and partition politics into
this, new map. And I've never known sent on a hunt to do something like
this. So If...</p>

<p id="030:00">
A member in districts that are not partisan.  And I’ve never known him
intentionally do something like that, but it’s a blatant attempt when
you look at these numbers that I just talked about.  Why consider
registration?  You look at the backup to this plan.  Registration has
nothing to do with it. The cases don’t say that you got to consider
registration.  You don’t have to.  In Wake county is not a county where
you have to consider race.  We don’t have to preclear. There is no sign
of African Americans being unable to elect the candidates of their
choice.  There are no studies.  In fact, this county led most, two of
the four constitutional officers.  The ‘70s and ‘80s and ‘90s were
African Americans.  Sheriff, registered deeds, county commissioners,
judges.  We’ve consistently voted without regard for race across this
county.  And so when you introduce these things into school board
districting, it makes me somewhat emotional because I don’t want to
spend the next forty years battling those kinds of battles.  And so, I
say to you this evening, that this is important because you really can
save a great school system.  And this bill goes to destroy it.  As I
said, the chamber opposes it.  Every organized group that I know in the
county opposes it.  The fact that we are now looking at putting a bond
on the ballot, when everybody says that we need two billion, but we’re
going to go for a billion.  And you guarantee, you absolutely guarantee,
that that bond issue will fail if in fact people perceive that race has
entered in to the way that you’re going to run the Wake county school
district , it absolutely will fail.  If people don’t feel good about how
their school board members are treating all of the students.  And, the
last thing that I would say is that we need to build schools in this
county. I represent the city, and I represent part of the county. Used
to represent it all the way to the county line, and had for twenty or
thirty years.  But I will tell you, mostly within my district there’s no
room to build new schools.  The places where the new schools will be
built are the places that are represented by folk who ought to be
fighting to ensure that we don’t inject these other issues in how we
choose school boards. In Western Wake County, in Eastern Wake County and
Northern Wake County where the populations are increasing.  And if we
don’t build those schools as you tear down this system, more people are
going to get frustrated because their kids have to take long rides into
the schools inside the Raleigh belt line, because that’s where the
schools are.  And that’s how we save money over the years, by using the
space that we have rather than just building new schools and abandoning
others.  That’s why our system has been successful, and I hope that you
will vote with me to help keeping it successful, and let’s defeat this
bill.  Let’s save the Wake County school district, and let’s not inject
these things into educating our kids that ought not be part of the
decisions that we make.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, senate bill 201 will

Senator Walters, with what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters has permission to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As most folks know in this chamber, I'm from rural North Carolina and
have a great respect for hunting and been a part of hunting all my life,
but being a member of the forest farmers community and having to go into
the forest every day in a working environment I have concerns about
folks hunting with silencers. It's dangerous. Also, being a landowner in
eastern North Carloina, and living on a farm, we always step outside the
house and if you hear a gunshot go off you know someone's trespassing on
your land. I'm all for hunting, all for the second amendment to bear
arms. I just have huge concerns about using silencers while you're
hunting, so I ask for you not to support the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Tillman, with what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, to ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rambin, do you yield for questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I heard this disgusting judiciary, but I didn't pay as much attention to
it as I should have. Would you tell me senator why we need this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, for a lot of hunters they have experienced hearing loss and I have
a letter from one of my audiologists who said that he has performed
hundreds of hearing examinations on people, and that this bill tends to
?? towards people who have experienced hearing loss from use of firearms
over the years. Typically hunting rifles, generally fired around, with
160 decimals. A suppressed rifle varies based on the specific suppressor
and the type of ammunition, but they typically lowers the decimals to
between 120 to 140 range. Anything above 140 range is when the damage,
which is caused by the rifles, can be permanent damage and it is
irreversible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to comment. Senator Walters, I've got a farm over on ?? county ,and
no the timbers all been sold, but I tend to agree with you. I've had
hunters down there, when we did have a lot of timber, that were hunting
and if they had suppressors I probably wouldn't know they were there and
that concerns me. One of the things that concerns me about this bill, it
is certainly a well intended bill, Senator Rambin, and I</p>

I appreciate you working on it. If you’ve got two groups of hunters down
there, and they don’t hear the others, I believe you, you’re opening
yourself up to another dangerous situation, so thank you, Senator
Randleman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, then, for one reason, the … As far as one reason for
hunting with suppressors is that when you’re getting rid of nuisance
animals such as coyotes or feral hogs, if you’re, when they travel in
packs, you may get off one or two shots and that’s about it because
they’ll scatter. Using a suppressor, you’re able to take more down. But
hunting with a suppressor is not one that you pick, something that you
pick up off the street. You have to go through a process to actually get
a suppressor. You have to make an application to the ATF for a tax paid
transfer and a registration of that firearm, provide a fingerprint card
and a personal photo. You must obtain the signature from the chief law
officer, from your sheriff, pay a $200 transfer fee, and register with
ATF. And that, and if you’re caught with an illegal silencer, it’s a
$10,000 fine and 10 years in prison. This is not something that you
would normally just happen to have. I urge you to support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask the sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Randleman, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Randleman, I heard your explanation, and I have concerns as
well, but I don’t think that many people will be able to get the
silencers. Can you try to clear up how many people will be available to
even get the silencers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, as the Senator explained, it is a process that one has to go
through. They do have to have an extensive background check. They have
to have a photo ID. If you talk about being concerned about silencers
being in the forest, being out in the forest and not being able to hear
these things, well you can still hear a rifle with a suppressor, and the
concern that you should have are the folks that’s out in the woods with
crossbows because I can assure that the people that are out there
hunting with crossbows, you will not hear the crossbow. And the people
who hunt with crossbows, they are very accurate. So you will hear a
suppressed rifle more so than you will hear a crossbow. So I still
appreciate your support.

Senator Walters, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters has the floor to speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ve heard some very good rebuttals here this evening, and ?? …with the
hearing loss, certainly hunters can use ear plugs. I think that’s a very
good way to protect your hearing. But to talk about using a crossbow
versus a high-powered rifle. Your limited distance on a crossbow is
pretty limited versus a high-powered rifle. In the woods, it travels a
long way. So that’s my concern. I mean, every day when we walk in the
woods during hunting season, we blow the horns in pickups and get out of
the truck and start singing, whistling, or do whatever we have to do to
try to let hunters know that we’re there. But if we don’t hear those
gunshots and understand that they’re in the woods hunting as a still
hunt, it’s a danger, and that’s my only concern. It’s not about issuing
silencers. I understand that there’s a long process to obtain a
silencer. That’s not the point. It’s about the safety in the woods.
Thank you.

briefly what it does. It allows the Commissioner of Agriculture, when
there’s an immediate danger coming due to hurricanes or whatever, severe
weather, he can send over a resolution to the governor, and this will
allow the governor to suspend the DOT and Highway Patrol from making
routine stops on vehicles to weigh them or whatever so they can get
their crops out of the field and into the bins or wherever they’re

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Senators this passed the Committee
unanimously.  It’s about commercial driving license. It allows the test
to be given by certified license person on any day of the week. What
really is happening is, if you have another job and you’re trying to get
your commercial driving license, DMV is only open from 8 to 5. But only
certain offices will let you take that driving test.  Therefore, they
need a time to go and take the test that’s outside of the normal working
hours. And this was done before, somehow it was taken out of the law and
now I’d like to put it back in. The other part has to do with extending
the time for temporary license from 20 days to 60 days.  What happens
is, if you go out on a haul on a truck you might be gone several days
and if you come back home and if your license didn’t come in, you don’t
have it, you go out on the next haul.  It doesn’t come in it might be
over 20 days and also if you have an add-on  The person that called me
about this had an add-on for  hazmat.  He was out on a haul, came back,
his license wasn’t there. It made his commercial driving license go to
temporary for 20 days.  The next time he called me, he had pulled his
truck over to the side of the road because he didn’t have his license,
his commercial license because it was tied to the add-on. So he asked me
to see about doing something about 60 days.  I’d appreciate your
support.

When all evidence shows that their incidence of drug abuse are no worse
than the general population using other government services. So where do
we draw the line then? Do we test all school parents of children going
to the public schools? Their incidence of drug abuse are probably
higher, if it were researched. Do we test parents of all scholarship
applicants of all government
scholarships for higher education and community college? Where do we
draw the line?
The fact that this bill has the applicant pay for the test in order to
apply is also a huge negative consequence that we know is going to bear
on how this, the constitutionality of this provision because you are
targeting ninety something percent of applicants who have no connection
to drug abuse whatsoever and also creating a huge barrier for them to
get services for themselves and their children and supportive services
to get to work which is what this program is designed to do.
The impact of this bill, if not the intent, is to hurt the most
vulnerable because they can't fight back. Even if the drug abuser
doesn't apply, you aren't helping him or her get treatment; you're just
punishing their children from getting these needed services. And then if
they test positive, they have to pay for the treatment even though
they're eligible for Medicaid and are already poor because they are
eligible for this program. So clearly the way this bill is designed,
there is no interest in helping.
The result of the impact is to stigmatize and demonize poor people which
is not good for North Carolina and not good for our state and not good
for helping the most vulnerable of our citizens have a chance to get
back to work through this program. Also, the studies in the other states
who have attempted to implement this kind of regime which is almost
exactly like the regime in Florida that's been ruled unconstitutional
has shown that it's no savings to the program if your goal is to cut
public benefits and the people who are applying for public benefits and
the costs far outweigh any savings in the program if that was your goal.
So for that reason I would ask you to vote against this bill and I will
be voting against this bill. In addition, let me say that all the social
service departments in my district, five counties, oppose this bill.

[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister President and members of the Senate. Our drug problem
that we have in this state is not something that we can just stick our
head in the sand and hope goes away. I can go back to what would be my
high school yearbook. The community I grew up in had a, not left before
graduation going to science and math, and I counted it up a couple of
years ago. More than twenty percent of my graduating class has already
served time or lost their life to a drug abuse. And I spend a lot of
time talking to law enforcement in my district and I don't think this
story is very different all across this state.
And I think we have to be aware as to how we are creating and we are
funding this problem in our communities. When an individual can go to
the correct doctor for two dollars and pick up a prescription for three,
actually they don't even have to pay that, and can turn that into nine
hundred dollars of street value for 30 milligram Oxycontins, we are
funding our problem. And when you look at this bill specifically when we
are handing cash payments to individuals who could not pass a drug test,
we are funding our problem in this district and in this state that we
are creating a situation, we're talking economic benefits all the time
about the ??
you put a lump sum cash payment in a drug addict's hands and look how
quickly that can turn over in your community. When they take it to buy
the large bags and break it into the small ones, sell it on the corners
and you've enabled that by creating this funding. Do I believe that this
completely solves the problem? No. But I do believe it's an action we
can take and we must take to help protect our communities from the
damage that we are doing to them by allowing these type of cash front
payments</p>

Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, let me make sure that I'm clear here.  I'm
all supportive of accountability and for drug testing. In jobs that I've
either worked or businesses that I've owned I've had to drug test
individuals so from that concept I don't have a problem with it.  My
question is is it true that we're making these individuals responsible
for paying for their own drug test?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. And the reason why we're doing that,
Senator Ford, is because my presumption is if you the applicant know
you're going to flunk a drug test you're probably not going to apply for
the benefit because you won't get the benefit and in addition to that
you'll have to pay for the drug test that you failed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you yield Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In every situation where I've been the employer and
the employee, as an employer I've been responsible for paying for that
drug test to bring somebody on to my company. Help me understand your
rationale for somebody who is not working  but looking for support from
this state to go to work, has the financial wherewithal to pay for a
drug test up front.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well my presumption is that as an employer you would
prefer not to pay for that drug test and some people don't have to pay
for their drug test.  They have to show proof positive that they passed
a drug test before they're going to be considered for the employment. I
have a lot of employers in my district that say they have to screen
three people to find one that passes the drug test and the drug test
that they pay for is $47.50 for every one of them.  So they would love
to not have that requirement on them and I think we ought to consider
that as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.  To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have fundamental issues with this bill because we're
supposed to be helping folks in this state. We've got an unemployment
rate that is higher than the national average. I'm not opposed to
accountability. I'm not opposed to holding people responsible for their
individual actions.  But if we're going to help put people back to work
I think we ought to do just that.  Not penalize them if they have a
problem.  Look, if they have a problem, if they get hired, it's up to
that employer to be responsible to make sure that they have the right
person working for them and again at every job I've either worked at
that required it or when I've been the employer I have paid for that
drug test.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? Senator Goolsby, for
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I hear Senator Ford's concerns and I would direct him
to the bill itself, Section B, that actually says that for an applicant
or current recipient who tests negative for controlled substances the
Department shall increase the amount of initial workforce program
assistance by the amount paid by the applicant or recipient for the drug
testing.  So in fact if you test negative you do get into the workforce
program. You get your cash benefits, making sure that you're not a drug
addict and you get your job training and you get the money back that you
paid for it.  I also heard one of the prior Senator's comments and I saw
some figures on line that 98% of the people in the Florida test actually
tested negative and I heard opponents of these types of bills say well
what are you doing here?  You're just wasting money. Well as Senator
Davis wisely pointed out you'd have to be pretty high to spend your own
money to take a test that you know you would fail. So again I think that
shows that this is very effective that 98% of the people that are coming
forward to do this are not on drugs and those that do test positive the
way this legislation is set up they actually are able to enroll in a
drug treatment program if they successfully pass that  and they get
tested again and test negative they are then able to go right back into
the program.  Otherwise they have to wait a year. I think this is wise
legislation. I am in support of it and I would, like Senator Davis, urge
you to support it.

that it's overly broad because the way this bill is interpreted and I

would be required to submit to a drug test it's not simply the
applicant.  It's also the applicant's spouse.  It's also</p>

Anybody in the applicant's household. So if grandma or grandpa are
living there or you got kids there that are eighteen, twenty years old
who may for one reason or another be experimenting with drugs, none of
us approve of it. But all of those persons are subject to drug testing
under this bill. It's not just the applicant. All of those other
individuals. And if they have to be submitting to drug testing, to be
candid with you, it not only imposes a financial burden upon them but
it's going to impose a financial burden upon these counties because
ultimately it becomes an unfunded mandate for these counties.
And for those reasons I think this bill just goes far, far too broadly
to cover a group of individuals other than the applicant who is applying
for benefits. You are talking about the applicant? There's some people
who might be open. But when you start reaching that far out in this net,
it captures the spouse, the grandma, the grandpa, anybody else in the
household. And we are looking at multigenerational households frequently
that may be subject to this type of condition. I think you've got a bill
here that really needs to be rethought before it moves forth.

Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President and members of this assembly, I too understand the
importance of substance abuse testing. I know a lot of people and some
of our agencies we do random testing and that's the way it is. And I too
want our children to have the best families and live in drug free
environments too Senator Davis, and I think you are sincere about that.
But if we want to have standards for people who receive state assistance
then we need to have it for all of us who receive state assistance. And
so therefore Mister President, In Kansas the governor recently felt the
same way and he said we've got to do something about this drug problem
and I do too.
I wish we had enough drug treatment centers because where I live, we've
got a lot of people lined up but not enough centers to fund that
treatment. So we need to do something about that. But the other thing is
that what the Governor said is he needed to handle that with the general
public but it was already implemented at the executive level, at the
official level, etc. And so therefore I want to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, do all the members have copies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can send forward your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Because I think that we as policymakers ought to adhere to the law. If
we're going to make the policies in this state
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me read the amendment in before we discuss it please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson is recognized the explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mister Chair and I was continuing to explain what the Governor
did. But I will move directly to the amendment. The amendment amends the
bill to say that the drug screening will be required of work force
assistants as well as for certain public officials. And it would require
that we as members of the General Assembly, Constitution officers
including the Governor, heads of all
principal state departments are screened annually. And you can read the
rest of it. And that the drug test would be administered prior to taking
an oath of office and you can see the rest of that. Now I think that's
imperative because we are saying that we receive state funds, we
represent the law, we institute policy, so it should not be above any of
us to submit to drug screening. I
recommend your support of this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator David, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the amendment sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Who's going to pay for these drug tests?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have to pay for it if you are requiring the other people to pay for
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, what if I test negative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you test</p>

Excuse me.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Robinson, do you yield [inaudible]
[Speaker Changes]
What if I test negative
[Speaker Changes]
If you test negative, maybe you can put in amendment to get your money
back out of your subsistence allowance, Senator Davis.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. President, I’d like to speak to the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Davis has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
I’d like to just say here, and now that any time that anyone wants to
have me drug-tested and if I test negative, you pay it. I’d be glad to
do so. Reason why I chose to never use those kinds of drugs is I didn’t
figure I had any brain cells to spare. And I think that this, we’ve got
to start with this somewhere and if Senator Robinson wants to put in a
bill to require all those individuals to submit to a drug test, that’s
fine. I’d be glad to support it, just so long as if I test negative, I
don’t have to pay for it. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes]
Any further discussion today (in audible) requesting before the senate.
Senator Apodaca (inaduble) requests for the Is.

[Speaker Changes]
Senator Apodaca is recognized, explain the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, Mr. President, I’ve heard some very good debate and it did
trigger something in my mind. I think we need to look at this and have a
report sent to us by the July 1st of next year and see how this bill’s
working. So what I do, is I add a new section to the bill, page 2, line
[inaudible].
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. President, Point of Order
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. President, I have the floor I’m not yielding right now.

Senator (inaudible)
[Speaker Changes]
Do we have a problem with the amendment being discussed?
[Speaker Changes]
Members have copies.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. President, no they don’t. If I read it, if they can’t comprehend
what I read, I’d be happy to hand them one, if they need it.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Apodaca, you have the floor.
[Speaker Changes]
This same Senator (inaudible) I move that we recess for 10 minutes and
provide him a copy. That’s a motion.
[Speaker Changes]
Inaudible Senate stands in recess for 10 minutes.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. President
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Apodaca
[Speaker Changes]
Just an announcement while we’re killing trees, it’s on your dashboard
right now, but we’ll make copies also.
[Speaker Changes]
Senate will come to order
[Speaker Changes]
Everbody should now have copies of the amendment on their desk as well
as on their dashboard. Senator Apodaca is recognized to explain the
amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members, Mr. President, If I might in
Accouncement, out of order.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Apodaca has the floor for an announcement out of order.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr.President, Members I want you to know this is the last time
we’ll be providing written copies of amendments on the floor. As of the
end of March, when they’re available on your dashboard, that’s where it
will be. So if you need a written copy have your staff get you one or
something but from here on it will be on the dashboard. So, Thank you.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. President, would the Gentlemen yield to a question?
[Speaker Changes]
Yes
[Speaker Changes]
On those written amendments that some of us need, when they’re
hand-written and offered up like that, will we be able to take a recess
until we can get a written copy of it ourselves, as opposed to getting
one and passing it out like we’ve done down here for centuries?
[Speaker Changes]
Well we, Senator Nesbitt, changed that last month, we said we’d be going
totally electronic. And the Clerk’s office has prepared to put it on the
dashboard immediately. It’ll be even quicker than being written and
passed out. So, I think right now, once it’s on the dashboard, that’s
considered handed out.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Apodaca is recognized to explain the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, Mr. President. On page 2, line 31 and after the line, adding
a new section to read, “The department of health and human services
shall report to the general assembly no later than July 1st, 2014 on the
importance of, implementation of this act. Somebody writes worse than I
do. So, that’s what it is. I ask for your support.
[Speaker Changes]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Nesbitt.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Most residents in these small towns, rural areas, don’t read the New
York Times or the Wall Street Journal. Even the news in the Observer,
the Greensboro Record, or the Charlotte Observer. But they do read their
local paper from cover to cover. These paper carry, little league
baseball, achievements such as an Eagle Scout award, several pages of
church news, local sports, accomplishments like the Aquinas Citizens of
the Year, school and senior events,. They learn about their neighbors
from these papers. They also cover local school board meetings, town
council and county commissioner meetings. All free of charge. And
remember those pages of delinquent taxpayers that we all look through?
That publishing yields much more return to the cities and the counties
than cost.  At one point, when I had five counties, I took twelve
newspapers, and I want to show you a couple I take right now. This is
the Chatham Record. And here we have a chicken plant that’s closed down
putting a lot of people out of work. And they got two or three articles
about that. There’s an article there, about the opening of the county
courthouse that had suffered a fire. Here’s a local judge who had run in
the marathon and [??’ say he was okay. We have a hundred and eight year
old Chatham resident. We have local farmers gathering endangered
honeybees. Not that’s what they call the front section. Then we have the
news of town. Eight pages of sports. Here’s the news of [??]. Here’s a
local baseball player who gets honors. At Mount Olive College. We have
the Board of Commissioners meeting. And on and on it goes. So why am I
concerned about this Bill? Yes it’s a local Bill. But I want to tell you
it’s the fourth one that’s come through since I have been here. Now the
County Commissioners Association on the League of [??] want to cease
publication at certain newspapers. This is the camel’s nose under the
tent. Because as I have said, there are three four communities in the
past, and have asked, and no longer have to publish legal notices.
Instead they want to publish their legal notices on their websites where
few people will see them. And some of these websites are sometimes down,
they’re not current leaving people without any information. How many
people including us browse our local government websites? If you got a
choice between Mad Men and your local government website, when you’re
tired at the end of the day. Which one are you going to look at? So very
importantly, the laws of revenue could put some of these newspapers out
of business. And I think that this is something that is very serious.
Our government, our Constitution was founded on newspapers, if you will.
The photo less papers. Our Revolution depended on local newspapers. The
five small newspapers I called tell me their revenue from legal ads
range from fifteen hundred to three thousand dollars a week. Without
that income, they could not continue the coverage they provide to their
communities for free. All of the local government meetings are covered.
School boards, county commissioners, if they have a town council, and
that is a very serious loss. Finally, these are small businesses. And I
mean small businesses.  We had a couple of people who talked to the
committee as a mom and pop. The husband and wife run that small town
newspaper. We talk all the time around here about jobs. You’re going to
put these small newspapers out of business, slowly but surely. We always
talk about jobs. We talk about small business. Here’s an opportunity to
show that we really mean it. At their committee hearing, there were
twenty publishers from small town newspapers, all over the State. Who
would come to voice their objection and opposition to this Bill? I
intend to vote against it.

we’re getting it clarified and we’re getting that on the dashboard right
now. Senators, the corrected copy of the amendment with the correct
number is now on the dashboard. Senator Barringer is recognized...the
clerk will read. I’m sorry, we haven’t read it in yet. The clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer moves to amendment the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. This very amendment demonstrates that this truly is
a local bill. In my county of Wake, I was requested by the town of
Rolesville, to not be included in this particular bill. This amendment
does remove the town of Rolesville from the bill. In addition, the town
of Wake Forest would like to be removed, but they don’t need to be
because I learned something in this whole process several weeks ago. If
a county is partially in one county and not totally in Wake county, they
are not included, so neither is the town of Wake Forest included in this
bill. I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there and further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot has the floor to speak on the amendment.

Members of the Senate, I represent the town of Rolesville entirely and I
urge you to support the amendment. I’ve spoken with their mayor and
they’re fine with this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there and further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the passage amendment one. All in favor vote aye,
all opposed vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The
clerk will record the vote.
45 having voted in the affirmative and 4 in the negative, amendment one

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I want to clarify colleagues from Guilford county, where I
also represent. This was not a unanimous request. It came up from one
individual and was kind of re-amended to put in as legislation. There
are several small newspapers who adamantly object because they work with
citizens, or at least the publications go to citizens, who cannot get in
that paper and reading it. A lot of them are elderly and they’re worse
than some of us in here who don’t use electronic media. We’re already
having trouble with some of ya’ll in here. But some of the people who
receive the local papers, the small papers, don’t use electronic media.
They can’t on those small papers, so I object and I hope that you won’t
vote for this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there and further discussion or debate?

And I want to applaud Senator Wade for bringing this forward. Let’s be
very frank, everyone, how many people read their newspaper today and
read the ads about government action of whatever other than the fact
that Senator Kinnaird’s talking about a farmer or whoever else. Nobody
reads that part. Let’s be frank about it. What this does is allows the
towns that have some flexibility to be able to decide how to best get
their message out to their public. That’s what we’re trying to do. We’ve
been accused of being evil to the towns and municipalities. We’re giving
them freedom, some flexibility to act according...</p>

Senator Walters, for what purpose do you rise?

To debate the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know, I think tonight we've shown that, with this amendment, that
this is just fragmenting our state. We've got some towns that won't,
some towns that don't, and so, at the end of the day, the general public
doesn't know what's going on any more. And I have a huge concern -- and
I talk a lot about Rowland,  North Carolina -- we just don't have the
internet accessibility to be able to get those internet connections that
you need to visit those government websites. And yes, there are some
offices that still run on paper, Senator Apodaca, it's a wonderful thing
in our life; it's a renewable resource.  So I would just ask that we
continue to give ?? and not fragment this state, with some towns doing
it one way, and some doing it another, it's just going to be very
confusing at the end of the day. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is truly a local bill for my constituents. I was approached in the
delegation meeting for my constituent municipalities to bring forward
this bill. And in looking at the amount of money, it's about government
efficiency, and government choice, and government closest to the people
making the decisions. Just in Wake County alone, with Wake County,
Fuquay, Holly Springs, Cary and Morrisville, almost $180,000 a year is
used for these notices. That's five public school teachers. I think we
have better uses in a municipality -- in, for example, Morrisville, who
was the first to request this, ninety-three percent of their residents
have internet access. Ninety-five percent have high-speed internet
access. Holly Springs, who desperately wants this option, actually has
free wi-fi in the town of Holly Springs, and so even if you don't have a
computer, if you have a smartphone, you can access this. Morrisville
already has a wonderful web page with a link for its notices right on
the front, and Cary, who's had this opportunity, this option, for a long
time, has done so wonderfully with the same kind of home page button. If
we're freed from the per word pricing, our municipalities, so that they
can go online, they can be more specific in what they're giving notices
for, and even put maps up and different things like that. And so this
truly is a local bill that gives municipalities options. It's not a
mandate of what they have to do, it's what they have a choice of. Thank
you very much. I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will Senator Barringer yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. I'm trying to piece this together on the computer,
but the section that we are amending, or the bill itself, takes the
towns of Garner and Knightdale out of some act of whatever session laws
2786 was --
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, I see what you're talking about. Are you talking about the
Rolesville amendment, the 6.5 amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, no, I'm talking about the bill itself, because I'm trying to see
whether something needs to be included with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I had that same question as well. Senator, what that means is, see,
already Apex, Cary, Garner and Knightdale have this ability. And since
they are within the confines, completely, of the county of Wake, they
are not needed any longer in that session law in that respect. The town
of Cary needs to stay there, because one of the things I learned is the
town of Cary is actually in two counties, not just one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I see. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I like to change a vote on the amendment, I voted no and
would like to be recorded as an aye.
