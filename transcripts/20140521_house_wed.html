The house will come to order. Members, please take your seats. Visitors,
please retire from the chamber. Members and visitors in the gallery,
please silence all cellular phones and personal electronic devices.
[pause]
Members and visitors in the gallery, please stand for the prayer and
remain standing for the Pledge of Allegiance.
Before Representative Ramsey says the prayer, I believe many of you know
that Representative Jim Gulley passed away today. And in the prayer I
hope you will keep him and his family in your thoughts and prayers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May you pray with me. This is an excerpt from our
state magazine. A prayer for North Carolina by Dr. Billy Graham.
Heavenly Father, we pause to worship you and give thanks for the mighty
works of your hands. We praise you for the blessing of our state in this
country with a spiritual heritage that anchored a new nation made up of
a people determined to seek and obey your truth.
Receive our thanks, Lord, as we remember those who came before us. From
the first American Indian exploring an uncharted wilderness, to the
pilgrims who came to this land seeking freedom to worship the God of
Heaven and Earth And our Founding Fathers who built new life upon your
loving commandments and holy scriptures.
Thank you, Lord, for gathering of families who came to live on the good
land that we call North Carolina. You have graced us with a magnificence
of your handiwork seen in the strength of the mighty ocean that brushes
the Outer Banks and Sandy Shores. The loveliness of the Appalachian
Mountains that pierce the clouds of Heaven and the peaceful scenery of
the rolling plains of the Piedmont. These are just glimpses of what you
long to give mankind. Your strength, your love, your peace.
Let us hold up your truth so that you will lead us. Help us to be quite
in contemplation and bold to do your will. For as you lead us in the
way, we in turn can point others to your truth that brings abundant
life.
You, Lord, are the giver of all good things and this is the reason for
our hope of eternal life. Salvation from our sin against you. The most
high God in the heavens. Though we did not deserve your favor, you
graciously granted to all who sincerely call upon the name in which I
pray, the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of America and to the republic for which it stands, one Nation, under
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

people's (Representative) names except for the first ?? which was half a
word clipped into. If this is correct spelling &quot;North
Carolinians&quot; then don't worry about that. If it is not correct then
it will need correcting in the text. The rest is at least 99% perfect. I
would say 100% but who's perfect? Thank you. btw, I am Alabamian. The
speakers sounded local to me :-)
?? eight hundred thousand veterans by nations armed forces lived in
North Carolina and about a hundred and fort seven thousand active duty
guard and reserved military personnel reside in the state making North
Carolina one of the largest active duty military populations in our

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
ladies and gentlemen, members in the gallery. this is an opportunity for
us as a body to thank our veterans for all that they have done. upon
enlistment in the army or any of the armed services or commissioning as
an officer an oath is taken to support and defend the constitution of
the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic. everyone who
has ever worn an uniform has take that oath and they have lived into
that oath. placed themselves in dangers way often being shot blown up
losing limbs being injured in ways that you can't imagine seeing things
that no one should ever have to see. this resolution is mere piece of
paper. its a small token of our true appreciation for what the men and
women of the armed forces of the United States have done for us. still
today overseas and for the last several hundred years since this country
has been around. we are truly an exceptional nations. we have a
volunteer armed force which freely enters into the contract. I would
just like to thank every veteran who's ever served. I would like us to
remember all of the families who've lost people the families who've
suffered on multiple deployments, when husbands fathers wives sisters
brothers have been deployed overseas not knowing if their coming home in
one piece or even when they're coming home. its an opportunity for us to
say thank you. now we just ask the members and everyone who hears these
words to not just take this one moment to say thank you but every time
you see a veteran to say thank you every time you see someone still
serving in the armed forces say thank you. they don't even have to know
what you're thanking them for. take that moment and thank them for the
lives that we are able to live as Americans in this great country of
ours.

Representative [Gary martin ??] please state your purpose.

the gentlemen is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you very much Mister Speaker, members let me first begin by
echoing part of the comments of the gentlemen from Cumberland that while
we do honor veterans today that its every bit of important that we
remember the families that sacrifice so much also along with the
veterans. one of the greatest bits of satisfactions I've gotten from my
military service is experiencing the diversity of America's military
that reflects the diversity of our society. until I joined the army I
don't even think I knew that Yankees actually existed. but theres
nothing better than sitting out on the docks and wait for Representative
??'s air force to show up late and pick you up. and have a chance to sit
there and talk to paratroopers from around the country, listen to them
talk about why they joined the army. what their goals were where they've
served what they've seen and to hear their plans for the future. what a
joy it was for me to get to the North Carolina house of Representatives
and find some of the same great experiences amongst my fellow veterans
here in the house. I'm not an authority on history I think
Representative Dewey Hill was our last World War Two veteran. and then
moving ahead to the Korean era Representative Mickey McShaw who joined
the army in 1952 the newly desegregated army what stories he has to tell
about his experiences. then Representative Rodger West served in the
Navy in Vietnam moving ahead to desert storm with Jim Fulghum and then
of course former Representative Ric Killian who as far as I know is the
only member of this body to actually go off to war while serving in this
body.</p>

Senator Jeff ????
From the county
Join me as an Afghanistan veteran in the General Assembly also. And I'd
encourage those of you members here to seek out the other veterans in
this body and hear our stories and talk to us also. But my main point in
this listing of our different members who have served is for the
veterans up there, and the veterans listening out of state, particularly
the young veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. You've answered your
country's call once but your country needs you again to step up ,
whether it's to serve on your town council, or to serve as Governor,
Senator, or in the House of Representatives, whatever. Please answer
your country's call again and once again seek out public service. I
commend the resolution to you.
Representative West, please state your purpose.
To speak to the Resolution, Mr. President.
??? to debate the resolution.
Thank you Mr Speaker and members of the House. It's a privilege today
for me to be here to honor our veterans who have sacrificed and given so
much so that we can enjoy the freedoms that we have today, and that is
great. But on a personal note, in my district I'm honored to have a
veteran, a WWII veteran who is one of two living veterans that is still
survived the Batan Death March. Representative Pierce, the other one is
John Mims[sp?] from down in Hope County. The member that's in my
district's name is Wayne Carringer. Wayne has been around for a number
of years, and he is presently in Ashville over in the George Charles VA
medical center. He's living there, but he gets to come home some and he
enjoys politics. I send him papers all the time to read over at the
medical center. Now the medical center's another story out in the
mountains. It's called the George Charles Medical Center, and George
Charles was a member of the eastern band of the Cherokee Indians. And he
was one of five American Indians that received the Medal of Honor and
that VA clinic is named after him. So I just want to say thank you to
all the veterans. What you mean to me and I commend the resolution to
you, Mr Speaker.
Representative Horne Please State your purpose.
To debate the the resolution.
The Senator is recognized to debate the resolution.
Thank you Mr Speaker. With so many young people today not eligible or
not willing to serve in the uniform we are all often asked, So why did
we serve? We wanted to give back a small portion of what we have been
given. We want to let our children know what it means to live in the
land of the brave and the home of the free, or maybe it's the other way
around. We want others to realize what a tremendous honor it is to live
in this country. And because we realize what a privilege it is to be an
American and to take steps to serve and protect the very freedoms upon
which this nation was founded. Service to country is not necessarily
linked to combat. Although I served in a time of war, in two tours
overseas I was not directly assigned to a combat unit, but I can say
that I fully appreciate the sentiment expressed by Winston Churchill
when he said &quot;There is no more exhilarating feeling than being shot
at without result.&quot; Those that serve, and have served, are men and
women from every background and every walk of life. We all knew the
price of freedom can be very high but we were willing to put our lives
on the line for something that mattered more than just ourselves.
Although those who have borne the cost of battle still carry a heavier
burden, we all can rightly say that we have served our country. Serving
our country meant that we gave up our normal lives. School, family,
careers, work force development to do something beyond ourselves. The
same can be said for veterans of many types of national service. This is
the very essence of what makes us a great nation. As long as we have
warriors ready to live and die for the ideals for which America stands,
we will continue to be the greatest nation that has ever existed. We
have fought around the world, not as conquerors, but as liberators. Not
for conquest, but for ideals, and not for treasure, but because it was
the right thing to do. Today we honor the lives of those who have served
this great nation in our Armed Forces, some of whom have paid the
ultimate price.</p>

By doing everything that we can do to uphold the values and ideals that
we all hold dear in this nation and to instill those values and ideals
in our children, our grandchildren, and our communities.  Yesterday
representative Cleveland, said freedom is not free, emotion generated by
simply saying those words quite frankly is almost more than I can bear.
It's the reason a tear rolls down my cheek almost every time I hear our
National Anthem.  We stand in awe of the heroic men and women of the
United States military who have served or are currently serving a
grateful nation in thousands of locations around this world.  On this
very day, at this very moment, American men and women stand in a breach
as a human buffer for a common influence, in desperate places and in
desperate circumstances and sometimes there is a fierce and relentless
force.  With no time for second guesses, no do-overs, no
reconsideration's, no amendments, no PCS's, no proposed committee
substitutes.  Ladies and gentlemen I am proud to be an American and an
American veteran, living in a land that provides the brightest speak-en
of hope and freedom in the world.  We all here commit ourselves and
certainly intend to see that we can continue to shine brightly for years
and generations to come, I commend the resolution to your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES; speak on resolution] Ladies and Gentlemen I can't help
but notice when we do this it seems like just about everybody who speaks
about the resolution is a veteran.  And that's great and that's
wonderful, they appreciate their fellow veterans, I just feel like its
time for one of us who's not a veteran to stand up and say thank you for
my freedom.  We appreciate you so much  and I'm not a veteran myself but
a lot of them have been in my family my dad was navy world war 2, my son
who was here yesterday served in Iraq in the National Guard.  I lost my
dear cousin Bobby Bulla from Ashboro in Vietnam.  Let me just say that
you guys from Vietnam you did not lose that war it was taken from you.
But, we appreciate you so much because we know if it weren't for you we
would not still have the freedom of self government that we are
exercising in this great place.  So God Bless, my wife kind of dreads
when we go to Walmart me seeing a Veteran or a group of Veterans around
because she's afraid shes never going to get me out of Walmart because I
got to talk to all of them and thank them.  And if I haven't had a
chance to talk to you today I'm sorry but I do thank you from the bottom
of my heart.  And I've seen occasionally when somebody in a uniform
would be in a restaurant, and somebody would go over and pay their bill
for them.  They've done that for my son, and I've had the privilege of
doing that occasionally.  And that is nothing, good to do, but nothing
compared to what you've done for us and we thank you so much God Bless
you.  [Speaker Changes; representative Floyd debate resolution] Mr.
Speaker, I just wanted to say that I'm proud to serve this great nation.
 If it was not for the military, and a lot of you have heard me say this
before, my father 3rd grade education, my mother 8th grade education, my
father was employed at the Pepsi Cola plant but he wanted one of his 7
kids to go to college.  So he talked to the owner of the Pepsi Cola
plant and shared that with the manager and the manager said why not let
your son volunteer to go into the army,  to get the GI bill to use to go
to college?  If it was not for the GI bill, I would not be here today,
sitting in this chamber nor would I have finished Varbit?? State
University.  But going into the army, many of you all have not
experienced this and representative Jetta?? mentioned yesterday that he
was about the same age as long as representative Stan?? has been
married.  Well he experienced taken a shower, I'm sure he has, but when
we were growing up if you noticed we had what you call a round tub.  A
round tub that 7 of us took a shower in.  I did not know how to turn the
shower on when we got into the barracks.</p>

Never taken a shower before. Never knew how to shave. Didn't experience
none of that. Didn't even know how to dress and put on a necktie. But
the army taught me all of those things. Did not know it, but today I'm
proud to have served in the United States Army. And had the opportunity
??? to fly a plane. To ride in a plane, let me say that. Never in my
life, being 17 and a half, 18 years old,  going into service had the
opportunity to get in a plane, the military. Never had the opportunity
to get on a  ship. The military, when they sent me to Paris, France. The
best duty assignment that anyone could get. Anyone, anyone with common
sense would want to be stationed in Paris, France, if you understand the
French life and how they live. Not any Marine Corps can land there, but
the Army can. And I'm proud because as I look at you all today, and look
at you that serve and the proud that you have I walked back home after I
got out of the military, and put that uniform on and see the young
ladies that didn't look at me when I was in high school, smile at me. I
was just honored just to wear the uniform, but I'm proud to have served
in the United States Army and I commend this ??? to you.

Members of this great house, I have a celebrity in my district. Last
week, and he has chosen to come and share with us today, I'm going to
give you part of the story, and I'm going to let the speaker give you
the rest of the story. This person was born and raised in eastern North
Carolina, currently lives in my district, in Murphysboro, North
Carolina. I'm going to refer to him as Mr. D. He was a 20 year old
leading a group of about 30 men into a battle, many one or two years
younger than he. And remember, I said he was only about 20. They dropped
the gate, and there were so many getting killed going out the front, Mr
D said I hollered and told them to go over the side of the boat. That
decision saved several lives, but a five foot seven inch, about a
hundred and ten pounds nearly ended his own life. I went over the side
of the boat. When I did, I went to the bottom. He said, I had 60 pounds
on me, and I was over my head. Two men were with me and they were six
feet tall. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't be here today. They pulled
at my shoulders and pulled me up to keep my head above water. Mr D made
it to shore but then had to make it to the base of the cliff. That was
forty yards, four hundred yards, rather, further. He crawled inch by
inch, his bayonet in front of him, and while he searched for land mines,
Mr D and two of his men made it to the cliff, but many were left behind.
We decided we had to go back and help the guys hurt and in the water.
They were in pretty bad shape. Mr D made the trip back through the
water, passing dead and mortally wounded soldiers along the way.
Fourteen of his men didn't make it. Holding a dead soldier that was
dying, asking for his mom, Mr D said &quot;I want&quot;, he said
&quot;to see my mother&quot;. All he could tell him was someday you will
see your mother. That was the worst part of it, and I think about it
often. Mr D was wounded by shrapnel the next day. He was injured three
more times in the route to and in the Battle of the Bulge. He received
four purple hearts for his injuries.</p>

you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hastings please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
the gentlemen recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr
speaker i originally had intended to do this as a moment of personal
privilege, but it seems appropriate now to go ahead and mention this to
the members. Those of you that know me for a number of years know that I
used to do veterans work for congress. And as part of that
responsibility we had to visit many of our cemeteries in the state. And
those of you members of the house know that your responsible for funding
state cemeteries for veterans. But the real reason i stood to speak
today that i was going to do as a port of personal privilege is to
mention Arlington national cemetery. and as you know were in a
commemorative period for the 150th anniversary of Arlington national
cemetery and some might wonder why we would discuss a federal cemetery,
but of course you all know that we have many North Carolinians who have
been buried there. As so, I appreciate the privilege to be able to
mention the 150th anniversary of Arlington national cemetery mr speaker
and i commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative

for us to reflect back in history so were not destined to repeat it as
it were. Ide like to take us back just a little bit further. If we go
back just for a moment to march 4th 1865. and i think some of the words
that a gentlemen spoke on that day in his second novel ring ever so true
once again today. and ill just use with the closing of his remarks that
have been known as the with malice toward none remark. at the end of
those remarks he states to kill for him who shall have been born the
battle and for his widow and his orphan i think its time that we fully
and completely own up to presidents Lincolns promise on his second
novel. thank you mr speaker [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Witmire

In my role as the NORTHCOM liaison to North Carolina for emergency
response, I see the best of our best currently serving on active duty
and in the Reserves and in the Guard. But also, I think back to
grandparents and many people who were so influential in many of our
lives.  The Greatest Generation and those who followed, who are
ultimately the reason we have our freedoms and have protected our way of
life and to that I am eternally grateful. I want you to know that this
body has several measures that we have done and we continue to pursue.
We'll seek out to protect our military interests, but also interests
that serve our veterans, and also serve many other interests. We will be
dedicated and diligent with that. And I will close by echoing
representative Greer Martin's words with, in your communities, and maybe
not just at the local level but higher up, with your dedication and your
discipline and your experience and your care, skill and diligence for
what makes this nation great, be involved, take leadership roles.  Thank
you much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative ??, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Speaker, I want a resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I spent 20 years in the Marine Corps, I actually
enjoyed myself most of that time. My son joined the Marines, we were
actually Marines together for my last year and a half, before I retired.
My grandson just joined the Navy, he leaves for boot camp in July. I
have an uncle that just passed away from Korea, that we buried at Camp
Lejeune cemetery out there. A lot of family in the military, a lot of
friends here that were in the military. Anyone that was in the military
knows that there's no place where you kind find humor better than with a
bunch a guys in the military. Every one of them's got a good sense of
humor, and it doesn't matter how long they've been out, they still got a
good sense of humor. I was standing in a line in New Bern, waiting on
the folks coming back from the World War II memorial, these were all
World War II veterans, and their trip was paid for for them, for the
only time in their life to actually see the memorial up there for them.
And I was standing in line, and I had a sign, and it said, thank you for
your service. And as they came by, most of these folks in their 80s and
90s, and I would say, thank you for your service. Thank you for, I told
one gentleman, I said, thank you for my freedom. Now, this guy had to be
mid-80s at least, I said thank you for my freedom, and he leans over,
and he goes, well, to tell you the truth, I was fighting for mine, he
said, but I'm glad it worked out for you. I recommend this resolution to
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Ladies and gentlemen, if the chair may take a point of
personal privilege, today we had several veterans with us, we had the
fourth meeting in four years. When the veterans came here when I first
became Speaker, we decided to create a tradition where we have all of
the vets come into the chamber, and if you think about it, the only
reason we have this chamber is because of their past sacrifices. And we
had a great time, but I think the think that struck me the most is that
these veterans are not just here for this resolution, they're here
fighting for other veterans, and they're here fighting to make sure that
we take care of our veterans. They have a very well documented
legislative agenda, one that I happen to think is rational and important
and one that I believe on a bipartisan basis we support. And I know that
they came to express their appreciation for the good work that you all
have done, and there's much more to do. We do certainly appreciate their
service. Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before
the House is the adoption of House Resolution 1130. All in favor, vote
aye, all opposed, vote no. The clerk will open the vote. All members
wishing to vote, please do so, and please watch their vote.
Representative Gill. The clerk will open the machine to record the vote.
116 having voted in the affirmative, none in the negative, House
Resolution 1130 has been adopted, will be ordered printed.  Ladies and

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Clerk will read the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Whereas the health of our citizens is the foundation
for a caring and productive society and our future rests with our
ability to adequately treat and ?? to prevent a variety of illnesses
including high blood pressure and whereas heart disease and stroke are
the second and fourth leading causes of death in North Carolina and high
blood pressure also known as hypertension is a major and modifiable risk
factor for heart disease  and stroke and is a major contributor to adult
disability and whereas in 2011 32.4% of North Carolina adults reported a
health professional telling them that they had high blood pressure. And
whereas current awareness and treatment for high blood pressure is not
adequate and whereas about seven out of every ten people having their
first heart attack..</p>

have high blood pressure and about eight out of every ten people having
their first stroke have high blood pressure and whereas adequate medical
treatment sand proven preventive health strategies such as healthy
lifestyle that include a low salt diet with more fruits and vegetables
are beneficial and whereas high blood pressure patients who are treated
earlier have a longer life expectancy and whereas education can help
with early diagnosis, prevention, and better treatment and whereas the
North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services recognizes that
the prevention and management of high blood pressure will require the
collective effort of health care providers, other community members and
organizations and patients and families and whereas the Justice War on
Heart Disease and Stroke Presentation Task Force, the American Heart
Association, the American Stroke Association, the North Carolina Academy
of Family Physicians, the Consortium of Southeastern Hypertension
Control, and the Carolina Senate for Medical Excellence are
organizations that have agreed to support the hypertension high blood
pressure awareness day schedule for Wednesday May 21 2014. And these
partners along with other North Carolina organizations seek ways to
improve health for the citizens of North Carolina by improving
prevention and treatment of health blood pressure through support of
education, advocacy, and awareness and have therefore be it resolved by
the house of representatives. Section 1 of the house of representatives
joins the Justice War on Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force
and other organizations mentioned in this resolution in recognizing the
third Wednesday in May to be hypertension high blood pressure awareness
day and urges all citizens in the state of North Carolina to recognize
the seriousness of this disease and the meritorious work of public

treatment of this disease. Section 2 this resolution is effective upon
adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Carney please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady has recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
house, the resolution says what it is I want to send out a special thank
you to Representative Dr. Folgium for co-sponsoring this resolution with
me, it's one of those that everybody in here should sign on to and have
your name out there in support of prevention and hypertension awareness
day. A big thank goes to our governor who signed a proclamation
declaring the third Wednesday of May hypertension high blood pressure
issue awareness day, that's a big step. As most of you know, health and
heart disease and prevention, stroke prevention are near and dear to me
as it is to many of you that we have talked about this issue. The key is
prevention, the key is understanding the statistics that are out there.
The heart isn't worn on the outside of the body so we don't see it where
we see other diseases that might affect people that are more visible but
it is a high issue in our state as a killer so I encourage you if you
did not go today and have your blood pressure taken, I did I know I a
lot of you did, please do that. Please make sure that you check. Those
little cups are inexpensive, you can keep them in your home and check
yourself periodically especially after you've had a week up here. Go
home and check yourself, it's an issue that we should all be aware of
and all of our family members should be aware of and I always have to
add, put that salt shaker down, it's not good for you. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Folgium please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Comment on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman has recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you sir. Some of you may know that I had a renal
transplant in 2006, my blood pressure was 140 over 90. For several
years, little bit on the high side. I did some things that were probably
making it worse at times, some of the surgical things I got into
occasionally made me a little nervous. I wound up with hypertension from
nephrosclerosis, whatever that is. But it turned out to be that really
one of the basic causes of it is mild regressive hypertension.</p>

How did the gentleman's blood pressure test go today?

It was high, so hopefully we'll make it to Thursday and I can get it
calmed down a little bit.
Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I asked those who have maybe had a blood
test over the last three months, and we had about 80 lights on. I'd ask
now, I understand many of you went. If you've had a blood test over the

Out of curiosity, I assume you have your blood pressure tested today,
how did your test go?
Like every time in my life, average to above average.
Thank you. You really ought to consider mountain biking.
Representative Richardson, please state your purpose.
To correct the fact that my light was not working, but I have had a
blood test. As a matter of fact, I had it today, but I have had one in
the last three months. But my light wasn't working when you called for
the answer, so I would like to correct that.
Representative Richardson, I noticed that several lights that were not
on yesterday were on, and I think that that's great because we as
members kind of have to walk the talk and I think that each and every
one of us doing that every time you have an opportunity to go to a CVS
or something else is very easy to do. There's no excuse. It's too easy
and it's lifesaving.  Ladies and Gentleman, upon motion of

therefore, there have never been any experience of what constitutes a

add, just as we did yesterday for real estate properties that were in

simple exclude or clarify that an automated teller machine or cash
dispenser is not a business location, so I urge your support for the
bill and the amendment, thank you. (Speaker Changes) Further discussion

Representative Pierce is recognized to send forth an amendment. The
Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pierce moves to amend
the Bill on page 12, lines 38 and 39, by inserting the following between
those lines. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman is recognized to debate the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. I’ve got a
couple calls from folks down my way, down round across the state,
dealing with county fairs, asking to be exempt from the admission sales
tax. I just wanted to just share a few reasons. Many of our ag. fairs
are owned and operated by non-profits – American Legion, Lions Clubs,
Rotary Clubs and all their volunteer members. Many of the volunteers are
youth and senior citizens. Trying to handle the necessary compliance ??
these tax would be cumbersome upon senior volunteers. Fairs provide an
educational and fun event in these areas. Fairs are diligently trying to
hold down their costs so it’s affordable to all of rural North Carolina.
Our ag. fairs are located in rural counties across North Carolina. To
put a sales tax on the admission ticket would impose an undue burden on
many North Carolina rural families who live on or below the poverty
level. These ag. fairs expose both children and adults to the rural
agriculture that plays into parts of our rural communities. An increase
in sales tax would decrease attendance at these fairs, making it ?? for
operators to have these fairs annually. County fairs are organized and
operated by community volunteers, civic non-profit organizations – we’ve
already talked about the different organizations. Funds derived from
these county fairs are used to do charity work within the local
community – eyeglasses for children, needed surgery operations,
counselor research, provide assistance for needy families, and also
funds are used for scholarships for children to further their education.
County fairs provide venues for community events at no charge – Race for
the Cure, Relay for Life, March of Dime, church fundraising activities.
County fairs provide an opportunity for civic organizations and
agriculture entities to talk more about our rural communities, help
community colleges and universities, and with those reasons, I ask that
you would join with me this afternoon to exempt our county fairs from
our admission sales tax, and I move for adoption. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady is recognized to debate
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker, and I
appreciate all the words that were just spoken in addressing the
amendment, but folks, I will tell you that there is a free-standing bill
that has been filed by Representative Bryan Holloway – it will be filed
– and it does this sole purpose, and I would ask you not to support this
amendment and load this bill any heavier, and let the issue be addressed
in Representative Holloway’s bill. And I understand that there was a
space available on that bill for a primary sponsor if the member so
opted. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Question, Mister Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pierce, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Howard. So we have your… [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, does the Lady yield? The Lady yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You are committed to supporting that bill if that bill is filed
like… [SPEAKER CHANGES] The bill will come over to finance, and yes Sir,
we’ll hear it, and we’ll get it back out on the floor, and I believe the
support is here to take that provision out. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister
Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pierce, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] With those comments from Representative
Howard, I move that we take the amendment off the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Pierce moves that the amendment be withdrawn.
Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the
House is the passage of House Committee Substitute to House Bill 1050 as

“No”. The Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will ?? machine record the

Carolina ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ?? please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  First of all, I want to thank
all of you all that did your homework and studied and debated this issue
internally and externally and voted with us in the last session on this
important piece of legislation.  And since we've had such a long summer
break I thought what I would do would be to refresh your memory about
what it is actually we're trying to do.  This bill is one that I feel
like North Carolina needs to consider because we're one of only two
states who do not have our 16 and 17 year old juvenile delinquents
placed in the juvenile justice system.  They go into the adult system.
The other state that is keeping us company is New York.  And the New
York Governor has just appointed a task force to look at raising the age
in that state.  And we're ahead of New York on several points simply
because since 2007 our state has commissioned 5 studies regarding
raising the age of jurisdiction on 16 and 17 year olds in North
Carolina.  They were done by the Governors Crime Control Commission, the
North Carolina Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission, Youth
Accountability Planning Task Force, the Vera Institute for Justice, and
the Legislative Research Commission of the General Assembly.  And all of
those recommended that North Carolina raise the age.  And in terms of
what we need to do in the bill and what we're planning to do is we're
dealing with misdemeanors only, and there is a very long planning time,
simply because there's been a lot of concern, justifiably so considering
past legislative action, of whether or not the system can handle this
change.  So there will be a 5 year period until July of 2019 before any
juvenile 16 year old will go into the system.  An advisory committee is
being appointed to study where we are, what we have, what we need, both
in terms of facilities, programs and funding to make sure that we'd be
able to do this in the right way.  Too many times down here I think we
can find examples fairly recently of where we've put major wide ranging
reforms in place that's going to cure all of our problems we did not put
the timing into it to study what we needed to do and actually how we
were going to do it and pay for it.  And that's why a mistake I do not
want us to make in this move with juvenile justice.
A lot of you have received, all of you probably have received a document
from the Sheriff's Association and have been heavily lobbied by them and
their concerns, and I want to address those.  They're rightfully
justified in saying we have concerns.  And we have listened to those
concerns in the bill that we have finally put before you.  We have taken
a lot of their issues to heart.  But I'd like to talk with you about the
specific ones they mentioned.  That the state can't adequately handle
the influx.  Well, I placed on your desk a letter that I received a
couple of years ago from the Commissioner of the Department of
Corrections in Connecticut who has gone through this same process.  And
I think you will see that a lot of the same sorts of end of the world
scenarios that has been placed here in North Carolina has been in other
places.  Connecticut and Illinois, a lot of the states.  The argument's
always the same.  If you'll look at how they approached it, the
reactions and the actions that they took, I think you'll gain heart that
we're moving in the right direction.  They're saying that we're closing
facilities and it's depleting our resources.  Well, misdemeanants do not
go to detention centers or development centers, so that is not a factor
that really should impede your decision to vote yes on this bill.  And
it says we're going to fund a policy that's not been fully analyzed or
completely developed.  I just explained the 5 year planning process that
we've put in place in order to do exactly that.  So that we'll have the
proven facts where we can develop a policy that will work</p>

<p id="075:00">
And that will be implemented by the General Assembly that will be in
place at that time because they have adequate funding to do the job
right.
The last point they make is referring to an unfunded mandate on the
local governments because of housing costs for secured facilities for
16- and 17-year olds. That mandate is already in place.
The federal law, PREA, Prison Rape Prevention Act, was passed and the
requirements for compliance under that law are much stricter than what
we faced and have in fact here in North Carolina currently.
Currently, we have the issue in the compliance with the federal that
those 16- and 17-year olds either have to be out of sight and sound of
older inmates or under direct supervision while they're in the presence
of older inmates. Currently, the only time that there's a separation
under North Carolina law is during sleeping hours.
Another one is a simple thing like exercise. The law now says that they
have to have daily, large muscle exercise. Currently in the state of
North Carolina, it's three days a week after you've been in jail two
weeks.
You've had very powerful voices come to you and ask you to vote no on
this bill. And I'm coming with voices that aren't going to be heard yet.
It's the voice of a 16-year old, because of just natural brain
development does not have the ability to make good judgement decisions
and does a stupid, crazy, typical teenage action. And ends up with a
criminal record for a misdemeanor. We have damaged his life in terms of
his education, getting into the military and getting jobs.
I'm just asking that if you would consider what you considered in the
last session. And remember who you're planning to help with the vote
that you make today. I would really appreciate your support. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeill, please state your purpose.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Chair understands representative McNeill has
an amendment, therefore, we'd like to hear the amendment before we go
back to the bill. If you'll leave your lights on, the Chair assumes that
you are wishing to speak on the bill.
Representative McNeill, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I rise, Mr. Speaker, to oppose the bill and to send
forth an amendment at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeil moves to amend the bill on page
4, line 4, by rewriting the line to read...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Many of you remember when I
debated this bill on the last day of session last year. And one of my
main concerns was that the bill didn't do anything to speak to gang
members that were juveniles.
Basically, what this bill does is two things. My amendment first
excludes 16- and 17-year olds charged with a gang offense from being
considered as a juvenile under this law. Those changes are accomplished
by asserting the exception on line 4 of page 4, which excepts offenses
listed under Article 13A of Chapter 14, which is the North Carolina's
gangs suppression statute. The same language is also duplicated in three
other places. On line 16 of page 4, line 10 of page 6, and line 16 of
page 10.
Secondly, the amendment provides that 16- and 17-year olds who are found
by the court to be a gang member could be transferred to district court
to be tried as an adult. This is accomplished by adding a hearing
process to determine first, gang membership, and a transfer process to
district court once that finding has been made.
I personally believe this creates a fair process which puts the burden
on the state to prove gang membership. I also believe that our law
enforcement community is clear, and the state is clear, that gang
activity is a serious problem and that criminal gang members should be
treated accordingly.
I ask your support for this amendment.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess my, thank you Mr. Speaker, I guess my first reaction is like a
lot of people when you've got your baby here, it doesn't need any
changes. You've worked, you thought you've talked to everybody and
you've worked it out and I actually, honestly, had that first reaction
and in talking with people, though, and understanding just how serious
the issue of gangs is and the concern that the law enforcement community
has I just rise to let you know I have no objections to Representative
McNeill's amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Gentleman's recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I do have huge objection to this amendment because the very, well,
Representative Avila statement so that she made, that's not, does not
constitute just because it's a gang member that you still have a 16 year
old making decisions with a not fully developed brain. Your amendment,
this amendment, what it does is actually perpetuate gang activity
because once we actually get this person out of jail from 16, 'cause
let's be honest they don't stay there long, the only thing that happens
is they end up with a record and now because we have now painted this
picture on them at a 16 year old, the likelihood of them going back to
gang activity is probably about 95%-100%. So if you really, really were
concerned about gang activity and if you really, really were concerned
about curbing it you don't treat those people differently than other p-,
problems are problems. It doesn't matter what crime you're doing. The
same reason why a 16 year old smokes a joint is the same reason why
they're into gang activity. It's because of lack of parental support,
lack of brain development, where they are, so this whole amendment just
really derails the whole purpose of the bill. The reason why we're raise
the age is because we know that when you are 16 years old you cannot
make those decision. That doesn't matter what crime you do. Just because
it's gang related doesn't make he's not a 16 year old. He's still a 16
year old, and the same rules should still apply. I vehemently oppose the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, the Chair has been advised that there may be a
technical issue with this amendment and we're gonna have to deal with a
perfecting amendment so we're gonna temporarily displace the amendment
and we will wait until the perfecting amendment is ready and therefore
we'll go ahead and hear debate on the bill. And the Chair will recognize
members in turn, Representative Duane Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
﻿[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. First thing I'd like to do is acknowledge there
are a lot of juveniles that we need to keep in the adult system. My
colleague, Representative Allen, mentioned this is only for misdemeanors
and just to draw out to you how minor of a crimes we're talking about,
class I felonies are not included in this bill. One example would be
uttering a forged check. So under this bill, if a 17 year old writes a
$10 check to Dominoes and it bounces he can still be prosecuted in adult
courts as an adult. This is just for misdemeanors. When I first got out
of law school I practiced in the juvenile court for quite a while and
the overwhelming majority of cases I had were things like a 16 year old
girl that steals a bracelet at the mall. It was a 17 year old boy who
had a fight at a high school football game. A common one I saw was when
a house party got busted after a high school game and there was beer
there, everyone got charged. Those students, I'm not trying to belittle
it, they need to be punished as well, but the problem with North
Carolina being only one of two states in America that prosecutes those
kids as adults is that they have to go out, then, and compete against
states that don't give them permanent, life-long, criminal convictions
for those very same activities. A criminal conviction, for instance, is
not a bar to get in to universities, we all know that. But if a North
Carolina kid has that conviction and a kid from any other state does the
exact same thing, the North Carolina kid could have worked 12 years in
school, hard, and gotten great grades but he's up against a kid with the
exact same record he may not get in to that university. Most job
applications, for the rest of your life, is gonna show a criminal
conviction for things like that, which, it hurts our economy but there's
so many more other implications. I don't usually like anecdotes but I
would like</p>

<p id="085:00">
I’ll give you a couple quick ones.  About six years ago, I house a 17
year old boy in my office and we were discussing taking a plea for a
fight he had during a football game. And the reason we were discussing
the plea is because he was guilty. He did it. I was trying to work out a
deal for him. He sat next to his dad in tears and the reason he was so
upset is that the week before, he had applies for the early stages to
get in the Marines. He was concerned that this conviction would stop
him. His dad, his uncles, his grandpa had all served.  What I’m asking
of this body is not to take away that chance for one first time youthful
mistake. Who knows.  That soldier could have possibly become a future
John Blust or a Larry Hall. For those of you that still have concerns, I
have a few mitigating factors I would like to mention. Implementation
doesn’t start until 2019.  That’s over five years away.  Almost two
years before implementation, this bill requires that a study commission
comes back to this body and accounts for the exact cost of it.  In the
meantime, we a pilot program in a few counties to work on the details
and exact cost of it.  I think you all also saw a study on your desk
from the John Luft Foundation and it’s their estimate that this bill is
actually going to save us 52 million dollars.  Other than cost, US
Department of Justice says that prisoners under 18 years of age are
eight times more likely to be raped than adult inmates, 36 times more
likely to commit suicides than youths housed in juvenile detention
centers.  The recidivist rate for children forced into an adult system
is 35 percent higher.  So this bill can save our children, but can also
save North Carolina a lot of money if we get it going. We had strong
bi-partisan support on the first and second vote and if conservatives
like John Locke and John Torbit are on board, friends across the aisle
it’s a safe vote for you, I commend the bill and hope you can vote for
us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Baskerville, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Thank you, Representative Avila for staying
vigilant on this issue. I support the bill.  I think it’s a good bill.
It’s a great start. To address our juvenile court system.  My colleague,
Representative Brandon made my point eloquently when we are trying to
decide whether to prosecute these folks as adults or juveniles.  We look
at their mental state.  We look at their frame of mind.  A lot of these
crimes that they are charged with require a mental state.  So you have
got to look inside that person’s mind and see whether they are guilty or
not guilty of a crime. If you are talking about a 15 or 16 or 17 year
old mind, their mind might not be fully developed and able to understand
or grasp the consequences of their actions.  Now I was reading this
document on my desk here that details some of Representative Stamm’s
remarks the other day.  I just want to address a couple of the points
briefly dealing with the confidential nature of juvenile court
proceedings.  I think that is very important that juvenile court
proceedings are maintained in a confidential manner.  There also
circumstances where we keep juvenile records.  We keep juvenile
documents.  We keep them sealed. For example, educational records.  We
understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of those
proceedings.  I don’t think that is a problem at all.  I think that is a
good thing. Also in this letter here, it discusses the fact that in
juvenile court it’s quote “How can we fix your problem whether you are
guilty or not?”. End quote.  I think that is a good thing that 16 and 17
year olds that have taken the wrong path down the wrong way has a
courtroom full of folks – court counselors, judges, lawyers – that are
trying to get to the underlying issue, the underlying problem with this
criminal behavior. I think that is a good thing that in juvenile court,
we have social workers in there that are trying to get to the problem so
they won’t repeat that behavior in the future.  There is none of that in
adult court.  As a matter of fact,…</p>

These crimes that are on this document here, if a 16 or 17 years old
goes to a [doco] they are gonna get a slap in their wrist. Nobody is
gonna try to find out why they’re doing what they’re doing. Nobody is
gonna try to rehabilitate this person. They are gonna get a slap on the
wrist, they’re fined, they’re not going to jail. I think a lot of my
colleagues might think juveniles are gonna go to jail, you know 17 year
olds go to jail when they commit crimes in a [doco], but that’s not the
case. You know any law you practice here will tell you that 16, 17 year
olds go in their [doco] they’re gonna get a fine, they are gonna get a
slap on their wrist and we need the juvenile corporate savings to help
these kids. I think that’s actually a bit [??] representative stand that
we have somebody there trying to figure out how do we help you with the
problem. I think that this is a good bill and I recommend it to my
colleagues. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Representative [Steim]. Please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill?
[Speaker Changes] The juveniles [recognized ??] bill. The house will
come to order.
[Speaker Changes] Respected members of the house. I couldn’t even
remember what I said last year about this. You could be used if you
didn’t remember so I have to tight up to save the style. So you don’t
have to listen to that again. But I would like to make a few additional
points. This is not the first time, of course we’ve heard this. 25 years
ago, I chaired the North Carolina juvenile law study commission under
the Martin administration. This came up then we rejected it then and it
has been rejected for last 25 years and I predict that when (where’s
roger yeans? Is he here, our newest member?). When he is the majority
leader of this house, it will come up again in 25 years from now. Now,
when we discuss hydraulic fracturing, the senate wanted to put that on
automatic pilot so that it required no additional votes. Remember that
last year? And the house rejected that. What this bill does is put us on
automatic pilot; so when this is in full effect it will cost us $63
million a year. You’re committing that we’ll spend that much every year
unless by majorities of both houses we repeal it. Transparency;
Representative Hall’s argument is all about “we don’t want this on
people’s records”. Don’t you all remember last year, we expunged
everything in the world. I mean, these kids this age, they don’t have to
keep these records all their lives. They can get them expunged by hiring
a good lawyer like Representative Hall. There’s a feature of juvenile
court you don’t realize. I do have this in the third paragraph. Look at
the title of the bill. Young offenders’ rehabilitation act. There are 3
different models of course of justice. Retributive, Deterrence and
Rehabilitation. And ideally, justice should do all three. But the
juvenile model is rehabilitation. There’s something wrong with this kid.
Let’s fix him. And the juvenile court is the last place you wanna be if
you’re innocent. Because even if you’re innocent they’re going to find
something wrong with you. And they’re gonna fix it and without a jury,
you can be locked up on a ‘he said’ ‘she said’ for years. Couple of
things have happened since we voted on this last July. One is that it’s
2014 now and I’ve read the senate rules; I can’t imagine any way this is
eligible in the senate. So I’m wondering, number one - Why we’re even
here under their rules. But we’re here. Second thing is this house
unanimously passed the bill in 2013 to decriminalize what a lot of these
16 and 17 year olds that you might be concerned about this bill.
Prostitution, it’s not even in the fits anymore. It’s not that they’re
not going to district court, they’re not going anywhere. Except unless
they’re maybe considered neglected juvenile or something like that. So,
there’s no need for this bill. It not gonna pass this year. It didn’t
pass last year, it’s not gonna pass next year because it’s just bad
policy and I [vote] no.
[Speaker Changes] Ladies and gentlemen, the chair’s been advised by the
court that they’re perfecting a [??] before us. The chair would prefer
to move to the amendment 7? The debate is focused on the final content
of the bill should the amendment pass. Representative [Mig Neils]

page one line three by rewriting the line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman has recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Basically what the amendment
does is where before when I told you that the language that I inserted
in the beginning of the bill on page four of line four that language
remains. On page sixteen of line four the language is removed. On line
ten of page six the language remains and on line sixteen of page ten the
language is removed. Basically it was decided and basically I think when
they looked at the amendment was that it was not necessary to list it in
two of the four places that it was listed so that's really all it does.
It doesn't change what the amendment does, it just to perfect the
amendment that takes the listing out of two places and Mr. Speaker I'd
like to commend this to you and would like to answer one of the points
that's been raised if it's appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman has time to debate if the matter is on
the amendment otherwise the chair would prefer to take action on this
amendment and then go back to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] It is on the amendment, I just wanted to point out to
Representative ?? that the state does have a gang suppression statute,
it has been on the books for several years so the state of North
Carolina recognizes that gangs are treated differently. That statute is
listed, article 13A of chapter fourteen is listed in my amendment and it
has been around for many years so I hope you'll support the amendment.

got from that commission, from the state using psychologists, using all
the necessary means and methods that we could in order to be able to do
this was looked at by that commission and the commission came up with
the idea that we did need to make some changes in this area and I would
suggest that we do it. The problem is this with with this amendment, if
you have an individual who is sixteen, seventeen years old and let's say
gets a ticket for a moving traffic violation or no operator's license or
something like that and then somebody wants to come in and fake that he
is maybe allied with some gang or something, there's nothing to stop him
from being pushed to that particular process. The process is there for
handling gang related instances, I know it's there because I wrote the
bill so we don't need anything in this bill trying to relate back to
gang supported evidence. Like I say, if that individual that sixteen,
seventeen year old gets a minor or a major</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Frasier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.  Thank you.  Let me explain my concern.  I’m showing
Representative McNeil actually a draft of an amendment that might help
fix my concern. I agree, actually, with the first part of the amendment
which adds in the gang-related part of the statutes.  I disagree
slightly with a few colleagues, although, it’s not necessary, but I
understand the concern and as a compromise measure, I understand that.
My concern is in the process and I think it’s going much further than
Representative McNeil has maybe intended.  And that’s in the second part
of this amendment. Because if you read it, what it says is  - if the
court must transfer from juvenile to adult, if the person is found to be
a gang member and there is probable cause to believe they committed a
misdemeanor.  But there’s no language in there that creates a nexus
between the two. And I would certainly favor an amendment that creates
the nexus that says: transfer should occur if there’s reason to believe
you’re a gang member and the crime you’ve committed – there’s probable
cause to believe it was gang-related.  I am with Representative McNeil
on that at least for right now. I would certainly vote in a spirit of
compromise for that, but that’s not what this says. So what this would
do right now without the nexus language says “I’m a gang member, but I
forget my license and I’m driving to school and I have a no license
charge.” It’s automatically transferred because you don’t need any
nexus. All the bills of the amendment that Representative McNeil has put
forward requires is are you a gang member, and if so, you’re
transferred. If you have any probable cause that you have committed a
misdemeanor even if it has nothing to do with your gang membership.
That’s problematic for me.  I think there’s other reasons there are to
be opposed to this.  Representative ?? and others have talked about, but
I’m willing to vote for it if we put some nexus language in that says
that transfer should occur.  It should be exempt out of the juvenile
court if you’re a gang member and there is probable cause to believe
that you’ve committed a misdemeanor for which there’s some relationship
to you being in the gang. But otherwise, we’re catching a lot of kids I
don’t think there’s any intent to catch.  Sometimes people can be gang
members, not committing any crimes, not involved in it, but they end up.
 Like I suggested, no licenses or there’s a trespass, or something
unrelated to their gang membership. Do we really want to transfer them
to adult court? I’m going to be proposing an amendment that perhaps can
fix that perhaps if Representative McNeil is willing.  It simply says
what he wants to do, I would agree with as long as there’s a nexus
between the two.  Without the nexus, we’re catching every kid who just
does something where they may or may not be currently involved in any
gang activity.  So I would speak against the amendment as it’s set, and
then we’ll be offering an amendment to fix that.  At which point, if
that passes, I would vote for it. And I just wanted to explain that.  I
think there is a real problem here.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Richardson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I would like to be recorded as voting “yes” on the
amendment.  I missed that vote.  Thank you.  On the perfecting
amendment.

Representative Lucas, please state your purpose.

To see if my good friend and colleague, Representative Glazier would
yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glacier, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, we’re making this use of this gang member.  Is
there a definition of a gang member that has been certified by the
courts?  What qualifies one as to be a member of a gang?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There’s certainly lots of definitions out.  Representative ??’s
legislation created a distinct definition.  If you would, Representative
Lucas, you might direct your question to him because I think he can
answer your question more directly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ??, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is a very distinct definition.  I think if you look on your desk…</p>

<p id="105:00">
Information that Representative McNeill passed out to you cites that
particular section of the statute that deals actually with what gang
activity and gang membership is. It was closely crafted. It took three
years actually to craft the definition of what gang activity was, what a
gang member meant. And that document, I can’t quote it to you directly,
but it is there and it is very very specific. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeill, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment as amended. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. In reference to Representative Glazier’s amendment,
I know the example that he used was possibly a motor vehicle law
violation. But this bill itself, nothing to do with anything that I had
to do with changing. This bill itself excepts motor vehicle laws, so
that’s not really going to be an argument as to what he’s arguing. North
Carolina, like I said before has had a gang suppression statute for many
many years, as Mr. ?? said and he helped write it. Article 13a of
chapter 14. Our own state law recognizes that gangs and gang members
should be treated differently. I think the amendment is a good
amendment. Representative Avila who’s a bill sponsor has said she is for
it. I understand their arguments. There is a process in the bill, set
out in my amendment, that says that either the juvenile’s attorney or
the prosecutor can ask for a hearing to determine whether they’re a gang
member. Then and only after then after that hearing that they are
determined to be a gang member, then can the case be bound over to
district or be tried as an adult. I think it’s a good amendment, and
would ask you to support it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative ??, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the gentleman yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McNeill, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
sir, I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McNeill, you do realize that there are other misdemeanors
that we have in law other than traffic violations which would be
affected by your amendment, and that particular person that would come
under scrutiny as a result of your amendment. That there are other
misdemeanors other than traffic violations, minor misdemeanors. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That would be affected by my amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh yes sir, I know there’s a lot of other
misdemeanors out there, class 1, 2 and 3 misdemeanors and class a1
misdemeanors. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Another question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That violation, that you would have to prove gang activity,
you’re violent. Your amendment takes out, as Representative Glazier
stated, the nexus between what that minor misdemeanor is and gang
activity. There’s no nexus there at all, which means that that kid who
is basically accused could be accused of being a gang member and then
sent into adult court, without any nexus at all in your amendment. Do
you understand that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I do understand that,
and that’s why I feel like when I said that there is a process in my
amendment for the prosecutor and the court to hear that. I think that is
sufficient to take care of those concerns. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
ask Representative McNeill a question and then perhaps to speak a second
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair also has been advised the gentleman
has an amendment to the amendment as amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have
gotten to the point that it’s late in the day and I think what I’d like
to do is see if we can resolve this Mr. Speaker through some questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeill, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative let me
just draw your attention to the last part of your amendment on the
second page, last paragraph. And it says at the end, I think the hearing
you’re referring to. And I just want to read the language and then I’ll
ask my question. At the hearing the prosecutor and juvenile may be heard
and may offer evidence and the juvenile’s attorney may examine any court
or probation</p>

...Or other records, the court may consider in determining whether the
juvenile is a member of a street gang. Then the next sentence. If the
court finds by preponderance of the evidence the juvenile is a member of
a street gang, the court shall transfer. Would you not agree with me
that once the decision is made on the street gang question, there is no
capacity for the juvenile or the judge in that language to make any
finding about nexus? It's strictly are you or are you not a member of
the street gang, and if you are, does it matter that there's no nexus,
the attorney can't argue it, and that in fact the transfer must occur.
[Speaker changes] I would not argue with that.
[Speaker changes] Second question please.
[Speaker changes} Does the gentleman yield?
[Speaker changes]The gentleman yields.
[Speaker changes]Thank you, representative. All-all my amendment, which
would do, and if you would consent to it being heard and..and...and
passed, I would be fine-cause I think it would fix this-would be to
simply create that Nexus requirement. Um, would you agree-because I
think you're trying to get at the person whose committing gang activity
or potentially, and get them out of this juvenile statue and keep them
in adult court. Would you agree to, if we passed your amendment, to
consent to the Nexus requirement being added in, and then we can fix it
over on the senate on the exact language?
[Speaker changes] If you'll vote for my amendment, then I'll vote for
yours.
[Speaker Changes] That works for me. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker changes] The speaker is a little bit confused, is there gonna
be another amendment sent forth?
[Speaker changes] OK, representative ??? sent forth an amendment, the
clerk will read.
[Speaker changes] Thank you very much.
[Speaker changes] Representative ??? moves to men, amendment number one
on page two,line 3 of the amendment, by deleting adults and
substituting:
[Speaker changes] The gentlemans recognize to debate the amendment.
[Speaker changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, uh and thank you representative
??? Members, what this amendment will do, is create the causal link and
the Nexus between gang membership and the commission of this misdemeanor
being gang related. And I think we've debated it enough and I hope I
would have your support and I appreciate Representative ??? doing that.
Thank you.
[Speaker changes] Representative ??? please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes] Just to inquire...
[Speaker changes] Yes Mr Speaker--
[Speaker changes] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[Speaker changes] This would be another perfecting amendment to the
amendment is that correct sir?
[Speaker changes] That is correct, sir.
[Speaker changes] Thank you. That's a good idea.
[Speaker changes] Further discussion, further debate, on the perfecting
amendment. If not, the question before the house, is the amendment sent
forth by Representative G??? to the  amendment to have house committee
substitute number 2 for house bill 725, all in favor vote &quot;I&quot;
all opposed vote &quot;No&quot;. The clerk will open the vote.
[Speaker changes] The clerk will ??? machine recorded the vote. 108
having voted affirmative and 6 in the negative, the perfecting amendment
passes. Now we're back on the amendment. Further discussion, further
debate. If not, the question before the house is the passage of the
amendment as amendment to the house committee substitute number 2 for
house bill 725. All in favor, vote &quot;I&quot;, all opposed, vote
&quot;No&quot;, the clerk will open the vote. The clerk will ??? machine

amendment, as amendment, amended, has passed. Representative Stan,
please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes] Mr. Speaker, in my debate, I talked about whether this
would be eligible in the senate, but after thinking about it, I'd rise
to the point of wondering if this is not eligible to be considered in
the House during the short session because it is not listed in the
adjournment resolution.
[Speaker changes] Representative Stan, Representative ???,
Representative ??? Please approach the dais. The house will be at ease.</p>

Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, I have a lot
of the same concerns that Representative Stamm has and that is, we have
an advisory committee that’s going to go out and look at this. That’s
fine.  We do that a lot. Then we’re going to have the advisory committee
determine what it costs and go ahead and do a pilot program. Okay, we’ve
done that on occasion.  But I know of no occasion where we then told the
advisory committee to go ahead and take it statewide without coming back
to the legislature. They do come back to us to ask for money.  They do
come back to us and say are there any special laws that we need, but the
program itself will go statewide without further input from us.  Now,
one of the things that Representative ?? said is that juveniles will not
get… on misdemeanors, you don’t get jail time.  Well, I disagree with
her.  If you look at your schedules, Class A1 misdemeanors, the courts
can impose confinement on the first offense. Class A1 misdemeanors,
which juveniles who commit these will be in juvenile court.  Anybody
under 18 will be in court with this.  That is assault and inflicting
injury, assault using a deadly weapon, assault by pointing a gun,
assault on a state officer or state employee, assault on a female,
assault on a child under the age of twelve, violation of a protective
order.  Then in Class One misdemeanors, we’ve got breaking and entering
buildings.  If you recall, as we did the Justice Reinvestment Act,
breaking and entering, especially multiple breaking and entering, is one
of the most serious crimes where we really need to take harsher action.
I think this is a bad idea that’s moving far too fast.  It’s going to
have costs and implications that we don’t even recognize yet.  So thank
you.  I oppose the bill.</p>

<p id="120:00">
Representative Samuelson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. We've heard from a lot of attorneys. I think it's
time for a story, and I'm going to tell you a story as a mom. When one
of my sons was turning 16, he wanted as a gift a replacement for a water
balloon launcher that had broken, and he wanted me to buy it for him. I
convinced him that I could make him a better water balloon launcher than
one he could buy from the store. So I proceeded to do so, and it was
really a pretty awesome water balloon launcher. In fact, they got so
could at it that they could knock squirrels out of the trees - very tall
trees - out of our yard. One day it disappears, and about a week later
I'm at an event on a Friday night and I get a call from the sheriff,
bacause I was a county commissioner, &quot;We have your recently turned
16 year old son in custody. He got arrested for shooting water balloons
full of ranch dressing at a local office building&quot;. What had
happened was he had figured out that that water balloon launcher was so
awesome that they could go and shoot it over the four story parking
building near his 15 year old buddy's house and shoot the glass office
building across the street. One of the men in the office building got
mad about it, and came out and did this to them. So they filled the
water balloons up with ranch dressing, and shot it at the building so it
would make a really discernible mark because they were impulsive, stupid
15 and 16 year olds. The police were called, the building manager did
not press charges, the man whose office it was did not press charges,
but the police officer decided to press charges. The 15 year old was
released into the custody of his mother. The 16 year old was taken and
spent all Friday night in adult custody, in the Mecklenburg County Jail,
on a night that was later told to me, &quot;Yeah, it was one of the
worst nights that we've had in the last few months for people to be in
jail&quot;. We were eventually able to hire an attorney to get the
charges dropped, the record expunged, but his picture was up for awhile
on all those little things that you see out there. As it came time for
him to apply for college, it was still up. He would call me and say,
&quot;Now Mom, can I really apply for college and check off that I
wasn't arrested?&quot; He wanted to apply for a summer job, and we went
through this for several years until I finally had the attorney write
him a letter saying your record was expunged, you don't have to check
this off. And yet the memory of spending that evening in jail, arrested
for launching water balloons full of ranch dressing at an office because
he was a stupid 16 year old still haunts him. I think we ought to think,
&quot;Yes, there are arguments that the attorneys make&quot;, but as a
mom I don't want 16 and 17 year olds treated that way for minor
offenses. I urge your support for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. Pages, some of you I'm sure are 15 and 16 year olds,
we're going to release you at this point. Your day ended at 5:00. We're
see you back tomorrow. Thank you. Representative McNeill [sp], please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and House members. This bill
was passed on the last day of session last year. The vote was 61 to 37.
That's a difference of 14 votes, but what nobody has said is that there
were 20 House members with excused absences on that day that didn't get
a chance to vote. Could the vote have been different? I don't know. I'm
not going to spend a lot of time on that. It's possible. But currently
16, 17 year olds are charged as a misdemeanor and tried as an adult.
Basically what this bill does is change the age and they're going to be
tried as a juvenile. Let's just look, just real briefly, at what a 16
and a 17 year old would face if they continue to be tried as an adult.
For Class I, II, and III misdemeanors the only possible punishment in
that statute for their first offense is community punishment. So the
first time they're arrested for Class I, II, and III is only possible
punishment is community punishment. For a Class II or III misdemeanor,
the only community punishment and intermediate punishment is available
for the first four convictions. One through four. So no jail time for
either one of those. Only after the fifth conviction, for a Class II or
III misdemeanor, do they have the possibility of jail time. That begs
the question, how many criminals, or how many times should a person be
allowed to violate a criminal law before they receive . . .</p>

<p id="125:00">
... punishment.  So to repeat again, as it stands right now, for 16 or
17 years olds - they would not receive any jail time at all until their
fifth conviction of a class 2 or 3 misdemeanor. Also as Representative
Stanton has already said, last year we declassified a lot of the
criminal code. We also moved several Class One and Class Two
misdemeanors down to Class Three misdemeanors and the statute
specifically says that, except for a few listed ones, the only possible
punishment is a fine. That was part of the budget bill last year.  Also,
as Representative Stevens has so eloquently stated, this bill includes
Class A One misdemeanors which are all violent misdemeanors.  The North
Carolina Sherriff’s Association, which represents all 100 sheriffs,
opposed this bill.  The Congress district attorney opposed this bill.
The Police Chiefs Association opposed this bill. I would certainly hope
that would be enough. There’s been several comments made about criminal
record.  As Representative Stamm said, there’s adequate expungement laws
in North Carolina to deal with that. Also, as far as the prison rate and
the fact that they are saying people under 16 or 17 are the most likely.
 We have a very rare chance that a 16 or 17 year old will ever serve
time for a misdemeanor. If they ever serve time, it’s going to be a
felony and this bill does not address felonies.  I oppose this bill and
I would like for you to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to work with the city ?? for 30 plus
years and I always thought, learning from my training, that disciplinary
action was not to punish, but to adjust human behavior. To adjust, not
to punish.  What a reasonably minded person would assume.
Representative Stamm mentioned about what a reasonable officer had done
as it relates to her son. You demonstrated today with two
representatives what a reasonable minded person would do. And one with
Representative Pierce and one with Representative ?? back there.  When
you allow them to make the necessary adjustments to their particular
bill and amendment, that’s what we are talking about here today. What I
see, what I feel as I sit back here, we believe in total punishment.
That’s what we believe in. Total punishment. Now if we do not look at it
from a state point of view, do we believe in fronting an education, or
rear-end, or in-between? But if we do not support this bill, at the end
of the day, we ?? somewhere down the line it’s going to have to
appropriate money for either family assistance or long-term care in one
of our high-rise facilities for a long period of time. If you understand
what a high-rise facility is, it’s our prison system.  Or taking care of
them from our welfare system. What I’m simply saying is that this is
just to adjust human behavior.  Sometimes we as parents, not that we
dislike our children, we have to apply tough love and sort of adjust
their behavior to come back because they didn’t think about a decision
that they made. That’s what this bill is trying to do.  Now we are
talking about 2019. I’ll probably be dead and long gone ??.  But we are
giving the kids some opportunities. Just stop thinking about punishment.
 I mean, where is the reasonable minded person in here? Now we are
talking about expungement.  Sure, in my neck of the woods, if the
officer or someone let my neighbor go, he could care less about
expungement.  He will have to be released. Then if he asked for
expungement, he’s going to have to go to my next door neighbor’s house
and get something from there to pay for expungement from a legal person.
 So there you go again. He’s broke down a man’s door again to get $250
to pay and get an expungement.  Now the person down the street has got
to pay $2500 to get his door replaced because the gentleman wanted $250
to pay for the expungement. So what I’m simply saying here…</p>

Representative Moffat please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman recognizes to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker the members of the house everyday when we walk on
to the floor this August body I do not ___[??] our task. We are poised
at every moment to make decisions that affect the lives of the good
citizens of our state that we have had the good fortune of being chosen
to represent. As I have elected this bill and as I had signed on as a
primary sponsor I did so because I challenge myself to maintain my
prospective on each piece of legislation that I have to sponsor and that
I vote on. So, I try to keep my prospective about how I feel about my
journey and my life, where I’m and how that applies to what we are face
to vote on. I do not have a law enforcement background so I do not know
it feels like to apprehend someone or to be apprehended, I’m not
afflicted with the law degree. So, when I look at the written language I
interpret it as I see it that for those of you that have a law degree I
wish you the best. But when it comes to this particular bill I’m
approaching it from two different directions, I’m approaching it as a
dad of father of three sons and I’m also approaching it if someone who
has a management consultant who has been involved in human resources for
27 years. So, let me take that prospective, there is no doubt in my mind
that today’s child is far less matured today than we were when we were
their age and when I was that age I was far less matured than my dad was
at that age. Last year, I had an opportunity to sit with my dad and my
sons and we were talking about where each of us were at the age of 17,
my dad was willing his way into the military, I was starting a life on
my own outside of the home and my son that was 17 and I was concerned
about him actually going to the grocery store. The reality is our
children do not mature as fast and I would argue that society has
recognized that simply because we have changed the age of legal drinking
from 18 to 21 which I think is an acknowledgement that children do not
age or society does not age at the same rate as we change in a society.
For me human resource prospective I will tell you that is very difficult
for people to change jobs since today society if there is a record of
them violating the law at any point in their life, it could be simply
something as DWI or it could be something that they did when they were
16 or 17, I understand about expungement but you folks also need to
understand that there is a determine move by a number of our
occupational licensing boards that want us to pierce the expungement
avail, they want those records to be part of the record of the person
that holds their license so they can make a decision based on person’s
overall character. So, when it comes to this particular bill again I
think that it’s something that is a policy decision, it is a difficult
one I have been on both sides of the debate, I have heard from law
enforcement on both sides, my sheriff supports the bill, your sheriff
may or may not support the bill, I have seen the argument from a fiscal
standpoint I have seen where we save money and I have seen where it cost
us money. So, all of those arguments aside we are faced with the
decision about moving our state forward being consistent with 48 states
that have already made this move or one of the last two as
Representative Eva pointed out and when I came to this body in 2011 one
of the things that we had committed to do was to move our state forward
in a lot of areas to where we were competitive with the states around
us. I think that this is one more step in that direction and I would
encourage you to vote ‘I’ for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon please state your purpose?

I believe because I have hear a lot of ___[??] speeches about this and

And I know that if I can get them to 18 without a record, I can maybe
get them in the Army. I can maybe get them somewhere else where they can
have a fighting chance. Some people don't understand what reference
point is, and we go through our lives and we think that because my life
is this way, everybody else's life is that way, and it's not. When you
grow up, it's not only just being 15 or 16, it's also being a product of
an environment that perpetuates crime. A lot of these kids cannot help
where they grow up from. They can't help the neighborhood that they live
in. So when you say 16, yeah, one might launch balloons because that's
their reference point and that's cute. But sometimes in my neighborhood,
it might be a little more serious, it might be a little more different.
But they're still 16. They're still 15 years old. And they still deserve
that second chance, they still deserve a chance to be able to be an
adult and get there. Just because you punish someone doesn't mean that
you are tough on crime. I see it every day. Why do you think crime
perpetuates itself in these low income neighborhoods? Because they had
already had a crime. And now they have a record, no one will hire them,
and now they have to – only choice they have is to go out and continue
to do the same things they were doing to be able to get, because it's
about survival. It's not about all these things from the Sheriff's
Association, and all this other stuff. None of that even matters. It
shouldn't even be brought up here. What really matters is these people
are trying to survive, and if you're looking for 50 cents so you can get
some potato chips to eat, you're going to eat – everybody's going to eat
every day at 5 o'clock. They're gonna eat the right way, or the way they
have to. And that's the reference point we need to look at in this body.
Is that it's about survival. And if you really were true honest about
crime, and suppressing crime, you wouldn't make policies that create
more criminals. Because that's what these types of things do. You just
create more criminals. There's a reason why you have a recidivism rate.
And if the Sheriff's Association and the police folks could have been
able to deal with what they were supposed to deal with, which is
rehabilitation, and if they were doing that correctly for those 16 and
15 year olds, I wouldn't even be saying anything. But because we know
they're not doing it, they don't have the capacity to do it, and they've
failed miserably at doing it, we need to bring those folks into the
juvenile where they can be rehabilitated. We can have an attitude
adjustment, and they can have a productive life. But it is a fight. It's
a fight in that community to make sure that I can get some of those kids
to 18. And so they can have a fighting chance. If they don't make it to
18, and they have a record, we've lost them. And they're gonna be
hopping through your house, or somebody else's house to survive. Because
everybody's gonna eat at 5 o'clock. The right way, or the way they have
to. So remember that when you're making the vote. Everybody's gonna eat
at 5 o'clock.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, to debate the bill...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman's recognized to debate the bill has a minute. [?]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And as I make my debate, may I also ask you for discretion to ask
question of a couple of members?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At that point in time just address the chair so that we can direct the
question and ask the member if they will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is a very, very tough issue, as we all know.
And I think a lot of you have already made up your minds, but as I look
at the complexity of this bill I really don't quite see how you've made
up your minds cause I have a couple of questions that really determine
whether I support this or not. I support it in theory but we need to
watch the execution of this kind of a program very carefully. The first
point I want to make is that right now we are in a class of states that
includes New York and North Carolina, and that's it. Everybody else has
already done this. That makes me very nervous because there's very
little that New York has done that I would like to copy. And I'm afraid
if you vote against this bill, you are saying yeah, we like New York, we
like the way they do things. Maybe an oversimplification, I understand,
but I have some concerns and I wanted to ask some questions about -- the
first question I have about this bill involves the implementation. We've
heard that there's an advisory committee and there's also a subcommittee
that's created in here, and we've heard</p>

That it’s all going to be on autopilot without the legislature being
involved. That concerns me a lot. I will not submit if it’s done that
way. But then we’re hearing from the bill supporters that no, that’s
not. It’s going to come back to us to approve certain things. Mr.
Speaker, I’d like to ask a question first of Representative Stevens. If
I may. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, Representative? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens, if she would yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens. Does the lady yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very
much, Representative Stevens. We’ve worked on many different issues
before, and this one as well. Can you explain to me where you see in
this bill that this advisory committee takes over and once we vote
today, or the senate votes and it’s passed, the advisory committee runs
with the whole process, does a pilot program and then runs immediately
does it state-wide. Can you show me that, because I do not see that in
this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Representative Jordan, I’ve looked
several times to see where it directs it to come back to us, and perhaps
it may be a question we better ask of, I thought staff was on the floor,
who was instrumental in drafting this bill. But what I see, yes she’s
working with her. What I see in it says they come back to us if they
need particular legislation or they come back to us with a plan of
money, but not anything about our approval to get it done so I would ask
if you want to defer that question to staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of Representative Avila, if
she would yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila, does the lady
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative. I would like to direct that
question to you and perhaps staff can help you as well. Can you show us
in this bill where this advisory committee does not automatically take
over and run with this pilot program and then state-wide implementation,
without the involvement of the general assembly unless the advisory
committee wants to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe it’s in the actual
charge to the advisory committee, and that is in section 1F, page 2,
line 30. The advisory committee shall develop a specific plan for the
implementation of any changes in the juvenile justice system that would
be required in order to extend jurisdiction in delinquency matters and
proceedings to include 16 and 17 year old persons charged with
misdemeanor offenses within the juvenile justice system. Any changes to
the system have to come through us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Will the gentle
lady yield for an additional question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative. Further on it has the
statement in the bill, right after where you were reading, that concerns
me, that says as the expansion of the jurisdiction of the division of
juvenile justice to include persons 16 and 17 years of age who commit
crimes or infractions, which is the youthful offender whole point,
expands, let’s see. Becomes effective pursuant to this act. The advisory
committee monitors and reviews. Where is this expansion in this act?
Because that’s what I can’t see. I saw that section but it looks to me
like it’s not clear how the expansion of this occurs. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m assuming when they’re talking about expansion, we move from 16 in
one year to 17 the next year. Is that the expansion that we’re talking
about? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman has the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do not know. That’s why I’m concerned.
Because that section made me think that Representative Stevens had a
concern. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I’m thinking there what they’re talking
about is that as we’re working at implementing the plan and making
changes, they’re going to be looking at any of the types of changes that
are going to be made when we’re going to expand and add 16 and 17 year
olds to the system. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. And does the gentle lady
yield to an additional, final question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So it is your position that this process will be
controlled by the general assembly, because the advisory committee comes
to the general assembly to get approval for each additional step.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, that was the intent of the bill and sometimes as
we’ve noticed, intent and letter of the law kind of get mushed up. If
there is any cases where that is left in question, it will be
straightened out to the true understanding. Because this is such a
pocketbook issue, that the responsibility for the decisions of any
changes in law or statute belong strictly with the general assembly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. To continue the debate, [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I am satisfied that the
implementation will require legislative action. If it does not, I think
we’ve heard from Representative Avila that we will work to make sure
that happens, because that is the purview of the legislature, not an
advisory committee that we set up, not delegate those powers</p>

in the advisory committee, but my second concern about the bill was the
discretion involved. We had Representative Stam talk about a number of
misdemeanors but they seem to be all Class 1 misdemeanor, A1
misdemeanors that were violent. I want inquiry, again, to Representative
Avila regarding this issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you tell me the treatment of Class A1 misdemeanors in this
legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I cannot give you the specifics on that. I don't have that in place but
the discretion, I believe, in a lot of cases rests with the judge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does she yield for additional questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So it's your position that there is discretion here from the judge,
maybe not the prosecutor, but the judges certainly have discretion in
these types of misdemeanors whether to remand them to juvenile court or
keep them in the adult court?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is where I wish I had a law degree but that's my understanding,
that we're not taking away any jurisdiction in terms of the discretion
at any level that already exists in the court system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan, the Chair would ask, is there staff on the floor
that could consult with Representative Avila on the issue? The Chair
assumed as much, so the Chair can consult with Representative Avila, in
the meantime Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time on the bill.
﻿[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Gentleman is out of order at this time, Representative Jordan still
has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, at this point my two concerns, the first one has been
addressed, regarding the implementation of this, the second, regarding
the discretion, we need to continue to keep discretion of the courts to
deal with the individual cases, cases by case, to make sure that we
don't make a mistake in any particular case. As far as the general
system, we need to move to the rest of the 48 states and have our
juveniles treated as juveniles, except in those specific cases where we
have a court and a judge looking at the situation. That's the place we
need to be. This is a first step, it's a great first step, and I think
that we should support this bill and watch it carefully, monitor it
carefully, to make sure that we correct any problems that may show up,
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. After consulting with the
staff I'd like to make two points for Representative Jordan. First of
all, the pilot program is about the civil citation thing. The bill
itself automatically makes these things, in the jurisdiction of the
juvenile court on a specified day, it's on automatic pilot whether you
like it or not and whether that advisory committee ever advises you to
do anything. Thirdly, it does include the A1 misdemeanors that, some of
which, are very serious.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if Representative Avila would yield for two questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, thank you Representative. Am I correct that on
page 3 of the bill the reporting requirement in section 1i requires that
there be an interim report on the specific plan and the costs and the
staffing and that is to come directly to the General Assembly by January
15, 2017?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And am I correct that this bill is predicated on
the legislature funding the changes in order for this to really be
implemented?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Last question, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And am I also correct that with regard to A1 misdemeanors, where A1
misdemeanors occur in juvenile court, the juvenile court  retains the
discretion if the 16 and 17 year olds are there and they believe that
they are serious or dangerous, that if they fit under the appropriate
category they may send those people to a YDC and to a youth development
center and, in fact, can give them tougher sentencing, tougher
disposition, than would ever happen in adult court for those 16 and 17
year olds with the same misdemeanor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill, as amended, a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think, just the confusion that all of you saw with the amendment to
the amendment to the amendment, that this is a very complex issue.
Because of that reason we cannot avoid it but there's something that
we're not paying attention to today. We're arguing my bill five years
from now with a system that exists today. The purpose of the Advisory
Committee is to determine what is our juvenile justice system. Is it the</p>

It can be. Is it the most effective? Their recommendations in year two,
three, four and five, will be changes we need to make in order to get to
the system that our young people need.
There's so much more I could say, but it's simply this. Law enforcement
works on evidence. They use evidence to convict the guilty and they use
evidence to exonerate the innocent.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have given you sufficient evidence beyond a
shadow of a doubt, that North Carolina needs to change the age for 16-
and 17-year olds. And I would just ask for your support for this bill.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Mobley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill, as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of this House, I have sat here and I've
listened. And some of it I can't believe is being said in terms of what
should happen with this bill.
I worked for 28 years as a court counselor, juvenile court counselor and
retired as T4 counselor. And I saw these children, starting as early as
age 6, being hauled into the juvenile court system. Then there was a...
No, I didn't say 16, I said 6. [laughs] As early as age 6.
Then I saw the intake process come into being where it allowed a
counselor to meet with the family, to meet with the officer or the
petitioner who's trying to get this child into court. Giving them some
leeway to divert some of what was coming before us.
I know that you've heard someone say along the way, and I'm going to
make sure you understand that our psychologist and psychiatrist have
given us enough evidence to know that the brain of a young person is not
fully developed until they get around 25 years of age. And you know
what? Sometimes I think those of us who are 50-, 60- and 70-years old
and older, that our brain still hasn't developed either. And I'm just as
serious as I can be.
I'm speaking as a mother, as a grandmother, and as someone who has had
some experience in working with these children. Some of your children
are crying for help when they commit crimes. Why? Because sometime
parents are not doing the discipline jobs that they need to do, or that
we need to do as adults. We're quick to say, I know I don't want to get
involved in that. But our children are at a point in their lives where
they need some guidance.
And I've heard some good points being made and I want to thank those of
you who are planning to vote in support of this.
Sometimes I see our sheriff's department and our police officers being a
little hot doggish. If you remember Barney, with his gun and his one
bullet. Sometimes I think that's where our law enforcement are like.
They've got a gun on their side and they're just a little bit hot
doggish.
But I think you need to think seriously about what we're doing. I'm like
one of the representatives who said earlier, I don't want a follow ??.
We're only one of two states who are prosecuting our children as adults
at age 16. Where is the money going to come from? How do you put a price
on your child's life?</p>

yes sir thanks i mean no offense to representative Samuelson but when
she was telling little ?? about her son i couldnt help but reactive that
i knew better than to do that kind of stuff when i was 6 years old a
number of years back my stepfather had obtained his old home place out
in the woods down at clarks north carolina and it was very much in need
of repair and he was going to fix it up and he spent alot of money and
did alot of work and was doing repairs on that house and had it coming
along better than new and a group of teenagers went out there one night
and stuffed two by fours down the toilet they broke out windows that he
had replaced they took a piece of tin and laid it in the living room
floor and set a fire on it and i dont know if they had marshmallows of
what but they had a fire going inside the house marked up the walls
messed up plaster and all kinds of stuff they found out who did it they
went to court and what they had to do was go clean up the place and try
to repair some of the damage they had done only one parent of those
teenagers showed up with her child and was pretty mad at the child and
thought it was fair punishment i guess but the rest treated it like why
are they making our kids do this its just an old house in fact one of
the parents even said that its just an old house what does it matter
well they kinda halfway did what they were supposed to do and there was
nothing more about it and guess what 2 weeks later the house
mysteriously was burned down now what do you think those kids learned
from being treated so leniently in that situation and of course i didnt
want to relate it down to a 6 year old but this stuff about them not
knowing any better cause their only 16 or 17 from Romans paul writes in
the 2rd chapter verses 14 and 15 for when the gentiles which have not
the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not

<p id="160:00">
It's the Chair's intent to end debate when Representative Steinburg has
had an opportunity to speak. Briefly, I'm sure.
Representative ??, you still have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I will try to be brief
with this, but what I was pointing out was that they didn't have to know
the law of Moses to know right from wrong. He was saying that when those
people who didn't have the law of Moses happened to do what was right in
the sight of God, they showed that they already had it naturally within
them to know right from wrong. So therefore when they did wrong, they
had no excuse. That's what Paul was talking about there.
And I just don't think that a 16-year old is that devoid of an
understanding of right and wrong, which most of us, I think, probably
did have when we were 6 years old, as I did. So I don't think 16 is
inappropriate for being treated as you do the crime, you pay the
consequences. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Steinburg. Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen is recognized to debate the bill, as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of
the legislation that we have passed here in the last session, and we're
just getting into the short session here, was legislation that was
created to give people an opportunity. And many of the bills we passed,
it was to give people a second chance.
I would be willing to bet, and I'll put myself first and foremost, that
if it weren't for some quirks in background and some people who were
willing to step out and help me, that I would not be, at a very critical
time in my life, and I did not make the wisest decision that I could
have made. But I probably would not be standing here in front of you
today.
However, I think what we need to do is we need to look back into our own
lives. Let's go back to when we were kids, when we were 16 and 17. And
I'd be willing to bet that a good number of the people that are sitting
right here in this House managed to escape what we're asking others to
face. And to me, for those of us who had that happen to us, and we're
going to vote the opposite way of the way we should? I think that is the
ultimate act of hypocrisy.
There is not one of us, I don't believe there's any of us, just maybe
some of the gals, but most of the guys, I doubt it. I think we may have
done one thing or another that we got a pass on. We were very fortunate.
There were others that we grew up with that did not and they paid the
price.
And so I ask you before you cast your vote today and it appears that I
will be the last speaker, I ask you before you press that button yes or
no, I want you to just take a quick look backwards at your own life.
Think about what might have happened to you had someone not given you a
second chance. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before the House is the passage of the
House Committee Substitute No. 2 to House Bill 725, as amended, on it's
third reading. All in favor vote Aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk
will open the vote.
[pause]
The Clerk will ?? machine record the vote. 77 having voted in the
affirmative, 39 in the negative. The House Committee Substitute No. 2 to
House Bill 725, as amended, has passed it's third reading. The bill will
be engrossed and sent to the senate.
Ladies and gentlemen. As an announcement. A reminder. Tomorrow we will
be meeting at the Old Capitol Building. The session begins at 11:00 a.m.
The Chair does anticipate one bill possibly being taken up for a roll
call vote, but other than that, it's a time sensitive matter. Other than
that, there will be no other bill.</p>
