The House will come to order.  Members will take their seats.  Visitors
will retire from the chamber.  The Sargent in Arms will close the doors.
Members and visitors, please silence any and all electronic devices. The
prayer today will be offered by Representative John Bell.  We would ask
that the members and any visitors in the gallery, please stand and also
remain standing for the Pledge of Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please join with me in prayer.  Dear God, thank you for another
beautiful day on earth.  And thank you for the men and women that serve
in this chamber. May you look upon this assembly of state leaders and
fill us with your wisdom. May we always act in accordance of your will
and our decisions be for peace and well-being of this great state.  It’s
in your name that I pray. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.  And to
the republic, for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible,
for liberty and justice for all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chairman, the journal for Monday, June 23rd has been examined and
found to be correct. I move for it to be approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr moves that the journal for June 23rd be approved as
written.  Those in favor will say aye.  Those opposed, no.  The ayes
have it.  The journal is approved as written. Petitions, memorials, or
papers addressed to the general assembly or the House.  Messages from
the governor, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The governor’s objection and veto message, House bill 1069, an act to
amend the unemployment insurance laws as recommended by the joint
legislative voters ??? committee on unemployment insurance.  After
reviewing House bill 1069, I have determined a veto is the proper course
of action. Although the vast majority of this bill contains much needed
revisions to unemployment insurance laws, there are unacceptable
provisions which stagger and shorten terms of current lawfully seated
members. I pointed these members following a previous legislative
directive that did not require confirmation for initial appointments.
The three qualified, capable and bipartisan appointees by all accounts
have performed well. I look forward to working with the House and Senate
leaders to help craft a new bill which addresses our concerns while also
improving employment policies. Therefore, I veto the bill for query.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those refer to the committee on rules, calendar and operations of the
House. Ratification of bills and resolutions. The clerk will read.

In order to maintain stability in the insurance and re-insurance
markets. To continue to deliver subsidied, direct benefits to
businesses, workers, consumers, and the economy overall in the aftermath
of a terrorist attack on the United States. The House resolves.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman from Nash, Representative Collins is
recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. What this resolution does is,
encourages Congress to reenact the TRIA Act, or the Terrorist Risk
Insurance Act, which was first enacted in 2002. It was reenacted in 2005
and 2007. I understand that the Senate has already done this since we’ve
prepared this resolution. So, we’re basically asking the House of
Representatives to do this, at this point in time. This, of course, was
an act that was first passed through Congress after the 9/11 tragedy
that we had here, where over 32 and a half billion dollars in insurance
claims were paid out. Obviously, after that time, our insurance
companies started writing property casuality policies with a terrorism
exception to them. This is a program which the federal government has
come in and sponsored along with the insurance companies. Basically,
there’s a way for the, the claims have to amount to a certain threshold
before TRIA comes in and helps them. It will only cover up to a certain
amount. The federal government also has a way to recoup the money they
spend on this program. And, there’s a co-payment for it. The federal
government doesn’t pay it all. The insurance companies pay part of it.
The federal government part till they reenact, until they enact fees to
get their part back. Anyway, this is something which has enabled our
tourism market and, also, our commercial property and commercial
construction market to remain relatively smooth, despite the risk of
terrorism. I would just ask that you support this resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of House Resolution 12.61. So
many as favor the adoption of the resolution, vote aye. Those opposed
will vote no. The court will open the vote. Representative Davis, does
the gentleman wish to record? The court will lock the machine and record
the vote. 111 having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative.
House Resolution 12.61 is adopted and ordered printed. We’re gonna go

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, we are now going to go back to
House Bill 1267, it has been read and it is now properly before us.
Representative Lewis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you, ladies and
gentlemen of the House. House Bill 1267 that we have before us now is
really to clarify and treat uniformly the ballot of an individual who
cast their ballot validly and, of course, was entitled to do so and then
prior to the canvas passes away. This conforms our law to the same way
we treat all other instances in which someone may become ineligible to
vote after they have cast their vote.
For instance, sadly were someone to vote and then step outside of the
polling place and something end their life, their ballot would count.
Should they have voted by mail and something occurred in their life to
make them no longer eligible to vote, such as a felony conviction or a
court ruling of incompetency, their ballot will still count because they
were competent, they were able to cast the ballot at the time in which
they did so.
This matter was brought to our attention from a case that arose in
Forsythe County, I do believe it is a very rare occurrence but I do
believe that the statute should be clear and uniform that if an
individual is eligible to vote and exercises their right and then
obviously through no fault of their own becomes deceased prior to the
canvas, that that right should stand and that their vote should be
counted. And I respectfully ask for your support of House Bill 1267.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of House Bill 1267 on its

debate the amendment. (Speaker change) Thank you Mr. Speaker, remember
as I hope this to be a simple noncontroversial amendment to this common
core bill, part of my concern is that in the bill when we're talking
about private entities to our curriculum with the local and state boards
of our education not entering into our private entity I am concerned
that some may believe that the because the ACT or the International
Bacceloreatte, advanced placement courses, all of these things most of
you have in your counties and  in our schools could be a part of this
and thus not be allowed and so I'm just asking to clarify this language
to make sure that our LEAs understand Legislative action and intent and
don't rewrite the policy for themselves. I move adoption. (Speaker
change) Representative Horn, please state your purpose. (Speaker change)
Debate the amendment. (Speaker change) The gentleman has recognized to
debate the amendment. (Speaker change) Thank you Mr. Speaker, although I
don't believe this amendment is necessary because I think it's in the
bill already, certainly it was never the intent to discourage IB or AP</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. This
bill, Senate Bill 815, ensuring student date privacy, is a bi-partisan
bill that took over six months of work by Senator Barefoot and others.
The bill will make North Carolina a leader in the protection of student
data privacy. Real quick because I know we have lots of support for the
bill.
The bill comes to us as a recommendation by the Joint IT Oversight
Committee. If you read Dr. Atkinson's tweet earlier today, she's
embraced the bill, as have other groups that are involved. This is a
great move for or state to move student data privacy forward, to make
sure that we protect students and also that we notify parents of their
rights. I urge your support of the bill and thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a couple of public bills on page 2 of the
calendar that have been temporarily displaced. Those who have requested
that the bills be displaced, please allow the Chair to know when they
are ready to take those up. Otherwise, we'll move to the top of the
calendar. But before that, Representative Moore, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion pertaining to today's calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, you have a series of bills to add to
today's calendar and start off, we can go through them one by one, I
guess.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will state the bill and the title.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The first one is Senate Bill 58, which is the
Environmental Law's Technical Corrections. It passed unanimously out of
Rules earlier today. I move that that bill be added...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, what we will, procedurally, we
need to read in the committee report. At that time, I will ask that it
be added to the calendar without objection. Does the gentleman have
other bills?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. Mr. Speaker, Senate Bill, strike that. House
Bill 1157, short title Electronic Driver's License Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 1157 without objection? So ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 1190, DPS Commercial Vehicle Safety

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would, Mr. Speaker. I understood there was going to
be objection raised to the adding, to this bill, but would move that the
bill be added. Mr. Speaker, the title again, this is the Boone ETJ bill
that was heard in the Government Committee yesterday and today. It was
reported out favorably today. I know some members...</p>

want to oppose the bill, and they'll be able to do that, but it just
doesnt seem to make sense to just keep it around an extra day, we are
trying to get into the final days of session, and therefore I would ask
the members to- whatever your feelings, regardless of what your feelings
are on the bill, at least to add the vote to the bill on the day's
calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Fisher, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, for a point of clarification?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady may state her inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If this is a part of an overall motion to add bills to the calendar, I
need to speak to that motion at whatever point it's appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Fisher, this is only related to a motion to add this particular
bill to the calendar, the other ones have been added without objections,
so the lady is recognized at this time to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise in objection to adding this bill, and I'll
tell you why: Rules Chair is correct in that we did have this bill in
local government yesterday. We were able to hear from residents from the
area about this bill, there were people in the audience who were asked
to speak, allowed to speak, the proceedings went along very well, we had
a vote on this bill yesterday and the bill was given- a favorable report
was objected to, and was voted down, and then not certain why the-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Moore, if the lady will yield. Rep. Moore, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rise to a point of order. The gentleman may state his point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just wanted to make sure we're not debating the merits of the bill, at
this point the procedure is what it is, I would just state a point of
order, I think that the debate should be limited to whether the calendar
can accomodate this bill or not, not to the merits of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman's point is well taken. Rep. Fisher, the chair would advise
you to stay focused on the debate which would be to either hear this
bill today or tomorrow. The lady has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly. Thank you Mr. Speaker. I think that to address the Rules
Chair's question, I think that the more time that you can give for folks
to check in with their respective cities about the ETJ issue the better.
To make for a transparent process. I think that to have-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??] the lady yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Fisher, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is the lady aware that this bill applies only to the town of Boone?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am aware of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is the lady aware that the gentleman who represents Boone has asked that
the bill be added to today's calendar?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, but I will say that there are other folks from that area, from
that delgation who were not completely in agreement about that. And I
think that it is slights up the whole chamber that you would have a bill
come back to the body, having only been announced that it was coming
back to committee an hour before the committee met to hear a bill for
the second time after a favorable report had already been defeated in
committee the day before. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Grier Martin, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker, I'd like to specifically address the
point made by the rules chair, claiming that there's no reason to let
this bill sit around for another day. We are a deliberative body. The
reason to let his controversial bill sit around for another day is to
let the democratic process work, to let the people we were hired to
represent take some time to look at the bill they THOUGHT was dead
before it was abusively brought back to life and contact their elected
representative and perhaps try to change their mind. I urge you to
absolutely oppose this motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the motion? If not, the question
before the House is the motion by Rep. Moore, to add Senate bill 8 65 to
the calendar for today's calendar. All in favor vote &quot;Aye&quot;,
all in favor vote &quot;No&quot;, the clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will not machine record the vote: 64 having voted in the
affirmative, and 46 in the negative, the motion passes. Senate bill 8 65
will be added to today's calendar.

technical correction. Rep McGrady ran this bill. This was language
identified by the staff that needed to be added to the bill we did

all. But I am sure once it is added to the calendar, Rep McGrady will be
glad to explain it. It’s pretty vanilla nothing to it.

committee and it is basically ??(inaudible) transfer state and   talk

The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] This is Amendment ATA-67V1, Representative Baskerville
moves to amend the bill on page 1, lines 2 through 10, by rewriting
those lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I first want to thank
Representative Hager for working along side of me on this issue. I
represent District 32, which has Kerr Lake in it. And we have a Kerr
Lake Regional Water System which is a huge economic base and driver in
our community. When the regional water system was put in place back in
the 70s, we were permitted for 20 million gallons a day in water from
the Army Corps of Engineers. We've only been using 10 million gallons a
day but we're ready for expansion to accommodate commercial needs,
commercial investments and to continue to supply our water to 60,000
plus people in my area.
We have been working on an inter-basin transfer permit for six years and
we're $600,000 in the hole here. And this amendment would allow an
expedited process for my particular permit that's already been in place.
The amendment language comes from Tom Reedy with DNR and so I ask for
your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Baskerville sat
down with me and explained it to me and I think that as a bill sponsor I
am wholly in agreement with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment? If
not, the question before the House is the amendment, passage of the
amendment sent forth by Representative Baskerville to the House
Committee Substitute for House Bill 1057. All in favor vote aye, all
opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote.
The Clerk will let the machine record the vote. One hundred and nine
having voted in the affirmative, and one in the negative. The amendment
passes. Ladies and gentlemen, that amendment does change the title of
the bill so we will only take second reading. Further discussion,
further debate?
Representative Harrison, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady is recognized to debate the bill, as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, with all due respect to Representative Daughtry, I'm very
troubled by the sections 3 through 6 of this bill. Back in 2010, this
body passed the session law that's referenced in that section of the
bill, Session Law 2010 143. This House passed that bill 109 to 2. That
was to set up this ecological study of our river basins. We have a
scientific advisory board that's been working on this since 2010, so we
have four years of a lot of time and money invested into this effort,
this hydrological study.
And I think Section 6, in particular, gives me some concern because it
sort of halts that study. I think it undoes a lot of good work that's
been undertaken by DNR and this state needs to be thinking more
proactively about water basin planning, given that water resources are
becoming increasingly shortened. So I would urge this body to vote no.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute to House Bill 1057, as amended, on its second reading. All in
favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote.
The Clerk will let the machine record the vote. Eighty-four having voted
in the affirmative, twenty-seven in the negative. The House Committee
Substitute for House Bill 1057, as amended, has passed its second
reading and remains on the calendar.
The House will be at ease.
Ladies and gentlemen, previously Representative Lewis asked that we
place Senate Bill 403 for consideration later on the calendar. The Chair
understands the gentleman is ready to carry the bill. Senate Bill 403
was read, it's now properly before us. Representative Lewis...</p>

<p id="060:00">
Recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker
and thank you ladies and gentlemen of the House. The House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 403 is largely a technical bill. I’ll go
through the sections as quickly as I can. Section 1 is technical. It
just re-states and clarifies that a person must be affiliated with a
political party for which they wish to run for office for a time period
equal to or greater than 90 days. This is not a policy change. It is
merely clarifying language. Section 2 clarifies that the order that
names of unaffiliated candidates appear on a ballot will be the under
the same random process that the state board uses during primaries.
Section 3 of the bill is technical change to explain that most counties
use their Board of Elections as their central polling site. Some do not.
They designate somewhere else. And this just says that they have to
include the hours that the central polling site was used, whichever that
was, and making sure that they offer the same number of hours for voters
to vote. Section 4 is a technical correction to a bill that we passed
last year. Section 5 is also a technical correction. Section 6 is a
technical correction. Section 7 is merely clarifying language which
recognizes that some photo IDs issued by federally recognized tribes do
not contain expiration dates. They do however contain date of issuance
and this said that that would also be a valid ID if the date of issuance
is not more than eight years old. Section 8 of the bill deals with the
effective date of the repeal of the voter owned elections act. Basically
what it would say is that any funds that remain in that fund may still
be used to present to prepare a voter’s guide so long as the funds
remain there to be used. Section 9, purely technical. Section 10, purely
technical. Several years ago we removed municipal boards of election
from the statutes because they don’t exist and this was missed. Section
11 is also a technical correction. I’m going to skip Section 12 because
I’d like to come back to that at another time, Mr. Speaker. Section 13
requires that a candidate for office may file their statement of
economic interest electronically and also that they may file it, or they
should file it directly with the state Ethics Board. Section 14 of the
bill, this deals also with the issuance of a free ID to vote. Part of
our rules have required that individuals be registered with the
Selective Service Act prior to being able to get a North Carolina ID.
This would repeal that requirement if they were getting a free ID for
the purpose of voting. Section 15</p>

Merely technical. Section 16 authorizes the State Board of Elections to
perform list maintenance with the same authority as the county boards.
Section 17 is purely technical as is Section 18, and Mr. Speaker may I
send forward an amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized
to send forth an amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This
is amendment AST-198v1. Representative Lewis moves to amend the bill on
page 7, line 35 through page 8, line 9 by deleting those lines. [SPEAKER

CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. After conferring with staff, it was
decided that this language may need some more work and since it doesn’t
apply until the 2016 election cycle, rather than try and fix it on the
floor, I would respectfully ask my colleagues to vote for the amendment
and just remove it from the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion,
further debate on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry
Hall, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not on this
amendment, Mr. Speaker. To send forward an amendment later. [SPEAKER

403. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 111 having voted
in the affirmative, none in the negative, the amendment passes.
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To send forward an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will read. The
gentleman will please state the number of the amendment he wishes to
send forward. [SPEAKER CHANGES] AST-193 version 2. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is amendment AST-193 version 2.
Representative Larry Hall moves to amend the bill on page 7, lines 32
through 34 by deleting those lines. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen. As you look the bill, you’ll notice
that this is an addition, that we’re removing the section that would
require the state board to have authority to perform list maintenance
under this section. It’s noted and I spoke with Representative Lewis
about this last week, that in the section under uniform programs, the
State Board of Elections shall adopt the uniform program that makes a
diligent effort not less than twice a year to do list maintenance, in
this section, in the first section A of this section. Additionally, it
requires that each county Board of Elections shall conduct systematic
efforts to remove names from this list of registered voters in
accordance with this section, that section being 163 82.14, List
Maintenance. And with a program adopted by the State Board of Elections.
In short, already the counties are required to conduct list maintenance
at a minimum of twice a year under a program that’s already approved by
the state Board of Elections. They are required currently to do that.
And so it would not be necessary for us now to provide additional
authority to the State Board of Elections, to go into the counties and
do list maintenance a third or fourth or however many times above and
beyond the two that are required of the statute. And so my amendment
just simply takes that unneeded section out. I don’t think it’s needed.
It’s already provided for to be done a minimum of twice a year and State
Board of Elections creates the plan that they carry out in doing those
two list maintenance purges twice a year. So I’d ask for your support on
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate Representative Hall offering this.
I would point out that it makes sense to me that the State Board of
Elections, if as Representative Hall points out have the authority to
direct the county boards to do this anyway, why should the State Board
of Elections not have concurrent authority to also do it themselves? It

Speaker: This language in this bill to keep the process more efficient
it doesn't seems to be to take this language out we can get into and
extend the discussion on it i would encourage the members to get onto
and look the statues that Representative Hall brings out 163 82.14 is a
quite a long statue it  mention certain things that performs these
things at least twice a year.under certain conditions it stays performs
under month  so is a every board statue that it makes no sense to me why
would give reserve something to give the state board ?? but not simply
allow the stare boards to do it themselves ,i oppose the amend and ask
you to vote no ,
Speaker Changes: Further discussion further debate Representative Larry
Hall please state your purpose,
Speaker Changes:  To speak the second time on the amend,
Speaker Changes: The gentlemen is recognized to debate the second time

except to say if we have the state board election to come in without any
reason ?? each one of the county board of elections as well county
commission have a problem with that .second of all the state broad tries
to prove in perform these lists maintain these functions ?? you local
board of elections have heard it ?? situations that father's and son's
have same names they have the same address father has died state board
will not know this they have no contact with the local area if they come
they have a ??? who have come in ,,now we have incidents before before
and the state has tried to solve these functions most recently in
Florida in 2012 and they really ended in debacle of thousands of and
thousands people who are alive being declared dead and their voting
rights ended up with Federal law suits ,the state does not have the
proper contact to do this efficiently ?? we need o do this more than
just twice a year minimum under the format that created state board of
elections so again this only be interference with the operation of local
board of elections they have functioning up this elections without a
problem  so as to support this amend that the county board of elections
do their job follow the instruction of state board that the state board
do their job and put the program in place,

<p id="075:00">
what the contributions are that are made to our campaigns. As you may
well know, especially during the last two sessions, we have had many
members who have sought to run for the US House of Representatives and
other Federal offices. In those cases, they are not required to make the
same kind of disclosures to the state board as we are. As a result, any
concern by people who  would be watching, the motivations for our votes
is brought into question because they can't access who is supporting us
whether on the Federal side, for action we're doing on the state side or
vice versa, supporting us through a state campaign, in hopes of
influencing us federally. And so what this does is does not limit any
fundraising that you might do. What it does is require that you disclose
to the State Board of Elections what that fundraiser is that you have
attempted or that you have recieved during the period of time. So again,
it's a good housekeeping ammendment, it has information that you would
already be accumulating for the Federal side or the State side, and it
just merely asks that you disclose it to the state board of elections
during this period of time. So I'd ask your support on the ammendment,
this is the Good Houskeeping seal of approval we need to give to our
elections. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the ammendment? And ladies and
gentlemen, the chair, without objection, wishes to be excused under rule

This is the ammendment AST 209 V2. Rep. Stone moves to ammend the bill,

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, all this ammendment does is basically
make sure that when we have a countywide bond referendum that you can't
have it when it's only a municipal election, which makes sure we get the
maximum voters out when we have  a bond referendum, so I ask you to
support the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? Rep. Glazier, please state your
purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, to see if Rep. Stone might yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stone, will the gentleman yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Rep. Stone, I'm sorry my- it was delayed in coming up on
screen. If you could explain it again and then just so I'm understanding
since i wasn't on the committee, where the request came from. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Rep. Glazier. What we're trying to do is make sure we put bond
referendums out in the counties that we make sure we get maximum voter
turnout, and sometimes we have bond referendums to go when there's only
a municipal election which we know is a much lower turnout. So what we
want to do is ensure that we get the maximum people in the county to
vote on that so by making it available only to vote in a countywide
election in even years, this protects to make sure that a maximum amount
of people are voting on how we spend the money
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the ammendment? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the ammendment, sent forth

...38 and 39 by inserting the following between those lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, the language in this amendment is identical to House Bill 919,
which passed this Chamber last spring on a count of 115 to 1. This is
the requirement that we file our campaign finance reports
electronically. As I recall, several members amended the provisions in
that bill to accommodate all the concerns and we've changed the date at
the request of the State Board of Elections so it's not effective until
January 1, 2017 to get the vendor time to prepare that software and also
to put some pressure on the vendor to prepare that software. So I
understand that the State Board of Elections is good with this
amendment. I talked to the director about it last week during the
committee debate, but we didn't have the language exactly ready at that
time.
Anyway, I urge the body's support. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
Representative Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I don't know how I voted the last time, I
might have been the one person that voted against it. I'm not sure. But
I still fill out my reports by hand and I know Bob Hall said he can't
read my writing. But, I just don't think that we ought to force the
members to file electronically as long as their filing their reports
completely by hand. When we put the system in place several years ago,
we told people it would be an option. You could have he option to do it
if you didn't want to do it. So to file my report by hand as long as I'm
doing them timely and accurately, I don't see why it should be a problem
so I'm going to vote no on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion, or
debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I like to file
my reports handwritten, too. You can see them online, they're public
record. This seems to me like it is a solution searching for a problem.
I don't know why we would require that you do this electronically. I
don't think we have a problem now. I personally like doing what I was
told to do when I first ran for office, which is fill out your report by
hand and mail it on the last day that it's due and send it registered so
you'll know it got there. And I don't want to have to, I'll do it
electronically if that's what it takes, but I would like to see this
amendment defeated. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and first of all, I'd like to
begin by thanking the lady from Guilford for sharing this with me in
advance and giving me the chance to review it. I also would like to
acknowledge that I know many of my colleagues may very well have concern
with this. I think it is worthy of note on this floor that the effective
date on this amendment is not until 2017. That gives well over two years
to get prepared to file electronically. I think it's also important to
note that when you submit your forms by hand, as frankly I have done
until this next filing. When I submit my next report it will be
electronically. When you do it by hand, someone, some state employee
that our tax money is paying, has to type in manually the doctor's
prescription that you often put on the forms that you mail in.
Third, and I think important to this conversation is that the reason we
have put the date or the reason the amendment offers the date as far out
in the future as it does, is that our State Board acknowledges that
under certain circumstances, they can't accept the report electronically
today. But what I hope however how you vote on this amendment, I hope
you'll hear this last point. Our state has paid a vendor to provide the
software to be able to receive these reports, whether or not they were
submitted on a Mac or a PC or whatnot, and the software has not been
delivered. Somebody should start asking some questions about why it's
not been delivered. It's my hope that if this amendment...</p>

[Speaker Changes]Rep Pittman Please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] Speak on the amendment
[Speaker Changes] Gentlemen right now is to debate the amendment
[Speaker Changes] The way i would do it is i fill out on a computer and
print you a copy and copy to submit and i go over two or three tines
before printing it off and i still some times miss some thing and i have
 to scratch something on what i have printed off and write in by hand
the correction before i send it off. I am just afraid if we all know may
be we have got a system where it won't let you to make a mistake. But i
still trust me doing that better. I just think we need to have the
option open. If you want to submit it online, submit in online if you
want it print it off and mail it in, you have to do it that way.
So,??(inaudible) you have to have this option. Than you
[Speaker Changes] Rep Collins, Please state your purpose
[Speaker Changes] Briefly speak on the amendment
[Speaker Changes]Gentlemen, right now is to debate the amendment
[Speaker Changes]Back in i guess 2011 after the 2011 session which was
the first session i served in this assembly, i got some kind of award
that i really didn't understand what it was.Some group gave me some kind
of sunshine award. I had no clue what it was about. Found it it was
about campaign reporting. I had no idea what idea to get. They said i
was one of the 20 members between  the two houses that was awarded that
award that year. According to this organization, which still i can't
tell the name of it, they said the two things idea to gain this award
were electronically file my campaign report and fill it on time. Now I
am not sure if the other 150 members were not filling on time, which i
thought we haven't any other choice on that, I thought that was the
lull. I just decided electronically file because that was the preferred
method. So i am sure whether other 150 members were not filing on time
but they won't be filing electronically bit i would say just be very
careful what you are voting.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Starnes, Please state your purpose
[Speaker Changes]: To speak a second time
[Speaker Changes]Gentleman right now is to debate the amendment the
second time
[Speaker Changes]Well i just don't want anyone of us to get  caught by
inadvertently being captured by the computer system which doesn't work.
As Rep Louis said the software isn't perfect.It's not working .it has
got glitches in it.  we are hoping that two years from now, it would be
working. That's what we have heard on food staff, fast track everything
else that's helping human services. we don't have a very good track
record of getting computer programs that work.So Lets leave ourselves
the option of filling the report by hand. I don't think there is going
to be any foul or any danger.
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion further debate o the amendment. If
not the question before the house is the passage of the amendment set
forth by Rep Harris in to the house committee substitute senate bill
403.All in favor vote Aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.59 having
voted in the affirmative and 55 in the negative the amendment passes.Are
there any other members who wish to send forth amendments on the bill.
If the chair is trying to determine if we should temporarily displace
this bill with a resolution. ALL MEMBERS PLANNING TO DEBATE THE BILL AS
AMENDED, Please turn on their lights this time. we will go ahead and
move forward with the main measure. We are back on this bill as amended.
Rep Larry Hall,please state your purpose
[Speaker Changes]Thank you Mr Speaker, To speak on the bill
[Speaker Changes]Gentlemen, right now is to debate on the bill as
amended.
[Speaker Changes] Well ladies and Gentlemen we have in everyday making
some improvement, i am sure a lot of them technical.But the principal
amendments to the bill were not made. So this bill is not as good as it
could be. and then we also put things in to it, which weren't necessary.
making it more difficult for people to support it who otherwise thought
it was a good deal who otherwise would have wanted to move forward with
it and agree at least in principal as what it was doing or it was
intending to do. our failure to make our best efforts on it for reason
which appeared to be articulated i guess  fear or the thought that we
could do something later so let's not do what we can do now make this
this a less attractive deal for people concerned about whether to
support it. once again  we had an opportunity to do better and we chose
not to without any good reason.</p>

Spoke on resolution. But today I guess I'm gon' end up doing both and
because of the passion and the commitment to Rutherford County I saw
Robin model in the years that I knew her. Yeah Miss Spence died suddenly
and unexpectedly a few months ago but she left a legacy of public
service and customer service of what folks really need to model after.
Robert Haddock was a true servant of the people of Rutherford county.
She cared really cared for those that worked in the clerk's office those
that came in the clerk's office and most of you folks that been in like
Representative Turner that have been in the courthouse see folks come in
that need help everyday. So don't know where to go there into stress
issues. She was one that would step out and really truly help folks. She
had a compassion to help and generally caring for those that treat him
like they were family. But she really had a passion for operating a
courthouse I think Representative Turner will understand this. Operating
a courthouse that was efficient. But the end of the day her biggest
passion was she wore every baby tree with fairness in the courthouse
under the rule of law and I think that most of the attorneys here can
understand that. I'm not known for talking a lot on the floor here but
I'm gon' tell you that on that last but certainly not least the thing
about Robin to me personally was she was my good friend and I got to
speak at her funeral and what I ended up is the way I'd like to end up
here. What I'd said then is we all miss our friend and we do and so I
would commend the resolution to the body.

community and employees in her office. And today we honor her short life
and appreciate the number of people she touched during her time in
service. I appreciate the president and the executive director of the

Robin and always thought a lot of her and the way she did and I remember
back to Mike Representative Hager when we first came up here for session
we all had dinner together. And she's just a wonderful person, wonderful
family served the folks of our area was just always very gracious. I saw
her help people who would come in and need help people who came in and
didn't have a lawyer who needed things done she was just very friendly.
Her staff was but she didn't mind getting her hands dirty and doing the
work. She's the kind of clerk that those of you who are attorneys always
admire you, they don't hide away you see 'em out there actually working
and helping folks and really treating it not only as a job but as a
mission to help people and she was that kind of person and I can assure
she's gon' be missed.

Representative Michaux, please state your purpose. Representative Adams,
please state your purpose. Representative Horn. Representative Horn,
hate to interrupt your chit-chat there but I was wondering if the
gentleman, if we are ready to go back to Senate Bill 793?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, Representative Hardister is going to carry that bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, the bill has already been read and Senate Bill 793
is now properly before us. Representative Hardister, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members, this bill makes changes to laws
pertaining to public charter schools. Most of these changes are
technical in nature. The intent of the bill is to allow charter schools
to operate efficiently. It passed the Senate on unanimous vote. We had a
discussion in the the House Education Committee. I think it's a good
bill and I'd encourage our members to support it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Riddell, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bring forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is amendment ATC-144-V1, Representative Riddell moves to amend the
bill on page 1, line 15 by rewriting the line to read:
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, what you have before you
is actually, in amendment form, House Bill 67, which passed this body
just a few days shy of a year ago. It passed with overwhelming support,
99-3 vote, and what this does is try to fix a current loophole in the
law regarding charter schools and the permanent license plates on their
vehicles. Through a recent interpretation of the law through the
Department of Transportation/Department of Motor Vehicles the charter
schools are in danger of losing their permanent license plates. This
would cause an increasing cost for the charter schools needlessly. So
what this amendment does is it takes House Bill 67, puts it in but
sunsets it in July 1st of 2015 with the understanding that the Senate is
determined to revisit the whole issue of permanent plates in the long
session of 2015. So hopefully we'll have a more permanent remedy. I have
spoken with Senator Tillman, he does not, is not opposed to this
amendment and I would encourage your support to fix this problem with
the charter schools that they will be facing very soon. Right now
they're working under a temporary extension granted by the Department of
Motor Vehicles which expires June 30th. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, we're going to temporarily displace this bill. Messages from
the Senate, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Joint Resolution 882, a joint resolution honoring the life and
memory of Martin Luther Nesbitt Jr., former member of the North Carolina
General Assembly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, without objection, this bill will be added to today's calendar
for immediate consideration. Is there objection? Hearing none it is so
ordered. For what purpose does the, strike that, Senate Joint Resolution
882, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A joint resolution honoring the life and memory of Martin Luther Nesbitt
Jr., former member of the North Carolina General Assembly. The Senate
resolves, the House concurring.

North Carolina gave to him NASCAR. He was an avid race fan. He saw an
opportunity to bridge his love with NASCAR with  his Senatorial by
organizing the General Assembly’s Pit Crew Challenge. It’s only fitting
that he will have a race, the Senator to Martin Nesbitt Memorial Race at
Newport Motor Speedway at June 21st, 2014. Senator Nesbitt has been a
supporter of their speedway and a part of the Southeast Super Truck
Series where he supported his son, Mark’s, racing efforts, and then, his
granddaughter, Taylor’s racing career. Newport Motor Speedway has dubbed
him a racing Representative. Whereas Senator Nesbitt was a Saint Luke’s
Episcopal Church. And, whereas Senator Nesbitt was a devoted family man
and a fair, but tough statesman, who served the state of North Carolina
with extraordinary dedication and tenacity. And, whereas Senator Nesbitt
died on March 6, 2014 at the age of 67. But, the day before he died,
returned to Asheville with a hero’s welcome, riding in an ambulance they
escorted by the sheriff’s deputies as well-wishers lined the road
waving, get well soon. And, American flags. And, whereas Senator Nesbitt
leaves to cherishes his memories, his wife of 35 years, D.S. Nesbitt, a
son, Martin Nesbitt, a stepson, Chad Nesbitt, a sister, Mary Anne Dotson
Silvery and two grandchildren. Now, therefore, be it resolved by the
Senate and the House of Representatives concurring. Section 1, the
General Assembly the memory of Martin Luther Nesbitt, Jr. and expresses
the appreciation of this state and its citizens for the service he
rendered. Section 2, the General Assembly extends its statements ?? to
the family of Martin Luther Nesbitt, Jr. for the loss of a beloved
family member. Section 3, the Secretary of State shall transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to the family of Martin Luther
Nesbitt, Jr. Section 4, this resolution is effective upon gratification.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The Lady from Buncombe, Representative Fisher, is
recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you mister speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, there are many circumstances that bring us together on a day like
today, where we, as the Representatives of all 100 counties of North
Carolina, come together to pay tribute to a former fellow House member.
We lost Senator Nesbitt too soon. Please let me take just a few moments
to review with you what we will want to remember about Martin Luther
Nesbitt, Representative and Senator. Maybe, to some of you, these
phrases will sound familiar. Let me give you this. The good news is.
And, my people or our people. Those are all phrases we heard Martin use
over and over again when he would tell us stories about the history of
where we live, or of the General Assembly, or of what was happening in
the Democratic Party, or whatever the issue he was called upon to talk
about. And, he could talk. Back, during the emergency meetings for flood
relief for the West in 2004 and beyond was happening during my first
term, here. I can’t tell you how many times I heard Martin say, we’ve
got to get some help for our people. Or, when he worked to pass the
Clean Smokestack legislation, it was; and the good news is that we will
continue to have clean mountain air for our people and the mountains
will always be a place where tourists want to come. Or, when he worked
to make early one-stop voting a reality, it was, let me give you this;
we need to make it easier for all our people to vote. Or, when he worked
to make sure that schools received the funding they so desperately
needed and deserved, to bring public education to the top in Buncombe
county and Asheville instead of being one of the Dirty Dozen school
systems, whose buildings and infrastructure were not being properly
maintained and replaced when necessary, it was, and the good news is, we
are now</p>

...now one of the top public school systems in the country. This is
Representative and Senator Martin Nesbitt's legacy, along with the North
Carolina Arboretum, Mountain Ahec, and any number of other initiatives
he started or collaborated on and saw to completion during his 30 plus
years in Raleigh on our behalf.
Oh, he saw things change and he even came home for what he called a
little vacation that the Republicans provided in 1994. But all the while
he was making his way back and bringing the voters with him, with a
better understanding of how important it is to get out to vote in
elections that were not presidential elections.
Senator Nesbitt got his love of all things to do with education
honestly. His father was my principal at Oakley Elementary School and
his mother was my fifth grade English teacher. And by the way, Martin
and I are cousins on our mother's sides of the family. Something I like
to remind Martin of when he was treating me too much like a freshman.
His father, Martin, Sr., was a big man like his son. And a strong
presence in my elementary school. Not someone you would want to cross.
Not unlike Martin, Jr., and how he was in the House and the Senate.
When Martin came to the House, his mother had just died in office and he
was fulfilling an appointment to replace her. Representative Mary Colton
became his seat mate in the House at that time, and Martin came in right
out of Chapel Hill law school, dashing to his seat on the House floor in
slacks and a shirt with no tie. Marie, who later became the first woman
Speaker Pro Tempore of the House, said to Martin that his attire would
just not do for the House of Representatives. From then on, Martin
referred to her as his Queen of Couthe.
There is so much to know about this man that we are paying tribute to
today. I have had several good conversations since his death with Deane,
his wife. They were married for 35 years. Here are some of the things
she shared. He's not the typical politician, she said because he would
tell you the truth even if you really didn't want to hear it.
And he worked tirelessly for education, healthcare and quality of life
issues of the people he represented. She said he tried to make life
better for the people. To bring home the jobs and recognition for the
people in the west. He was determined, even as things were changing
politically, that folks not forget that the state went further west than
Winston-Salem.
He was on the phone from the moment he left Raleigh until he got to
wherever he was going or from Asheville to Raleigh, doing his job and
that's why Deane said that he did not favor the no cell phones while
driving bill and voted against it. Because he said that's when he got
most of his work done. A point I can certainly relate to.
She said he gave his life to his work for his mountain people up to the
day he died. Senator Blue was asked by one of our local party folks
about how in the world we would find someone to take Senator Nesbitt's
place. Senator Blue responded by reciting a poem by Rudyard Kipling
titled &quot;If.&quot; Here's If and I've paraphrased it a little bit to
make it a little more gender neutral.
If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and
blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all people doubt you
but make allowance for their doubting, too. If you can wait and not be
tired by waiting or being lied about, don't deal in lies, don't look too
good nor talk too wise. If you can dream and not make dreams your
master, if you can think and not make thoughts your aim, if you can meet
with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same,
if you can bear to hear...</p>

Truth you've spoken twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, or watch
the things you gave your life to, broken, and stoop and build them up
with worn-out tools. If you can make one heap of all your winnings and
risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, and lose, and start again at your
beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss; if you can force
your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they’ve
gone, and so hold on when there is nothing in you except the Will which
says to them: “Hold on!”. If you can talk with crowds and keep your
virtue, or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, If neither foes
nor loving friends can hurt you, If all people count with you, but none
too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds’
worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
And—which is more—you’ll be fully human, my child. Martin, during his
time in the house and senate experienced the full measure of what that
poem describes. So, how do we pay tribute to this man of the mountains?
Well, as Martin would say – let me give you this. I submit that it’s by
voting in every election year and not just the presidential years. By
electing folks who will not forget that they came from the west, from
the mountains. And the good news is, that we’re all right here. We are
the ‘we’ that we’re looking for. We’re always stepping up and there’s
always someone in our midst ready to sacrifice time and talent and in
Martin’s case, a life’s work to our mountain people. Ladies and
Gentlemen and Mr. Speaker, I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Buncombe,
Representative Ramsey rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the resolution, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You. Member of the house, Governor T.J. Jarvis
has served North Carolina from 1879 to 1885 referred to another great
individual from Buncombe County, Zebulon Vance as he was monumental of
our great men. In the affections and love of the people he towered above
them all. As ages come, we’ll not be able to mar the grandeuring
greatness of Martin Mitchell so they would not be able to have faced
from the hearts and minds of the people the name of their beloved Vance.
That perhaps is not too much ?? about Governor Vance and certainly I
think in many respects you can say that about Senator Martin Nesbitt.
Senator Nesbitt grew up in the mountains. His family were there for
generations and often times in today’s politics you have a certain
[mole] that someone is and they’re in a certain ideological perspective
but Senator Nesbitt really broke the bounds of what one would take. This
past Saturday I was not able to go and I really regret, I could not get
away from work but there was a race in Newport, Tennessee that’s first
annual Martin Nesbitt memorial, southeast super truck race at the
Newport speedway. And it was in Newport, Tennessee because,
unfortunately we don’t have a race track now in Ashville but Senator
Nesbitt loved racing. His son raced. His granddaughter. [was] turned
into a wonderful part of the city of Ashville but Senator Nesbitt show
up down there on a pickup truck talking about how much we needed racing
and how that was a part of our heritage and most folks would respect
that. Over the years when I was a county commissioner and certainly down
here in the general assembly, I had opportunity to be on the same side
of the issue on many occasions with Senator Nesbitt and sometimes on the
other side of the issue and like many good folks in public office it was
all lot more fun when Senator Nesbitt was on your side. He could be a
[burden] in your side and that didn’t matter regardless of your
political party. I’m sure there were many on this side of the aisle who
could.</p>

<p id="125:00">
Say the same thing that, when Senator Nesbitt was in opposition, he was
certainly very good at that. Two things that I will always remember that
he did and I think he took great pride in, uh. In the early 80’s,
there’s an article 39 in a passed legislation that dedicated a portion
of the sales tax that goes to Buncombe county, could only be used for
school capital projects. And, there was a. Not that folks in Buncombe
County and the city of Asheville, we ever had any feuds. You all know
from down here that you don’t here any controversy from our community,
but he did that and I was a student, at that time, at Buncombe County
schools. And, we had a lot of schools that were built in the 20’s around
the time of the bin time of Asheville and Buncombe County and so, one of
them needed repair. And, because of that, over hundreds of millions of
dollars were able to be spent to improve our school capital projects.
The other was, Asheville was the first community in the state to have a
dedicated hotel tax and it was dedicated to promote our tourism economy,
what goes to our administer’s bureau. Tourism today is about a 2 and a
half billion dollar industry in Buncombe County and he guarded that very
jealously. Folks of all persuasions would suggest changes to that
legislation and as long as Senator Nesbitt was down here, he was gonna
defend that. His parents were, I think, instrumental in what he turned
out to be and, like most of us, we’re a reflection of our family. And,
he certainly lived up to that. His father is representing Fisher State,
he was a principal. His mom was a teacher. And, last session, Senator
Nesbitt’s family had been very involved in our community and there was
nothing to recognize in any contributions they made to our community, so
I talked with Representative Fisher and Representative Moffitt about the
possibility if we needed to name something for Senator Nesbitt’s mom, or
Mrs. Nesbitt, who passed away in 1979. Certainly, we’re not going to
name something after someone currently serving in office. So, I talked
to Representative Fisher and she said, have you talked to Senator
Nesbitt? And, I said, of course not. It’s going to be a surprise, we
certainly don’t wanna know about it. She said, I think you ought to call
him and let him know. So, I call Senator Nesbitt and I said, Senator,
would you mind us naming the Mayhap campus in Asheville after your mom.
And, he said, lord, no. And, that I always remember him saying that. In
1994, the one time he was not returned down by the voters of Buncombe
County from 1979 to 2013, every election he was successful except that
one. Now, I remember listening to the radio WWNC that night and, Senator
Nesbitt, it was quite a shock because he was certainly a giant in North
Carolina politics and in our community. And, it appeared that he was not
going to be successful that night, and he just, maybe he had this saying
in his little quotations somewhere in the back of his head, but he said
something that I will never forget. He’s sitting there, is it a rider
who’s never been thrown, hadn’t been on a horse that’s never been rode.
And, he just had a unique ability to say the right thing at the right
way in a simple way that anyone can understand. And, he, we’re gonna
miss him greatly. He made so many contributions to our state. And,
unfortunately, I hate that we didn’t have the opportunity to really say
goodbye to him in a better way, but his legacy is great and. For, to his
family and to all of those who were touched by them. Are deepest
sympathies go to them. Mr. Speaker, I would request that the remarks
made today be spread across the journal. And, I thank you today for your
indulgence.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Without objection, remarks will be spread across the
journal. For what purpose does the gentleman in Durham represent in
Michaux? Rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on a resolution to speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGE[ The gentleman has authority to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I had known two giant men from the mountains. One of
them was Mr. Ramsey, who served as speaker. And, as I understand it for
Martin Nesbitt, Mr. Ramsey was one of his idols. The other one was
Martin Nesbitt. Now, it’s hard to talk about your friend, but Martin got
to be a friend in 1991</p>

Dan Blue became speaker of the house.  One of the best appointments that
he made at the time was he named two co-chairs of appropriations. One
was Martin Nesbitt.  The other was David Diamond.  David was a good man,
but Martin was much more of a mountain man than David was.   And Martin
really took not only the mountain under his wings at that time, but took
the rest of the state under his wings.  He would always go for the
little guy. He was always that way.  But I think my finest memories of
Martin was that Martin was a member of the original gang of eight.  Now
for those of you who don’t know, I carry in my pocket still today the
list of the gang of eight.  We were the group that kept this general
assembly in session until December because we didn’t want a tax
increase.  You hear me, Republicans? The eight of us – Alma Adams, Dan
Blue, Toby Fitch, Bob Hensley, Howard Hunter, Merrimack Alistor, yours
truly, and Martin Nesbitt.  We sat here.  We made this body sit here
until we decided that if you were going to have a tax increase, it was
not going to be what you asked for, but what we asked for.  And that was
when the one cent tax increase was raised in December of that year. But
Martin stuck by his rules. He stuck by what he believed in. And he
always said, “You’ve got to go for broke.  You’ve got to go to help
people out.” These are the reasons that they sent us to this body.  I
recall a saying from Dante’s Inferno. “The hottest places in hell are
reserved for those who take a position in neutrality in the face of a
moral crisis.” Martin Nesbitt never failed to take a position on what he
believed was right, what he believed was best for the people of this
state. And he stood by and he did it.  That’s why Martin is up their
looking down on us, not down there looking up at us. Because he believed
it.  Those who did not know him, you really missed the treat of your
life.  So I guess you know it’s just one of those things that here again
and as a friend, as a good friend, there are many things I could tell
you about the fights that all of us we went through to get things done,
but the one thing that stood out about Martin was that he was his own
man and he looked out for the people in being his own man. That’s it,
folks.  He was just a great guy. He will be missed. His wisdom will be
missed. It’s like that song that has ended, but his memory lingers on. I
commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Lucas, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen, I first met then
Representative Martin Nesbitt in 2001. Representative Nesbitt occupied
this area right here.  And of course, I was at the back. But when
Representative Nesbitt spoke, you really gave attention.  Representative
Michaux had mentioned the gang of eight and being a freshman, I soon
learned how powerful the gang of eight could be. They stuck very
tenaciously to their beliefs.  And I remember Representative Nesbitt
saying that, &quot;Well I'm almost like Lyndon Johnson.  If you believe
that you’re right, go ahead with it.”</p>

...never backed down from a good fight. He would not back down. One of
the most fierce debates that I remember on this floor, back in '01, was
with his roommate David Redwine. I said, &quot;Gosh, they're roommates,
and he's debating him that ferociously?&quot; But he would not back down
when it came to the budget. He stuck to his principles. And yes, he did
initiate and help with the fight to keep this general assembly in
session until December 6th. I remember that very well. It was December
6th because I kept saying to my wife, &quot;I think we're gonna be here
for Pearl Harbor Day.&quot; But they did stick to their guns, and they
won. That's just the kind of man that Representative Nesbitt was. So
indeed, it gives me pleasure to commend this resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Martin, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. I came to the House
just a few months after Senator Nesbitt had made the lateral move across
to our body across the hallway, but immediately became aware of his
presence. I have many good memories of him, one of which was when we
were chairing a joint select committee on emergency management together.
I would show up to his office for a planning meeting about the business
of the committee; inevitably, an hour later we'd find ourselves having
delved into every other topic known to man -- racing, mental health,
veterans, more race cars, and still more race cars -- and then
completely neglect the business of our committee, and walk away from it
feeling like we had had time well spent. That said, though, one of my
favorite memories of Senator Nesbitt was an encounter with his nature as
a fighter, and a fighter for things that he believed in, for his people,
for the west, for the mountains. I chaired the Transportation
Appropriation Subcommittee and had the misfortune of having a budget
that someone else had amended to do something messing with funding for
the roads out west. I had nothing to do with it -- [I] was just chairing
the committee -- and got in his way. And we engaged in an extremely
heated...almost a shouting match outside the committee room. I came away
from it not really sure what I was being yelled at for. Martin came away
from it thinking that was just business as usual, I think, as he was
advocating for his people. Once my anger died down I realized what
Martin was doing. I had been in the presence of greatness, and I'd
received a butt-chewing from one of the best in the business, and it's a
memory I honestly treasure to this day. Martin was a fighter. He was a
fighter from the day he got in here next to Representative Colton in
1979, and he fought for his people 'til the day he died. And that's an
example for all of us to emulate. I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Orange,
Representative Insko, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Members, it was my privilege
and my honor -- and, I guess, my challenge -- to serve as co-chair with
Senator Nesbitt on the Joint Legislature Oversight Committee on Mental
Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services. And he
plunged into that work, I think, with the same kind of energy, I think,
that he took on everything. This is a complicated area, and he didn't
back away at all from learning all the complexities. He asked a lot of
questions. He spent a lot of time on this issue. He set specific goals
about what problem we should work with next, how can we solve it. He
engaged the staff. He was passionate and persuasive, and he made
significant contributions to people with mental illness and
developmental disabilities and addiction disease. And I commend the
resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Iredell,
Representative Brawley, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. I first
met Representative Nesbitt in 1981, when I came down here, and I've
enjoyed listening to the comments. Representative Nesbitt was a
dedicated statesman...</p>

Sir, I need to change my vote on Senate bill 403 to &quot;aye&quot;.

before we took up the resolution, we were on Senate bill 793 and we were
on the Riddell ammendment. All members have that back up on your
dashboard?
I believe Rep. Riddell, the gentleman from Alamance had already
explained his ammendment. Had the gentleman already debated his
ammendment? Okay. Further discussion, further debate on the ammendment?
Seeing none, submitting as favored the adoption of ammendment 2,
offerred by Rep. Riddell to Senate bill- to the House committee
substitute for Senate bill 793 will vote &quot;aye&quot;, those opposed
will vote &quot;no&quot;. The clerk will open the vote.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you, members. Members, this is an
ammendment that I believe is a consent ammendment, I've worked it with
Rep. Hardister, and it is for a section of the bill that is fast track
and all it basically says is just to make sure that although we're fast
tracking, that the other requirements for the application of charter
process are still in place, and as are all of the requirements, with one
exception, and that is the elimination of the required planning year for
applicants that are selected for fast track, since that's the purpose of
fast track. We worked with chater school folks and I believe Rep.
Hardister has no objection to the ammendment, and I ask for support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Hardister, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Sexual orientation is not defined anywhere. I have here thirty different
types of sexual orientation. Now one of the Presidents of the House is
when we discussed the Bill about four years ago where it was for the
first time included under the Statute, I offered an amendment to exclude
two sexual orientations but see, I didn’t know this was coming up if I
could let this to the Sergeant for passing it out. I thought we should
exclude pedophilia, masochism and sadism which are sexual orientations
but the Speaker at that time ruled it out of order to define the term.
Would Representative Fisher, you’re in for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher, does the lady owe?. The lady does not ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would any member who seeks to vote for this amendment yearn for a
question? Well, I think the response speaks for itself. Many, many
sexual orientation are not the ones you want to have teaching kids in
school. Now you may think you know what you mean by this but you don’t.
I’ll encourage you to vote against this amendment. I would  just like to
read you a few of them. I think I won’t read a few instead, what I’ll do
is if Sergeant ?? is passing it around and if you think this is what you
really are going to vote for, I would ask that you while we have three
lights up so you’ll get a chance to read this before you vote on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think this is a very good amendment. I will say to Representative Stam
who I understand your arguments but pedophilia is not a sexuality and we
cannot ?? to keep calling things that are something that’s not. It’s
offensive to a whole group of people but pedophilia is not a sexuality.
It is a disease and it is a problem that has to be addressed outside of
this ?? but the bigger issue here is that in the State of North Carolina
we are continuing to have policies that treat people like second class
citizens, the LGBT community is part of that problem. You cannot go up
into a charter school or a private school for that matter and say, “I’m
not going to accept Black children. That is illegal, you cannot do that.
And so, I don’t think that you should be able to do that. We need to be
able to this in a more comprehensive way but at least in this Bill that
we’re talking about educating our children, we will not say because of
who you are because of how you identify yourself not as  a pedophile but
as a LGBT person. That you are not able to go to the school and no
school should be able to deny you because of that right. This is a very
simple amendment. It treats people with respect and dignity they deserve
and I urge the adoption of the amendment please.

Merely explains that a charter school may grow naturally in grade levels
with his kids.  What does that mean?  That means that if a charter
school is initially approved for K-12 and it only opens up K-5 then the
very next year it can go K-6, no problem.  But if the person applying
for the charter didn't perhaps plan ahead enough and only got approved
for K-5, then when they get to 6th grade, those kids can't move on up to
6th grade. So this would just say that it could grow one grade a year
and I would ask for your support of the amendment.  Thank you Mr
Speaker.  SPEAKER CHANGES.  Representative Hardister, please state your

SPEAKER CHANGES.  He yields.  SPEAKER CHANGES.  Representative Lewis if
I had an objection to the information containing your amendment, would
you have a problem with laying it on the table?  SPEAKER CHANGES.  Mr
Speaker I'm not sure what the gentleman is trying to ask.  Perhaps if I
had surprised the bill sponsor with an amendment they wouldn't support
it, but they've certainly indicated that they did.  SPEAKER CHANGES.
Representative Glazier please state your purpose.  SPEAKER CHANGES.  To
see if Representative Lewis would yield for a different question.
SPEAKER CHANGES.  Representative Lewis, will you yield?  SPEAKER
CHANGES.  Yes Mr Speaker.  SPEAKER CHANGES.  He yields.  SPEAKER
CHANGES.  Thank you representative, and on it's face I understand what
you're trying to do, and it's really just a two part question.  One is
has this amendment been run by the state board and are they ok with it,
that's sort of part one, and part two, I completely understand the need
to do this if you opened like a K-4 and you want to expand to a 5th, but
I worry a little bit about the blanket expansion and I wonder if you
could talk about it when you're transitioning from elementary to a
middle school, or from middle school to high school because that's a
completely different charter, and so I wonder if you could answer both
those and then I may have a follow up. SPEAKER CHANGES.  Well I
appreciate the inquiry Representative, the intent of the amendment is to
allow for the natural growth of the school, obviously if a student
begins in school and is pleased with the performance of the results they
receive, the type of teaching they receive in the school, and the school
is able to continue to provide quality education services in the next
grade then this just is an automatic ?? if you will, and the school will
grow in that regard.  To the first part of the inquiry that you have, I
will always answer completely candidly.  I did check with all of the
bill sponsors in both this chamber and the senate but I did not speak to
the state board.  SPEAKER CHANGES.  One follow up please Mr Speaker.
SPEAKER CHANGES.  Representative Lewis, do you yield?  SPEAKER CHANGES.
I do Mr Speaker.  SPEAKER CHANGES.  He yields.  SPEAKER CHANGES.  I
appreciate that Representative Lewis, and I do appreciate that the state
board wasn't asked but that you did talk to the bill sponsors and maybe
this is going to end up being my argument but I wonder if we vote for
your amendment today on the theory that it's just trying to do one grade
level, but there are concerns this evening and I would object a third
then.  Would you be willing to talk about putting some limitation on
your amendment tomorrow that limits it to the nature of whether it's an
elementary, middle, or high school charter, which I think would make
those of us who are going to vote  for this bill much more comfortable
than if we are opening a charter to a whole new level.  Does that make
some sense?  SPEAKER CHANGES.  It does and Mr Speaker, let me just
assure the gentleman from Cumberland that I'll be glad to chat with him
and with anyone else he would like to include at a later time tonight or
tomorrow, whenever you want to get to it.  I'm not prepared to commit to
any language I have not seen yet.  SPEAKER CHANGES.  Thank you.  SPEAKER
CHANGES.  Representative Hardister, please state your purpose.  SPEAKER
CHANGES.  I'd like to see Representative Lewis yield for question.

<p id="160:00">
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, didn't we pass- I've been conferring with my colleagues
back here - didn't we pass a law last year that allows charter schools
to expand one grade level per year without SVU approval?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, thank you for that inquiry. It's my understanding, and
you are more knowledgable, let me point that out, than I am on this, but
it's my understanding from reading this statute that that is the case
only after 3 years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Adams, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I'd like to ask Rep. Lews a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Lewis, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Rep. Lewis. I wanted to follow up a little bit on Rep.
Glazier. So, the way this ammendment reads, if you have what we call
right now &quot;middle school&quot;, 6,7, and 8, I think that's what
that is, so if we're talking about the school only going to the 8th
grade, that school could advance to the 9th? Into a whole different type
of school? Is that what this ammendment will do? I know you said 1
grade, but that could be that the school could be at the end of that
grade, and it could take you into another level. So is that what I'm
understanding this will do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, thank you for the inquiry. As I tried to explain to the
gentleman from Cumberland, that is my understanding. If a student and
their parent or guardian are pleased with the education that they
recieve, and the school is able to educate them, the next year of their
academic life they should have the chance to do that. I don't know if- I
guess the short answer to what you ask is yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Followup?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So when the schools get the charter, isn't it chartered for like an
elementary school, a middle school, high school. So wouldn't that change
something?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well thank you for that, Representative. As I tried to explain in my
remarks, what the school asks for in its initial charter can be a range
of things. And again, a school can ask for K-12, and then only elect for
whatever reason, to do K-4. And then the next year, without having to
wait the 3 years that are required, it  could add the 5th grade, and
then the following year the 6th grade, and so on. All this says is, even
if you didn't- if you have the demand for the chance to educate kids on
a higher grade level than what you currently have then you can advance
one grade a year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Queen, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the ammendment sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Lewis, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Lewis, a few years back I had the privilege of serving on the Blue
Ridge charter school commission and one of the issues that we dealt with
was performance of our charter schools. Does your ammendment
automatically allow a charter school to expand year after year without
any performance criteria being met?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Queen, thank you for that inquiry. As you know sir, you're familiar
with charter schools, there are a variety of monitoring mechanisms that
monitor the progress and performance of our public charter schools. This
ammendment would in no way weaken the monitoring that is applied to our
public charter schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well the point of having standards is to meet those standards and you
know we've been in the standard discussion around here for weeks. Do you
get to expand in spite of your performance if it's poor, or do you have
to reach a minimum

<p id="165:00">
Told before you are allowed to have this, this privilege of expanding
your charter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen, as I’ve tried to say before, current law requires
or allows the expansion by grade after three years but nothing in this
amendment affects the monitoring that goes on of the charter schools.
Nothing lowers the accountability that the charters have to educate the
kids that are used to attain them. This amendment merely deals with
allowing the Charter school to add a grade level a year. It does not in
any way remove or restrict the monitoring of authority’s ability to look
at the performance of the school.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentlemen ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So it seems to me that you would want to meet some threshold to expand
but what you’re saying is they continue to monitor, the noose is bad,
expand anyway?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen, nothing in this Bill does anything to interfere or
nothing in this amendment does anything to interfere with the State
Board’s ability to monitor the performance of schools. You know that
there are stringent rules that apply to charters and how they are
monitored the academic growth, if they have the performance so they
have, you know those things are in place. This amendment does absolutely
nothing to weaken those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. May I speak on the Bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s one thing to, it’s one thing to monitor our charter schools and
it’s another thing to pay attention to the monitoring. It seems to me
that if we have a vehicle or a mechanism for expansion, it should follow
on success. One thing I can tell you about our charter schools is we
have some good ones, we have some average ones and we have some poor
ones. And it seems to me that if we want to make a charter school system
that really meets the expectations of the public that there should be
some reward if you are excelling and there should be some, some, some
consequences to poor performance that shouldn’t say, “Well, if you just
have more of this, it might be better.” So it strikes me that if you
don’t have the connection between performance and expansion you’ve
missed a major opportunity so, which we don’t seem to have in this
amendment. So I plan to vote against it and suggest you might too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[Speaker Changes]
To debate the Bill ??.
[Speaker Changes]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I had come into the chamber completely ready to
vote for this bill and work with the amendment and Representative
Hardister. Thought the Bill did some good things and fix some things,
but this amendment really changes it,  and let me tell you why I
disagree with the bill now, and before I looked at the amendment. If you
looked at the language of the amendment, which is a concern. It says the
following things are not material changes in the charter. Well of course
it's a material change in the charter. That's the whole point. And you
can tell that because the sub-paragraph right above it, sub-search three
says specifically that the charter can advance a grade after 3 years.
Number 1. And number 2, provided there isn’t as Representative Queen
said, inadequate performance.
What this amendment now does is essentially eliminate sub-section 3
without doing it. It simply says now, you can advance every year and you
don’t have to have it in your charter, its not a material change
and you can do it with inadequate performance. Now Representative
Lewis's  right that there;s still ??
that you've taken away the remedy. This is a very major change and thats
what I feared when I first saw it, but of course we're operating on
quick time it says someone who came in and spoke on it to ?? ??
atonement in the education committee booming for the bill and the
education committee was prepared fully to vote for it here. But we are
absolutely now allowing to go back to where we had prohibited in the
charter bill passed through the front door. And were doing it in a way
that doesn’t even revoke the section prior to it. I am all for the
change Representative Lewis suggests as a policy matter if you’re
staying within confines of elementary middle, or high school. But
representative of that, is its absolutely right. Just take with me the
assumption that theres no charter ?? one through eight school, you
didn’t have a high school. what this says is, because the parents are
pleased, you can now open without ever having had a charter that put in
the ninth grade, a ninth grade without ever having had your curriculum
reviewed, your teachers reviewed, anything done provided the parents
like it at  that charter. But thats not the purpose of a charter. This
is not a private school, this is a public school, and that is the
distinction we ought to care about, we are essentially undoing,
unravelling, the limitations we have put and we voted as a compromise,
as a body on charter schools thru an amendment on the floor that no
one's
?? with all due respect. and for that reason I'm going to vote against
this bill and object a third reading. And at least hope that we can all
talk with our school boards with the state board and get a better sense
of what we're trying to do and maybe get a more limited amendment that
stays at least within elementary, middle or high school qualifications.
Thank you.
[Speaker Changes]
Further discussion, further debate?
If not, the question before the house, is the adoption of the house
committee substitute to senate bill 793 on its second reading. Those in

Senate Bill 865, the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 865, a bill to be entitled An Act
Providing that the Town of Boone Shall Not Exercise the Powers of
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction, General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan is recognized to debate the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Seizing counties in North
Carolina undertake a land use planning and may apply land development
regulations only in the geographic areas over which the legislature has
delegated them authority to do so. There are no overlapping of city and
county land development regulatory jurisdictions in North Carolina.
Jurisdiction of an area is assigned to either a city or a county. The
general rule is that municipalities have exclusive jurisdiction within
their city limits and counties have exclusive jurisdiction within
unincorporated areas outside the city limits. The exception to this rule
is that municipalities may, under certain circumstances, extend
regulations to a limited area immediately outside their city limits. A
city may not extend its regulatory or police powers beyond the city
limits without specific legislative authority. This police power is an
exercise of a state authority rather than a local power.
The legislature adopted the bulk of a study commission's recommendations
on this issue and granted state-wide authority for a municipal
extraterritorial land use regulation in 1959. The original
extraterritorial authorization exempted bonafide farms from zoning
coverage because this exemption existed for county zoning. The farm
exemption for the extraterritorial area of cities was deleted in the
1971 recodification but was passed again by this General Assembly last
session.
Why do we have an ETJ? According to the authorities, state law
authorizes municipalities to have ETJ areas based upon existing or
projected urban development and areas of critical concern to the city
that are expected to come within their corporate limits in the near
future and allow for a smoother transition from county to municipal
services.
The reason for this bill, which was also introduced in the last short
session two years ago, was that in the two years since this action, this
bill was proposed, the town of Boone has made no effort to address the
concerns brought forward by the legislative delegation. Senator Soucek
and I have been constantly urged to move forward by the public over the
past two years, including a local resolution on this.
There's a foundational principal of property rights here. Regulation
without representation. The planning board appointments have become
political issue in our area. For example, one planning commission member
said that the appointees should have a general understanding and
agreement with the town's master plan in order to serve on the Board of
Adjustment. One resident, one citizen said the idea that you have to
agree with the town's plans in order to serve on the board is not only
objectionable, it's ludicrous.
The town of Boone has had ETJ since 1985 but has never used it for its
intended purpose, which was to grow. They've relied on voluntary
annexations, they've bragged. But if it's voluntary, you don't need ETJ
control. The topography of Boone is a bowl. The town occupies the bottom
of a valley and all around it are our mountains. And it's too expensive
to move water uphill so they're never going to expand and send water and
sewer outside of the current city limits. And you may hear that water is
an issue in the area, that is a question. It may be. But, after we had
extensive local controversy over a water intake in the New River that
was designed to double the town's giant straw dip into our precious New
River, my question was why did the first developmental denial from the
town after this never mentioned water as a reason to deny development.
No, the town of Boone's ruling junta is primarily about one thing and
that's control. Control over people who have no recourse to the ballot
box against their regulators.
What will happen to those in the ETJ under this bill? This bill provides
six months to transition to the correct elected authority of the county
commissioners. The county commissioners can already provide protection
under county regulations. There's a high impact land use ordinance,
there's housing development ordinances...</p>

You’ve got HOA’s, POA’s. Our Senator lives one mile from Boone. He’s not
in a housing development, he’s not in the E.T.J. near a quarry, for
example. He’s not putting anyone in a situation that he’s not
experienced from his 15 years. Before anybody asks the question, yes the
town is against us. Of course they are, we’re taking away a power that
they’ve used to control the citizens in their area for decades. I urge
your support of this local bill where our local delegation seeks to
protect individual constituents against an overreaching town. Thank you
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] At this time, the pages are dismissed for the day.
Representative Fisher, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I know
that you’ve probably heard enough from me today, but I just want to
refresh your memory about an earlier conversation that we had on this
same bill when it was objected to having been placed on the calendar for
consideration today. We saw this bill, yesterday, in committee, where it
was not given support for a favorable report. And, we are now, that we
saw it again an hour committee met, back on the calendar due to some
creative rule-making. And then, we see it again, here on the floor,
after objections having been made. I have to say that it is not a very
transparent process that we are working under, here, in the General
Assembly today. I think that it leaves a lot to be desired, not only
from the members here.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Point of order, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Lady, may you state your point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Are we discussing the process or the actual bill? I
think we need to get Germain to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I will keep it to the bill, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Fisher has uphold.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I appreciate that. As I was saying, the process for
looking at this bill, I think, needed to be a little transparent. I
believe that the people from the town of Boone were, said, yesterday,
that they were going to make a very concerted effort to look at the
concerns that were being submitted to them by the County. Ladies and
gentlemen, the process is not a good one. We need to give the town a
chance to come to terms with this, with its citizens. And, I would
appreciate it if you would join with me in opposing this bill. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I speak on the bill and send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman would like to send forth his amendment
now.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Okay, the Representative Luebke sends forth his
amendment the clerk will read.

speak first about the bill, and then, on the amendment. Members of the
House, this is an extremely.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Luebke, we’re on your amendment now. If
you would, if you want to.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Well, Mr. Speaker I’d asked to speak on the bill and
send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Or we could displace your amendment so you can speak on
the bill if that’s your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Temporarily, temporarily, and then, to hear my
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, this is
an extremely controversial bill. This is a bill whose opposition has
been opposed by Republicans and Democrats alike. It was defeated, the
motion for a favorable report was defeated yesterday in the House
government committee, again with Republican and Democratic opposition.
The bill resurfaced today, ?? 12 to 15. In today’s debate, today’s vote,
it passed just 18 to 16. So, the issue of getting rid of
extra-territorial jurisdiction is very controversial. And, there’s a
couple of reasons. One is that, if you do not have extra-territorial
jurisdiction and the County does not have zone, all kinds of things can
happen just outside the city limits that are very harmful for those that
live outside the city. For example, without E.T.J. and without zoning
for the County</p>

asphalt plant could be put up right next to a neighborhood. The asphalt
plant being just outside the city limits and the neighborhood being
within the city. And indeed, there was someone who came forward
yesterday from Boone who said exactly that had...there was an attempt
and thanks to ETJ they were able to keep the asphalt plant from coming
in. ETJ also protects people inside the city limits from, say, a massive
center that might come in just outside city limits. ETJ protects that.
The importance...and then for that reasoning now I'd like to send
forward my amendment Mr. Peter. Send forward my amendment.
Speaker Changes: Representative Lucas, before you send forth your
amendment, I think the clerk has a technical correction that needs to be
addressed. If you can take care of that with her. Your amendment refers
to a page two. There's only one page to this bill. So, you need to
correct that with the clerk first before we can proceed on your
amendment. If you'll come up to see the clerk.
Speaker Changes: Very quickly, yes.

Speaker Changes: To see if the gentleman from Watauga would yield to a
question.
Speaker Changes: Representative Jordan, do you yield?
Speaker Changes: I do yield.
Speaker Changes: He yields.
Speaker Changes: Representative Jordan, this is a local bill that
applies to the  applies to the town of Boone, is that correct?
Speaker Changes: Correct.
Speaker Changes: And, will you yield to additional questions?
Speaker Changes: He yields.
Speaker Changes: Are you the representative for that town of Boone or is
there any other representative in this body who represents that town of
Boone?
Speaker Changes: No, sir.
Speaker Changes: Additional questions.

Speaker Changes: As I understand, this is not your bill. This is a bill
filed by Senator Soucek, is that correct?
Speaker Changes: That's correct.
Speaker Changes: Additional question.

Speaker Changes: Is Senator Soucek the only legislature who represents
Boone in the senate?
Speaker Changes: That's correct. Yes, sir, that's correct.
Speaker Changes: One final question.
Speaker Changes: He yields.
Speaker Changes: Is your entire legislation delegation for this, for
Watauga county, in agreement with this bill?
Speaker Changes: Absolutely.

Speaker Changes: Gentleman may be recognized for a motion.

question.

Speaker Changes: Representative Moore?
Speaker Changes: Since the member has sent forth his amendment, I
withdraw the motion at this time, but I will move it again, shortly.
Speaker Changes: Representative Moore withdraws his motion for the
previous question. Representative Blue, you can now speak on your
amendment. We've already read it in and the gentlemen recognized to
debate your amendment.
Speaker Changes: The issue here in Watauga county is that there is no
zoning. There is nothing to protect the people who live in the
extraterritorial jurisdiction. If this bill is successful...
Speaker Changes: Mr. Baker.
Speaker Changes: I have an amendment...
Speaker Changes: Representative Jordan, please state your purpose.
Speaker Changes: Will the gentleman yield for a question?
Speaker Changes: Representative Blue, will you yield?
Speaker Changes: I will yield when I'm finished.
Speaker Changes: The gentleman doesn't yield.
Speaker Changes: There is no zoning in Watauga county. If this bill
becomes law, then the people who are now in the ETJ have no protection
from the examples of the super mall, the asphalt plant, etcetera. What
this bill does is does not proclude the ending of the extraterritorial
jurisdiction, which many of you know  in your cities works very well. In
which members of both parties spoke about, about how it works well, ETJ.
What it says is that the ETJ disappears 30 days after the county passes
a zoning ordinance. Members, I think it's critical that the citizens be
protected. The zoning ordinance does just that. The ETJ can disappear if
the zoning ordinance is done. This amendment addresses Watauga county,
and I urge support for the amendment so that the citizens can be
protected under a zoning ordinance when they can't be under ETJ.

House of Representatives was trying to step in an as one person said
abusively deal with the people of Boone and the ETJ, and that we were
trying to come in, force our opinions on people on the local area rather
than the local government. It looks to me like what this amendment does,
and correct me if I’m wrong, we’re basically telling the people in
Watagua County that they have to have some kind of zoning ordinance,
either an ETJ through the city or a county-wide zoning ordinance whether
they want one or not. Is that not correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is not correct. If you read the amendment it says
that the zoning is only necessary to be in the ETJ area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, we’re still saying that the people in the ETJ have
to have some kind of zoning. Isn't that correct, if your amendment
passes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My amendment says yes. The ETJ is beneficial, but
Representative Collins, if you will, the difference is that zoning
ordinance would be voted on by commissioners who are voted on, whose,
who have, on those people who have a vote. The objection to the ETJ is
that many people live, the people that live in the ETJ don’t have a vote
in this case on the Boone City Council. My amendment simply says when
ETJ is there that the Watagua County must pass a zoning ordinance for
the ETJ area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lucas, I ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I noticed the word must in there; so, we are indeed
saying that the people in this area outside of Boone are either going to
have to Boone continuing to rule them through an ETJ or the county
commissioners are going to have to county-wide zoning which the citizens
of Watagua County may or may not want.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First of all, again, Representative Collins, it’s not
about county-wide zoning. It’s about zoning the ETJ area, and the
advantage of this zoning amendment is that it gives the vote to the
people because sometime people have said ETJs are wrong because the
people that live there don’t have a vote. This gives the people the
vote. If you will vote for this amendment to have zoning in the previous
ETJ area. What it says is if the amendment passes the ETJ goes away. I
urge support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman’s recognized for a motion. Have the
