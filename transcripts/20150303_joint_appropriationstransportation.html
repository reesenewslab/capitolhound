  ...construction activities are funded by some federal funds, but mostly
highway funds.  There are some federal and interstate bridge dollars.
The interstate maintenance account is what we use to do heavy
maintenance on our interstates.  We do a lot of paving projects on our
interstates to improve the surface, riding surface of pavement on those
particular facilities, and we use bridge program funds, federal funds to
do preservation and maintenance work on bridges on the state highway
system, on the interstate system.
State highway funds include contract resurfacing, highway maintenance,
bridge program funds, pavement preservation funds, secondary road paving
programs or funds, which is a $12 million program on a statewide
priority system for paving our gravel roads.  There’s also contingency
small construction, economic development, squad safety and public access
funds that build smaller projects.
This graphic here is our current year funding.  It breaks it down by
categories.  If you’ll note, our current state allocation for this past
fiscal year is right at $1.1 billion and we have a federal allocation of
about $282 million, which includes $91 million for interstate pavement
resurfacing for projects across the state, and includes $9 million that
we use for bridge projects for structurally sound preservation on
interstate bridges.
For structurally unsound bridges, rehabilitation repair/replacement, our
federal allocation this year was $191 million, so it was a total federal
dollars used for maintenance activities of $282 million.  They gave us a
total maintenance budget for working on the system of approximately $1.4
million for this past fiscal year.
This chart here is a demonstration, this is out of our Mopar? report
that Miss Vanderburg? will talk about shortly, is a demonstration of
different budget scenarios.  These give scenarios of what we would do
distribution-wise or allocation-wise if we had an additional $200
million up to $700 million to address our full needs identified for
maintenance on our system, or in contrast, if we had, if we had to cut
$100 million, $200 million or $300 million out of our current
maintenance program, where we would actually do that.
These activities are prioritized, disasters and emergencies are our no.
1 priority, of course.  Our no. 2 priority is our pavements and the
preservation of those pavements, and our no. 3 priority of course is our
structurally unsound bridge maintenance.  So we would allocate more
money to those particular three items if we had money; and if we had
less money, we obviously would go to our lower priorities to decrease
the funding in those particular categories.
This is a graphic that shows the funding allocations by category.
You’ll not that contract resurfacing is our biggest piece of the pie at
$480 million, and then of course, our maintenance fund is primary,
secondary and general maintenance reserve that we allocate to the
divisions for maintenance activities across the state total about
$440-$450 million.  Then we also have our bridge preservation funds for
working on functionally obsolete or structurally deficient bridges of
$153 million, and of course, the pavement preservation is our chip/seal
funds of $65 million.
Some of the legislative directive from the last session included a
staffing study.  The study was completed and delivered to joint
legislative oversight on Dec. 1 of 2014.  We’ll go into more detail with
the staffing study tomorrow, that’s ?? presentation.
Pavement preservation outsourcing, there was a requirement last session
and establishment of the pavement preservation line item, the pavement
preservation funding that we have accelerating outsourcing of that
particular activity to the public sector.  The first report was
submitted in Dec. of 2014 that gave the current status of where DOT is
relative to outsourcing efforts in that particular category.
I gave a report a few weeks ago relative to the pavement preservation
current status of the outsourcing.  Our projections are it will be about
57% outsourced...

  Speaker changes: once we elect contracts if the spring with that
particular activity we also head of the ?? condition of the state
highway system is find it needs one of those two charts are directly out
of that documents the more powers ?? the operations performance
appraisal ?? first legislature on January 2015 ans we also doing ??
highway maintenance program  and this will be posted to board
transportation websites ?? it will be approved by the board on the
meeting that we are having this particular week ?? legislation specified
in previous systems of program funds ?? are pleased to report that very
much on track to see that goal and more than 70% of funds allocated and
get that contract prior to December of this year ?? my part of the
present on sir
Speaker changes:Thank you Mr.Holder ??
Speaker changes:??
Speaker changes:i don&#39;t have that figures when that&#39;s knock my
head but i can tell you that last spring as long as i came into the job
last ?? or my i got a call from several municipalities about the dollar
mount of our reimbursement agreement all of the agreements we have ??
for doing sign repair for doing traffic markings they re all reimbursed
with the department actually has ?? with the city what they do the work
they bill us what they do they not to exceed price so we would estimate
what the department to actually do that work and that is the basis of
the agreement with the city so i guess it&#39;s physical neutral ?? we
wont pay them more than we would do it ourselves
Speaker changes:??
Speaker changes:?? but i would say is  probably close to 100 if not more
we rely on our administrative partners to operation on steady systems
and we buying  steady partners in that and  could say with the meeting
we have with them they are concerned ?? declining that it was until the
past this yer we re trying to maintain that agreement trying to maintain
that level of fund
Speaker changes:??
Speaker changes:Good question Representative ?? they use power bill
funds on their close cities and streets on rods their state system rods
on our official mates ?? our agreement is manage those signal
responsibilities ?? on their own state rods so they use the power bill
funds and actually apply them and make hem on their city streets for
signals it looks puzzled ??

  ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. In a sense it is outsourcing because we’re
relying on an external party to help us with maintenance. It’s more
efficient in many cases for, let’s just say Charlotte for instance, all
the signals that are on State System Roads within the municipal limits
of Charlotte, we have an agreement with Charlotte, a reimbursable
agreement where they have to, they go out and do preventative
maintenance. They change out parts to the controller, they actually
respond to emergencies. So they keep a record of all of that. And we do
an accounting that that maintenance activity is actually done on the
State System or state-owned asset. So if they send us a bill and it has
a signal on it for Idlewild Road and we know Idlewild is a City Street,
then we would deduct that off the bill. But that’s delineated as part of
the agreement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to ask a question, first, if
you don’t mind. Mr. Holder, on one of your sliders, you had a breakdown
between primary roads, primary routes and secondary routes. If, and
there’s a lot of discussion sometimes about our, how we have a
state-wide maintenance system and the counties don’t bear any
responsibility for maintenance. How many miles, if we sort of had the
standard state model where you have state, county and municipal roads,
how many miles of those roads would be dedicated to county maintenance?
If you know or, an estimate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, the, probably the
majority of those, of that secondary road mileage would be, so the
64,000 miles of secondary road, which many of those in the counties are
what we consider to be farm to market roads. Two lane, two-way roads.
Your major secondary roads that are adjacent to or run through
municipalities, I would think, in the standard model, like in Virginia
or South Carolina, would keep those roads for maintenance just because
they’re such a critical part of this transportation system. So the, just
a rough two-thirds of the mileage probably would be county-maintained.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Shepard. DO you have a follow
up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a follow up, thank you Mr. Chair.
Representative ?? So basically, a state highway that runs through a
municipality, that’s not taken care of by the county, that’s being taken
care of by the state. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct, yes sir. That’s
exactly right. And Senator Daniel, if I could take a liberty with the
previous question, as most of you all know, the state highway system or
the county road mileage was transferred to the State Highway Commission
many years ago. We’re as a matter of fact this week celebrating the
hundredth anniversary of the department, or of the establishment of the
State Highway Commission. And we feel, our department feels, I feel in
North Carolina we have a much more efficient model because even though
it is very expensive, we’re directly accountable for the maintenance and
operation of our system through our gas tax and through our Highway
Trust Fund. And it gives our residents of our state a whole lot more
consistent experience and a consistent level of maintenance throughout
the state. You have a unilateral or a Unitarian owner of the system. So
instead of having one hundred maintenance to our Department of
Transportation facilities, you have really one organization that
provides consistency and uniformity through the state, which if you’ve
been to other states adjacent to us, I live not far from South Carolina,
you drive on their secondary roads, not to cast dispersions on them, but
they definitely are not up to quality that our secondary roads are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Any other questions for Mr. ?? Yes sir.
Senator Ford. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve had a couple people ask me, ??
municipalities at home they were told there would be no more tar and
gravel roads. Is that true? That that was being done away with? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No sir. Our quote tar and gravel roads, pardon the vernacular,
are chip seals. And that is what the pavement preservation program is
intended to address. So the legislation, the budget provision last year
that authorized 65 million dollars in that particular

Speaker changes:we can look that how they maintain roads in Germany too
?? My name is Jennifer ?? engineer and i will be talking to you bout

really hard to get that acronym in that this year actually would get

to you maintenance program assessment in 1998 and 2014 we switched more
?? some similarities between the tow but some differences s well both
reported condition of that highway system to you board ?? both of you
gave funding need the  report reported everything to you on  state wide

to show how the different assets we have sing into ?? overall goals and
talking bout the goals these are NCC golf this is the one other speak up
today so we talk about making our transportation network ?? making our

  <p id="20:00">
  ...last few weeks with the snow and ice, the road markings have become
kind of dull. So those are some of the things that we do to make our
transportation safer. Signal maintenance and operations, of course, that
is a common one. Guardrails. Installations and guardrail repairs.
Shoulder repairs. We have run off the road accidents that cause a lot of
problems so shoulder repairs. And then coordinating with emergency
services. Yes, they need to be in the lanes to deal with the accident,
but do they need to be in all the lanes or can we move them off to the
shoulder a little bit quicker to try to speed up some of these accidents
that are in the roadway? As far as moving our people and goods more
efficiently and more effectively this whole chart talks about the
interstate system and I will start in the top right hand corner.
We&#39;ll work clockwise. One of the things that MOPAR was asked to give
you was information on congestion. And so if you look at that graphic,
the green for interstate, our traffic congestion on 78% of our network
is what we would call good. That means we&#39;re traveling within 15% of
the posted speed limit. The blue, that small piece, is 7% is in good
condition. It means we have moderate congestion in that part. That is we
are traveling at traveling at speeds less than 15-30% below the posted
speed limit and then that yellow piece is the poor, or the severe
congestion, that means we are traveling at less than or greater than 30%
less than the posted speed limit. Does that make sense? So in other
words, if you&#39;re on the interstate and the speed limit is 65 miles
an hour, you are in that area and you are traveling at 45 miles an hour
if that helps. No surprise the most congested mileage in the state is in
the Mecklenburg area followed by Wake County and Cabarrus County and
then from there the interstates drop off in the amount of congestion
that they have. One of the reasons that this is very important is that
statistic in the top left: for every minute that a freeway lane is
blocked, because of an accident (so congestion and accidents kind of go
together), for every minute that a lane is blocked due to an accident
(or an incident of some kind) it causes four minutes of delay.  So for
every half hour that an accident is in the roadway, it&#39;s two hours
worth of congestion behind that accident causing more problems and more
accidents in the background. Another piece of moving good and people
more effectively that we really don&#39;t talk much about, except in
months like February when we&#39;ve had all this snow, are disasters and
emergencies. Of course you saw how travel was impacted because of the
snowstorms we had just in the last couple of weeks. We break our
disasters and emergencies into three categories. The first one is
declared events.  These are the federal declarations. These are the
Hurricane Sandy&#39;s and the Hurricane Isabelle&#39;s, and the things
that really cause a lot of damage that we get federal reimbursement for.
Now we get a federal reimbursement up to an average of about 75 or 80
percent of our expenses so there&#39;s still a 20% or so there that DOT
has to foot from our own maintenance funds. The next category are non
declared events. These are small tornadoes or things like that that
don&#39;t get a federal declaration. They are not big enough to warrant
that sort of a declaration, but we still have to deal with them, and we
have to get the material off the road and we have to repair things.
Those cost us a good bit of money through the years, and we&#39;ll talk
a little bit more about those. And then, of course, the most obvious one
that we&#39;ve all seen recently is snow and ice and the graphic goes
with snow and ice. So the yellow line is the average, what we&#39;ve
average spent on snow and ice in the last five years. We typically
budget about 30 million dollars for snow and ice, and you&#39;ll see
it&#39;s variable, it goes up and down. We&#39;ve had some pretty bad
winters and we&#39;ve had some pretty good winters. And up until last
week or so we thought 2015 was going to be a good winter. And, yeah,
that hasn&#39;t worked out quite that way. As of today, just as I was
getting started  I got a text that said we&#39;ve spent 47 million
dollars on snow and ice this winter so we are on target for that average
even though we budgeted 30. Now we do have a little bit of money that we
hold back for those sorts of emergencies and over runs so we are not in
the red yet, and of course we will take care of those things, but we are
on track to spend about that average. Some activities that contribute to
moving people and goods: some things like turn lanes, not stopping
traffic for somebody to turn left, but  giving a turn lane for that to
happen. Ramp metering, iMap, incident management...

  <p id="25:00">
  Those folks really help keep traffic moving, get that car that just
needs a gallon of gas to get to that next exit. Get them off the road.
Snow and ice clearance, of course, is one that we&#39;ve seen recently.
Debris removal with the snow and ice. We had some ice storms in there
and had some trees down, so those are, are things that we get the trees
off the road and get people back moving again. Major drainage repairs,
something that&#39;s happening more and more for us. Lots of reasons why
this is happening. We&#39;ve had years of drought, and now followed by
years of plenty of rain and it&#39;s, it&#39;s really causing some pipes
to fail and some of those things. We&#39;ve got pipes that are aging
out. These pipes don&#39;t last forever, so we&#39;ve got pipes that are
aging out. We also have increased development that&#39;s adding more
water to those systems. The, if you&#39;re from the, the Raleigh area,
the picture on the bottom there is Hammond Road. What started out as, as
a hole in the pavement about the size of this podium, when we got down
in it and figured out what was going on, it became this huge hole in the
ground, literally, that took about a million and a half dollars to fill
that thing, but it caused traffic delays, it caused all sorts of things
where we have to dig up and repair. But those are things that we have to
deal with, and we have to deal with them out of our maintenance money if
we&#39;re gonna keep people moving. Moving onto the next goal of making
our infrastructure last longer, our biggest asset are pavements. And
we&#39;ll start with, with that. The trends for pavements are in the
right direction. We&#39;re trending, we&#39;re at our target on the
interstate system. We&#39;re at our targets on the secondary system and
our primary pavements are improving. If you look at that graphic, you
see we have a target for good and a target for poor. We don&#39;t really
do a target for fair. It&#39;s kind of the, the in between of the two.
So we&#39;re trending toward those targets. This graphic shows how we
make those roads last longer, and it goes in a combination of pavement
preservation and resurfacing treatments as well. If we were to fully
fund pavement preservation, add $100 million, we can actually show that
we would save money over time, and that&#39;s what the graphic is
showing there. So if we allocate $64 million for pavement preservation,
we need to spend $493 million in contract resurfacing versus spending
$100 million in preservation treatment and only having to spend 411
million in contract resurfacing. So that gives us a, a savings of some
money. And those, those chip seals are, are good and effective
treatments that help us keep our network in good shape. The other things
Mike mentioned earlier is the interstate program. We do have some
federal money that we put toward paving and improving our pavements on
the interstate. Our next biggest asset, of course, is our bridges. If
you&#39;ll, this graphic has got a lot of data on it. The solid line and
the dashed lines are the targets and the condition scores for, the top
one is interstate, the blue is primary, and the orange is secondary. So
you can see, we&#39;re, we&#39;re trending up for those targets. If you
look at the gray bars in the background, you&#39;ll see the funding
spikes in 2013 and 2014. That is, corresponds to the bump we had in
funding, when all of the system preservation money was funneled into
bridges. So that&#39;s the spike there, and then you can see as we put
more money in bridge, in the bridge program, it also spiked the
condition. So you can see we&#39;re trending up in condition there as
well. So we&#39;re trending in the right direction but we have got a
bridge tidal wave coming at us in the future. Typically, we think of
bridges lasting about 60 years. We have got 2,261 bridges that are gonna
cross, that are gonna have that 60th birthday here in the next seven
years. We&#39;re gonna have all those bridges that hit that target,
which means that we&#39;ve got some big expenditures coming in, in our
bridge program. What that means for us is we need to replace, we need to
start now replacing those bridges to get over that, that 60 year
birthday threshold. So that&#39;s 323 bridges a year that we need to
start replacing if we replaced them today for the next seven years. We
need to do that production. That&#39;s 50% of the bridges than we
replaced in 2014, and there are some things we can do to make those
bridges last longer, to push that out there to, to the 75 year mark in
our bridges. So we need to do more bridge preservation as well, and
I&#39;ll talk more about bridges in a little bit.

  <p id="30:00">
  The other part of making our infrastructure last longer are our roadway
assets and this is the lines on the pavement, the slab or markers on the
pavement, and then anything outside the pavement as well so some
activity that contribute to this: removing hazards from the roadway,
shoulder maintenance, making those, if we get the shoulders in the right
condition that keeps water out from under the pavement, helps us
maintain that pavement, ditches gets the water off as well. Water is a
big enemy for our pavement. And then drainage structure repair, we have
boxes that fail, Hammond Road sort of things kind of happen. And then
something that you can think about kind of routinely are maintenance, or
I&#39;m sorry, mowing and litter, but if you look at the graphics, you
can see our roadway items, we&#39;re in pretty good shape. Green means
good, yellow means we&#39;re within 10% of the targets we set, and then
red means we&#39;re more than 10% away from the targets we set. So if
you look at that, we need to focus on the yellow and at the top is
drainage. We need to focus on some of our drainage assets and improving
those. And in the red are pavement markers and words and symbols. So we
need to work on some of those things to help improve the safety of our
structures as well. As Mr. Holder said, he is gonna be presenting
tomorrow on staffing and budgeting as well but this is just a graphic of
some of the ways we&#39;ve started looking at things to work, how our
agency works and works well. He&#39;s gonna go into more detail tomorrow
on this one. This is a chart of sort of division lane miles per
employee. So you see far east and far west while we have less lane miles
per employee. It&#39;s geographical issues with how to get around and
get to everything they need to get to. The colors don&#39;t necessarily
mean good or bad, it&#39;s just looking at how much, how many lane miles
they have per employee. So you see the Peamont Crescent has many more
lane miles per employee. Some of the things we are doing to improve our
efficiency, a good one is our fleet utilization. We are doing audits
twice a year of our fleet, looking at what pieces of equipment are being
used less than 20% and working with the divisions to see if they really
need all of those pieces of equipment, are they things they can dispose
of, or large pieces of equipment that they can rent for part of a year
and save money in there. We&#39;re purchasing multiple use pieces of
equipment, skits gear loaders, the little bobcat loaders, come with
multiple attachments. They do lots and lots of things and they can
replace multiple pieces of our equipment. So can we go to something like
that. Or compact excavator that fits on a smaller trailer versus a big
back hoe that we take out. And then disposal of equipment, we do get rid
of our equipment on a regular basis. We have auctions several times a
year to get rid of our equipment and get it out of our fleet. Something
else we do, low cost maintenance alternatives, we do, there have been
tons of operational technique improvements rather than digging out and
patching in an old fashioned kind of a way. Can we do a mill patch? Can
we take out a small miller and patch rather than taking out the big back
hoe and doing all those things. Low cost materials and more resilient
materials. They may not be the same thing. One common example is using a
polymer modified emulsion with those chip seals that makes it, that
helps the (inaudible) a whole better, it makes it last longer. And then
timing treatments effectively, you know this with your own house. If you
paint it at the right time you save yourself a lot of money in the long
run. And so pavement preservation activities, bridge preservation
activities, washing garters through having a deck, those sorts of things
help our system to last longer. Alright, now I will move on to
(inaudible) budgeting. In 2014 we drastically changed the way we budget.
Before that we had done an inventory based method, where we took into
account the number of lane miles in a division or county, the number of
the population in the county, the ADT in the county, those sorts of
things. We went to, in 2014, to a needs based methodology, and I&#39;ll
talk more about these categories in a little bit but the three
categories that we assess need in are assessed things, non assessed
things, and then emergency and administration and I&#39;ll elaborate on
those in a little bit. So why did we change the way we do it? Well, it
gives us data driven decisions. We have targeted levels of service. We
have targets that we want the divisions to hit. We can see the ones that
aren&#39;t meeting them and then it gives us a target for them to shoot
for. It gives off the better accountability. They can

in one another it is ?? we are putting in where it needs to be fit it
our resources where we fit hurdling in it need the dollars more than
others some of the ?? it shifted money some of the ways we didn&#39;t
expect and it&#39;s working through some of the ships were some of the
common things and it shifted the calculations well when we shifted the
?? money  and we have worked in some of the issues ?? we have one of the
favorite ?? management systems in the country and that&#39;s the
management system really good ?? if i have 100 dollars where is the best
place to be ?? and those tools can spend us what is the best place to
spend us money in those tools is something called decision trees if the
things in charge those decision trees ?? the things to do which we
decision some we still continue to do that looking t the analysis in
that what is in the analysis in there what is make the decision in the
we would make if we have generate all these questions what would you
do,for closing the loop and how ?? management structures no prior report
?? we have couple of the charts for you guys have legislation ?? and we
do the whole cycle next time looking at the bridge program looking at
the bridge in particular
Speaker changes:??
Speaker changes: go ahead ?? you have the floor
Speaker changes: thank you Mr chairman on slot 20 ,i have been waiting
on this quite sometime and thank you very much for bringing this ?? 10.1
billion  year is that correct? follow up
Speaker changes: ??
Speaker changes: why is the asset recovery rate,
Speaker changes:that number included private vehicle damage as well as
DOT property damage ?? damage as well as claim what have 60-70 percent
recovery rte on those worked in to get that money last time ?? 60-70%,
Speaker changes: follow up,
Speaker changes: follow up that to me is important enough is that number
needs to be broken out as it ?? to property damage the state property
and that recovery from the assets as the chairman is i possible to get
that data
Speaker changes:?? would it be possible to go back 5 years and to get
that possible recovery ?? and it personally i would like the committee
to ask ?? the equipment price rate is that something that you work with
the department
Speaker changes:just find out how many people ??
Speaker changes:follow up
Speaker changes:the providing the ?? is it internal program or something
that it contract out
Speaker changes:we have  agreement with highway patrol we have tagging
system where of they ?? they could stick round the ?? damaged with the
report number and hen we go back to ?? and then we internal the DOT
check that funding we do not contact the services out

  ...have things about them that are are are not, that are in poor
condition, but not unsafe.  The bridge program last year was allocated
$153 million.  One of the things we want to do with this program is to
expand it to be able to include some preservation treatment on our
bridges as well.  Just a funding scenario for the bridge program, if we
spent all of that money on just the structurally deficient and
functionally obsolete is another category in that, that’s, it’s not wide
enough, it doesn’t have enough lanes on it, those sorts of things, it’s
still a very good bridge except for that...those are the funds that we
would need to spend on it.  If we were to try to drop that structurally
deficient amount to 10% in 7, 10 and 15 years, you can see the dollar
values that would go with that.
Allocations -- Mike talked a little bit about this, but this is how we
funded highway maintenance in the past year.  This is for routine type
work.  These are patching potholes, mowing the grass, those sorts of
things.
 The allocation formulas are simple -- division need versus statewide
need -- and these are assessed needs.  These are the things that we do
condition assessment programs on.  We have a roadway condition
assessment, payment condition assessment and bridge condition
assessment.  So you can see some examples there, those things, bridges,
pavement, shoulders.
Non assessed needs, these are the cyclical type things or the things
that we have historically spend money on and a certain amount.  We know
that we’re always gonna mow a certain amount and we’re gonna pick up
litter a certain amount of times.  Those things are cyclical, we can
figure out how much money we’re gonna spend on them.
One historical need is guardrail repair and we spend about $10 million a
year on guardrail repair, so we know how much that’s gonna be.
The formulas are better (I talked about this a little bit earlier)
because they’re needs based, because they put the money where they need
to be, because they give us the opportunity to use technology to help us
in that we do many of these condition assessment programs with automated
services.
Some of the challenges we have, our maintenance funding is
beginning--has dropped for the last few years.  The blue line is the
actual, are the actual dollars.  The red line is the CPI adjusted, if we
were to adjust it for inflation, so you see we were below 2004 funding
levels once you adjust for inflation.
The spike at the end is more of an accounting thing that we did
internally.  We used to take bridge maintenance money off and set it
aside and allocate it separately when we do the inventory type system.
Now that we’ve gone to full needs based, we put it all in together,
which made that look like a little bit of a spike with the division
engineers can now fund the money where they need it to be.
Some other challenges, material costs have gone up.  This is in the last
10 years.  The material costs have really gone up.  You can see that
with salt prices, and salt prices have gone up quite a bit just in the
last year.  We’ve gone from $70 a ton to $120 a ton in some places.  And
you can see that alt is a previous commodity with all that’s going on in
the Northeast.
Payment preservation, these are the dollars for those chip seals, and
micro surfacing and slurries.  They’re cost effective.  We can get much
better bang for the buck on them.  It gives a smoother pavement.  This
is a typical pavement graph and you can apply this to your house or to
your car as well.  If you paint regularly, you don’t have to replace
wood and so a dollar spent at one point versus six dollars later on, you
can see how that would move out the deterioration of the pavement.  Same
with your house or with your car.  If you change the oil, your car lasts
longer.
Contract resurfacing, again, is done by needs, division needs versus
statewide needs.  And to remind you, contract resurfacing is just a
single list of asphalt.  It’s on good, fair pavement and it’s minimal
patching in those.
Rehabilitation, this is category of pavements that we do not address a
lot.  This is pavement in poor condition, traffic volumes exceed the
need.  What, we have sent our target--it can be funded with contract
resurfacing dollars.  We set our funding up or or our targets, I’m
sorry, our targets.  I told you we had a good target and a poor target.
Our poor target is 10%, so if we’ve got 9% poor pavements, we’re meeting
the target, but we still have 9% of pavements in poor shape.  To get
those pavements up would cost us about $172 million dollars.  And we can
do it with contract...

  Resurfacing, that that takes a big chunk out of that. Mike mentioned a
couple of these programs, this is repaving program, it changed a few
years ago in how we did. We&#39;ve gone to a state wide system from a
county system, so its a state wide priority. So, its how many homes and
businesses are on that road, plus the traffic volume, is it a dead end
or a connector. Some of the other programs, Mike mentioned these so I
won&#39;t spend any time on them, but these are some other funding
sources, and as you can see they&#39;re particularly small. Staffing
strategy, these are some of the things we worked on, they&#39;re in the
?? report, which Mike is going to spend some more time on tomorrow.
I&#39;ll draw your attention to looking at delivery mechanism in-house
versus out sourcing. We spend a lot of time looking at those types of
things and how can we do things better. We have developed a library of
other states contract documents, we don&#39;t pretend that we have it
all figured out, do other states have a contract document that they use
that gives them the service that they feel like they&#39;re paying for.
We&#39;ll plagiarize those contract documents, and they do from us as
well. One thing we&#39;re looking at, just recently snow and ice
control. We&#39;ve had . . . We are in desperate need of snow and ice
contractors, they are just not out there. We&#39;ve hired a consultant
to come and help us look for better ways to do that. Better contracting
mechanism, what would it take to make them interested and helping us
with snow and ice, and that goes in with seasonality of the work. We
need them part of the year and part of the year we don&#39;t, what are
some of the things we can do to make that better. Some action items that
we got in that document that we&#39;re working on, the staffing plan,
Mike&#39;s going to give you that one. Looking at indirect cost factors
for some of those administration things that we need to work on, some of
the ways that we charge out indirect type of items, we&#39;ll be doing a
report on that. Looking at the differences of what does the division
plan to do versus what they actually did. Then, we&#39;ll be working on
a transportation asset management plan, that is a federal requirement
coming up, but it really ties all of our planning and our large
construction projects with our maintenance dollars and make sure
we&#39;re spending all of our funds in a way that will improve the
entire system. Some of the things in the ?? document that you&#39;ll see
we want like increased funding for bridges that 323 bridges per year is
a large number and it takes a lot of money to do that. We&#39;d like to
increase payment preservation to show you how we can use that money
effectively and how we can actually save money. Then, we would like to
increase our maintenance funding flexibility, so we can put the money
where we really need it to be. And, lastly . . . I promise I&#39;m done.
The highway maintenance improvement program, like Mike said the board
will be voting on that tomorrow. That&#39;s an example of a plan up
there for FY-16, that&#39;s a sample from division one. You&#39;ll see
that it shows, its really a grocery list of all the projects that
we&#39;re going to do in the next three years using our preservation
funds, our contract resurfacing funds, and then the other category was
rehabilitation we&#39;ll be doing that with contract resurfacing money.
But, you&#39;ll see the year it was suppose to be done, the roadway
we&#39;re going to do, the section of that roadway we&#39;re going to do
if its long, and the type of treatment we&#39;re going to do, and then
the estimated cost. That will be posted on the web by April 1st,
you&#39;ll be able to look at that list by county, so you can see the
roads in your area. In the future what we will do with that is if the
divisions next Winter will be giving us the delivery. What did they
actually accomplish on that list of things? We&#39;ll be looking at the
delivery, and then we will be updating the document. They&#39;ll move
years two and three into years one and two, make adjustments they need
to make and we&#39;ll add a new year three to that. The board next year
will adopt a new one and we will post it on the web April 1st annually.
And, with that Mr. Chairman, I am done.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Miss Brendonburg. Questions from committee? I see Senator
Krawiec has a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Question regarding the bridge funding on
location, and I think the documents in my office, I was supposed to have
them here, but I don&#39;t of course. I had gotten some information
about several ?? using our, I believe Pennsylvania, recently is where we
were doing it mostly, with pre-fabbed bridges. Are you familiar with
that? Is there any research into that? It saves a lot of money from what

  We use some prefab elements now in our bridges. There is a move toward
doing a prefab bridge and setting it in place overnight. I&#39;m not as
familiar with how that works, but we do some prefab elements in our
bridges now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator [INAUDIBLE].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You mentioned a couple times that you want to expand in the preservation
treatment on your bridge program. What&#39;s the stumbling block for
you? Simply finances? Thank you, sir. Is it simply finances or the
amount of money appropriated, or are there other things that you need to
have changed in order to enter into that program?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is predominantly financing. To be able to do 323 bridges, it takes
more money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr.--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Because you mentioned that you needed more flexibility, so I
didn&#39;t know if that was a change at the legislative level or that
was something that you could do internally. Do you know?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For just general highway road maintenance funding, we are allocated in
three pots: primary system, secondary system, and general maintenance
reserve. So, the primary funding can only be spent on the primary system
and the secondary funding can only be spent on the secondary system. The
flexibility there would be maybe I need more of that money in one place
than another.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A separate question if that&#39;s all right with Mr. Chair. So, at one
point you were also looking at the staffing strategy and what&#39;s the
best amount of staff versus the outcome. It seems to me that every time
we look at a reform inside of DOT it&#39;s piecemeal. We look at this
piece, we say, &quot;How can we do this more efficiently? How can we do
that more efficiently?&quot; Has there been any reports that are
available that are particularly outcomes based on maintenance? So, for
example, by division. If you said based on I&#39;m making this very
different in the mountains than it is [INAUDIBLE] than it is in the
East. Have you all said, &quot;We should be able to resurface, maintain,
et cetera this number of miles per division for this number of
dollars&quot;? If we&#39;re working optimally. Sometimes I don&#39;t
feel like we identify the goal. We often just try and fix what we
perceive is broken. So, have you all developed a set of goals by
division or state-wide in regard to maintenance goals?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. [INAUDIBLE].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. What we&#39;ve done-- Right now there are statewide measures on--
And we have statewide crew sizes. How many people should it take to
repair that pipe or apply this chip-seal treatment. With outsourcing of
chip seals now we&#39;re gonna be getting contractor data in the mix as
well. And, yes, it&#39;s different from mountains to coast. In the
chip-seal arena when we were doing the [INAUDIBLE] we had some regional
targets for those guys -- square yards per man hour. So, we&#39;d done a
little bit of that. Mike&#39;s gonna talk much more tomorrow about
staffing. Yes, we need to revisit those crew sizes and look at some of
those things and how we do that, and then use some of our contract data
as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll try and make this my last one, but that again in personnel
based as opposed to the whole process base of comparing outsourcing or
number of people or the cost of whether we have the equipment or they
have the equipment. All that the overall goals-- That&#39;s something
that I&#39;d personally be looking for as we move forward over the
next...over this session to see what types of goals have been
established for the overall process so we can move towards more
outcome-based reform as opposed to individual or numbers of employees as
we move through, because that&#39;s the discussion that we have but that
may not be the discussion that we need to have. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Any other questions from the committee? Thank you, Ms.
[INAUDIBLE] for your presentation. Mr. Holder, the committee is
adjourned and we&#39;ll see you tomorrow.
