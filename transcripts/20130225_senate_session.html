<p id="05:00">
Senators, we're going to move right into our calendar for the day. For
public bills we have two bills on the calendar. Senate Bill 36. The
clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senate Bill 36, APA, Technical Clarifying Changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Hartsell, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator, you have the floor to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Before I ?? motion to cut off debate. Which I've been warned might be
forthcoming.
The bill does exactly what the short title says. More particularly, the
most significant of the technical changes is, it permits folks who
actually win a case before the APA, or before the Office of
Administrative Hearings, if it's appealed by the agency they can
actually have that appeal go to their home county, as opposed to Wake
County. I commend it to you, I'll be glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Senator.
Is there any further discussion or debate?
Hearing none. The question before the Senate is the passage of Senate
Bill 36 on its second reading. All in favor will vote aye. All opposed
will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk
will record the vote.
Stein, aye.
43 having voted in the affirmative, and zero in the negative. Senate
Bill 36 passes its second reading. Without objection, it will be read a
third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
North Carolina General Assembly enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senate Bill 72, Amend UCC Article 4A Funds Transfer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Hartsell, you're recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentleman of the Senate, this
bill's even more scintillatingly technical than the last one. When
Congress adopted Dodd-Frank it's in part separated remittance transfers
from electronic funds transfers. We're just trying to clean up the Act
as it appears locally. I commend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Is there any further discussion or debate?
