First thing first, I'll introduce our pages. Thomas Mcbrayer. Senator
Allran. Andrew Scott. Senator Nesbitt. Brian Clark. Senator Jenkins.
Harrison Freelick. Senator Wade. Logan Brooks. Senator Soucek. Henry
Disinclair I think i'm misprounce that. Senator Tarte. And Lily
Turlington. Senator Jackson. Thanks very much. We hope your visit here
at the general assembly is pleasant and if you have any questions any of
the senators will be delighted to chat with you and any of the issues.
We want you to be as knowledgeable and have as much fun as we can have
here. Also we wouldn't operate efficiently as we would without our good
sergeant at arms and we have ?? Sheryle, Ken Kirby, Hen Louis, And Donna
Blake. Thanks folks, you've been very helpful to us as always. People of
the audience, if there are folks that would like to speak on any of
these bills there is a sign up sheet at the podium out there. You will
need to sign up, it'll be for two minutes. That being said I am going to
call house bill 710, Water Utility Recovery. Representative Hagar And
members of the house when you hear the speak, would you please let us
know who will cover this bill on the floor for you. So that we can be
sure that it will be explained accordingly. Representative
Hagar.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr Chairman. Will you also have them let us know
when they'll be hearing our bills in the house.[SPEAKER CHANGES] We
don't wait for an answer on that senator Apodaca.[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I
address that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will do all
I can to help you guys out. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright so we have house
bill, house bill 710. Go forward. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mr.
Chairman. This bill is basically, the summary as exactly what the bill
does. It allows the ?? committee to establish a mechanism for whats
called a third party water and sewer utilities. Section 1 qualifies the
existing practice of commission regarding the pastor of bulk increases.
Section 2 provides incentives to accelerate the investment in
improvement in water and sewer services. And thats pretty much what it
does. Now it does have some mechanism protections and only allow certain
percentage increase utilities commission on either side can either deny
it or modify or improve the rate increase. It allows the water utility
to make some improvements in whats called a secondary condition such as
water quality water taste it if fully supported by utilities commission
and public staff. With that mr chairman I'll take any questions or
comments. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee Do we have any
questions for representative Hagar? I've got a motion for favorable
report for house bill 710 from senator Apodaca. Any questions/comments?
Seeing none all in favor please say aye. All opposed nay, the aye's have
it. Who's gonna cover that bill for you representative Hagar? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I'm gonna talk to senator Newton. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Newton. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir.
Representative Howard, house bill 60, transfer of Indian cultural center
property. I have a PCS. Good. I have a motion from senator Brock that
PCS for house bill 60 being brought forward for discussion. All in favor
please say aye. All opposed nay. Aye's have it. Representative Howard if
you would be kind enough to share your thoughts. Microphone. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] How's that? It's really a very simple bill. This bill came from
the program evaluation division and the findings were that we would
terminate two leases. One lease between the state and North Carolina
Indian Cultural Center Inc. And for the Indian cultural center property.
And the lease between the state of North Carolina and the Lumbee land
development incorporated for the maintenance of riverside golf course.
There's four parcel of lands there and I hope that you can identify them
on the map. The bill recommends that the 386 acres which is parcel
member 1 be sold. And parcel 2 3 and 4 be given to the Deener for river
access and for parts. And that;s basically what the bill does Mr
chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca. Question? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes if I may. This is...</p>

continuation of what we did was it last year during the ?? of these
problems[SPEAKER CHANGES]yes sir,it is[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think this is a
good move I move in favor of a good report[SPEAKER CHANGES]okay[SPEAKER
CHANGES]I think you're the finest woman in this building[SPEAKER
CHANGES]you just like her cookie I am jealous actually Senator McKissick
question[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Senator Richfield, Representative
Hall it's my understanding they're certain Native Americans  groups or
tribes that are in favor of this bill and there are others who oppose it
perhaps you can shed a little light on that cause I know I got some
calls last night and this morning saying they just found out that is was
going to be on the calendar today and they were concern cause they
wouldn't have a chance to get here now I really don't have a bone in
this but at the same time if when I hear that their two different
fractions and I'm not sure what all the depth, nature, and magnitude
those concerns are my tendency is to want at least give them a chance to
be heard[SPEAKER CHANGES]we have a couple of speakers on this Senator
McKissick they be the ones that address those gross concerns to
you[SPEAKER CHANGES]thank you Senator[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator I think
that the best of both worlds are here we entered into a non?? release
with the Indian cultural center and unfortunately it has not develop to
be like they had intended there is little or no maintenance there is no
security there's no one really taking care of the property it has burned
the copper has been removed  it's in a real bad state right now however
if you will look at the bill there's two options on sale in Lot number
one the first option is to offer it to the Indian Lumbee Tribal
Administration and if they are not able to purchase it or choose not to
purchase it then in goes to public sale so we've tried to compromise the
best we can with rather bad situation[SPEAKER CHANGES]quick
follow-up[SPEAKER CHANGES]follow-up I notice that in the bill and I
wasn't quite certain why it was structured that way are the Lumbees one
of the groups that support the bill[SPEAKER CHANGES]depends on what
member you want to talk to[SPEAKER CHANGES]I see[SPEAKER CHANGES]that's
questionable there's seven tribes this was the Indian Cultural Center
and it was a make up of seven various tribes and that was the focus, the
vision and then some of those tribes and I think I'm saying this on the
safe side some of those tribes don't necessarily get along well with
some of the others then within the Lumbee group you have the same
situation it's just not a good environment[SPEAKER CHANGES]last
follow-up[SPEAKER CHANGES]last follow-up the Lumbee's did not exercise
that option and it's pretty clearly spelled out with restrictive
covenant (??:3:27-:3:30)appraisal will be done and I thought those were
all thoughtful provisions[SPEAKER CHANGES]what do you consider a viable
option that the Lumbee that another one of these groups [SPEAKER
CHANGES]it's offered to the public so anyone can come in and buy it at
that time thank you[SPEAKER CHANGES]thank you[SPEAKER CHANGES]??Senator
Walters a question[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chair and I just want
to thank Representative Howard for a job well done with the public
evaluations and Senator Hartsell this property is located in the
Robinson County which is in the heart of my district and there are
fifty-five thousand Lumbee Indians in the Native American tribe I had a
very extensive conversation with Chief Brooks on Thursday and the tribe
is in support of this ??bill sixty Representative Howard has said in the
past today it's in dis-repair you can't get on the property most of the
time the gates are locked so it's not open to the public today my
understanding does not have general liability insurance which violates
the lease immediately we have exposure to the state and I like to see us
move forward with</p>

...well, I think it's a great direction to give the Lumbee tribe the
opportunity to buy and then after that, it goes to the public after it's
appraised. I think it's the best move that we can make with this
property this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any additional questions from the
committee? Seeing none, I'm going to ask, David Harris asked if he could
speak on House Bill 60. Mr. Harris, please come to the podium. Identify
yourself and you have two minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon, everybody. My name is David Harris,
I'm an attorney in Durham. It's good to see you again, Representative
Howard. I met you down in Maxton. I represent the North Carolina Indian
Cultural Center Board. I come to you to speak against this bill. When
you look back at the history, and I may add, too, because of the short
notice for the committee hearing, there will be, my clients will be
speaking rather than you all, rather than myself. You've received
several e-mails from me, which attached to those e-mails were letters
from chiefs and leaders of three other tribes, maybe four other tribes,
in North Carolina who stated strong opposition to this bill. And the
reason for that is that the center, when it was established and when the
lease was set up in 1994, the cultural center was to celebrate the
heritage of all American Indian tribes in North Carolina, not just one
tribe. Now, it presupposed money would come in from private sources. One
major private source fell through due to interference by one of the
State agencies and you'll also note there's been two lawsuits. One of
your bills was struck down by Judge Fox. An effort to actually replace
the board by the Commissioner on Indian Affairs was struck down by an
administrative law judge. And I have to ask the question to everyone,
thank you, how can you comply with the terms of an agreement when the
person you've entered into the contract with keeps getting in your way?
Now, there are thousands of volunteers working, money being spent out of
people's individual pockets, to make this property work. I urge you to
go down there and see it for yourselves before voting. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Harris. I also have on House Bill 60
Reggie Holly. Mr. Holly, identify yourself, please. You might have to
hold it down.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. I can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Manager at ?? all of the
other leaders who've been engaged in this process. It's been an ongoing
process. ?? evaluation committee has done decided whether the building
be disposed of ?? gone down and visit to the site. What we have here
today is a ?? lawful process. I speak on behalf of the Lumbee tribe as
their ?? and they're trusting you today ?? encourage ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Thank you. I have nobody else from the audience?
Senator Walters?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask a follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To Senator Hartsell, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell, I think you had the opportunity to
go down and visit the Indian Cultural Center. Would you explain to us
what you saw. The gentleman recommended that folks go down and visit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First, I'll be glad to answer that note. First, the
entire program evaluation committee and staff had an opportunity to go
visit the site and did, in fact, visit the site as a group some time
last fall. What you see is the result of some of that work that they
did. I was not on that trip, but I separately, about two months ago,
went to the site, met with the Lumbee Chief and went down to the site to
take a look at it myself. I, in combination with the Lumbee Chief, could
not get into the site. But what we could see was the site was in
extraordinary disrepair even from the exit. It is incumbent on us...</p>

If you do pass it because that allows the city to complete the [??] road

questions. Seeing None, All in favor Please say Aye. All Oppose No, Ayes

Sorry, we couldn’t give a better senator. OK. On that house bill 545
modified Henderson county Occupancy Tax, Rep McGrady Welcome
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Chairman. This is a bill that simply
repeals a 1% allocation to the Vagapon school of Drama, which is the
flat Rock play house and makes a tactical change. We had an occupancy
tax bill late year . This is a correction and a change in that and to my
knowledge there is no opposition to the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Alright I have got a favorable report from Senator
Wade on House bill 545. Question from Senator Brown.
[Speaker Changes] Yes Chair. How will the dollars be allocated now. The
occupancy tax dollars.
[Speaker Changes]  There is a travel and tourism development authority
that allocates the money. The county hasn’t actually bumped up to the
6%, it’s still down to 5%.
[Speaker Changes] OK any additional questions. Senator Apodaca
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Chairman. Mr McGrady, your predecessor
liked this bill.
[Speaker Changes]  I believe she has no opposition to this in this form
[Speaker Changes] Follow up
[Speaker Changes] Follow up
[Speaker Changes] Will this make her happy.
[Speaker Changes] I have not been able to keep Caroline Justice
completely happy at all points in time. Nor have you.
[Speaker Changes] It Should be the end of the conversation. Alright I

Henderson County Occupancy tax. All in favor Please say Aye . Oppose No.

[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Chairman . Mills River De-Annexation .

All in favor please say Aye . Oppose No. Ayes have it. Senator McGrady
Excuse me Rep McGrady . Thank you very much.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you
[Speaker Changes]  OK. Thanks for visiting us. Alright , we have Rep
Turner. We are talking about House bill 32 increase years allowance.
[Speaker Changes]  Thank you Mr Chairman and members of the committee.
Rep Hurley was held up in another meeting. So I am here in her stead.
This is a simple bill House bill 32 to increase the years allowance in
her states. As a former caucus of your court we do have some people that
call in and say , they want their state to pay  them their years
allowance. But that‘s not what this is about. There is no money from the
state involved. This is when a spouse passes away, then the remaining
spouse can claim $30,000 rather than $20,000 protected that  usually in
these days that sometime means a car.
[Speaker Changes]  Rep Turner we have a favorable report for House bill
32 from Senator McKissick. Any additional comments or questions. Yes
Senator.
[Speaker Changes]  Thank you Mr Chair. I am curious were there summaries
or you did not want to increase the children’s or dependent’s support
from 5 up or was there summaries that were focused here.
[Speaker Changes]  Mr Chairman
[Speaker Changes]  Yes Madam, Please Answer the Question
[Speaker Changes]  Generally it’s the spouse who has difficulty handling
managing their assets up to that limit and the children limit seems to
be a generous amount.
[Speaker Changes]  Senator Barringher. Is that OK. All right.</p>

No additional questions, do we have motion for the report, all in favor
please say ‘aye’.  [SPEAKER CHANGE] “Aye”.  [SPEAKER CHANGE] All opposed
‘ne’.  The “Ayes” have it. [INAUDIBLE BACKGROUND TALK] Alright we do
have House Bill 449 Representative Starnes welcome. It’s always a please
to see you Representative.  [LAUGHTER IN BACKGROUND] Ok we have House
Bill 449 State contracts, please share your knowledge with us. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the committee.
House Bill 449 is an attempt to assist our State’s furniture
manufacturers by making it easier for them to sell furniture right here
at home in the State of North Carolina.  Despite the competition of
off-shore manufacturers we still have a healthy and thriving furniture
industry that employs thousands of North Carolinians. Manufacturers are
constantly looking for new markets in which to sell their furniture. The
State of North Carolina is a major market for institutional and office
furniture. We purchase millions of dollars of furniture every year.
Sadly, many of our manufacturers are missing out on the opportunity to
bid for state contracts because of difficulty in having their products
placed on the QPL or Qualified ??? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Cook, you
have a question or comment? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes I do, I move for a
favorable report [SPEAKER CHANGE] We have a favorable report from
Senator Cook on House Bill 449.  [SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chairman, I think
I’ve seen Representative Starnes before two Senator Committees today I
just…reaching out really seems to be helping him and working well with
our colleagues in the other chamber. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Alright we have a
favorable report for House Bill 449 state contacts, furniture from
Senator Cook.  Any additional comments or questions? Seeing none, all in
favor please say ‘aye’. [SPEAKER CHANGE] “Aye”. [SPEAKER CHANGE] All
opposed ‘ne’. Aye’s have it. Representative Starnes who would you like
to…[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Soucek will handle this.  [SPEAKER CHANGE]
Very good.  [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Alight, you
have a nice day. And I’m sure we have another Senate Committee for you
this afternoon.  Alright, I think this is our last bill of the day,
House Bill 788, Representative Catlin, and we have Water Sewer Authority
rate flexibility.  [SPEAKER CHANGE]  Thank you Mr. Chairman and my
senate friends. This is a bill to allow public utility authorities the
flexibility for water resource protection and mitigation.  Basically
during the winter time when there’s excess flow capacity, one of the
benefits here is that they can use the water for aquifer storage to
prevent saltwater intrusion and they can also use it for surficial
storage for aquifer recharge it is not a local bill but it does have a
significant impact on ???  County.  Long term our river allocations are
decreasing so this would give us the flexibility to protect the weather
resources and store excess water during the low flow season to protect
those resources and water is going to be our new gold so I’d appreciate
your support. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chairman move to…oh, Senator Brown
has motion for favorable report on House Bill 788, water sewer authority
rate flexibility.  Any comments, questions? Seeing none all in favor
please say ‘aye’. [SPEAKER CHANGE] “Aye”. [SPEAKER CHANGE] All opposed
‘ne’. Aye’s have it. Representative Catlin who would you like to run
that bill for you? [SPEAKER CHANGE] I’ve asked my senator, Senator
Goolsby to handle this. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Alright, members of the
committee we’ve gone through our work today I thought very well. Thank
you for your attention. We will have a meeting tomorrow morning at
Senate Finance same room 10am. Stay tuned for the announcement.  Thanks
very much and meeting’s adjourned.</p>
