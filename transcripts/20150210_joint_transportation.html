  Good morning. One more time, good morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. We&#39;re gonna go through a little bit of
housekeeping before we get started. As you&#39;ve noticed, we&#39;ve had
some changes. There&#39;s an on air light on the wall. There are round
devices scattered around the tables. This committee for the first time
is going live, so for committee members and people listening, welcome to
the first meeting of this session for House and Senate joint
transportation appropriations. I&#39;d like to welcome everyone here and

  To introduce themselves as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [inaudible] [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, and I am your chair for the day, Representative John
Torbett representing what I refer to as the Garden of Eden in North
Carolina, which is Gaston County. A little bit of housekeeping,
gentlemen, if I use a round disk as a red light we have two options that
we can do. We can leave them on or if you choose to speak, please push
the button. So what I&#39;d like to do at the beginning is start with if
you need to speak just push the button and if we can&#39;t remember to
do that we&#39;ll just push them and leave them on, so either way. We
have another member joining us. Representative Bumgardner, once you sit
down we&#39;re going to ask you state your name, where you&#39;re from,
just a little introduction. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner,
District 109, Gaston County. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Moving right
along on the agenda, the first presentation is by Nick Tennison, Chief
Deputy Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
He&#39;ll be addressing general remarks and management introductions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am Nick Tennison, Chief
Deputy Secretary for NC DOT. The Secretary of Transportation this
morning is at an event that he agreed to attend some weeks ago before
the schedule was known and so I apologize for the fact that that
conflict occurred, but I&#39;m here to deliver greetings on his behalf.
I also would like to take the chance to introduce a few members of the
management staff for the NC DOT who are present this morning. You&#39;ll
meet many more of those folks during the next few weeks and we&#39;ll
see these folks again I&#39;m sure. Starting with the gentleman
who&#39;s currently signing in, Mike Holder, who&#39;s Chief Engineer
for NC DOT. Mike, of course, has presented over the years several times
and so Mike will be again on the schedule of presentations later. Next
to him is Reston Jones. Reston is with our legislative liaison capacity
and will be ably representing us and will certainly be a contact that
you could reach out to. Next to her is a stranger to you or at least
most members of the House, Mary Turnigan who is our Director of
Legislative Policy and Government Affairs, recently joined NC DOT and
has already had an impact on making sure that we are getting it together
and I hope that you will agree and help her help us succeed. Next to
Mary is Rudy Lupton. Rudy is the Director of Logistics for NC DOT, has a
primary responsibility for the global transport and also works on issues
related to keeping us, working on the port tranpark liaison and works
with the ports although obviously the Port Authority is a separate body.
Next to Rudy is Jeff Mann. Jeff is Deputy Secretary for Transit. Under
Jeff&#39;s able stewardship, all the non-highway modes of transportation
so rail, public transportation, bike, ped and aviation. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ferry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And ferry, oh my Gosh. Alright, well,
thank you very much. I&#39;ll never forget the ferry division, sir, in
case you&#39;re ever looking for advice. I, so, anyway, Jeff&#39;s
handling that. I think, oh, yeah, ha-ha, and Kelly Thomas was here, oh,
Kelly, you&#39;re hiding behind the camera. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There you go. This represents the orderly way that I
manage the team. Kelly Thomas is Commissioner of DOT. I was proud to
have that occupation for three months and Kelly has certainly taken over
and provided a strong leadership for that division, a very important
function of NC DOT. Was there anybody else from NC DOT that I, oh, Susan
Pullium is Director of Strategic Planning. She&#39;s the person who has
been working very hard on all sorts of aspects of long range planning
and the whole thing that if you haven&#39;t known before, you

  ---there is some very quiet audio. I tried to pull what I could from it.
My apologies.
...the ??? aware that nothing in transportation happens without this
extraordinarily long planning process. Susan works with the folks that
help to make that happen, and also right now, is facilitating the
workgroup that is working on potential revisions to criteria and waiting
and things like that for the STI process so was there anybody else here
that&#39;s from the NCDOT? Susan ??? Well this is because, again, you
know him so well, Bo Memory, who is, began work with NCDOT yesterday as
executive director of the turnpike authority so Bo is somebody that is
certainly at least I believe you have come to rely on in the past and I
believe you can rely on him now as NCDOT member so I think that&#39;s it
for who we&#39;ve got. I did want to take a moment also to thank those
of you that were members of the General Assembly in the 2013 session for
the great thing that I believe we all did together which was reform the
process by which we prioritize and select projects for construction. The
process wasn&#39;t something that I think anybody whose involved in
man-made things ever would believe was perfect, but it was a  huge
advance and I think it&#39;s put us in the vanguard of the states in the
United States that are trying to solve this problem of what to do in an
environment where you don&#39;t have as much money as you need to do the
work you need to do. How do you prioritize? How do you choose?  And I
think we&#39;ve made a really good start in that direction. The result
of that first STI process is the currently circulating currently
publicly available draft State Transportation Improvement program that
drafts ??? is out. If you have not already seen it. If you have
questions about it. If you&#39;d like to go over it we are certainly
happy to do that. I also want to take this chance to encourage you as we
are encouraging them to be in touch with your division engineers in your
area and with the Board of Transportation board members. They&#39;re
folks that are intimately involved in what we are getting done and a lot
of times, certainly the division engineer level can provide an immediate
answer to a question that you  might want to know the answer to about a
certain operation in your area. As an elected official in - on my resume
I was, for a couple of terms, Mayor of the city of Durham, I believe I
know a lot of what you&#39;re going through in terms of being responsive
to constituents and trying to make sure you&#39;re balancing the public
need, the public good, with the needs of individuals that come to you
with things that are important to them. We are as responsive as we can
possibly be, and on those occasions we&#39;re not as responsive as you
believe we need to be, I hope you&#39;ll feel free to be in touch with
me or the secretary to try to find out where the missing link is. Again,
I think this next two weeks will be very productive, certainly two or
three weeks will be very productive, in terms of these meetings and
informing you on transportation. I&#39;d be happy to answer any
questions that you might have right now although I&#39;m confident I
wasn&#39;t allocated the 35 minutes on the agenda.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions of Mr. Tennyson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Nick, thank you for being here today and having your whole team DOT with
you. My apologizes to Debbie, we jumped right over so we&#39;d like for
you to let us know your name and who you represent and where you&#39;re
from.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m Debbie ?????
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we have another Senator that has joined us if you would. We did a
brief letting folks know who we are, where we are from before you got
here so if you&#39;d like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kraweic? representing ??? counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and good morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moving along the next one is committee protocol. We have a Mr. Bryce
Ball from physical research will be reporting, and if you don&#39;t get
a chance please try to take a chance, step out of your way, and
congratulate Bryce during the interim I believe you became a father, did
you not? So I&#39;m sure life changed not at all for you, is that right?

  <p id="15:00">
  Not at all. Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Ron Small. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Good morning to the committee.
We&#39;re going to continue with some housekeeping items. If you will
refer to a handout in your packet labeled joint transportation
appropriations committee, committee protocol for presenters and
audience, these are standard procedures for presenters and audience in
addressing the committee, but there have been two changes that I want to
call your attention to and those are items five and six with respect to
the submission of handouts and presentations to the committee. All
materials, final versions of handouts, presentations are to be sent to
both the chairs and to fiscal research staff by noon on the day prior to
when the information is to be presented. With handouts, fiscal staff
will consult with the chairs and respond to the submitter to let them
know whether the handout will be permitted the following day, and again,
final presentations are due by noon on the day prior to the presentation
being given, and you&#39;ll see with items seven and eight, those
pertain to the distribution of hard copies but with our technological
capabilities there is the ability to go paperless so we want to gauge
the members and see if there is interest in going to a paperless
distribution. Of course, this does not preclude the production of copies
by your LAs for reference during the meetings. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And
let&#39;s stop right there and get an idea of how do we want to choose
to move forward. Do we want to continue getting a pretty good amount of
paperwork? Do we want to try to be as paperless as humanly possible or
do we want to go entirely paperless? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to make a
motion that we go paperless. If a member needs it they can get their LA
to run it off. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Wonderful. Thank you, Senator.
You&#39;ve heard the Senator&#39;s comments and offered a motion that we
go to a paperless. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I second that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
And seconded by Chairman Iler, any other discussion? Hearing none,
I&#39;ll just ask for a show of hands to approve. Pretty much unanimous,
thank you very much, and should a member request, as Senator Meredith
stated, a hard copy or something that is, of course, their prerogative.
So thank you very much, you can continue, Ron. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, sir. Then we&#39;ll move on to the next item on the agenda, the
budget process. Most are fully acquainted with these topics, but as a
refresher I&#39;m going to quickly cover the budgetary process, also
discuss the roles of staff and that of the agencies and then preview the
tentative schedule for the committee. First, the process. Appropriation
of the budget starts almost immediately after the last appropriations
bill is enacted and certified. The effort culminates with two documents,
the continuation and the expansion of budgets. The continuation
specifies the level of funding that&#39;s needed to maintain program
service levels accounting for enrollment growth, annualization,
inflation and non-recurring adjustments. Secondly, the expansion budget
outlines the Governor&#39;s priorities and recommends changes to
programs and individual allocations. Together these comprise the
Governor&#39;s recommended budget. As shown in the chart, we anticipate
the Governor&#39;s budget to be released to full Appropriations and the
committee sometime between late February or early March, meanwhile the
Appropriations committees are charged with meeting jointly to receive
background information on programs, budget drivers and other priorities.
The allotted time for this education period is roughly ten weeks but the
meeting frequency is flexible. Next, the House will take the input from
these joint meetings and break off to prepare its version of the budget,
passing its recommendations on to the Senate where the committee process
is then replicated. As implied by the chart, we&#39;ve yet to receive
target dates for the House and Senate budget passage respectively. In
prior years approximately four weeks has been afforded for each
chamber&#39;s deliberations. Assuming that the House doesn&#39;t concur
with the Senate&#39;s adjustments, the bill would then be referred to
conference committee to sort out the differences and then a conference
report would be voted up or down in each chamber and then if passed,
enrolled and sent to the Governor for approval. Now the process, the
joint process is especially beneficial because it reduces duplication,
helps to identify any gaps in information and also highlights areas of
agreement early on which saves time on the back end, however the success
of this process is contingent upon member feedback so I would encourage
you to ask questions and provide direction during this process. To that
end, staff has been working with the agencies to frame the presentations
that you&#39;ll receive so that they convey both the necessary
background and also more focused and issue driven and with transparency
in mind, all subcommittee presentations and handouts are posted online
for public consumption including materials from prior sessions

  <p id="20:00">
  There&#39;s a considerable amount of reference material that&#39;s
already available on the website, so I encourage you to explore it at
your convenience and also to refer to it regularly. You&#39;ll find both
the 2011 and 2013 regular session and short session materials online.
For today&#39;s purposes, you also have hard copies of transportation
acronyms, a glossary of transportation related terms, and a contact list
for agency and staff as well for your reference. Before getting into
responsibility of staff, I will again draw your attention to Karlynn
O&#39;Shaughnessy from fiscal staff, Amna Cameron who has, who was
double booked today with senate finance, and Luke Gillenwater as well
from bill drafting. These are your principle staff to the committee.
Fiscal research specifically is charged with analyzing and preparing the
budget, conducting public and confidential fiscal analysis of proposed
legislation, performing special studies at the general assembly&#39;s
directions, and also responding to ad hoc requests from members. Staff
assists in coordinating the appropriations process, and when not in
session, oversees the implementation of the budget for the joint
legislation transportation oversight committee and joint legislative
commission on governmental operations. Each analyst on the
transportation information technology team specializes in certain policy
areas and serves as a principle contact for corresponding issues. In
general, Amna Cameron covers all roadway related aspects, and I cover
intermodal, logistics, and division of motor vehicles issues. Karlynn
again serves as our team leader and statewide information technology
analyst, lending her expertise for GOT and DMV IT initiatives.
You&#39;ll see on the next slide that you have our specific assignment
areas, so please consult those in terms of making any requests to staff.
Bill drafting and research division staff also play vital roles in this
process, drafting budget provisions and legislation, and also
researching legal, regulatory, and other policy issues. Bill drafting
services is the primary legal resource for the appropriations process,
whereas research supports the concurrent activities of the policy
committees. Additionally, the program evaluation division is tasked with
conducting formal, longer term evaluations of programs focusing on
performance assessment, activity based costing, and providing actual
recommendations which we find often make their way to the appropriations
committees for consideration. And lastly, the office of state budget and
management and executive agency staff preparing to present the
governor&#39;s budget and justify any recommended adjustments. They
orient the committee to the programs that they administer. They assist
fiscal staff in obtaining data for the committee, and of course,
they&#39;re the ones who are ultimately responsible for carrying out the
directives of the general assembly. So where are we headed? This is our
tentative schedule for the committee. You&#39;ll see tomorrow that
you&#39;ll receive the transportation primer. The following week,
you&#39;ll receive a presentation on transportation funding. Then
we&#39;ll move into overviews of this NCDOT programs and kinda delve
more so into the specifics of operations. We have an NCDOT 101
orientation to divisions and programs, followed by the division of
highways presentation focusing on the maintenance and construction
programs as well as staffing and budget issues. Then we&#39;ll kinda
switch gears and move to strategic transportation investments update,
move on to debt, affordability, and tolling issues, and then begin
logistics presentations with state ports and a focus on dredging issues.
So that completes my presentation, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Brian. If you have any questions from committee members? The
planets obviously are perfectly aligned, having no questions from
committee. We&#39;re gonna move onto the math section of committee.
There is no test today, so just letting everyone know. Budget starting
points, referencing the long sheet, 2015-17 consensus revenue forecast,
and again, Bryce Ball, fiscal research.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chairs have requested that staff provide you with a sense of where
we currently are, where we&#39;ve been, and what is the context for
where we&#39;re going to go from a numerical perspective. So I&#39;ll
call your attention to three handouts. The first being a legal sized
sheet, a spreadsheet format. The second in order you should have a flow
of funds chart, and lastly it&#39;s the January consensus forecast,
another spreadsheet format. We&#39;ll first tackle the, the long sheet.
And the intent here is to just take a moment to orient you to the
current biennial budget as a starting point for consideration

  <p id="25:00">
  future adjustments to the 2015-2017 budget. This is intended as a
reference. As we go through the individual presentations, we’ll delve
into greater detail, into the individual line items that you see on the
spreadsheet, but just again to orient you to the material, on the
leftmost column you’ll find the categorization of program and line item
allocations according to fund and purpose. Moving from the left to the
right, the first set of columns that you’ll see are the Governor’s
recommended adjustments for the 2015 biennium. From there, the second
set of columns to the right, you’ll see the… actually the third set of
columns to the right, you’ll see the 2013 enacted biennium budget –
that’s the adjustments from the 2013 regular session – and then the
focal point of the spreadsheet is really the last set of columns, which
is the 2014 short session adjustments for the current fiscal year.
These, when adjusted for nonrecurring actions and also actualization of
programs, will really serve as the starting point and basis for
consideration of adjustments for the 2015-17 biennial budget. If you’d
like to consult the totals associated with the overall appropriations,
as well as the availability and any adjustments to those, you’ll find
those on page 3 of the spreadsheet. So we’ll move to the next handout,
which again is the flow of funds chart. Again, this is included for your
reference; it will be addressed in the presentation tomorrow as well,
but you’ll see within the chart, the chart is depicting the incoming
receipts by major category for each of the respective funds, and the
relationships between those receipts for the individual divisions and
programs that are funded. For the highway fund, you will note a direct
line relationship between those receipts to the NCDOT programs. For
transfers to external agencies, you’ll see a dotted line relationship;
the NCDOT does not administer those funds directly. And then to the
right you will see the highway trust fund; again, the receipt’s in
direct line relationship to program allocation as well as federal aid.
And the last category of other receipts or revenues and how they are
used refers to other receipts that generally do not hit the highway fund
or the highway trust fund from a non-budget perspective. The last
handout that you have that we’ll take a few moments to cover is the
January consensus forecast.  This forecast of course will be updated in
May to reflect current data at that time, but bottom line, this is based
on available data. The best sense of what availability will be for the
fiscal year 2015-17 biennial spending, as shown when you look at the
rightmost columns for fiscal year 2015-16 and 16-17 in relation to the
highlighted column in the middle, fiscal year 2014-15, we’re forecasting
a combined loss of 212 million dollars for the next fiscal year, and 138
million dollars for the fiscal year 2017. Again, this is relative to the
current year’s budget, fiscal year 14-15. This drop is largely driven by
falling wholesale prices for fuel, resulting in combined annual motor
fuel tax rates that are approximately 6.6 cents per gallon and 5.7 cents
per gallon, lower than the budgeted rate for 2015. This drop in the
motor fuels tax revenue is partially offset by rebounding DMV fees,
principally the highway use tax, which again goes directly to the
highway trust fund but does not bolster the highway fund. So these
individual components are going to be addressed in the presentation
tomorrow in greater detail, but to the extent that there are any
questions about this information in the reference material, sure, I’ll
go ahead and take those. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions from committee
members? Senator Gunn, ?? allocate you to 35 minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m going to sit here and be quiet, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excellent. We have another committee member? Representative Hall, we
took just a moment to introduce ourselves if you’d like at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Duane Hall, Wake County,
District 11. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Well we’ve pretty
much covered the material. Is there any…? Chairman ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick question. Since we’ve gone all paperless, are these papers going
to be in our folders tomorrow also, and are we going to have these
available on the committee page? [SPEAKER CHANGES] They should have been
posted to the website at 8:30 when the meeting convened. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] When the meeting…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] When the meeting convened.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Where will I find this on the website? We’ll do that
after. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me actually take a moment to

  ...orient you to the...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Because this benefits [INAUDIBLE] tracking at home as well if they want
to through and see the information that we&#39;re seeing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, navigate to the homepage and from there click on
&#39;Committee&#39;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that&#39;s a North Carolina General Assembly homepage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
From there you can either select the House or Senate standing
committees. Scroll down to &#39;Appropriations and Transportation&#39;.
From there you can access the Committee website link and at the bottom
of that -- again, you&#39;ll find this in both the House and the Senate
appropriations website -- the link to the joint website. From there you
see the reference materials that have been pulled forth from prior
sessions and then the 2015 session materials. You&#39;ll see that quotas
have already been created for today&#39;s meeting and for tomorrow&#39;s
meeting. For today&#39;s meeting all materials have been posted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chairman Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[INAUDIBLE] question. So, there will be a way to print these off the day
before? Like for me, that I do want a hard copy, so I can do that the
day before even though they&#39;re not posted until 8:30 in the morning?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Procedurally, we will make a point of staff to send out all the
electronic copies to committee membership and events. Any further
questions? And we&#39;ll reiterate the website addresses and locations
just to make it easier to follow. That sometimes keeps you from getting
out in the weeds when it comes to accessing websites. That concludes our
business. Senator Meredith, any closing remarks?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Iler? Or, Representative Iler. Representative Shepard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bumgardner, you had a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. Did you say this all is going to be kept in our folder,
especially these acronyms and all this stuff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can make sure that that&#39;s done. Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Because I don&#39;t want to carry it around with me, but I want to look
at it while I&#39;m in here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct. Correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further business? Say none. I will remind you that once again
tomorrow morning at 8:30 in this room we&#39;ll have a second meeting.
Look forward to your attendance and with no further ado, this committee
stands adjourned.
