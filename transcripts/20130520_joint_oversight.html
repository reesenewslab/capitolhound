...we are our other staff and we look forward to them being as
productive as they can be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Folks from the chairs and the committee we welcome you
on board and we're very glad to have you. Buckle down because we have a
lot of hard work that we have to do in this committee. We appreciate you
being here. Sarah, Chuck, Joshua and Brent. We're glad to have you on
board.
Our next item is Department of Public Instruction, and update on the
driver's education program. Maria Martin and do both of you ladies want
to come together? Maureen Burner? You can come up here if you'd like to,
please. If you'll just identify yourself and push the button until the
green light comes on and we'll take it from there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon to all assembled. I am Maria Pitre
Martin and I'm the State Director of K-12 Curriculum and Instruction at
the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. With me today is
Dr. Maureen Burner, who is with the University of North Carolina's
School of Government. Today we will both be presenting to you on the
work of driver's education and certainly the work that has been done, as
well as the work that we are planning to do moving forward. Certainly,
as we have prepared to present to you today, there are several documents
that you should have in your possession. Starting off, of course, with a
PowerPoint presentation and then also, copies of the driver's education
strategic plan, should also have been provided to you, as well. As well
as the University of North Carolina evaluation report that Dr. Burner
should speak about very shortly. So all of those things should certainly
be in your possession as we go through today's presentation.
We also have a performance matrix that should be, it's a one page
document, that should be included, as well. We'll be referencing those
things as we continue on.
Just to give a brief history of the work that has been done before Dr.
Burner presents the evaluation report, we know that going back to
November of 2010, the Office of State Business and Management presented
information on driver's education and the efforts to move forward with
some reform efforts around driver's education. Also, there was a review
given to this body back in December of 2010. So much of what you will
see today is in response to some of the changes recommended at that
time. Also, we know that we had driver education reform. That certainly
was presented in State statute and then we also have additional reports
that have come to fruition in this work from September of 2012, as well
as January of 2013.
As I said before, today we will report on the UNC School of Government
study and Dr. Burner will be stepping up shortly to do that report. Then
I will continue on to discuss the driver education strategic plan.
Before Dr. Burner comes up to the podium, just as an update, we know
that the pilot program, which was an online pilot program involved five
of or school districts, our local education agencies across the State.
That particular project took place between February of 2012 through June
of 2012 with 30 hours of computerized instruction. It solely was based
on that computerized instruction. We have 532 students enrolled and
currently we have about 358 students who have completed that work.
At this time, I will ask Dr. Burner to step forward and she will go into
more specifics regarding the results of the study.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Again, I'm Maureen Burner, I'm a professor
of public administration and government at the University of North
Carolina School of Government. In 2012, the School of Government was
approached by the...</p>

<p id="10:00">
North Carolina Department of Public instruction while conducting an
investigation of the different teaching methods used in driver's
education in North Carolina.  We defined different teaching methods as
traditional class room instruction, traditional classroom instruction
augmented with various technical tools, often referred to as blended
instruction, or completely we-based instruction such as the pilot
program just mentioned.  We agreed to conduct an evaluation, and we did
so in several parts.  We conducted a literature report review to see
what other organizations or universities, or researchers had done
reports on driver's ed., educational teaching in particular with on-line
teaching, and what had already been done.  We gathered data and compared
the quality of the teaching mode of these different teaching ways using
various measures of performance using student test scores and pass
rates.  We tried to obtain and compare cost information for the
different teaching mods, and we gathered information on the use of the
optional driver's education fee.  The data we used include the reviewing
the reports that were currently available nationally, looking at data
that included test scores, the school that was attended, and related
teaching scores for students who took the DMV driver's test from July
1st, 2010 to July 31st, 2012.  We ended up shortening our data set to
ensure that we included compare able students within our very large data
set, that we initially started with.  And our final data set, after
cleaning, included information for almost 274,000 students state-wide
from all different parts of the state.  Part of the information we used
was obtained from a state-wide survey of schools.  That survey had an
81% response rate, or information from 338 schools, these are the
schools that would be included in driver's education, not every school,
obviously.  Finally, we had information from interviews from officials
and contractors in other states who dealt with on-line driver's
education programs.  I want to thank DPI and DMV for working together to
provide the raw data for analysis, and assisting in conducting the
survey.  To my knowledge, the resulting data set, which ties information
about the students with their actual test scores from DMV, does not
exist in any comparable form in any other state.  So, to go to our
findings.  Firstly, we were unable to find other similar evaluations
that specifically focused on how driver's education is taught.  There
simply, at least, from the time that is spent, simply no other
evaluations or research available targeting how driver's education is
taught and in comparing quality or performance measures related to that.
 So in terms of overall, there doesn't seem to be a lot of research out
there on this topic.  On-line programs have been described recently, in
a report by the National Highway Transportation Safety Association of
the US Department of Transportation, they provide some descriptive
information about these programs, but do not evaluate them.  In our
analysis of our data, however, let me turn to looking at the actual test
scores and pass rates for the students, we found little difference in
the performance across the teaching modes as measured by overall test
scores, pass rates, or test frequencies.  That is how many times a
student has to take a test before they finally pass.  There was very
little difference between students who took traditional driver's
education in a traditional classroom, versus in a blended classroom.
Unfortunately, we were unable to include in these comparisons, the
completely on-line pilot, because the earlier graduates of that program
have not yet taken the DMV test at the time that we pulled together our
data.  And so, while a number of students have already finished that
on-line test, they may or may not have actually gone to the DMV and
taken the appropriate test, and they were not included in the data set
that we had available when we did our analysis.</p>

<p id="15:00">
And the next step, looking at cost per student, we were unable to assess
cost per student across the 3 teaching modes because there are concerns
over the comparability of availability cost information.  When we got
down into the details of the cost information, we did not feel
comfortable at the School of Government drawing conclusions from the
information we had, because we weren't sure we would be comparing apples
to apples.  And the information was not in such a state that we could
make really good cost comparisons across teaching modes.  Finally from
our survey we can report, that among those that responded to the
question about the optional fee,  the majority of schools do require the
fee, and of those, most require the top allowable amount, or $45.  I'm
happy to answer any questions at any time.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Questions from the committee, Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]My biggest question on this, as I look through some of
the results on the findings, given that the individuals to be in the
blended course are a self-selected group, and when you look at them as a
whole, they have a variance, for 300 students, that is much smaller than
the variance that exists in a 200,000 students, kind of looking at
overall.  What kind of look have you done as seeing what is innately
different in the populations that would be done by the selecting of the
course, and not necessarily, and not exclusively to the teaching methods
of the course?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Ms. Burner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Let me try to answer as best I can, but then I may also
refer to DPI in terms of some of the specifics of how that classroom's
techniques actually work.  The determination of whether or not a school
as a whole was offering blended instruction or not, just to be clear in
my understanding of your question, it's not necessarily the student's
choice as to whether or not they're in, but whether the school chooses
to offer it in a blended format in that classroom.  And there are a much
smaller number of schools who reported, self reported, that they were
using a blended teaching method.  Out of the schools that responded to
our survey, 42 reported, the schools, 42 schools reported that they
offered blended instruction, 178 offered traditional.  The rest of the
schools who responded to the survey did not provide sufficient
information for us to tell exactly which pot they fell into.  So in the
end, when we were comparing the test scores, we narrowed it down to
folks that clearly had self identified themselves as one or the other.
Now, in terms of differences with those schools that chose the blended,
we did not look at the specific school characteristics that might say
that they may be different systematically from the rest.  But certainly,
by choosing themselves to offer blended, that in itself is a systematic
difference compared to the others.  Hopefully, in general, the students
are not systematically different, there would be a wide variety of
students within those schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up.  And I think, when we look at the,
particularly the on-line students, that's going to grow to even a bigger
concern is that students who would chose to take one on-line tend to
have internet access and these types of things coming forward, do you
plan to continue this study and repeat it when you have the data and
information available for the on-line students completed and their
ability and their results from the test scores.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We have no firm plans at the moment, but we're more
than happy to be accessible to DPI to continue the study.  Certainly
there would be interest nationally, given that no other state really has
been able to follow it this way, so there at least would be some effort
to share these results because it would be of interest to a larger
community.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Hise, are you asking, are you making that in
the form of a request?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I could make that in the form of a request is something
I think we delve into this looking at what is the difference between</p>

online education. We kind of discovered the blended method along that
way moving forward and so I think we really need to have a look at what
is the online results.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Note to our staff, we will do a follow up on that. Senator
Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam ???. The pilot project was undertaken from, I believe,
February to June 2012. You may, or DPI may know. In the fall of 2012 or
currently in this semester of school is there still an online presence?
I mean, are there any school systems using the online version and do we
have an identification of who they are or where they are or what's
happened since June of 2012?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Martin, would you like to address that please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, we are definitely aware of school districts that have continued to
use the online portion but they have not been considered part of that
pilot and we can certainly get that information to you of the specific
districts that have continued on to use some of that work, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Senator
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Did any systems beyond the five you indicated were participating in the
pilot participate in the fall or actually the spring of this year. I
mean, did any other systems participate besides the five.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And how was that selection made?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. And actually we do have with us today, with your permission, Reggie
Flythe who is our day to day operations person at the Department of
Public Instruction who could certainly speak to those specifics if you
would, certainly I'll ask permission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely. Sir, if you would give us your name for the record and
identify your position.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. My name is Reginald Flythe. I am the driver education consultant
for the
Department of Public Instruction. This particular study, the data that
you saw in the slide with the 358 students that completed, that
information was through February of this year. What the locals did is
some of those students that did not finish the online course, they took
them back into the classroom to finish them to make sure that they could
go through the process for whatever reason they did not complete the
online only portion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Senator
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's not my question. My question is did any systems beyond the five
who were a part of the original project elect to utilize the online
product. As in the fall of 2012 or thus far the spring of this year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To my knowledge, no sir. The study ended at the end of the semester.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Were they offered the prospect of utilizing the online product? Or any
system beyond the five that were there, was anybody else offered the
prospect of utilizing the online product?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In North Carolina 30 hours of classroom instruction there's part of it,
and a part of this pilot program. No system that I know of sir does
that. This is part of the pilot for that particular point in time, I
don't know of any that does online only education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes I think we could ask for some input from Larry Yates, a member of
our staff. Mr Yates?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am. Larry Yates, program evaluation. I believe that there are
some schools as we got into the review previously there was discussion
with other DPI staff that there are some schools out there doing online
or mixed trainings, matter of fact. Unfortunately I do not have that
list that was that was developed and gathered within the DPI network.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think, madam chair, what I'm going to ask is, what you just asked me.</p>

<p id="25:00">
What did the pilot prove? Or did he prove anything?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Martin did you want to address that question or do you want to defer
it to someone else?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No actually I’d like to respond to that particular question because
based on the last couple of comments that were  made in Dr. Burner’s
presentation and actually I’m going to switch to the next slide that we
have in or presentation. I think we know that the work that was done in
the pilot we know that there are students that have been brought back to
actually complete that pilot and then if we have other school districts
who are not a part of that pilot but have chosen to use that particular
information.  We need to certain that we know who whose school districts
are and how we can include that information.  So to answer the question
that I think that was asked earlier about, what additional information
can we bring to the table to continue the study? That is what needs to
be done at this point to really get at the question that’s been asked
regarding what have we found out from this particular study. And I think
Dr. Burdum might conclude as well that more information needs to be
gathered and I don’t know if she wants to speak directly to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As mentioned, when we did our analysis in 2012 the students involved in
the online program had not reached the point at which they could
actually take the DMV test so we couldn’t bring them into our large
statistical analysis.  It is certainly possible that at this point, DMV
may have test data for those individuals that we could bring in and do a
comparison.  Although it is a small number of students and we’d have to
go back to DMV and bring that in again.  One thing I will note in terms
of research done in other of the description of the online programs in
other states, we were able to speak, we started with Pennsylvania and
Colorado in terms of asking about their experience.  We also spoke with
individuals in California, Georgia, Florida, Indiana, Nebraska,
Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia and the most significant issue that they
had followed in terms of online education was concern of incompletions
or folks who do not finish eh online course once started.  But at this
point there’s not the data from the online study to analyze in hand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thought that was the objective.  Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t know which one to ask this.  But do you know why these were not
completed on the 174, do you know why they didn’t complete or any
analysis on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The 174 if I want to make sure I’m understanding your question.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hurley would you repeat your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On page 2 it says 532 students enrolled in the pilot 358 completed so I
think that leaves 174 that we do not know anything about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry we have not tracked or gone back to interview students or
discuss with the schools why they did not complete the online.  We at
the time that the school of government was doing the analyses, those
programs the students were either still actively within the online
program, and then there is a gap between when they finish and when they
may actually go to DMV to take their test scores.  Which is what we were
basing our large scale analyses on. So there was a time gap.  We have
not gone back to the students in that online ilot and discussed anything
with them directly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comment from the Chair.  I don’t believe we’re ready to accept the
report.  Because the objective of the report was to get the pilot, get
the information from the 5 pilots and to determine several things,  one
being how many of those students completed and how many passed their
exam.  So I’m going to ask with.</p>

One being the financial operation of the department, the other being the
programming part of the department. From time to time the journal
assembly needs to take a look at what the department is doing as a
whole. There's a lot of confusion about the role of the department of
public education, public instruction. These would be what the local
school boards do. Number four, fire rescue and emergency management
service funds. The state has grant programs coming from the insurance
premium tax. We will look at how those handled, what they're for. There
have been some reports of some book keeping problems in way the
department is handling those funds. Nothing fraudulent, I might say very
quickly, but just some concerns about timeliness of book keeping and
since it is to some extent a pension program, there's always an interest
there in any unfunded accrued liability that might be occurring there.
Number five the unused unutilized surplus property, that is, real
property and those are underway right now. There is a bill now that is
in process that would require formal reporting of the states real
property by the agencies back to this division and to the ?? committee
and to some other committees. Those are all underway as we speak. The
projects that are pending, I'm not going to go down all of those, but I
will mention a couple of them. Project number six, Senator Clark, that
was one of the projects you wanted. The senate budget bill has an
identical project and is requiring the chief information officer in the
ITS department to conduct an identical study. It's possible that this
committee could either defer this project pending the outcome of that
CIO review or you could totally strike our project and just look at the
results coming from CIO and accept that. The other one, Community Care
of North Carolina, same thing, the senate bill requires DHHS to do an
effectiveness study. There's been some criticism of that study from some
researchers and scientists that have questioned the validity of the ??
studies that have been done, showing that it does indeed save money and
avoid medicaid costs. The state auditor recommended such a study and you
committee wanted us to do it, but now the senate bill has the DHHS doing
that study. Same thing, you could either defer our study pening the DHHS
or you could strike that study in its entirety from the work plan. The
rest of the are listed there and in the interest of time I won't go over
all of the individually. We went over all of those at the last meeting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to point out, number 10 the ?? program for overnight ??
the governor recommended continuing those funds after the ?? project and
the senate budget expands that project now state wide that's moving
forward. We may want to look at reviewing what we were only doing with
six counties now that we've, how we want to do that now that we've
expanded it state wide depending on how that comes through.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll do that. I thought you might look at the timing, the staging of
these projects that are underway plus the two that we're going to start
following those. One of them being we had planned the ?? IT projects.
Again, depending of what committee wants to do that. Let me back up a
bit. You may want to defer action on deferring the project until the
house acts on the budget and the budget's signed by the governor and
it's not overridden and there's no complications about that. The
budget's always subject to amendment. We won't launch that project
unless there's some definition there. So I won't ask the committee to
deal with that right now or until the budget is settled. Those projects
that are listed there, we have project teams on all of them. The last
box shows when the reports should come out. We're also going to do two
reports on the rural fire departments grants and pensions. That covers
three or four different program areas.</p>

going over the rim of the bill last night and this morning. staff also
been a good thing the Senate bill does not add anything to the studies
we do not have any projects or going around this committee 's work plan
as yet once again, as I was saying before the pins on what the final
outcome of the budget process is a mission. the Seattle study I
mentioned the DHS. a study of community care, North Carolina.
interestingly, the Senate budget authorizes the legislative service
officer. my boss to assign or to allow our own all of our/ to assist in
that North Carolina can your project that is a statewide efficiency
study of state government Senate budget sets aside two million dollars
to be used by officer state budget and management to contract with a
consulting firm or firms and to put together an inter agency team to
review to review all of state government look for cost savings
opportunities. it's broader than that the Senate bill itemizes some
particulars about what the scope of that study will be. I have some
discussions with Mister Pope, who is number two budget director  he's
very interested in using our reports. reports of the state are others
that are done and done by other agencies and staff in this effort on so
that's a possible of workload impact fire, but I do not believe that
that will be too burdensome. now if the request is for us to take some
of our staff members and put together a team and work on that him places
I would remember from my window,forcing that time on. also mentioned are
the units are some hand out is attached to the slide presentation here.
I did look specifically at that looks like this look specifically at the
Senate bill for any recommendations on some of our reports are from this
committee, or both, but show up somewhere in the center 's budget
proposal and their storm. the budget includes twenty seven million
dollars to start repaying the escheat fund loan for global transport
bottles on my lungs,
Change Speaker: thirty nine million
Change Speaker:, including accrued interest twenty seven will address
the entire amount. okay, but a way that that's a good thing we
recommended that some repayment schedule start. I wouldn't say they
decided that because of our recommendationlegislators and lawyers
Association minor regret and figure out global transport. nobody else.
so yes to me and the Senate budget also makes a number of
recommendations for motorfleet management for her Broadway in many
recommendations from Word for Word from our series of reports, including
the testing of telematics for monitoring on vehicle use the underground
tanks. report redid several years ago I one of the recommendations was
that we look specifically at a greater cost sharing by the industry and
that is reflected to some extent in the sentence budget tag and title
latest report on that is so that requires a DOT and the MP4 and study
looking at the rates charged by those contractors looking specifically
athow well they're doing the work. the duration of what made the
contract agents to compare to what DMV in-house work does our reports
look at that found that of the contract agents are generally more time
efficient than the DMV workers are doing work and I'm also drivers
education is mentioned in their drivers in Caerleon districts are
authorized to charge the students,parents forty five dollars to take
drivers. it is an option of the Senate bill rises to sixty five dollars
that additional funding. of course, when also it will be put back into
the program off set some of the state 's contribution will could be put
back in the program. this term</p>

any question, or if anyone has any.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Questions from the committee with respect to the
amendment of the plan?  Or any other questions?  Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]John, the 2 projects that are specifically identified
in the Senate budget involving the CIO and the community care, has your
staff commenced any work on either of those projects as yet?  I saw the
schedule, I was just curious.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We have done some background reading, primarily buy
low, and the staff has looked at those projects for the purpose of
scoping them out for the work planning, so we do have that, but no,
there haven't been any entrance conference or formal notice to the
department, or stake holders, and we do not have the projects underway
as we define it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Tukoff.  Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, and since I wasn't here last year, I've got
a couple of questions, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well you're here representing the House, solely now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We appreciate you presence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  Well, I did have Representative Moffitt
here.  I have 2 questions.  On the contract tag agents, do you check
also about the contractor, the ones you give the contracts to, to see
how good they are, authorized to actually be contract agents.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]When we did that study, I'll be happy to give you a
copy of it.  I don't know specifically.  we checked to see if they have
valid contracts.  Does anybody from staff recall that.  Karen McGordy
was lead on that, Madame Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]They all have contracts with the Department of Motor
Vehicles.  The real issue is that they have different contracts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]And my question was, were they really supposed to be
having the contracts with the background check, is what I was checking
to see if maybe they had conflicts with dealerships.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'm not aware of that, what we really focused on was
more the process for giving new contract at this point in time.  Some of
them have had contracts for a very long time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, my next one was Global Park, where did the policy
payments coming from.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Because it was $33 million and then, of course it was
more interest.  Where did the payments come from to make it back down to
$27 million?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Shawn, can you answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Indeed, Shawn Elm for evaluation division.  Last year
in the short session, the General Assembly took action to make a
one-time payment of $17.5 million to the sheet fund, that drew it all
the way down, somewhere to just above $25 million, and at the time that
it passed it came out to $27 million because of the interest, and this
time I believe it's now coming out of the general fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Trukoff, would you like to mention the railroad
report.  I believe we missed that, and that was quite important.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Oh, my apologies Madame Chair.  The recommendations to
committee made from our report have all been put into the Senate's
version of the budget.  The only difference in what the Senate is
proposing to do, and our report, is that the real estate that we've
identified as being idle, not producing enough income, or not related to
railroads, the Senate is having the railroad corporation look at those
properties to see if any of them are contaminated, or if there's any
problem wit the sale.  And the sale, of course, will be, the dividends,
I'm sorry, the proceeds of those sales will be dealt with in the future.
 They're not included in the one-time dividend that we estimated.  But,
the one-time dividend from cash is $15 million going into the highway
fund for rail projects, and a recurring dividend of 25% of the trackage
agreement with Norfolk Southern Railroad, that $3 million would also go
in the highway fund and be dedicated for rail projects.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Acoda, I believe that's the Senate budget you're
speaking of.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senate, yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  Are there other comments from the
committee?  I believe in the wisdom of the body, the Chairs would
suggest</p>
