Senator Apodaca said I didn’t qualify for that. He said that was for
amateurs. In any case, I was contacted by two district court judges, one
of which was a senior district court judge, who felt that it was
important to bring to the attention of this body that when unemployment
benefits get reduced, it also affects the ability of people to pay child
support. He thought it would have impact on those who receive child
support through our system. I told him that I would bring that to the
attention of this body. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I rarely speak at this chamber so I wanted to have this opportunity to
stand and debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Members of the Senate, we have a real problem here, a $2.5
billion shortfall that we owe the Federal government. There are a lot of
causes and we heard a good debate yesterday as to what those causes were
that got us in this hole. But we all agree that this is a big hole and
one that it’s essential we get out of. The fund must be solvent.
If you put too much of the burden on the businesses then tax rates,
which North Carolina is one of the lowest in the country on our city
taxes, I think we’re 42nd, 43rd in the country, we put too much on the
business and our tax rate gets out of whack, it makes it hard on those
businesses to compete, it makes it hard for North Carolina to compete.
Similarly, if we put too much burden on people who lost their job
through no fault of their own and are actively looking for work, which
is who we’re talking about, and their families, you create real
hardships for those families but also for their local communities, their
landlords, their supermarkets, their gas stations, everywhere where they
spend their little bit of money that they need in order to keep their
families going for the periods of weeks that they’re unemployed.
A problem, I guess, requires a balanced approach. What I regret is that
the bill that is before us now is not balanced. It is not a bill of
shared sacrifice. For every one dollar that is borne by the business
there are two dollars in permanent cuts for unemployed workers.
The number of weeks, we’re going from 26 weeks to 12-to-20-week sliding
scale. Only one other state in the country uses 12 to 20 weeks. 45
states use 26 weeks. We had a very reasonable amendment yesterday to
settle on 20 weeks. It would put us at the very bottom of the country.
Everyone else is at 26 but you all rejected 20 weeks and went 12 to 20.
The way you calculate the income on what the unemployment rate is paid,
is we’re the only state in the country that does that and it results in
the lowest amount in the country. We put in amendments to make this bill
fair. They were rejected.
Then there was the issue about the sunset. Let’s put a sunset on this.
If the business taxes go away when the debts are paid, let’s have these
benefit reductions borne by workers go away. Then we can reevaluate what
the system should look like. That was rejected.
That’s the most surprising, most harmful, or most telling was your
rejection of the amendment that simply moved the effective date on all
these drastic cuts you all are proposing to the beginning of next year
so that we can continue to draw down long-term unemployment benefits for
people who are having a very tough time finding a job.
We heard about counties where there are 17 and 18 percent unemployment.
There are two or three applicants for every empty job in North Carolina
and to pretend that they’re just not finding jobs because they don’t
want them is really callous.
It also is just shocking that you all are willing to forgo at no cost to
the North Carolina taxpayer $780 million in economic transfer to
unemployed workers which results in $1.5 billion in economic activity in
counties where there are unemployed people.
We have an unemployment problem in North Carolina and you all are
rejecting $1.5 billion in economic activity at zero cost to the North
Carolina taxpayer. We’ve taken up three major bills and so far, I’ve got
a little tally going, that’s $3.5 billion in economic activity this year
at no cost to the North Carolina taxpayer that you all are forgoing. We
should be about getting the economy going again. I urge you to vote
against this bill on third reading. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
