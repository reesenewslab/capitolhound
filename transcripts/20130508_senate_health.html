Thank you members. So. We'll start by introducing our pages today. First
we have Olivia Djaro. Durujo. Senator Paten thank you. Gabby Holmes.
Senator Raven. Christine Marrow. Senator Jenkins. And Jordan Thomas.
Senator Blue. We have a sgt at arms with us. If we don't know him by now
we have problems. We'll rearrange we ask that senate 132 be moved to the
end of todays calendar. So we'll go ahead and begin with senate bill
321. I do apologize for not being here but the insurance committee ran
over. So I had to be over there. I was trying to dance between the two.
Senator Davis is recognized to explain his bill. Do you have PCS.
Senator Davis moves to hear the PCS senate bill 321. All those in favor
say aye. PCS is before us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you chairman Heis and
ladies and gentlemen of the committee. I bring to you today senate bill
321. Contain counties inmate medical cost. This legislation will provide
to counties the same inmate medical cost that this general assembly
enacted for the state prisons system several years ago. To control
escalating state medical cost for state prisoners the general assembly
enacted legislation to limit the department of public safety payments to
medical providers to 70% of the current prevailing charge. That full non
negotiated rate that no one pays except counties for jail inmate medical
services. Unless our individual health insurance which is paid at
negotiated rates. Counties are largely being charged that full non
negotiated rack rate for medical services provided to county jail
inmates. This legislation would implement the same medical cost
containment cap for counties as that allowed for state prisons. I have
had a conversation with representatives from the hospital association
and they have some legitimate points of interest in this bill and I
pledge to them that we will continue this conversation. It is in our
best interest in every county. To make sure that the county is healthy
but also that our hospitals remain healthy as well. And I'd be glad to
entertain any questions that the committee may have. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I've just seen this now.
And I've worked with for many years prisoner legal services and medical
is always a problem both in huge cost over runs. But also there is a
constitutional requirement that when a person is in custody that they
have to have adequate medical services. When you put a cap on this and
as I said I have not read this I just glanced at it. Are you not
jeopardizing maybe a lawsuit even that says that they're not getting
adequate medical services. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No we're not. They're still
gonna get adequate medical services. This is not a bill about what level
of medical services that you're gonna get. This a bill about
compensation. The counties are just asking for the same thing, same deal
that the state gets. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you mr chair. Thank you senator Davis. Two questions I am
supportive of that because I know our county has had some issues in
terms of covering the cost of medical care and this will help. But two
questions, have you heard from the county's sheriff association. Well
let me let you answer that in terms of hearing from the counties
associations about this. Have you heard from them at all. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If I may mr chairmen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Are you referring to the sheriff's association or the North
Carolina association of county commissioners. [SPEAKER CHANGES] County
commissioners. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I have. And they're in favor of
this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok [SPEAKER CHANGES] Matter of fact its been one
of their goals for some time and I believe its one of their legislative
goals for this session. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And the follow up Mr Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My question is kind of in
concert with senator Conard's question in terms of how does that putting
the 70% cap on that. Because I know that our county has contracted with
the prison health services before and that kind of thing. How does that
affect their ability to provide those services or is there gonna be any
impact based on that 70% cost? Of the usual and prevailing rate, I think
thats what your legislation says. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may Mr
chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You may respond. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes it
will impact their reimbursement rate the hospitals but it will not
affect the level of service. Again I ...</p>

mentioned earlier that the hospital association has been in contact with
me about this bill, they would prefer to get a hundred percent, but
wards of the county are just asking for the same rate that the state
prison system is getting. But again, I don't believe there's any county
commission in the state that would want to jeopordize the existence of
their local hospital. And so we, I have pledged to them that we will
continue a conversation so that we have everybody at the table to iron
out the differences that we may have.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I have Senator Rabin, and Senator Don Davis, and Senator Parmon, and
Senator Bingham, so we'll begin with Senator Rabin.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I'd just like to comment that I too, unsolicited, received calls today
from some of the, my county commissioner. One of them who reports that
the board of commissioners is a hundred percent on board, and therefore
I'm saying at the appropriate time to move for a favorable report.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Senator Don Davis.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thanks Mr. Chair. I would simply thank Senator Davis from the list here
for bringing this forward. I think this would have tremendous impact on
our counties. I just, right now our county, Greene county, in which I
preside or reside, we have a situation right now dealing with paying a
bill associated with an inmate had a heart condition. Unfortunately the
inmate passed, and we're still trying to settle this debt obligation. I
think this is more a stab at the long term here.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you Senator Davis. Senator Parmon.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I totally support this bill, and I've heard from
my county commissioners. And having been a county commissioner and
having to have dealt with issues like this, I certainly support the
bill. But I also wanted to ask the bill's sponsor, within this bill is a
requirement that the local jails have a procedure in place to ensure
that indigent inmates receive the same quality care. Did you make sure
that was covered in this bill?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
If I may, Mr. Chairman.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
You may respond.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
My understanding is that's federal law, and so those protections are
there already.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I wanted to re-emphasize that it is taken care of, and that we just
need, that counties are able to pay these bills without going broke.
Thank you.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Senator Bingham.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was going to move for a favorable report, but
I was in hopes that someone, Senator Davis from the hospital association
may have a comment. I'm just curious, because I have two small hospitals
in my area, and I agree with you as far as, but I just, I'm curious to
how and what exactly in the direction and resolve in this, what effect
it would have on some of these hospitals, the smaller ones.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Anyone from the hospital association like to speak? Can you please
identify yourself?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Hugh Tillson, Senior Vice-President, North
Carolina Hospital Association. We've had a conversation with Senator
Davis, the bill sponsor, about some of the issues we have related to
this bill, and look forward to continuing to work with him. We're still
trying to figure out, frankly, how this would affect some of those
hospitals. Figuring out kind of how the payment rates would work, but
also making sure that the custody questions are asked and answered. Make
sure that we know who is really in custody, and therefore when a payment
obligation kicks in, we recognize that these are longer term
conversations, and we appreciate the bill sponsor's willingness to
commit to having this with us.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you.  Any other questions, comments? Seeing none, Senator Rabin
have moved for a favorable report to the proposed committee substitute
of the bill unfavorable as to the original bill. All those in favor say
aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it. Thank you Senator Davis. Next we will
hear Senator Cook. Drug testing for LTC applicants and employees. Check
your microphone please, sir.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Good morning. I believe there's an amendment to this bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Member have an amendment? Senator Tarte.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Yes. I have an amendment to offer. It's really a technical change.</p>

Two members of the community have asked to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Marty McCaphrey [SP] will be joining Senator Daniel's
in the explanation of the bill, from UNC hospital as well. Before we
move to that we also have a PCS for this bill. Senator Tucker moves for
the consideration of the PCS from the committee. All those in favor of
considering the PCS please signify with saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The aye's have it, PCS is before us, Senator Danial.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
Basically just for the committee's information the only change in the
PCS is to take the exact language that as in the original bill and
relocate it in a place where we thought it was more appropriate in the
educational curriculum so that it will be taught to students seventh
grade and above. So that's the only change in the PCS. This bill is
about giving our young people scientific information about the future
health risks that are associated with abortion. It's a bill based on
science, it's not based on political ideology. We educate our children
on the risks of cigarette smoking, we educate our children on the risks
of drinking and other hazardous behavior. And this is just a bill that's
based on the scientific evidence that shows that you will have a future
risk of premature birth if you decide voluntarily to have an abortion.
At this time I guess I'll let my co-sponsor senator Randleman would like
to say a few words and then we do have a gentleman from UNC hospital
that's going to provide some expert testimony.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Daniel. You know I'm very honored to
have been asked to be on this piece of legislation. We talk about
informing our young people and I think this is a step in that direction.
And also I hope we will also cover today the impact that this has on
families because when you have a preterm birth it devastates that family
in a social way and also economically. So I hope that we touch on that
also today, and as Senator Daniel says this is based on studies so I'm
sure that we will have that covered and I hope that we can ask for your
support. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning and thank you. Thank you for the
invitation and the opportunity to speak in support of SP132. My name is
Marty McCaphrey [SP]. I'm a neonatologist, professor of pediatrics at
UNC Chapel Hill. Member of the North Carolina Child Fatality Task force
and director of the prenatal quality collaborative of North Carolina,
PQCNC or picnic [SP] for short. Former life I was a US navy captain, a
medical director of a NICU and a navy surgeon general adviser for
neonatology during my navy career. My work revolves around the care of
premature infants but in picnic [SP] and the child fatality task force
I've been fortunate to be involved in organizations whose missions
include reducing prematurity and its consequences in North Carolina.
Prematurity is a very complex problem with multiple associated risk
factors. The 2006 institute of medicine, IOM report, is the
comprehensive reference on factors associated with preterm birth.
Including a prior preterm birth, infection, smoking and other factors.
But the IOM report also identifies quote, &quot; an immutable risk
factor associated with preterm birth.&quot; Which is prior first
trimester induced abortion. In 2006 there were 115 studies reporting on
this association. Today there are 137 studies reporting on this
association including two gold standard publications, systematic reviews
with meta-analysis, the swingling [SP] and shaw [SP] studies.
These dialysis reviewed 39 qualifying individual studies and reported
and increased risk for future preterm, less than 37 weeks and very
preterm birth, less than 32 weeks, of 36% risk and 65% elevation of risk
after one abortion. Two abortions increases the risk for a preterm birth
by 95%. There are no meta-analysis which dispute this relationship.
Obstetrical experts are now openly acknowledging the evidence of the
link. Dr. Jay Iams [SP], a maternal fetal medicine specialist,
international expert on prematurity and member of the IOM preterm birth
committee wrote in 2010 quote, &quot; contrary to common belief,
population based studies have found that elective pregnancy terminations
in the first and second trimesters are associated with a very small but
apparently very real increase in the risk of subsequent spontaneous
preterm birth. Doctor...</p>

<p id="20:00">
Phil Street, obstetrician, editor of the British Journal of Obstetrics
and Gynecology, commenting on the 2009 child study I referenced, wrote
in his editorial: “The key finding is that compared to women with no
history of termination, women with just one termination of pregnancy had
an increase odds of subsequent preterm birth.  We have known, listen to
this, we have known for a long time that repeated terminations
predisposed to early delivery in a subsequent pregnancy.  I don’t think
a lot of us knew that. I continue with Dr. Steer: “However the finding
that even one termination can increase the risk of preterm birth means
that we should continue to search for ways of making termination much
less traumatic. How important is this for the citizens of North
Carolina? It has been estimated that abortion may be responsible for 31%
of their preterm births. In 2010 there were 2,100 very-low birth weight
infants born in North Carolina.  Abortion is estimated to be responsible
for 262 of these cases, 86 excess deaths and 18 extra cases of cerebral
palsy. The personal, social and emotional toll of this epidemic is
staggering and disproportionately burdens the African American
community.  The financial impact however is equally devastating.  In
North Carolina in 2010 abortion related costs for hospitalization were
$23 million with an additional $43 million in lifetime costs related to
new cases of cerebral palsy in that given birth year. ??? reports showed
a modest association at best between smoking and preterm birth in yet
since 1985 have been labeled with “smoking by pregnant women may result
in fetal injury, premature birth and low birth weight.” In North
Carolina we have developed extensive public health campaigns to educate
women of child bearing age about the risks of smoking and preterm birth
but the evidence linking abortion with preterm birth dwarfs that linking
smoking with preterm birth but the public is unaware. Some of the
mothers of preterm babies I care for tortured at their bedsides as they
maintained vigils with their preterm infants for months ask the question
why, what could I have done to make this different.  They know nothing
about the association of preterm birth with the abortion they may have
had months or years before. In summarizing the clinical implications of
their landmark med analysis, Shaw stated: “ More than a million
abortions are performed in the U.S. per year. Of these more than 75% of
women wish to get pregnant again. These women should know the risks
associated with abortion not only for their health but also for their
future reproductive potential. Potential areas for knowledge, transfer,
and this is still quoting Shaw from the British Journal article:
“include education of girls and women enrolled in schools or colleges
during routine visits to family doctors or specialists and finally in
counseling women seeking abortion. Preterm birth has reached epidemic
proportions in North Carolina.  SB132 addresses a long overdue need to
ensure that young women of child bearing age will be informed of all
potential risks for preterm birth including abortion. At a point,
hopefully, prior to making decisions which may profoundly impact their
risk for a future preterm birth. It’s time to educate our young citizens
about preterm birth including the fact that never having an abortion or
deciding to not have another abortion reduces a woman’s risk for future
pre-maturity in their birth processes. That is why SB132 is unanimously
supported by the child fatality task force.  I ask you to help put ???
like me out of business.  Continue our journey to help make North
Carolina the best place to be born and support SB132.  Thank you very
much.   [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you…nothing else sir.  We now hear from
two members of the public we have signed up to speak, first Dr. David
Grimes from UNC Hospital.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good Morning.  My name is
David Grimes. I am a Gynecologist and Epidemiologist from the UNC School
of Medicine and formally chief of the abortion surveillance branch of
the CDC in Atlanta. I’ve been studying abortion safety for 40 years now
and have published 135 articles on this topic in the ??? literature.
Last month many of us were embarrassed to be North Carolinians. House
joint resolution 494 opened the door to a state endorsed religion.  This
aberration immediately made national news.  Although the resolution
never progressed the damage had already been done. North Carolina had
become a national laughing stock. Now a month later poised to go down
the same path. SB132 would establish…</p>

…by teaching that abortion causes pre-term birth. Have we learned
nothing from our mistake last month? Three compelling reasons argue
against this language.
First, the statement is scientifically false.
Second, the World Health Organization, the CDC, the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics to
which Dr. McCaffrey belongs, and the American Public Health Association
all have uniformly concluded that abortion does not cause prematurity.
How did they all get it wrong?
Third, even if the statement were true, curriculum content should be
left to educators, not politicians unfamiliar with the literature.
If the Senate truly feels compelled to mandate health regulation
messages, it should focus on tanning booths and texting while driving
which pose real not imaginary health risks. Please don’t bring further
embarrassment to our state through unnecessary and uninformed
legislation. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Now I have Kaye Phillips.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Chairman Hise, Chairman Pate and committee members. Teen
abortions and multiple abortions are rare in North Carolina. Thank you.
Senate Bill 132 would require public schoolteachers to give students
information on abortion and to tell them that three-plus abortions
increase the likelihood of pre-term birth.
It is important to recognize that abortion is rare among teenagers in
our state. With fewer than nine percent of all teen girls receiving an
abortion each year. Of those, 69 percent were ages 18 and 19.
Furthermore only 4.6 percent of all abortions in the state were to a
woman who had had three or more abortions.
Teen behaviors that lead to pre-term birth already receive attention.
Information on the most common causes of pre-term birth could help
students make better decisions about their own health now and in the
future, and the health curriculum should include those common causes, we
do agree.
Documented contributors to pre-term birth including unhealthy eating,
lack of exercise and tobacco and alcohol use are prevalent among our
North Carolina teens and are already addressed in the North Carolina
Healthful Living Curriculum.
Senate Bill 132 creates administrative roadblocks to required health
education. It creates an administrative roadblock to providing health
education requiring that any state-developed materials would require a
60-day review, LEAs, and an initial review period.
It requires an annual update to the materials and the law inadvertently
creates a two to four-month  blackout. We understand the desire to
reduce both the number of pre-term births and the number of abortions in
North Carolina. Senate Bill 132 is unlikely to impact either health
issue. It is however, likely to create discomfort for our state’s
parents, students, and educators. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Kinnaird.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. If I could ask Dr. McCaffrey to answer some questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning Dr. McCaffrey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have the privilege of serving on your…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, you do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
…wonderful Picnic Advisory Committee and have learned a great deal. I
have three questions, if I may, Mr. Chair. One of them that I learned
from your committee was that one of the leading causes of pre-term
births is planned deliveries less than full-term. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am. There is an increase in the number of pre-term births that
are associated with late pre-term deliveries and some of those you might
say are planned, but they are later pre-term births for certain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I have three questions, this is the second one. Thank you Mr.
Chair. Is this the only cause of prematurity?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, ma’am. As I said it’s a very complex problem. So I would not stand
up here and say…</p>

<p id="30:00">
abortion is the only cause of prematurity. I think that everything that
was spoken about by the previous speaker, abortion comes closest to
causality based on statistical analysis than any of those other factors
do. But there are multiple factors that go into this.
Speaker Changes: Further questions.
Speaker changes: Further questions Mr. Chair, thank you.
Speaker Changes: You did say very small, but you didn't give me actual
figures or percentages.
Speaker Changes: Jay Imes said very small. Are you referencing my quote
that I used? Jay Imes who's one of the world's experts on prematurity
and shared with the group at the Institute of Medicine report on the
approach to prematurity has come out--even though he didn't say it at
the time--has come out in 2010 now four years later and said,
&quot;There's a very real association although it appears to be small
but very real, between abortion and prematurity.
Speaker Changes: Senator Robinson?
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to send forth an
amendment.
Speaker Changes: Member may send forth the amendment. Sergeant ?? will
distribute copies. [pause] Senator Robinson is recognized to explain the
amendment.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Mr. Chair. As you can see the amendment
moves to amend the bill on page 1, line 31 by rewriting the line to
read, simply, &quot;Teaches about preventable causes of preterm birth,
which would exclude the part about induced abortion.&quot; Just to
explain that. I think what we've done, we've heard from experts on both
sides of the aisle. And as any researcher knows, and I assume some of
you are researchers, that you have multiple studies to validate your
research. And you can continue to do that. You can prove, you can
disprove, etc. What we've heard are things on both sides. I would say,
and I've read about the ?? study, etc and what they said. Because they
don't really have information to validate that the multiple preterm
deliveries were causes of later problems or abortions. But I would say
on the side of real people that I know for a fact in North Carolina
infant mortality among low-income women--and I've heard somebody talk
about minority and low income women--has decreased. North Carolina is
one of the few states where it has and it's not because of teaching
about preterm birth later leading to later abortion or whatever that is
all that stuff you wanna talk about. But it's because of preventive
health measures that are taught to women 15 to 44 in terms of your
sexuality and your health. Now, what we want to do here is include
another piece  and legislation about what ought to be taught in schools
by people who are not professionally educated to talk about abortion
preterm delivery. As opposed to teaching what health educators are able
to teach about sexually transmitted disease. If we teach kids about
prevention, about the use of condoms, that it can not only prevent, has
a high probability of preventing pregnancy, but it prevents sexually
transmitted diseases like Gonorrhea, like Syphilis, like HIV and AIDS.
If we would teach proper education we'd have a better chance of
education our teens about these issues. We also heard one of the
presenters say that most of those pregnancies had not occurred in women
who were teens but older women. So that's the population I think that
the doctor has an obligation to talk to their patients about. So my
amendment here is to take that language out of here and if your intent
is real, if your intent is real,  in terms of properly educating our
young people, then you won't object to this amendment.
Speaker Changes: Thank you. Senator Barefoot. And we will leave
individuals intent to individuals. Thank you.</p>

I actually don't think that the amendment is a bad amendment. The
amendment says teaches about the preventable causes of pre-term birth
and the bill says the exact same thing. It just says that they must
include induced abortion as one of the causes. I would like to correct a
few things. I passed out to the members of the committee and this speaks
directly to the amendment and some of Sen. Robinson's remarks.
John Thorpe is a medical doctor at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. He's also Holden's cousin. He is the professor of Maternal
and Child Health at the School of Public Health. He's the Division
Director for Women's Primary Health Care, the Vice Chair for Research
for the UNC Department of OB-GYN. He sits on the editorial board for
Obstetrics and Gynecological Survey. He sits on the editorial board for
the British Journal of OB-GYN.
He says in his letter, which you have, which does supports what Dr.
McCaffrey stated. His last sentences says that given the fact that
termination of pregnancy is one of the few modifiable risks --modifiable
means that you can do something about it--risk factors for pre-term
birth. The high number of women who have termination of pregnancy at
some point in their lives and these women's almost universal desire to
bare children in subsequent pregnancy. It is scientifically accurate and
appropriate to educate young men and women about this modifiable
consequence of termination of pregnancy.
I would say that the nice woman who spoke against the bill; she
indicated that the percentage of induced abortions that happens between
women that are teenagers was 9%. What she did not include in that
statistics is that 18 and 19-year olds are also teenagers and 18 and
19-year olds, as she stated, represent 69% of the women who obtain
abortion.
While your amendment does not go against the Child Fatality Task Force
intent of educating young women on the preventable causes of  pre-term
birth, the bill is a little bit stronger and I'd ask you to vote against
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I will recognize Senator Robinson. I will ask all committee
members to be aware of the time. We will conclude this discussion in
four minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since Senator Barefoot is referencing my
amendment, let me say there clearly that if you want to include
abortion, you need to list everything else. Everything else. Unless you
want to put a period there. The other thing you need to recognize, too,
as we talk about those experts that you reference, I have my own too.
There are experts all over the country and you need to recognize that.
You heard another one and you can hear many more from CDC etcetera. I
have extensive information from CDC, as a matter of fact, I provide some
of this information in terms of health prevention. So, the information
is out there. We can use whatever we want to justify why we want to do
these things. I think that we need to make sure the health experts, the
teachers, teach what they are able to teach and educated to teach; and
not go into other areas that they are not professionally educated to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, then Senator Davis, then we'll cut off.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Very quickly. Can I ask the bill sponsor a
question, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If this bill is passed will it stop -- excuse me -- the amendment is
passed and we move forward with this, will that prevent the ability of
people to teach about syphilis, gonorrhea, condoms, etcetera that
Senator Robinson had discussed. If we move forward and remove all of
this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, and thank you for the question. First of all, I'd like to ask the
committee to vote against the amendment. It is a recommendation of the
Child Fatality Task Force and to specifically address your question if
you look in sub-paragraph “K”, I think that answers your question in
current law that they already teach about preventing sexually
transmitted diseases including HIV, AIDS and other communicable
diseases.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a problem with this section “I” there
and the cause of pre-term birth. I'm not acquainted with all the
literature, but it appears as though induced abortions could be a risk
factor, but that's different from being a cause.</p>

the underlining bill I have a question, we just voted on [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Stein mark 30 seconds. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. So
Bill Sponsor, do you agree that there are a number of risk factors that
cause preventable pre term birth?[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would defer to the
expert but I think that he indicated that there are more than one cause
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes even your expert did that. So are you amendable to
an amendment that would add the top five risk factors?[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that's an amendment that I'm willing to consider. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you senator ??. The clerk moves for the approval of the
bill as amended by the post committee substitute not amended unfavorable
