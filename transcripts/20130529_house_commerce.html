<p id="00:00">
Good Morning, Welcome to the Wednesday May 29th meeting of the House of
Commerce and  Job Development Committee, My name is Sam Mery, I'm the
Chairman of the Committee.  Let me introduce our pages for the day. We
have, in page as when I'm saying your name you will stand up by Integre
Stalinsit Pitt County sponsored by speaker stils, Els Steven from Moore
Redolph County, our representative Samson,  Joshuva Wiggins from Layes
County, Sponsored by Johnbel and  Taylere Watson from Rodson county
sponsored by ?? We also have some sergen arms helping us today Fried
heins, Reddy Sines, Jon Brandin and Mike Clampton. It's my pleasure to
invite the Secretary of Commerce to presentation today on the Governor's
proposal to develop an economic development of Partnership,
public-private partnership for economic development of state in North
Carolina, and Secretary Shina Dekkard is here and so Secretary Dekkard,
I would welcome you here and I wanted to extend our condolences to your
family  and Secretary Dekkard's Father-in-Law passed away recently and
she has broken away from the family to spend some time with us, so I
appreciate your being with us and honor some what lighter note, if
you've got the business North Carolina Magazine in  your Mail Box
yesterday she is   officially issue you a cover girl  and so we, we are
appreciative of the cover girl sharing your time with us today we also
have some members of  the Governor's staff with us so, tell me our meter
is here.  He is a senior adviser to  Government of McCaury on jobs in
the economy and we also have  Senator Henry Brown with us who has made a
special invitation to Members of the Senate Commerce Committee to make
sure that you can hear the presentation as well.  So, thank you Senator
Brown for being with us today as well.  When we without further due
Madam Section 4.0.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Maury thank you for the opportunity to present
today.  I am excited about the opportunity to  share more of the
framework, for the partnership we have been talking about now for
several weeks, a lot of work has been done by an often lot of  good
folks around this issue  and again what I will share is a framework.
There is a great deal more work to be done.  House Bill 630  will be the
enabling legislation to create the Partnership and  what I wanna share
is  where we think this is  head and what we think it will begin to look
like.  Our focus is on economic growth in all 100 counties and some of
you have heard me speak and I say almost without exception that  a lot
has been made by my time and surely preparation for this role as
Secretary of Commerce but I think  what I needed to know most about this
job, I've learned living in Roor county, the last 12 years of my life.
And Roor county as many of your counties that has separate double digit
unemployment, now going on  9 years.  So, I come to this role without
perspective, that what we do in urban centres, is critically important
to the  success and health of North Carolina.  We are fortunate to have
the first   and fifth fastest growing urban centers in the country, in
our state and that's to our advantage.  But we can't broke those
communities and forget the rest of North Carolina.  We have the Nigelist
at 82 counties that have continued in deep unemployment for the last 9
years in the Negalist moving although we spend a lot of money and we've
done a lot of good work , the Negalsim is moving, so, it says to me that
we've got to do things differently. I think it was Einstein who said
doing things in the same way and expecting a different result is the
definition of insanity.  So we have to think about it differently and we
have to approach it in a new and fresh way and that's what I want to
propose you today.  I wanna remind you that Tony Armida, Governor's
Advisor on  Jobs in the Economy and I will be leading the Development of
a state-wide economic development plan and it's been a number of years
since we have had such a plan in place and that plan will drive the
activity and the work of this partnership.  So the framework you will
see must be married to that  strategic plan and that work will begin
with the help of our economic development of the Board over the next 90
days.  We are focussed on a comprehensive approach to economic
development, can I have this framework will explain how I propose that
should be done. I'm gonna share some boxes and charts and we are quick
to go and count heads and that's  not the intention of this but rather
to again give you a frame</p>

Organization structure. The slides you see in front of you is best
describes as a public side of the partnership. When we talk about a
public private partnership. It means that a portion of this is publicly
positions a portion is privately positioned.  This public portion of it
includes an operation and innovation support team. Just ?? tired Brian
Gossage to lead this team but I'm bring together what has been labor and
economic development. Economic analysis, community assistance where you
know is now where our community development block grants a house,
information technology. North Carolina broadband, the energy office and
science and technology to focus on the customer. These departments have
operated pretty independently. And what I'm asking Brian to do is focus
this entire team on the customer. Which in our case is the community, or
communities across the state. Businesses across the state. How did these
technologies support their growth and development. Employment services
as you know, now headed by Dell Fullwell will report to me within this
public division. Workforce solutions, we are moving aggressively on a
plan to reorganize and consolidate streamline and make more efficient
our workforce solutions initiatives. That process is in play you will be
seeing a whole lot more about that in the months to come. We are
proposing a creation of a consolidated area for grants. One of the
things I have learned from you as customers of commerce from consultants
from developers at a local area is that we have been slow to make
decisions and slow to move and we've gotta change that. So we are
talking about consolidating all of our grant making into one team, one
stop. So whether is CDBG, whether it is a grant for infrastructure.
Whether it is a jdigg or one with North Carolina. Theres one place to go
for that and a place that will move very quickly. We're also talking
about the development of a non profit collaboration fund. In both the
senate budget in conversations with those of you in the house. Theres a
lot of conversations about the non profit pass throughs that exist
today. In the governors budget each of these was cut and in the senate
budget these were ended. And in your budget I think you're talking about
how to manage through this. And a proposal that we would like to make is
a non profit fund. That would be a competitive fund if there is work the
state is not doing. But that the state feels they should support. Non
profits could come and seek a competitive grant on an annual basis. We
do think there is work to be done in the state by non profits that are
important to this economy. And work that is costly for the state to do
that is already in place for these non profits. So it gives a resource
and a way for these funds to be distributed. There also would be an
administrative team legal human resources public affairs. Fiscal
management as you know it today. But this would be the public side of
commerce. Then there would be a new non profit forum, the North Carolina
Development partnership. And the legislation that is before you or will
soon be before you, bill 630 would describe this and let me just walk
through how it would be form. It would be an over signt committee. Which
would provide the public over sight for the new partnership. This
committee would be chaired by the secretary of commerce, and would
include the secretary of revenue, the state budget director, the
secretary of DOT the secretary of Deener. And there also would be an
appointee of the house and senate. And this committee would oversee this
partnership and be responsible for the creation of a contract with this
partnership for the performance of job creation and economic development
for the state. There will be a board appointed by the governor. 8
members appointed by the governor plus a chair. Would also include two
appointees of the house and two of the senate asking each of the
chambers to appoint one from a rural city and one from an urban center.
We would also have an appointee that we would seek from the state
chamber and also one from the north Carolina federation of independent
businesses. And this board would replace what we now know as the
economic development board. Smaller, more engaged in the operation and
over sight of the partnership itself. That board would hire a CEO for
the new partnership. There also would be a fund raising arm of this
partnership. That would raise private funds to leverage public dollars
and grow the total the total sum of economic development statewide.
We're already in conversations with a number of private potential
investors with a lot of excitement on their part ..</p>

for marketing and tourism, it will come under this umbrella of branding
for the state, so that there is one voice, one message, one north
carolina. Rather we're recruiting businesses here, rather we're seeking
tourism here, it will be a constancy of message targeted to each of
those markets. The objective; speed of movement, reduced cost. We
anticipate that we can do this initially in year one at about 5 percent
less than the previous commerce budget, we will reduce that to 10
percent and continue to grow the reduction in resources while improving
our effectiveness, as we work together to find the ways to do that.
There is not an easy answer to this, its not do it one way and then one
day you start a new way. There's got to be a plan for migration and
transition, to a new vision for state commerce, and we recognize that we
have to do that in partnership with all of those entities involved in
economic development. I think this really came home for me recently when
I got a call from a consultant that recruits business to north Carolina.
He was upset that we had not aggreed to get the Jdig to a business that
he was recruiting to the state. It simply was not a good project for
JDig, it did not meet the criteria, it did not pass the economic model
and so we had said that Jdig would not be avialably. He called me and he
said &quot;I don't know why the state of north Carolina won't help me,
I'm getting money from golden leaf, I'm getting money from the rural
center, I'm getting money from the Biotech Center and Im not getting
anything from the state of North Carolina, and I hope you understand the
Irony of that, but it illustrated for me the challenge that we face. So
many good people doing good work, but we are seen as independant
entities not as the state of north Carolina, and folks if rural North
Carolina and Biotechnology and advanced manufactoring and trism, all of
these thijngs are important to the state of north carolina, we need to
be doing it as the state of North Carolina, and we need focused together
all under one umbrella. I have absolute confidence that with my partners
in each of these groups rather it be the regional partnerships,  rather
it be the biotech center, rather it be the rural center, we can figure
out the ways to do this collectively and to do it more effectively, and
I trust that and have confidence in our ability to figure that out. This
is the framework we'd like tok move forward in, to make that happen and
it aligns with the governers budget, and it allows for a progressive
move to a new organization. It won't happen over nightm, this will be a
process over about the next 12 to 18 months. I'm going to close with
those comments and just open it up for conversation if I may and answer
any questions that come.
[speaker changes]
excellent, members I wanted to point out at your desk you have a bullet
point letter, talking points on the high points of what the secretary
just presented, for some additional light reading. During the transition
there is a white paper put together by blenny ching and tony alemeda, on
the governers staff, about public private partnership concept for
commerce and how other states have done it and look at the models that
are in other states and so thats what constitutes this white paper. This
is from december 2012 and these bullet points were just distributed for
you guys yesterday and the power point presentation will be made
available to you after the presentation and with that representative
fisher your recognized
[speaker changes]
thank you mr chairman, and thank you secretary for being with us today.
I'm intrigued by your new approach and I'm wondering if you would talk a
little bit more about the zones. I am particular concerned being from
bungnum county. We have an entity called advantage west, I'm sure your
familiar with, and my concern is that we have a lot fo really good
things going that we could probably ship to other parts of the state,
but if we're doing a good job, why should we have to reinvent them? As
zones are concerned I would like to know more.
[speaker changes]
Very familiar with advantage west, I use to serve on their board and
scott and I have been in a lot of conversations about the work they are
doing in the western part of North Carolina. A lot of good thing
happening. We continue to have in Western North Carolina, a lot of
counties my county as an example still in double digit unemployment, I
think the issue is what do we do? What do we change that begins to move
that needle? Lets don't stop doing those things that are effective and
are working well, but where do there need to be new initiatives. One of
the concepts is the leadership of those zones, each of them would have a
specialty in an area of expertise</p>

<p id="40:00">
Good answer, follow quick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I disagree followed. Thank you so much for that
response. It definitively makes me feel better about the reorganization.
But just one thing that I just ask in regard to the rule here is, that I
have as a representative is that one thing that concerns me is the
aspect of the role of incentives. And what we're doing is that I have to
make a vote, either yes or no. If I'm voting for incentives, I'm voting
to take money for the purpose of the role of Government, that is ?? on
the backs of individuals through taxation, and I'm directly giving that
to private business by way of an incentive. And to me, it concerns me
greatly that we would make a decision of that, regardless of aspect of
infrastructure that may, we can argue, that helps all, but that a direct
transfer of private, or public dollars to a private individual is
something that definitely, it makes me very nervous, as the individual
has to vote red or green.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yeah. I hear ya. And I think one of the things that I
hope you'll feel good, in North Carolina, as we keep some tools
available to us for recruitment and business growth, is that in North
Carolina, we do not give grants to private business to cash grants. All
grants are given based on job creation. It's very different than a lot
of our competitors do.  And I don't suggest we get into the business in
that way. But we have a very high accountability for those dollars and
how they perform. The jobs are not created, the money isn't paid out.
And I feel very good about the process, the follow up around that. I do
think that in today's competitive environment, that we are taken off the
list if we don't have the tools in our quiver. We don't always have to
use incentives. And that's a new thing for us to learn. That North
Carolina is a very attractive place. As one individual said to me last
week, Sharon, it used to be that North Carolina had to put the best deal
on the table to get a business to come to your state. And you see,
you've earned the right not to have to do that. But you still have to be
able to play in the game. And so I think we've got to be wise investors
and very careful. I hear what you're saying. I'm respectful of, though
we have a difference of opinion on that. But what I think you can be
assured of is a high level of accountability on our part to use well the
tools that we have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Transparency is key when it comes to this. And I think
that's one of the points that Secretary Decker was making is, when you
keep some of the things on the public side of the House, is the key
point of transparency. And you'll see that as a theme in the white
paper. And another illustrative example of some of the problems that
we've got. This is the March 23, 2013 report from the Fiscal Research
Division on the economic development inventory that we have in the state
of North Carolina. This is an 80 page document, and it contains all the
funds and lists of all the various things that the state of North
Carolina's involved with. And it's available for you to peruse in the
Legislative Library if you would like to look and see all the varied and
overlapping, nontransparent, in some cases, funds that we have with no
contractual relationship with the state of North Carolina, and no
deliverables. And it's all right here prepared by our Fiscal Research
Division. With that, Representative Larry Bell, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman,?? This past week, I've met
with some members of the Chamber of Commerce in my town and county. And
we had a member there from the South Eastern region of the Economic
Development Board. And my understanding is that they were negotiating
with a couple of industries who plan to locate in that area. And I've
asked and I'm sure of the top associates there about trying to, to ??
find out if what you're doing, the reorganization may negatively impact
what they're doing right now. Or would you help them with that as far as
getting the negotiation done withing the next 12 months?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Absolutely. It shouldn't interfere. It would be our
intention not for it to. That's the reason for a transition. There are
relationships with companies that we need to maintain, and if we're not
to maintain them, to pass them off to someone else that would be in that
territory moving forward.  But we need to be careful about that. And
again, that's why I think this planning has to be done at a community
and zone level so that we are dealing with it project by project and
relationship by relationship. So that underscores the reason,
Representative Bell, for a transition process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Tine, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Nice to see you again, Madam
Secretary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you for being here and giving your presentation.
As you and I have spoken before, we both agree that there need to be
some changes here. And I like some of your ideas of your plan, and I
also like that you recognize that there's additional planning at the
local level that's necessary.  But timing sometimes can be as critical
an element as any</p>

…and the Senate budget and some of the bills that are out there right
now creates the undoing of some of these partner organizations July 1st.
My question to you is, “Is the Department ready to absorb all the
missions of these different organizations that have projects in the
pipeline or do you perhaps need some more time to complete your planning
process?”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We need some runway. I think the Governor’s Budget provided for that.
There was a transition kind of process, reduction in funding, but it
allowed us some runway space to do the planning. So I would just
underscore what I said earlier that that I think is necessary so that we
can get in at a zone level and kind of make the plan for how we move
forward in that geography.
That will take us a few months to do that. I think a large portion of
this can be transitioned January 1. I think the bulk of it by next year,
end of the fiscal year, I really do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitmire, you’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Secretary Decker, I appreciate your words. I have three counties, two of
which are very small rural counties, Transylvania and Polk. Henderson
County while it’s much larger in and of itself compared to many others
around the state is not that much bigger.
So, with several key entities that others have already mentioned,
Representative Fisher mentioned Vantage West, Golden LEAF sort of falls
in there but maybe not in this context, the Rural Center, and Biotech
and what have you, my question is this.
You have touched on it quite a bit, but could you speak, please
elaborate a little bit more on as you sort of roll these under one hat
the responsiveness and also how the smaller counties which in that far
west block that I saw on the map there are a lot of them…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yep.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
…how we don’t get lost in the shuffle? Because we don’t have a lot of
voices.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the key there, responsiveness is that we have to move at the
speed of business. We’ve got to be quick and responsive. That has more
to do with process more than anything and right now we don’t have firm
processes.
Today in state government, and in any of these economic relationships
it’s about who you know that can get it done faster not a process that
consistently makes it happen quickly. So, we’ve got to redefine all that
like you’ve done in your businesses and would do in your businesses. I
think that’s very doable.
Secondly I think the key to being more supportive of the small
communities statewide is that we do our planning in a smaller geography
and real-clear focus. You’re talking about home, so let me use home as
an example.
If you look at Polk, Rutherford, McDowell, even Burke County, we look
very different than Buncombe, even Henderson. There’s a difference
there. I say, “In Rutherford County, we’ll never attach to Asheville
because there’s a big mountain between us,” just the sheer geography
makes attachment there to that urban center very difficult.
We can’t attach to Charlotte because Shelby needs a bypass, right? So,
until there is some focus on Rutherford and Polk counties that develops
a large enough economic engine there for them to change we’re not going
to see a lot of change.
I see within that zone a microcosm, looking at those counties that are
sitting in the foothills and saying, “You know the foothills look a
little different than the other counties in this zone, so what do we
have to do uniquely here? Is it a four-lane to Spartanburg and a
corridor further east in Rutherford County? Is it about developing the
74 Corridor so that you really are equipped to cross Rutherford and Polk
counties to attract business there and if so what kind of business do we
want and how do we go proactively out there to get them?”
Not wait for them to come find us but go get them. What is it that we
can attract…Get the idea? It means planning at a microcosmic level and
doing that in great detail with state support to do that.
Today each county kind of operates on its own. Some of you get great
support from your regions and you do that planning from a regional basis
as well. But I think it’s got to be done in a different way, in a
different approach knowing that one size doesn’t fit all. Your geography
is a perfect example of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does that help?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tolson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Secretary Decker, how are you this morning?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good, thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me just lay out a scenario and you use your vision of this new
process to tell me. I have a company in another state and I want to
expand. I am looking at several states, North Carolina being one of
them. I call your office and tell you of my interest. Through your
vision of this new process, walk me through how you would try to recruit
me to North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’d answer the call quickly, with a live person. That is…</p>

<p id="50:00">
knowledgeable and able to respond to them with general information. Then
we would go through that process we do today, which is gaining
information about what they’re looking for, what are their priorities,
then getting them in touch with these folks that are in zone positions
across the state, probably the specialist that’s out there in their
particular area of expertise, be that biotechnology, be that advanced
manufacturing, whatever the technology specialization is, and then
identifying the sites across North Carolina that are probable sites for
that plant to relocate. We would then take them to see all of those
sites across North Carolina so that we’re not competing site-to-site but
looking at what’s available across the state. I would quickly add,
Representative Tolson, that I see that scenario as less what would be
happening in North Carolina, and more of what we want to be happening is
that in your community we have identified the businesses that could be
most successful there, and the folks that are located in that zone and
the folks with support from the state office are proactively going to
recruit those businesses into North Carolina. That’s the way to get what
we need in this state. Reaction is important and it needs to be fast and
on the money, but we also need to be doing a lot more of that
proactively. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] How would what now exists as my regional
partnership fit into that process? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t see a
state-supported regional partnership. You might choose locally; private
investors might choose to stay engaged in the process and fund the local
partnership. I understand that. I understand that may happen. We would
work with them as partners with a memorandum of understanding what role
do they want to play in economic development. Some will want to do
marketing, some will want to do recruiting, some want to focus on
existing business; each has a little different view and we would work
with each to develop a plan for how we’d work together. I see that
happening. Today there are committees of 100, there are partnerships of
a variety of type that are privately funded, and many of those would
continue to exist. My hope would be that over the course of the next
several years we would find there’s less and less need for independent
parties, but there’s an opportunity to get together in one plan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I indicate to you when I make that initial call that I
like the rural area, I want to go to the eastern part of the state…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We’d come east. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Tell me how you
would initiate… [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’d bring them to the east. You got
to listen to the customer, and the customer knows what they’re looking
for and what’s best for them, so we’re going to listen to what their
needs are and we’re going to take them where they want to go. I just had
an amazing customer service experience buying a new car, and I’ve never
had anybody listen to me like that guy listened to me. The process was
easy, painless and quick because he knew exactly what I was looking for
before I knew it, and it was a matter of listening. We’ve got to be
really good at that, so if the client wants to be in a rural area in
eastern North Carolina, we’re going to help them get there. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Cunningham, you’re recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Secretary ??. Thank you for being here. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] She’s over to the left here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You can’t hear
the direction in this room. It’s crazy. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry. In
the packet there are six models presented. Have you all determined which
model you will be implementing, or closest to? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
state of Indiana is probably the closest to our model. It is a wholesale
model where we’re moving all of tourism, small business development,
much as they did, all of that into the partnership. We’ve thought
through that very, very carefully and the decision was really based on
the need for speed and nimbleness, also based on taking a comprehensive
approach and trying to get all out sales and marketing for the state in
one team, so we’ve chosen the wholesale approach and Indiana is the best
model of that. They’ve learned a lot that we can learn from, so part of
the reason to take these next few months so we can iron out the details
with your help and the help of local folks is trying to avoid some of
the pitfalls that they’ve experienced. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized for a second question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. With education declining in the state and you want
to attract the top talent and the top companies, and most people that
come with these companies are well-educated and they want their children
to be in well-educated environments, how are we supposed to tackle that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wish I had that answer but it’s a critical one. If
you look by county at unemployment, it’s higher where education rates
are lower and so we know it’s a major indicator of economic health. I
say as I am sharing with folks our platform for economic growth in North
Carolina that it’s about health for all North Carolinians, that everyone
needs access to healthcare and the ability and option to live a healthy
life. That means quality of air and water, it means farm-to-table
initiatives, it means living communities</p>

We can live and walk and stay active means access to health care. Then I
say it’s about education. And it starts from cradle to grave.  And it
continues. Most of us thought would be retired by age by this time but
we are not for a lot of different reasons. But education has to
continue. Job retraining has to continue. So our focus on Prek through
High school our community colleges and universities that partnership is
critical. Met recently with the economic development specialist in our
University They were meeting together with Lesley Bonney And talked to
them on How do we bring together a closer relationship. With what effect
going on leveraging the resources in our university. Next is economic
development. So far from infrastructure to recruiting businesses to
growing existing business, development of small businesses, arts,
tourism and culture  critical to the success of North Carolina,Quality
of life and environment . So Education is one of those top 5. We got to
be focussed on that. It has been a competitive advantage for North
Carolina. We got be sure we don’t lose that. Very Very Important. Our
relation with the community colleges particularly is critical. As I talk
with companies about what has been the most important determinant of
your coming to North Carolina, Community colleges come up over and over
again. Our customized training with Spired Aviation last week. We  had a
wonderful opportunity to be in their composites lab and their composites
training spoke to a group  of their  students to see what they have been
able to do from a education standpoint to equip folks for jobs their its
pretty amazing. And that story is being told all over North Carolina.
Very Very Important.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Staines, you are recognized
[Speaker Changes] gold and Lafer rule senate
[Speaker Changes] Will they continue to receive applications and award
grants in an autonomous manner or will their grants be co-ordinated
through the economic development partnership.
[Speaker Changes] My intention would be that ultimately they are
co-ordinated  through this partnership. I think we have to got to have a
plan to work together to get to that place because they move a lot
faster than we do today. I want to learn how to move that fast. And the
processes we need to have need to be that quick and nimble. But not just
based on it used to be a process.Whatever the grant requests us. CDBG be
it JDig be it infrastructure   grants all of those need to be faster and
consistent. That’s very important  with great accountability with where
they go and How they go . So I think initially there would be a
Memorandum of Understanding . There would be some continued grass making
by each of these entities. But I am going to very clear with you. My
objective would be that ultimately all that comes together under one
Umbrella. But I think we need a plan to get to that place.
[Speaker Changes] And the letter that you gave it to us , it says, you
are looking for an organization it can leverage profit funds with
public dollars. So primarily the public dollars   would be those that
are allocated  through the Gold and Leaf sending so-forth or you are
looking for an additional corporation.
[Speaker Changes] I would think based on the Governors Budget, I would
think we, our intention would be that sooem of thos edolars that are
rediuced from orther entities could help to fund this. Already the
department of commerce is funded. So some of those dollars would be set
in reserve for the funding of partbership  as opposed to the exisiting
department of commerce. So I think it’s bringing together exisiting
funds and these are not net new dollars. The objective is to begin to
reduce the total expense of economic development in the state and that’s
one of the objectives of doing this. So there are net new dollars in
this proposal. Irs reallocation of those dollars and repositioning of
thoise dollars. What we have been new to this is the raising of private
funds in a signigcant way to match those dollars in support of the new
organization. So it would not be a request for net new public funds.
Just re-allocation

Northeast partnership in my region. All economic developers are not
successful. Some of the rural counties have problems keeping economic
developers in their county. They come and go. The life expectancy in, of
economic developers is ten years, give or take in a community. So take
that in consideration. Each partnership has a board and they have people
that are distance leaders, people that are involved in the communities,
that go and take time to go to meetings and be involved. Most counties
have economic development boards. And there are counties that have a
county commissioner involved. When you go to the zones, please make sure
that you involve the municipalities, and I'm sure you involve the county
commissioner of course, educational people. But again, my request to you
is slow down. I know we can't slow down two or three years, but I know
we can't implement plans in thirty, sixty days, but I believe in
thinking out of the box. I look forward to working with you, because
again, working together works, and having all the partners at the table.
But when you send people in these regions, send the right people. Don't
send people there to, for lip service, and then do separately. No
respect to DOT, we're fighting the I-95 toll lane. And they have outside
consultants to come in to our local community colleges and we have our
DOT people standing over to the side, and then we have the people
outside doing the presentations. So please, don't rush in and rush out.
I know you can't go stay two or three days, but give the people adequate
time and adequate conversation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks for that, and I think a basic tenant of how I like to work is
that the plan will be, the local folks are the ones who've got to own
and develop that plan. We can provide great support and guidance in that
process, but we've got to own it and, and be engaged in it locally. So
it's important.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Mister Chair. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One of our issues like in our rural communities are our local counties
which are our local taxpayers. Normally, when economic development
projects are engaged, we purchased a property. Our county does. So we
have a stake hold, and the people have a stake hold in the community so,
again, you know, take that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Makes a difference.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It does, because we are, we are the ones, our county manager, our local
public works in the rural communities, across to urban also, they have
to apply for the infrastructure, all the process so. Again, working
together works.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Kelly Alexander, you are recognized. He's to your right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman, madam Secretary. I just wanted to, well first
I want to compliment you on the presentation of the plan, but there are
a couple of things that I want to make sure that as this is developed
are taken into consideration. First, the zone map that you presented, if
you take that map and you overlap the fifteen most populous counties,
which collectively presents something like fifty five to sixty percent
of the state's population, there's kind of a disconnect between those
zones and the location of those counties. First thing I seriously want
you to think about. Secondly, over in some other departments, they're
discussing projects that would have an impact on the desirability of
some of the zones. In my area for instance, the development of the
Monroe Bypass and the Garden State Parkway would open up territory and
open up that territory to a different kind of economic development, and,
which would play successfully with the greater development of the zones
and actually would help to link some of our existing population and
economic centers. As we look at some of the other infrastructure things
that are there, for instance, the Charlotte-Douglass International
Airport and the Intermodal facility that's being developed there, which
sits right in the middle of a couple of your zones, and if you think
about the, the parkway and the, some of the other development, it all
works in a holistic</p>

approach to broaden economic development. I think that’s the way we’ve
got to think, but the other thing is we also have to consider certain
limitations. One of the limitations is the availability of water as a
resource. The Catawba River basin, the Yadkin basin have some
limitations. They have… ultimately you’ve got competition between
industrial uses for water and people uses for water. I think that has to
be taken into consideration, especially as you move from west to east
because the availability of the resource changes, the how it can be
accessed and used changes, and that has an implication too on the type
of development that makes sense in particular regions. So these are
things that I don’t believe we can do in isolation. All of this needs to
be taken into consideration, and especially in those 15 most populous
counties, some of which are considered to be having a very good economic
development at the moment, but you can find pockets inside of them that
are not, so we also have to be able to find ways to stimulate growth in
those pockets as well as to stimulate growth in the broader regions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Agreed. You’re right on it, and that’s the challenge
of this is that we are one North Carolina, so although we’ll have new
zones, we’ve got to be able to… I think of those as planning zones. I
think of those as a way to kind of get our arms around a manageable
geography with priority, but those lines, just like state lines to me,
are irrelevant when it comes to economic development because when you
cross the state line, you might see the sign but the world doesn’t
change, right? So those economies work together, so it’s a guidance but
it shouldn’t be a constrict, and so we’ve got to think through that, and
particularly as it comes to natural resource planning, those lines will
be helpful in getting our arms around manageable geographies, but we
can’t let those lines be barriers to our planning across them. You give
two great examples with access to the south of Mecklenburg County and
Gaston County. You give a great example with the bypass around Monroe.
Those are corridors that would change the economic planning around those
roads, and so we’ve got to be open-minded, we’ve got to think out of the
box and think as one North Carolina because we’re all connected. It’s a
big state but we’re all connected, and so lines for me are guidance for
planning purposes. I think marketing looks very different when we do it
today, and that’s a whole different conversation. I don’t see us
marketing necessarily by those zones. We’re going to market the state of
North Carolina, but within a zone we will market geographies. Might by
urban centers, might be rural areas where there are particular
activities that are event-driven. I think we’re going to have to
approach marketing very differently than we’ve been doing it, and it
doesn’t have lines round it in my mind. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Floyd, you’re recognized. He’s to your left by Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chairman. I just have some… This is a
statement and then you can respond to it, and it’s also a question, and
I understand at the beginning of the presentation you’re talking about
speedup, you’re talking about reducing costs, and I’m glad that you left
the map up. If you would look to your right on the map – I mean my
right; I guess it would be your left – if you look at that part of North
Carolina, that is indeed the poorest part of our state, and to me, each
time that I see that I see the lost colony, meaning the lost counties
that the state, maybe the Department of Commerce has just simply
overlooked over a period of time, and whether or not that can be
eradicated, whatever, but in the eastern part of North Carolina we have…
we’re mostly a tourist, travel and service area. That’s what we are, and
beyond that we have two military installations; we have Camp Lejeune and
we have Fort Bragg. Those are our largest, and then too we are blessed
by the coast, so what kind of branding can we do for that part of I-95?
I heard you all talking about the Parkway, some part of the state over
that way. You mentioned that, but as my colleague</p>

…he had mentioned. We have I95, which is moving north and south there.
Now, that to me could be a trucking industry paradise to move goods and
services to the market. And then we have the transit park, which could
be like UPS or Federal Express. Where they send everything in Chicago
and overnight and it’s back to us. Park could be considered as that.
The other thing we’re talking about when we start talking about
infrastructure, and we’re talking about years, we’re talking about a $60
billion worth of infrastructure across this state. We’re talking about
in 30 years. So we’re talking about 30 years planning because those ways
and all of that, it may not get built during my lifetime, and I’m biting
my teeth. So do we look at economic development within the 10 years?
And then too, the last thing is that when we’re talking about
public/private partnership and funding, one thing that these
partnerships need is not to worry every year whether or not their
public/private partnership that they enter into will be only contingent
in funding basis in order to attract that kind of partnership that is
needed.
This is my last and you can respond. When we look at I95 corridor, we
see Wal-Mart Distribution Center which is in Fayetteville, which has
about 495 trucks, 437 trucks a day. We see Food Lion, they’re in Dunn.
Which has numerous trucks that come in per day.
There is a commitment there, but it had to be more of a commitment, as
my colleague mentioned. What I see in public hearings is that we are
being talked down to as it relates to economic development and economic
growth. If there’s truly to be a partnership, to be all of us talking
together.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. Absolutely. It is all of us together.
That’s the only way this can change and this can work. And it’s a
process. If this were easy, it would have already been done, right?
So I think it takes a lot better planning and it takes planning at a
community level, and in a smaller geography level in great detail to
deal with issues of infrastructure. To deal with issues of job
recruitment. To deal with issue of existing business growth. It’s not
one dimension. There are many dimensions to this.
Eastern North Carolina is a huge part of this state. And it ought to be
a priority for us, those rural counties. And you’ve had counties as you
said, the poorest counties in the state. And that’s unacceptable. I
don’t know all the answers, but I know I’m committed to help us find it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ve got the secretary for 10 more minutes.
Representative Floyd you’re recognized for a second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. But when we look at it and we talk about,
one thing that needs to come out of commerce is customer service.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is the key. Even I at my age, when you tell me
that I’ve got to call in and I’ve got to get through 4 or 5 prompts. You
know, I’m aging. So we have to do better than what we have been doing.
And when we look at the I95 corridor, that’s 10 percent of the state
population that is totally forgotten when it comes to economic
development.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, you’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She’s right in front of you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you Madame Secretary
for your indulgence and your time today. But for your vision for
economic growth and development in North Carolina, and a new plan as we
move forward. Or maybe, not a new plan, but taking what we have in place
and broadening that to a new level.
I do applaud you in the efforts to include in broadening your scope of
your view through adding the Sport’s Management film, traveling tourism,
but don’t forget the arts. Because they’re an important part. I always
have to get that in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I hear you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanted to just maybe ask a couple of questions
briefly, and I’m very appreciative of your time today. There’s some
assumptions that are out there about the partnerships, and when they
will cease. It’s either to be June of this year, December 31st of this
year, or June of 2014. And I know that in the Senate Bill it’s June of
’13. You are talking a vison, or a plan rather, of a year to 18 months.
For the certainty as we move forward…</p>

...lead time as you possibly can before we have to close down. That's
the North Carolina eastern region, because we have people with
contracts, we have personnel, we have other building. There's several
things that we need to walk through and it may take six to nine months
to make all that happen. Thank you and thank you for coming to Sharon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. This is not a painless process. It's easy
for us to talk about it in this room. It's very hard to do. This is
going to be very complex, very complicated, very challenging, but I
think you're right, together we can make it happen as we all come to the
table. After the same end, which is net job growth for North Carolina.
We've been in declining job growth now for nine years. It's not
acceptable. And that's exactly what we're trying to change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeff Collins, you're recognized. Right
in front of you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Secretary Decker, comments today. I look forward to
working with you and implementing those in my area. I thought I
understood everything you said today until Representative Bumgardner's
question about incentives and again, I've only been here a couple years
so I may be misinformed. I was always under the impression from what I
had read that our incentives were primarily a tax exemption that could
be recouped over a number of years if you met certain goals and so
forth. So I was confused. If we could get away from having a corporate
income tax, would our incentives change or our current incentives more
than just an exemption from corporate income tax?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What our competitors do with income tax rates set
zero, is they have cash incentives that are based on performance but
not, on job creation, but not tied to any tax credit. It's cash in
return for that job creation. I'm not suggesting we go there. But that
is what they're doing. The theory that if you get to zero, you don't
have to have any other incentives is not playing out in the market place
today. That's what I was responding to in his question. You're exactly
right, they are not tax incentives, but they are cash incentives that
are used in their place, in addition to the zero based rates. I don't
know, Tony, would you add anything to that? But that's the reality we're
facing today, Representative Collins. I mean, that's the facts of what's
happening in the market place today. So, that's just what we're dealing
with. I feel better about a competitive tax rate and incentives that are
performance based only. I think puts us in the best competitive position
for the long haul. I think it's manageable and doable, but the thinking,
and it's logical, that you can do away with them when you get to zero,
all incentives when you get zero, just isn't what's happening today.
It's just the facts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But we would be in a better situation than we are
today if we had no corporate income tax when all we're doing with our
current incentives is giving a partial exemption from income taxes. It
has to be paid by to only some corporations. It would have to be better
than what we've got now, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I hear you. I don't know that it's better. It's
different. I think the question is what makes us more competitive? Our
competitors, who have taken it to zero still still this need to do
something in addition to that. That concerns me. So you take it down to
zero and still throw in money at it. That's a zero sum game that we
don't win. It's a complex set of issues and there is, I mean, it's just
extremely competitive. I just wanted to speak to the question that if we
go to zero we can do away with them, I don't think so. Film is a good
example. The question we have to ask ourselves is do we want the film
industry to grow in North Carolina? And if we do, there have to be some
competitive incentives. That's the way the business comes to the State.
We just have to make a call. What are we after and what's the priority
for us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up to that. I would say that for the film
industry in particular, as well as any other, we want that industry to
grow as long as it actually is a net contributor to the State of North
Carolina's economy and not a net detractor from it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's right. We want the economy growing. GDP and
jobs, for sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Secretary, you've been very generous with your
time. I know you've got to get back on a plane to be with your family.
We spend a lot of time having a conversation about incentives, but in
the economic development world, that's the one percent. Most of the deal
is done, 99% of the deal gets done before we even have a conversation
about incentives. I think you're coming up with a transparent, very
public process to how we do economic development in North Carolina and I
would ask every member to research the white paper. Look at the letter
that Secretary Decker sent with the white paper and look at the economic
development inventory in the library. You will see, will clearly see the
problem and the solution that we're trying to achieve. Madam Secretary,
with that, thank you for your attendance and this meeting...</p>
