<p id="000:00">
Good morning everybody. If members would take their seats, and audience
would take their seats, we'd appreciate it.
Please take your seats.
This thing ain't working. Hello? can y'all hear this?
Kessler? can you hear this? Okay.
Thank y'all for taking your seats.
This morning we're going to have a lively discussion, I'm sure. Let me
first introduce the pages: We have Zack Mayer, representing- sponsored
by Tommy Tucker. Joseph Womble, sponsored by Sen. Jackson.  Gabby
Huberts sponsored by Sen. Tucker. Alexis Johnson-Mobley, sponsored by
Sen. Blue. Ryan Burnett, sponsored by me. Weston Davis, sponsored by me.
Thank y'all pages for your service.
Our Sergeant at arms this morning are Ed Kessler, Canton Lewis, Isaac
Walker, and Billy Fritcher.
The purpose of this meeting this morning is to try to resolve the large
differences between medicaid estimates from OSBM, and the estimates of
the legislative fiscal staff. The inability to agree on a concensus
estimate for the medicaid shortfall for 2013-14 and the rebates number
for 2014-15, has kept us from being able to finalize the 2014-2015
budget. Our goal is to avoid the very large underestimation of medicaid
costs that we have seen over the last several years. This morning, Art
Pope, the budget director, is going to tell the committee of how his
office arrived at their estimates, and then the legislative fiscal staff
will explain their estimates. The committee will get a chance to ask
both OSBM and fiscal staff questions about how they arrived at their
estimates. Hopefully after evaluating the source of their numbers, we'll
be able to reach a concensus on the amount we should set aside for
medicaid reserves.
Thank you Art Pope for coming, and I'm looking forward to hearing your
presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hunt, members of the committee, thank you for giving OSBM this
opportunity, I believe that the Office of State Budget Management, the
Dept. of Health and Human Services, the Fiscal Research division, have
actually been working for months trying to analyze the data and reach a
concensus forecast where respectfully understand each others numbers and
agree or we disagree.
In brief, and I'll be quick in the intrest of time, representing the
Dept. of Health and Human services today, and available to answer
specific questions are Rod Davis, Chief Financial Officer for the Dept.
of Health and Human Services, Joe Cooper, Chief Information Officer for
the DHHS, Rudy Demling, the acting finance director for the division of
medical assistance, Angelo Taylor for the division of NC Fast, of course
I'm Art Pope, state budget director, in this presentation today I will
be assited by Tony Gurley, the Chief operating officer and deputy for
the state budget and management, and Pam Kilpatrick whom you all well
know as the senior ?? for Health and Human Service including Health and
Medical for DMA.
Mr. Chairman and committee, this review's going to be broken up in two
parts, the first part we're gonna go through very quickly, I'll review
OSBM and HHS roles in the budget, preparation and medicaid, and the
comparison of general assemblies, fiscal research division, and final
medicaid budget as been delivered on June 24th, which was on two days
ago, and I'll welcome to stand to be corrected and update the
information that fiscal research divison has, and add to the Governor's
recommended budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do think there needs to be some clarification. Office of State Budget
and Management does not do medicaid forecasting. We do budget
development for the Governor, we're delegated and directed by statutory
authority. So we see budget requests from state agencies, including
Health and Human services, including DMA and we develop the budget, we
do not actually do the forecasting. And of course, routine we recommend
the budget to general assembly, even numbered years which this year is,
we recommend adjustments for the ?? budget, and of course Governor
McCrory released his ?? budgets on May 14th. And again, to be specific,
the management of medicaid's of DHHS which I recieved the medicaid
program. That's chapter 108-54, the natural practice.</p>

<p id="005:00">
Actually Health &amp; Human services prepares an annual estimate of
Medicaid spending revenues referred to as the Medicaid rebates. And
again this rebate is an estimate of funds needed to continue program
under existing law. And of course last year and this year, we'll here a
lot of discussion about this. We have new Federal law with a merit and
portable care act directing new enrollments. So there are other issues
in addition to the rebates for that increase spending. The rebate
changes are difference between the estimate in spending less existing
revenues to produce an incremental change. Mr. Chairman, if I'm going to
fast let me know. But you have the written material and I know we have
lots of discussion to do. But this is my main point. Department of
Health &amp; Human services prepares the Medicaid forecast about it. But
LSVM and fiscal research. Both fiscal research and LSVM use this
information for developing budget recommendations. So really LSVM and
fiscal research are in the same position receiving the information and
analyzing information. Because of the unique challenges this year which
we will discuss, OSBM has being even more proactive. And I personally
have been more proactive in working with HDHHS, working with fiscal
research division, and analyzing numbers and changing numbers, updating
numbers, booking holds on each others' theories. But again, ours is the
budget development Mr. Chairman. We don't actually, LSVM does not
actually do the forecasting. Which again is why we have a team with DHHS
here as well. Mr. Chairman, this is something I think all of the party,
fiscal research division, LSVM and DHHS all agree, this is a unique year
and we do have severe limitation ?? datas and report due to these unique
circumstances. We have two major new computer systems that will be fully
utilized. It has been years in development, delayed and full
implementation. That's NC fast regarding enrollment and NC tracks for
claims processing. Those are two of the main issues. What happened to
enrollments where's enrollment back log. What happened to claims pay,
and what is the back log on claims pay? That's the heart of it. But even
in the best in circumstances, transitioning to a new computer systems
poses difficulty. This is particularly true of these systems. And there
have been numerous meetings over the last year and a half on this issue.
And I'm not gonna try and repeat it right now. The other major issue
though is significant enrollment increases of affordable care act
woodworking. Again in brief, these are individuals who are already
qualified for medicaid but never participated in medicaid. However under
the affordable care act they are required and forced into medicaid and a
penalty wall to pay a tax back. So the question is how many numbers are
there? How many will enroll and when will they enroll? And of course
because of all the difficulties well recorded on the affordable care act
and the Federal changes in North Carolina and other states, the
enrollment is expected to start last fall and be effective January 1,
which was actually delayed. Have nothing to do with the state of North
Carolina, except we have to deal with the delay. So the issue the
woodworking effect, and we're gonna elaborate on this later, is a major
change and from current law major change, and with the numbers we have
to deal with, determining how to deal with them, and that's caused a
great deal of uncertainty. Now I believe I can say from putting fiscal
research division that they say that this in writing, we agree. We were
not talking about the formal forecasting. Not this year. Just too many
changes because of the above. So we're doing estimates, trying to work
on a consensus and reach agreement on what the numbers should be.
There's really not what I think anyone at finance or budgeting would
call a forecast because of these unique circumstances. We've been
received inquiries about the material and information that has been
provided to fiscal research division and the general assembly through
fiscal research division. So I just want you to know this has been
provided over 50 documents to the fiscal research division since January
1st. LSVM has met 17 times regarding Medicaid since January 1st, 2014.
Now I know this is small print for those of you who do not have the
printed handouts, but you'll see as recently as Tuesday the 24th we were
meeting with fiscal research division. Had a long meeting on Friday June
20th. We had a meeting on Tuesday June 17th all over these numbers. And
also in particular on that Tuesday June 17th, that was the meeting
requested by of the state budget management with the conferee's with
appropriation co-chairs we weren't sure if conferees be appointed over
these questions. So we have been very actively engaged with this the
research division and with the general assembly leadership. This I know
you cannot read, and I'm not asking you to read it, but this is a list
of material sent from ?? being with this research division giving the
dates. There's a separate set of materials from DMA to fiscal research
regarding Medicaid since January 1st, several pages of that.</p>

...and then material from DHS central administration of Fiscal Research
Division about 250 some told and, Mr. Chairman, just so there's no doubt
about any information not being provided, here is a thumb drive, all
those data files in one simple place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's proceed on. Oh there we go, thank you. All right, one of the major
issues that was specifically requested that we address in the letter
from the co-chairman senate appropriation issue, was the claims backlog.
We're going to have a review on the claims backlog first, and then the
applications backlog second. In regards to the claims backlog, we're
going to have Tony Gurley make that presentation. Let me say, by way of
background, those of you who do not know Tony, he joined the state
budget office back in about February. He is a former chairman of Wake
county commissioners, is very actively involved in work with Wake
Medical Center. Also served briefly on the CCNC board of directors so he
is very familiar with this issue, far more familiar than I am, which is
why I'm glad to be able to turn over this part of the presentation over
to Tony.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Again, my name is Tony Gurley, Chief Operating Officer for
OSBM. Giving a review of the Fiscal Research Division's claims
processing backlog estimate, on Tuesday June 24, OSBM received this
document from Fiscal Research Division detailing revised estimates for
an increased current year Medicaid claims backlog and an associated
increase in next years rebates. FRD stated that the revised estimates
are based on a provider survey that was provided by the North Carolina
Hospital's Association and the communications between FRD and several
large hospitals. This slide details the information that was provided by
the Hospital Association on April 30, 2014.
This slide indicates that FRD provided revised estimates of the current
year claims backlog, I've highlighted the line that indicates the June
17th estimate of a $26 million backlog was increased on 6/24 to an
estimated best case backlog of $212 million and a worst case backlog of
$241 million. Those are total dollars.
To provide support for this drastic action, FRD provided the information
included on this slide. I would like to call your attention to two
specific sections of this claims backlog estimate. The first section is
a line detailing Carolinas HealthCare claims backlog and the second
section in the bottom right corner details a whole dollar state share
calculation. The two highlighted sections from the previous slide are
expanded on this slide here.
While...I'll leave that there...while OSBM did not use the same
methodology to determine a claims backlog, we did notice immediately,
two glaring errors in the documentation provided to us. The first error
we noticed is evidenced by the mistaken treatment of Carolinas
HealthCare's projected backlog of $41 million...$41.7 million. The $41.7
million increase in Medicaid accounts receivable from 2013-2014 was
confirmed by the CFO of Carolinas HealthCare. In practice, providers are
normally paid between 20 to 25% of billed charges. Therefore, Carolinas
HealthCare can expect to be paid, at most, $10.4 million for their
claims backlog. Correspondingly, they can expect a payment of around
$9.2 million in the FRD column which adjusted their backlog down to
$36.9 million.
The corrected amounts that I just mentioned, have been input into the
line next to Carolinas HealthCare on this slide. The $41.7 million...</p>

<p id="015:00">
dollar backlog was confirmed in this email from the CFO of Carolina's
healthcare, and as you can see in the highlighted text at the top of the
email, he confirms that his numbers reflect whole dollars including both
the state and federal share amounts. This distinction is very important
because it forms the basis of an explanation of the second substantial
mistake we discovered in the FRD claims estimate. This slide details the
74 million dollar best case and 84 million dollar worst case FRD claims
backlog estimate. These estimates are already provided as whole dollar
amounts. FRD mistakenly assumes the numbers to reflect a state share,
and adjusts these numbers to derive a new incorrect whole dollar amount.
You'll see then that this mistake was then taken to FRD's June 24th
revised estimate and that's where the best case 212 million dollar
shortfall and 240 million dollar worst case shortfall were identified.
Having corrected the two major errors that we identified in this
estimate, you can now see that the model used by FRD should indicate
that the best case is a 47 million dollar shortfall, and the worst case
is a 53 million dollar shortfall in whole dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tony, before you go to the next section, the fiscal research staff would
like to ask you a few questions on that form before you, I'll forget
what you just said, will that be alright?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd rather finish. [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
Okay. OSBM is not the only entity to identify the mistakes in this
claim's backlog estimate. This email notified FRD that the North
Carolina Hospital Association, quote, &quot;believes that the amounts
owed to hospitals are less than those contained in the April
analysis.&quot; Reading from second highlighted section, &quot;in
addition, we need to be very clear that the dollars in our analysis are
total State and Federal. We think that the numbers you've recieved from
conversations with hospitals are as well. From the hospital perspective,
that's the amount they're owed. We believe that the amount the state
owes to hospitals, the state's share of that amount is approximately one
third of the total amounts identified in our April analysis and that
you've received from hospitals.&quot; In conclusion, by correcting the
two identified problems, FRD's best claims backlog is reduced from 212
million to 47 million. And the worst case claims backlog is reduced from
241 to 53 million.  A lower claims backlog will reduce in a smaller
short follow up at year end and thus affects the starting point and
rebates necessary for next year. Since this is not the methodology used
by OSBM, we are not in the position to calculate the impact of these
mistakes on FRD's short fall and rebates estimates.
OSBM has found the data provided by DHHS through it's NC track system to
provide a more reliable and accurate estimate of claims backlog. This
slide summarizes the maximum liability for unpaid claims submitted by
all hospitals and affiliated physician practices in North Carolina. If
every denied and unpaid claim, and there have been 872,581 claims
submitted since July 1st of 2013, if all of these denied and unpaid
claims were paid in full, the maximum estimated liability to medicaid
would equal 54,456,704 in whole dollars and you can see the estimated
state share. And while FRD did not consider other providers in their
calculations because the hospital association survey did not include
other providers, we were able to take this a step further and look at</p>

that difference, I would interpret that as build- [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Doesn't the email refer to this as total dollars state and federal
medicaid?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right. So it's total dollars calculation. He is not attempting-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, but I believe he refers directly to state and federal medicaid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's billed to medicaid. It's medicaid accounts receivable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the information that was provided to fiscal research on this
particular chart, it was very specific that these were recorded at net,
which is the net amount due from medicaid not bill charges. So I guess
if this is in fact net due from medicaid and not bill charges, to write
this down further to the 20 to 25 percent number that you're using but
also tend to understate your estimate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, if this is a billed amount, it needs to be netted down. They do
not expect payment of that amount in full, I have with me here the
printout of all of the hospitals and affiliated claims that are pending,
and in this report the number due to Carolina's Health is significantly
less than that, and it's similar to the taking 25% of the billed amount.
So that's something we can reconfirm, but hospitals- I know of no
hospital that can anticipate what medicaid is going to pay. Hospitals
bill their normal rates and expect to be paid the medicaid allowable. If
you start trying to anticipate what medicaid is going to pay you, you
may bill less than what could have received, and you're going to be paid
less if you bill less. So hospitals normally bill their full rate, and
expect medicaid to pay the allowable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Instead of going through the chair, we're going to have a lot of give
and take today so I'm allowing that to go back and forth until it gets
out of hand. I have a copy of the email, Mr. Gurley, that I'd like your
comment on. It's from Carolina Healthcare, it says that all amounts
below our net- could you look at this and give me your comments on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
The email that says that all of the amounts are net- I anticipate- and I
have received emails from this individual as well, but I am not aware of
any hospital netting an amount to equal what medicaid is expected to pay
them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Steve Owen, fiscal research. Just have a couple of comments. I did talk
directly with Mr. Gumbar who confirmed that these were net amount due
from medicaid. I spent over 27 years in hospitals as a CFO or CEO. I can
assure you that every month, I calculated what was actually due and
recorded in that receivable. In every hospital I ever worked in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I also spoke with this individual who's a CFO, and I don't have that
interpretation of the numbers, I also have a printout of all of the
claims that have been billed by Carolina's healthcare, and they are
included in the totals that I gave you at the end of my presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, if you have a- conclude your presentation, we're gonna have
some questions from the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh okay, alright. Excuse me. He's not- presentation is not complete.
Mr. Chairman, if we could real quick-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Solve this question, is Mr. Gumbar here, or is somebody from the
hospital association here to answer the question?
Seeing no one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We've got somebody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is anyone here from Carolina Medical?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Cody's here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Cody Hand.  Welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, Cody Hand from the hospital association. I will happily
answer any question you've got.
Mr. Gumbar is not here, by the way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question is, is this a net number or is this a billed number?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm under the impression that what we submit to medicaid is net. Mr.
Gurly is correct that the final number is the state's share of what the
hospital anticipates recieving. I will have Mr. Gumbar clarify</p>

That force though.

Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes Sen ??
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I Believe Misses [Kimble 00:05] here representing Carolina Medical,
could we hear from her please?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Miss Kimble.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I’m not Misses Kimble, I’m Martha Ann McConnel with Carolina’s Health
Care System. Mr. Gumbar confirmed that it’s expected payment is the
number.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay. That’s a whole dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
That’s state dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Let’s go through the chair so we can make sure everyone hears the
response. What was your response Mr. [Hurley]?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I was asking is it expecting state dollar. The email specifically says
it includes state and federal share.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I think that was in an earlier part of the email but the number that we
have is 17.5 expected state dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay this is saying 41.7, what I was looking at. So that is the total?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Right
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
So the total expected is the 41.7 and a third of that would be?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Right at 17.5.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
It shouldn’t be that much, okay. Well again, we do have the
documentation of all of the claims. That’s similar to what we said.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I have an additional question. It was eluded to the fact that this email
is a part of the email. Has it been redacted in some way?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Not to my knowledge sir. I haven’t seen the whole email that was sent to
Mr. [Girly]. From this distance I don’t know that it was redacted but I
can’t say that it wasn’t.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Do we know whether or not, I’m sorry Chairman, do we know whether or not
this was the whole email or just part of it as our staff didn't receive
it?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I’m glad to forward you to entire email.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Alright thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I can’t attest to whether that’s the whole email or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Alright, further questions? I hear a voice. Representative Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Based on Mr. Pope’s statement that there’s additional presentation, are
we going to go through the entire presentation, is that his wish? Then
we are going to get bogged down and not be able to ask Mr. [Girly]
questions as a committee an hour later from now or can we do it now?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No, that’s what we’re doing right now. We’re asking Mr. [Girly]
questions and then we’re going the rest of the presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay, I have questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman, Mr. [Girly], what is your number that you project? Is that
$41 million dollars in state dollars that is owed in a check, right,
that’s due, is that what I’m hearing?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
My interpretation of this slide is that there’s $41 million dollars more
in accounts receivable at Carolina’s Health Care as of May of 2014. $41
million more than there was May 2013.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Excuse me Mr. Chairman. In your presentation did you have a number that
is owed to hospitals now? Since that’s the most reliable information,
what was that number?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
All hospitals and affiliated positions, the maximum estimated liability
if every claim that has been filed and not paid since July first of
2013, if they were all paid in full, the total liability to Medicaid
would be $54,456,000. The estimated state share of that is $18.5
million.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow Up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up, that $18.5 million is where I’m going with this. What the
hospitals are owed with their data systems, and I know you have a law
background, a pharmacy background, and you ran a business. You know what
your receivables were on any given day and with the sophisticated system
of the hospitals they can pretty much within 24 hours come up with the
most pertinent up to date information there is. I received information
from just two hospitals, just two, that says they are owed by the state,
just two not Vidant or any of the other big ones, again just two
hospitals, $28.5 million dollars that they are owed, state dollars,
which blows your 18 million out of the water. I don’t understand why…</p>

...physical staff, OSBM, whoever is trying to get this, we're just
trying to get an agreement of numbers. Hospitals can provide that
information fairly quickly. At least I was able to get it from two, and
you've heard Carolinas Healthcare state that they're owed $17.5 million
in state dollars. That blows that $18 million. I can add another $11
million for Novant and we're at $28.5 million.
So unless we survey and find out pertinent real-time information from
hospitals, I don't see how you can, sir, substantiate those numbers
based on what I received just last night.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would call upon Mr. Cooper with DHHS and he is the
one that is in charge of this. He is able to track the 1.6 million
claims that have not been paid and document where it's due and the total
amounts and the likelihood of the difference between what hospitals
expect to be paid and what they eventually are paid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Cooper.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, one more follow up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was the Chair of a hospital for eight years. They
bill net dollars, what they're expected to be paid. There's no funny
money there. It would be like you billing for half of a prescription and
saying that's your receivable. That's not it, you bill for the whole
prescription. I'm not here to banter back and forth, I'm just saying
that hospitals should be able to provide this General Assembly, OSBM and
physical research, clean up the date, real-time numbers to substantiate
that and I have two that blows it out of water by $10 million. Help me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't know which two hospitals you're...yeah, that'd
be great.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First of all you heard $17.5 million from Carolinas
Healthcare just now, so that means you only got $500,000 left there. And
then Novant's owed $11 million in state dollars, that's $28.5 million.
That doesn't count Duke and Vita or any of the rest of them. And if you
take NC track's numbers and you think they're the gospel with all the
trouble we've had those guys. Tony, I mean, Mr. Pruitt, I cannot imagine
a man with your background being able to stand there and substantiate
$18 million when it's blowed out of the water. I can get you that data,
sir, I can back it up.
It is real-time and if you want me to go to finding it as a part-time
legislator and call all these hospitals which you or our physical
research or anybody else could have already done and talked to Gumbar,
talked to the CFO's like I did on two, then you can find out exactly the
information and be able to give us real numbers up there so that this
General Assembly, the House and the Senate, and the House is placating
more to your numbers than what physical research says, and that's a
chasm we find ourselves in. We could find out a real number from our
hospital partners here and be able to substantiate that. But this, right
here, you're already $10 million in the hole and I ain't even gone to
the rest of the big ones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Gurley, you want Mr. Cooper to respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, yes, but first let me, I have been invited and
met with the individuals there and they were originally claiming $70
million owed. That turned out to be, and it is owed to them, but it's a
cost settlement. It's not claims. So their experience, and I'm not here
to defend NC tracks, DHHS can do that. But Vita, you specifically
mentioned them, they are very happy with the level of their accounts
receivable, except for the cost settlement, which they are definitely
owed $70 million and that's in the budget to be processed. And they are
not behind in claim settlement and that's something I think that maybe
missing in this discussion. We're only focusing on an increase in their
accounts receivable this year over before NC tracks.
Hospitals always have a certain level, just as you saw on the Carolinas
Healthcare, we were focused on the difference, the increase in their
accounts receivable. So a lot of the hospitals are quoting numbers that
they're owed and they are definitely owed that but that's a normal
amount of receivables.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, one follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, one follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You know we do have a member of the House who formerly
ran a hospital in Winston-Salem that's available to clear up net and
claims and whatever, right here amongst us. If you want to ask him a
question about how he ran his hospital, which is consistent with today
the way hospitals would run if you chose to ask him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We can come back to that if we need to. I think it's
pretty clear where, how it's supposed to be billed. Mr. Cooper, did you
want to respond to any of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Tucker, I think that
Mr. Gurley hit the nail on the head when he was talking about...</p>

<p id="040:00">
When we deal with hospitals, which we deal with every day, we hear
numbers – they’re owed x amount of money or whatever – and then when we
get in there and start dealing with the CFOs or the building manager,
what we routinely find is that they’re lumping all the things, whether
it’s settlement or dish payments or whatever in there, and when we get
down to the actual NC ?? claims data, we’re usually very close to where
they are, so what I’m saying is I can’t speak to the numbers that are
being shared with you, but what I can tell you with complete certainty
is in terms of what’s been paid to the hospitals and what’s been denied,
we have accurate data on both of those fronts, and I would remind
everyone that so far, we just finished our last check-write for this
fiscal year and we paid 10.3 billion dollars, and this is very much in
line to where we were last year at this same time, so what I would
actually say, we have lots of detailed data, we can get together with
the individual hospitals, and I’m confident we can sit down with them,
look at the denied data and approved data and get to a very good place
in terms of an agreement on where things are. One more thing I’d add is
back to Mr. ?? point, when we looked at what’s submitted and what’s
actually paid out, the numbers tend to be, and we have the data to back
this up here, when hospitals submit their account receivables or their
actual claims, they routinely fall in the 20 to 25 percent range in
terms of actual payout, and we have very convincing, compelling data to
that point and happy to share that, and I believe hospitals here that do
this every day would tell you that they don’t have a high expectation,
much more than 20, 25 percent of what they submit actually getting paid,
and anybody from hospitals that’s here, I’m sure it would be good for
them to speak up on that front. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker, is
your mic on? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, but I wish it was to respond to
Mr. ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well Senator Hise has his hand up. Do you want
to respond? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, let Senator Hise go ahead. That’s
fine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He said he doesn’t want to. He said he wanted
you to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I want to be the one to ask any
questions, but I’ll just respond. I’ll have a question later. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s fine. Any other questions of the committee? Mr.
Pope. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just one quick note on…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please everybody check your mics and see if your mic’s
on. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I did want to clarify in regards to
Steve Owen’s OSBM HHS ?? that he left the Department of Health and Human
Services, Joint and General Assembly last year. I want to note that an
apparently errant email was sent by the north Carolina Hospital
Association with the wrong email address. I think that’s one of those
cases where he just typed in an email address, up pops an old one at
that particular point. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my
next comment before we move onto the backlog in applications, this
comment’s more for the general public who may be listening to this
screening because we have a lot of knowledge and use a lot of
terminology. I think the overall context that needs to be kept in mind
is that Medicaid, for the whole dollars, Medicaid claims are paid for
whole dollars, which includes both the federal dollars, which are going
down by the state, and the state share, and an approximate rule of thumb
is about one third, 34 percent as to state share, so when going through
these numbers and amounts and discussions, you need to always
distinguish between total dollars versus the state dollars into
information billed, is that the whole amount that the provider is
billing and what’s the state’s share of it, and then when you get
detailed calculations within the numerous spreadsheets we go through to
make sure that the multiplication and division is right to go back and
forth between state dollars and whole dollars, and Mr. Chairman, I’ve
already spoken to Fiscal Research Division yesterday and today. This is
an unusual process to be having these discussions in public hearing,
though we’re glad to do that. We received most of this information
Tuesday afternoon, had a brief meeting with Fiscal Research Tuesday
afternoon. Yesterday we received a request about 11 am to appear this
morning, so unfortunately we do not have the normal process or the
changing information with Fiscal Research Division, and like I said in
my opening remarks, poking holes in each other’s numbers and trying to
arrive at more certainty, and in particular as a businessman – I’m a
hospital retailer – very much we all understand, we really emphasize
this. Any business, any hospital, any provider is always owed money that
they have been billed but not yet received.</p>

<p id="045:00">
When we talk about backlog, we’re trying to determine the amount, the
difference between how much is owed this year versus last year or a
normal year, the excess amount, especially an extremely high excess
amount, being called the backlog – that difference between what’s
normally billed and pending but is not yet paid versus additional
amount, and yes, Senator Tucker, we all share the frustration on
information and data. That’s why I also said in my opening remarks, we
all agree upon that, but if you think it’s complicated on the backlog of
pay, wait until we get to the applications. The Division of Health and
Human Services provides Fiscal Research with data worksheets including
the comparison of Medicaid enrollment data between 2013 and 2014. I know
you cannot read this chart unless you have the hardcopy printout, and
this is just one snapshot in time of that enrollment data, and we had a
very productive discussion with Fiscal Research Division on even how you
treat these numbers and the historic numbers, but one of the columns is
a starting point, and the earlier version provided the Fiscal Research
Division last Friday had in the May 13 pending applications, 168,888
now. That was previously 166, 694, so that number’s gone up slightly.
Now just like with accounts received, there are always pending
applications, so depending upon what the pending applications are,
you’re going to use an average for the previous year. There were
approximately 50 thousand plus pending applications last year, so
routinely there are 50 to 60 thousand pending applications. Then we have
processed fewer applications this year. We have a separate chart that’s
provided, and Mr. Speaker, we got lots of charts on that thumb drive
that highlight this, but basically the state processed fewer
applications at the beginning of the year, especially January, February
and March, than we did last year, in part because, as has also been
well-discussed previously, the catching up on the backlog on SNAP and
other issues, but beginning of May and April we start wearing those
claims down, and then we also have increased pending applications,
although enrollment has increased, so there is actually… Mr. Chairman, I
did not even try and put this on a spreadsheet on my presentation, but
here is an example, one spreadsheet that shows I think the
collaboratively effort, and again poking holes. This is the detailed
spreadsheet worked at by both OSBM, DHHS and Fiscal Research Division.
The left hand column’s actually numbers provided by the Department of
Health and Human Services and worked on by them, including Rita Dimling,
who’s here today, and the right hand columns were worked on by Fiscal
Research, trying to do an analysis of that application. Now based on the
allocations, Fiscal Research Division had a starting number for the
pending application of 180,110, versus 166,698 we had previously
provided. That addition was due to a category called the “changed, not
transferred”. These are the number of applications that are received by
the federal exchange that are due to be transferred to the state of
North Carolina. Earlier that was given a higher number from CMMS which
in turn was then provided to Fiscal Research Division, which is what
Fiscal Research used to get that 180,110. As of yesterday, that number
has been revised down by CMMS to 19 hundred applications, which is 168
thousand. So again, this is because the information, numbers we get
change, and these numbers came not from NC Tracks or NC Fast on the
applications side but from CMMS and the federal exchange. That shows the
challenge that we have. Now this is wordy, and we have spent, gosh,
months on this issue, and that is that the current information does not
allow the current identification of the woodworking effect. Again, the
woodworking effect was to be the numbers who were not previously
enrolled in Medicaid but would enroll in Medicaid, and then would go
through the federal exchanges operating in North Carolina to the
Medicaid system. Well only about eight thousand – excuse me, only about
three thousand have been approved for the woodworking effect through the
federal exchange operating in North Carolina.  As we all know, the
exchange did not work. People were encouraged to apply through the 1800
numbers, navigators assisted them, they were directed…</p>

<p id="050:00">
county social services. So the woodworking effect has been merged into
over all applications, plus we had a unique explosion of duplicate
applications of people  who applied on the federal exchange more than
once, or applied for federal exchange, and gave up, went to the county
social service who still had that application there, so a very high
number of rejects due to duplications of applications, and we have
individuals already enrolled in medicaid. So they heard or were told
they need to go to the federal exchange, or go sign up for medicaid
althoug they're already on there. And Sen. [??] asked an excellent
question on a meeting we had last month Tuesday, in that the screening
is done constantly so the fact that we've knocked down those
duplications early on, what does that say about the future? So those are
all excellent questions, but unfortunately we do not have that detailed
information. We don't have it, CMS, the federal government doesn't have
it, and nor does fiscal research division to identify what that
woodworking effect is. That is very important, because I was looking for
my handout but in the last year's enacted budget on the committee report
continuation, there were two items: One  for the overall medicaid
rebates, and one separate for th woodworking effect. The woodworking
effect had a number in there of 69,683 new enrollees for this year, be
funded at 49.6 million dollars. The next year's on the annualized basis,
12 months not just the 6 months of January through June 14, that cost
114.4 million. That part of the budget was done based on enrollment
numbers, whereas the overall medicaid rebates was done based on a macro
process we'll discuss later.
Again, we cannot identify those who came through the county social
services, whether they were traditional enrollees, or woodworking effect
enrollees, because they're all merged together. But the total
information on enrollment and the information we do have, in particular
those that have come through the federal exchange, in the case that
we're not anywhere close to the 69,683 and one of the reasons we believe
the check right is lower, and we do have all the check rights now Sen.
Tucker, is because the woodworking effect was not as great as we
thought in total numbers, but also we do have a seperate calculation,
and I believe Steve Owen has done this, although the potential backlog
of claims, how many of them the woodworking effect, and fiscal research
had a range of options of the backlog for ACA, sometimes it's a
confusion between whats on ACA and the woodworking effect, a
22,000-24,000 backlog we're pending will ultimately be approved. I don't
necessarily disagree with that number, but even given that number, and
those that are re-enrolled, we are obviously well below that 69,683.
Overall, based on fiscal research division's analysis, we're willing to
go with on this, we again do not see any evidence we'll see the overall
medicaid rebates for this year that the general assembly enacted of 557
million dollars, and then the additional funding for the medicaid, the
woodworking effect as reported again in last year's continuation budget.
So in part, and we'll go into detail in the next part of the
presentation, we agree we think the general assembly, the Senate and the
House, and the Governor signing law did a good job on the rebates last
year, budgets for this year in general and for the woodworking effect,
there are other specific issues that we can address and fiscal research
division saying, including the transfer of children from health choice.
And that part may be slightly underfunded, whereas we think woodworking
is  overfunded. But on that basis, I'm going to go to the next part of
our presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tillman has a question before you go to the next part.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Pope, you're known far and wide as a budget guru. Your facts and
figures are almost looked at sometimes as coming from above. But, we're
basing on assumptions and you can come out with whatever you want on the
end if you take this assumption or that assumption. We're all basing it
on assumptions, and we really are working from the blind in some of
these things and you can't tell me how many adults have pending
applications and how many children. We don't know that. And one's high
cost and one's low cost. But in any event, with these unknowns, and
you're taking the least worst scenario, and we're 100 to 200 million
dollars appart, and we will be after this, something is wrong. So if
we're gonna try to come up with a number, and a good Businessman and a
good budget man I just wonder if you can be comfortable with taking
numbers that are the least worst</p>

<p id="055:00">
scenario versus the more conservative view that we're taking. The gaps
to wide and what I want to know with all these unknowns why would we
gamble on a two or three hundred million dollar deficit coming into an
election year? I'm just looking at the fiscal side of this thing and I
know that your usually conservative with your numbers. But what I'm
saying is we're setting up a case, now your last three budgets that
we've got have missed our projections by about a billion dollars of
taxpayer money we've had to throw back into this program. Are we setting
ourselves up again for a two or three hundred million deficit coming
into the fifteen long session? And are you comfortable with us being
that far apart and are you comfortable with these numbers? That's what I
want to know. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Totally. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator I was
planning to address those issues in the conclusion. I'll be happy to
address them now but take a few of your points in order. Angela Taylor
here is with NC Fast. A particular point was we cannot distinguish the
woodworking effect from the cause in part of those enrolled through
county social services. We do have a detailed breakdown and analysis,
multiple spreadsheets on the breakdown of the applications already
processed make assumptions on the applications already processed what
percentage of those pending. Applications pending means it's pending you
haven't gone through it to classify it. I can have Angela Taylor provide
additional detailed information or brief me on that. Now to get to your
more fundamental question, and first of all part of your reference to
your, it is absolutely correct that there has been three out of the last
four years substantial gaps in medicaid funding. In 2010, 2011 under
prior general assembly and prior administration the gap was $601
million. In 2011, 2012 the budget, I presume you were here and passed it
had a $375 million gap requiring legislation senate bill 797 house bill
14 to offset that during the course of that year. Likewise in 2012, 2013
you mentioned your Governor McCrory was not governor yet and the budget
was enacted in 2012 but that resulted in a $487 million gap which yes
this general assembly and the governor we had a deal with the ones that
came in office had addressed that gap with legislation house bill 980
and house bill 336. So twice in the last 2 years this general assembly
has voted on medicaid budgets without a balance. Now that the good news
is, we didn't have to do that this year. There is good news. We do
believe and agree there is a backlog in claims and applications but as
already been indicated and I think everyone is in agreement, we're going
to have approximately $70 million in cash to carry forward to next year
to take care of this years obligations. ?? I'm talking about state
dollars again, ?? between state and whole dollars. So that is the good
news. We've not had to do that. You did pass a responsible budget last
year and the governor has done a good job administrating that budget and
controlling the costs where we can, though there are still many
uncertainties. So that is good news and good information that we need as
a starting point. Second vote in regards of rebased lectures you just
asked me should we use the most conservative numbers? Respectfully
senator, I think the worst case, well look at ?? if the worst case is
this general assembly and the governor signs into law you use the number
from the governor office state ?? management HHS the house the under
funds medicaid what is the worst case? Unfortunately, The worst, this is
a bad case. The bad case is we'll back here next spring in May or June
like we were in 2013 and 2012 asking for additional legislation to
authorize to use state resources to pay and make up the medicaid
backlog. We've done that before. Presumably if this year is a normal
year we'll have reversions here today. You've been given, we've already
lowered down our estimates of what revenues will be. We'll have other
collections of revenue. So senator Tillman the worst case is the
governors recommendation is the house position is accepted rather than
the senate position is we'll be back here next year using state
resources to pay for it. Now then, lets say that we take the senate
position and fund medicaid at two, three hundred million dollars more,
what is the worst case then? You've over funded it and have a surplus
next year. But senator what is the cost of over funding medicaid? The
cost in the senate budget is firing teacher assistants. Some 6 to 7000
dollars current teachers assistants who serve over 239,000 children in
the classrooms would be fired. You'd unnecessarily fire them. You can't
go back and rehire them, put them back in the classroom next spring. We
find out Oh we over funded medicaid. The senate  house pays for it's
budget by changing the</p>

eligibility laws. That would require not underfunding medicaid, but
removing 5,200 aged, blind, and disabled low income residents from the
medicaid safety net. 1600 of those patients with alzheimers or dementia
currently being served in special care units. So the worst case is you
overfund medicaid, and you underfund needed service for people currently
eligible for medicaid. You'd also eliminate or delay medicaid services
up to 42,000 people a year, when nearly 18,000 of those are long term
care recipients. Now that's people served and touched during the year,
there's updates on the discussion on the numbers of how many are served
at one time. So Sen. Tillman, we need the general assembly of the
Governor as a duty to properly fund medicaid at the level expected to be
needed,  with the worst case if that number is wrong, we have to come
back and find what financial resources, or a interim bill, supplemental
bill like we did in previous years, would avoid what's definitely the
worst case, unneccessarily firing teacher's assistants on the job now,
serving children now, unnecessarily laying off people removing their
eligibility from medicaid, including those 1600 patients with alzheimers
or dementia.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Sen. Tillman, I-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One follow up-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
-I see you have your finger on the button.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
-one follow up and I'll stop with this line.
You failed to say, Mr. Pope, that if we take our conservative figures,
we'd have 300 million on the table to cut taxes or to put teacher
assistance in classrooms, or to buy textbooks, or to fund teacher
raises, you can do a lot with the cash. And I think we can take care of
these needs that you've just talked about without making these bad
choices now and probably running a 2 or 300 million dollar deficit. I'd
rather face the cash on hand than the deficit. That's simply what I'm
looking at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. TIllman I agree with you on that. That's when we get through the
next part of the presentation, the governor's recommended budget because
there is risk, did leak  50 million dollars, for medicaid risk reserve,
which will fund about 150 millon dollars in total dollars, plus the
governor's recommended budget left 100 million dollars unappropriated
which could be used for medicaid. We left it on there unappropriated
because that had been the practice in the past year, the beginning of
this general assembly in 2011 and 2012's very irresponsible, and leaving
unappropriated amounts, because it was necessary for medicaid shortfall.
But that actually began a good leadin to what the governor's budget does
recommend, that we can find common ground for the appropriate funding
level for medicaid, the appropriate medicaid risk reserve for those
contingencies, without incurring undue hardships.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And for that Mr. Chairman, on the positive side,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I've got a question, [??]. Before we debate what the final
budget looks like, which I think Mr. Pope wants to do, because there's
no budget thats been passed that's in place, that's your opnion, becaue
we're not negotiating a budget. What we're trying to negotiate is a
starting point to begin a budget process. Now your comments want to
dictate what our budget may do - that's not a final budget, you know
that. And we can make decisions on how those dollars are spent when we
decide on what dollars we have to spend. We haven't had that debate yet.
What the debate is about is what's the beginning point on dollars. And
we can argue about what cuts to make and where to make them, and we'll
do that in the budgeting process that's been in place in this body for
many many years. We'll do that. The question I want to ask my staff is
on the application's backlog, we've got a 180 million dollar piece and
Steven Susan- a 180 thousand dollar backlog, I kinda want to talk about
the difference between our backlog and Mr. Pope's backlog.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dave, you want to respond to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Steven, on fiscal research, the 13,000 difference came from documents I
believe that OSBM provided last Tuesday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Sen. Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, don't- do you want to respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh no, I was just agreeing-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I acknowledged in my opening remarks that the numbers change in CMS,
which is the difference between 180,000 and 168,000. That was the change
from CMS which Steve Owens did not have the benefit of when he prepared
his numbers. And Sen. Brown, I agree, that we have obviously not passed
the entire budget, there's a limited amount of money available
throughout the budget and I was responding to Sen. Tillman's question on
that regard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Pope, that was just your opinion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr.-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold on, hold on, hold on one  sec.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do have-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Berger.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Mr. Pope, one of the issues we're trying to deal with is why there's a

… log and what number either DHHS or the Budget Office has for the
backlog. Can you tell us what number you are using in connection with
the projection of backlog dollars of the claims – I’m sorry, of the
enrollment backlog that exists? Are you in agreement with the numbers
that our fiscal staff has or do you have a different number? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President, we are in general agreement on the numbers of
the backlog applications, and again, we’re in agreement in part because
that 180 thousand number again had a difference of a revised number from
CMS. That’s the only difference in the numbers on that. Fiscal Research
Division has an approach of providing an analysis, and again, that’s
this long sheet right here. I’m trying to allocate what percentage of
those are traditional Medicaid applicants, which have an approval rate
of approximately 61 percent plus, and then a portion of that under the
Affordable Care Act, different ways to describe that including
woodworking, which has a lower percentage in the 40 percent plus range,
and from that getting a projection on the number of people who will
eventually be approved. We do not have any substantial disagreement I
believe on those numbers. The next step is then to provide what is the
cost of those applicants once they get enrolled, and there I will defer
to Steve Owen to describe his approach on the PMPM, per member per
month. At Fiscal Research’s request, the Department of Health and Human
Services including Rudy Dimsling is here to try to look at their
approach and do other approaches on that cost figure, but no, we do not
have a different cost figure on that factor from Fiscal Research because
that’s in part not the methodology we use, though we’re glad to receive
the information. So if I could summarize, I don’t think we have a
disagreement on the numbers of people. We don’t use the same methodology
that Fiscal Research does in using that all for projecting a cost for
it, and that’s why I’ve been trying to get to the rest of our
presentation on methodology we do use, but I’m happy to answer further
questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What is the difference between your number and Fiscal
Research staff’s number on the cost. If there’s not a difference on the
numbers but there’s a difference on what percentage represents the type
of Medicaid that would be awarded, what’s the difference in the cost on
the two numbers? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger, I personally, OSBM,
does not have a cost number. If you’d like to, I’d be glad to bring up
Mr. Dimsling. If you want to come back and reconvene, we can do the
variations, get this up here and have a discussion on the various ways
of posting cost data, but to summarize, we’re not disputing or arguing.
I honestly think when you look at the total amount allocated in budget
for Medicaid, we are approximately 2015 million dollars in total bill
less on the check-write than what was budgeted. We’re approximately 70
million dollars in state dollars ahead in cash for that. We all agree
and think part of that again is due to the claims backlog discussed
previously and the enrollment backlog because we know that enrollment’s
slowed down; initially those people will be there. Now allocating what
the costs of those are, again, I can have Mr. Dimsling get here and you
can have Steve Owens discuss that. They have discussed it, but we’re
willing to go approximately with Steve Owens’ approach on considering
that on what possible effect that will have on next year. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess at this point it appears
to me that there’s a difference but I’m trying to get to what that
difference is, and maybe somebody from Fiscal Staff can help. Is there
something that they need that would help bridge the gap or is there not
a gap? I just don’t know. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, I don’t think
there’s a major gap on that particular component of issues. We’re
talking about the enrollment backlog, what that number is, what the
normal number is, and when they are approved, the percentage rate down
between the various categories. I don’t think there’s a research on that
particular component of it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Susan Jacobs, Fiscal
Research. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, Senator Berger, members of the
committee, I think that one question that we’ve had, members have
routinely asked us about the Governor’s budget and the backlog
estimation of 215 million dollars in the backlog calculation. I think
the members would want to know – they’ve asked us what percentage of
that or how much of that 215 million dollar backlog are you associating
with the claims backlog if any, and how much are you associating with an
application backlog, and how you arrive…</p>

...that those calculations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I can have Mr. Patrick come up and give the
presentation the Governor's recommended budget and then the House will
start getting that issue and the methodology that we use.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, you want to ask you a question now? OK,
we'll wait. Now you get to have all the fun.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning to the Chairs and the members of the
committee and to the public. My name is Pam Kilpatrick and I'm here with
the Office of State Budget and Management. The next part of the
presentation focuses on the Governor's recommended budge proposal.
The Governor's recommended budget began with the enacted budget in
Session Law 2013 360. What's reflected on this slide is intended to show
growth in state appropriations invested in the Medicaid budget in an
enacted law from $3.1 billion when the budget was enacted for 2012-13,
to $3.6 billion, which is the amount of funding currently appropriated
for Medicaid for the budget year that's being debated.
Within that, there is a rebase factored in already of $434 million state
dollars for the current year and $557 million for next year, which is a
growth in the rebase alone of $123 million and overall increased state
appropriations next year to this year of $146,168,972,000.
The next slide, we show this to show the various components that have
already been factored into the budget that is enacted in law and these
are the assumptions that were made about 11, 12 months ago about what
was expected to occur as a result of growth in the Medicaid budget, as
well as what the effect on state funding would be due to some of the
other payments that the Medicaid budget has to support. The legislature
enacted increases in this budget for the rebase, for cost settlements,
for contracts. In addition to the normal Medicaid growth, the enacted
budget included funding for the woodworking effect of the Affordable
Care Act.
Referencing the numbers that Mr. Pope mentioned earlier, the budget
funded 72,426,000 new clients for 2014-15, with a specific appropriation
of $114,119,120,000 and that is a higher amount than the estimate for
the current year.
Also the legislative budget included funded to move Health Choice
children, also a requirement of the Affordable Care Act, from the
Medicaid program, from the Health Choice program to the state's Medicaid
program. And there was a growth in funding for that enrollment
adjustment to the Medicaid budget.
In addition, there was funding for some work arounds dealing with the NC
Tracks implementation and CCNC study, so we bring you to the total
amount that the legislature enacted in adjustments, taking into account
these issues that are being debated as to how to adjust them for next
year going forward.
Then there were decreases, and I won't spell each one out, but there
were decreases from savings initiatives that were directed to the
Medicaid agency to fulfill and those are listed under the decreases. And
for the current year, they were estimated to total $147.3 million and
for next year the savings, when they're fully annualized into the
budget, were expected to achieve savings of $221.6 million.
On the bottom line, again, reconciling to sort of where we're starting
out...</p>

<p id="075:00">
...going into next year compared to the current year, there is enacted
$3.6 billion for the Medicaid agency next year, or that growth that has
been considered in light of these various factors of $146 million.
When the governor's budgets was being developed, the information that
was available at the time of budget development, was actual expenditure
activity through March 2014. As is typically the case, we start with
evaluating what's happening in the current year and trying to interpret
what we're seeing that is happening and then we start diverging and
making assumptions about what that means.
With that in mind, and understanding that what happens in this year, is
the basis against which a number of the assumptions about growth and mix
and enrollment change, will occur. We started with 2013-14 and we did
the following, as a collective group. And again, the Medicaid agency
owns the development of the models that have been used in developing
these numbers, and there has been the process of debating and trying to
vet those numbers. The original assessment used actual expenditures
through March 31st and an estimate of the fourth quarter expenditures
and revenues to project where it was expected that June 20...June 30,
2014, within that, how would the resulted plan look.
The forecast indicated at that time time, based on that set of data,
that the Medicaid expenditures would be about net $205 million under
budget in total spending. Or, if you calculate a third is the state
share, an estimate of $70 million. Again, this was not a pm/pm
calculation. It was not based on enrollment changes because, frankly, we
didn't have that. So it's what a budget estimate would look like using
where we've been, looking at three years of prior March year-to-date.
Three years of history of how the fourth quarter typically looks if
there's ever a typical year in Medicaid. And attempting to create an
expectation for the full 12 months.
Under-spending at that point was estimated to be that net number. That
net $205 million. That number was assumed to be a backlog. The
underlying assumption, starting with the enacted budget, was if that was
a good set of assumptions that we collectively made coming into this
year, then there must be a reason that spending is lagging or falling
behind the planned budget.
We attributed that, at that time, to answer the question of how we came
up with a backlog number, it was the difference between where the
enacted budget spread over 50 weeks of check writes lead us to believe
that when we finished June, we would come up with money left on hand. We
assumed that related to the questions of providers not being paid or
citizens not being timely or promptly enrolled in the Medicaid program.
The unspent funds that were projected to be remaining at June 30, 2014,
were recommended in the Governor's budgets up to be retained, regardless
of whether we debate a carry forward or an appropriation of the general
assembly, to be retained for Medicaid liabilities going forward so that
that money could be used to liquidate that potential for the backlog due
to provider claims delay and/or enrollment impacts.
The recommended budget, again for emphasis, did not differentiate
between the claims processing and enrollment. We were not able to do
that at that time. To update this committee since that was done, the
Medicaid program has made the 50th of 50 check writes for the state
fiscal year. That would be the final NC tracks check write. That
occurred Tuesday the 24th and in total, again based on that spread of
the enacted budget, they came in $204 million.</p>

<p id="080:00">
Through the budget very close to what it had looked like in March when
we looked at it. Came in very close to that. Now what we caution, we
always say that the final balances and the final cash remaining at June
30 is dependent on the remaining payments that the agency will be
making. They will not be holding payments or delaying payments, we are
assured. And it will also be dependent based on the collection of
receipts that come in through June 30. As we all know this budget uses
state appropriations as well as a significant portion of total dollars
of about $700 million in drug rebates and a lot of those come in in the
month of, in the fourth quarter, and in June. So we will be watching
that, and that should have a positive impact. So this slide has
reflected that the allocated budget, the spread on the check write
schedule that is fairly widely distributed, $10.1 billion. The actual
check writes came in at 9.967 which placed the provider payment NCTracks
payments to the providers at $204 million under budget. Another update
is another filter that a state budget office would look at to measure
where we are, would be to look at what we have as cash on hand. So what
this slide is, is a DHHS estimate that they’ve prepared. The next slide
will be actually what’s in the bank and what’s on hand. But we included
this so that you could see a couple of components of the cash. What this
says on the bottom line of that, is right now DHHS is estimating ending
the year at June 30 with $123,123,793. That’s pretty specific for a
target, for an estimate. But that is their estimate and it’s based on a
point in time. It was based on their estimates as of yesterday, and what
it’s made up of, in their estimate, is $57 million as a result of those
claims coming in under budget. It doesn’t match exactly because cash is
the net of all payments in and out and all the receipts that come in and
out of the budget code. But the next three items are important to
highlight because this has been a question before this body previously.
How the federal share of drug rebates are treated in Medicaid, how they
are recorded and whether they’re attributed to state cash. In the
current year, well let me finish this short block here, that represents
39 million and 13 million represent federal shares of this cash that
will be carried forward so there is adverse impact in next year’s budget
from having to re-pay a federal component of a rebate that’s collected
in the current year. We had been working with the state comptroller’s
office, have been collaborating with your team here, looking at one
first the appropriate accounting method for how to deal with these
receipts, but the $13.7 million, we’ve had some communication as staff
back and forth about whether or not there is some money in this cash
that is actually has a federal component to it that hasn’t been
identified. So it’s line item in this presentation before is, and it
says on disposition receipts carried forward assumed to be 100% federal.
In short, briefly what it is, is it’s a recoupment. A provider payment
was made by NCTracks, it was recouped for one reason or another, it goes
into a bucket and you have to determine what’s the state and federal
share of it. We expect there’s a state and federal share but in the
abundance of caution we’re itemizing it as 100% federal so that we don’t
overstate the cash position. Two other notes at the bottom of this
slide, briefly. There were, because we did work with OSC and our
partners on the appropriate accounting methodology for federal shares of
drug rebates, we point out that based on the method that was used last
year, this year’s budget had to absorb the impact of $64.1 million of a
repayment to the federal government for drug rebates that were collected
in June of last year and use state appropriations out of this year’s
budget to catch that up. And we’re not benefiting by June of this year
having any ?? offsetting impact to it. And also, the state had to make,
this budget will reflect the HHS budget for Medicaid will reflect what
they call hardship payments also related to NCTracks, CSE. Those are
made 100% state funded. They ultimately will earn</p>

Some federal match, and so this years budget has had to absorb the whole
payment. Next years budget will benefit by getting two-thirds of that
back once those claims are properly adjudicated, and the general fund
can benefit from that. This is sort of the stuff that budget geeks
look-up; this is the cash management as of this morning, at some point
early this morning. And I include this because it shows you the original
appropriation by this body, adjustments that were directed; that would
be the distribution of state wide reserves is on the left hand column:
adjusted appropriation.
The appropriation balance in the vernacular is money that is still in
the saving account and hasn't been moved to checking. To be used for the
medicaid budget. So, it was money appropriated by the general assembly,
the state budget has not allocated because it has not been needed thus
far. And then on the right hand side, all those gross' and nets', come
down to a current balance on hand, again, of one-hundred and twenty-five
million dollars in the checking account today. As the agency has to
spend the balance of this week and on into the first week of July;
wrapping up payments, making adjustments for federal draws, and doing
the final accounting around the medicaid budget.
Estimates for the year, that is being discussed here for the next year.
No adjustment was made in the governors' budget for what they call their
fund eleven-ten , eleven-o-one, their administrative fund. Because we
done make adjustments for state positions, staffing, payroll, or rally
costs in a ?? process so that was omitted. The funds that relate to
claims administration cc and c and other provider payments were
reviewed; using various different scenarios.
We looked at the scenario of a claims backlog of a high of three-hundred
and ten million, a low of two-hundred and fifteen. We looked at growth
that ranged from three point nine percent to five point three percent to
five point seven percent, and our result in doing that was producing,
one, a negative ?? on the low end; and we were not comfortable with
recommending a cut to the medicaid budget for next year. It created a
high, on the other end, of about forty-one million dollars and somewhere
in that range the fifty million dollar medicaid risk reserve was
proposed to both adjust for the high and low, as well as, potential
growth should it occur.
Other more technical adjustments were made because we understood the
base line of the current year would not be adequate for funding for next
year because we would have to take into account, and the department did
in their backup worksheets for developing this estimate, took into
account the items you see on this page. I'll just point out a couple of
them because it's a lot of words but most of what..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The high points would be great.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The high points would be great.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Most of what this, the couple that I would point out
is that we assumed a lower ACA woodwork effect, that's the first bullet.
I would point out that the inactive budget planned fifty-one thousand
kids to go from health choice to medicaid, and ultimately that number
was quit a bit higher. So, you'll see in these bullets that we both
annualized as a normal ?? what you'd given us for the fifty-one but also
assumed impact of the twenty-thousand additional children that were
moved over.
And finally based on this information ?? based on our high and low
estimating, based on a total backlog combined that did not
differentiate, the governor did not recommend a traditional ?? but
instead felt that the five-hundred and fifty-seven million that had been
enacted or the growth, net growth of one-hundred and forty-six was
adequate when combined with medicaid risk reserve, and when combined
with the remaining one-hundred million dollars on the bottom-line. Mr.
Chairman that completes my portion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you for that presentation. Senator Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I guess to start this I just
need to clarify one because I think that I've heard something that
finally gave me an answer to several other questions that I've got. What
your estimating as the backlog, both enrollments and payments, really
doesn't have anything to do with either component it's just the
difference between what we've actually spent and what someone's
estimated we would spend.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: May I respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Senator..</p>

<p id="090:00">
I am glad. Yes and no. What we attributed backlog was the difference
between spread of the budget for claims growth and the actual plus
estimated expenditure, but I would point out that it wasn’t based on
nothing; it was based on the assumptions that were already in place for
13-15 for the growth being built in for ACA and the other components.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So if information, to follow-up – and this will
probably be a series, if that’s okay, Mr. Chair. So if information from
the hospitals indicated that at additional 500 million was owed to
hospitals in state dollars, that would neither impact the spend nor the
estimated budget spend, so those wouldn’t change that number. Now you
would have to change if you completely changed methodologies because you
saw it, but none of those factors will impact that number because it’s
always been the difference between the actual and expected budget
numbers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, you are absolutely focusing in,
zeroing in on the differences in approaches, but there’s not a
disconnect there. Actually from our perspective, every time a
check-write has been lower, and it’s been 205 million dollars lower over
the course of the year, rather than that being good news, that just
means the backlog’s bigger. It is absolutely crucial as a starting
point, when you’re check-writes are lower than budget, why? That’s what
you’re getting at; that’s what we’re getting at. One reason, and
hopefully a good reason, is lower utilization at lower cost. We do think
that is a factor. We think lower enrollment. We think that is a positive
factor because we think the woodworking effect has been lower, but it is
also due to backlogger claims, which we have discussed, and the backlog
enrollment, so we then look at those enrollment figures and the
backlogger claims as a reality check as to why we were below the
check-write, and that’s where there’s uncertainly for all of us due to
the data, that’s where there’s some disagreements on the number, which
I’ll be glad to summarize once I get to my conclusion, but then I go by
my reality check to see why are we lower than the check-write, and does
that mean we’ll be lower next year, or next year’s going to be worse
when we get called up with a backlog of claims, called up with a backlog
of enrollments. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And using
that methodology, doesn’t it make the entire method incapable of
identifying a shortfall in this year? Because what happens is at the
culmination at which expected equals those, we’ve assumed that the
backlog is now zero. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not sure I ?? but let me try
and answer your question this way. In a literal cash flow sense, there
is no backlog this year because the check-write was lower than budgeted
and we have cash on hand. We all agree and always know there are pending
claims that have been incurred this year and billed this year which are
not being paid until July, and then the question is what is the
increased amount of claims that will be billed in July, and that’s why
we did carry… actually, we recommended carrying forward the money in
reversions and health and services to pay for it. The General Assembly’s
taken the approach of recovering that money and appropriating the same
dollars a second time, which different way to get to it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I think but the problem with
that comes if there is a problem resulting, which I believe that there
is, from the implementation of two systems, one that’s not paying
providers and the other that’s not processing applications that’s coming
through. That risk cannot only be understated but could potentially not
exist in another budget model that exists because all that we look at is
how much we spend versus how much we expected to spend. If there is a
fear in there that that risk is higher – that providers aren’t getting
paid or that individual applications aren’t getting paid – all that will
show up next year as a shortfall with everybody turning around and
looking what happened, what it came through, but if we don’t make the
budget associations and the reductions in the budget to account for
that, they grow another year so when we’re making those cuts coming back
in May, we’re not only having to make them at the levels we had to make
them this year; we have to make them for the growth in that spending
level as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, the methodology you’re
describing and concerned with is the methodology this Senate and House
adopted last year. The document didn’t have my fingertips earlier.
Everyone has seen this. It’s the money report from last year’s
appropriations bill. This particular…</p>

copy, it's page G4 of the annotated version that came out in the fall,
item #66, medicaid rebates. I'll go ahead and read it: It provided
medicaid funding for the continuation of the program as the current
levels adjusted for changes in enrollment, ?? of enrollment consumption,
new services and new policies, additionally rebates, it includes the
impact of change in federal match, ?? in reductions, not fully implement
during fiscal year 12-13, an extension of medicaid in former foster care

year, and 557 million compared ?? increase to 557 million next year.
There already is an increase in here. But Senator, this methodology
which this Senate chose to adopt is what's been described as the macro
approach. It does not have a breakdown of enrollment growth from normal
medicaid activities, though it does have a separate item, #68 for
woodworking  affordable care act which does have a head count and does
the calculation on that basis, which we know we're below now,  and I
think there may be a concensus  even when the pending claims get
processed we'll be below,  and then a separate item for the transfer of
the transfer of the ??. So the governor's budget starts with the budget
enacted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just say on that, respectfully the method we are using for calculating
this budget is the method the department was using to report to
oversight, and every one of our oversight meetings in breaking down
these categories show us what our budget risk was, and is a method they
continued to use until OSBM began to write  the governor's budget and
then we went back to a different method.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will let DHS address if you want them to, on what items were addressed
at what point in time. But with the summer, I think that we're at- Sen.
Hise I believe you and I are in agreement, We used one methodology in
last year's budget, and the governor's continued to use that
methodology, It should have what I call a reality check based on actual
claims enrollment, and pending applications backlog and enrollment, I
think we were again ready to go into my conclusion just off hand, if I
may, I'll go with my conclusion or defer to the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you want to follow up? Pursue that, Sen. Hise, or...
We've run out of time here so before we do that we have one more
presentation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One page.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, one page. Alright, go ahead and do your page, and then we'll...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? I know this is again too small for you to read, but this is our
conclusion in trying to respond to some of the issues we just discussed
in  the letter from the co-chairman of the committee received last year,
again, the good news is that on a cash basis, there was no short fall,
no need for supplemental funding this year, we're carrying cash forward
that can be applied to the backlog claims and/or enrollment.
So that's the second part of the good news. So the unfortunate news that
Sen. Hise and we all know, we got lousy information. We do have a new
computer system, there is uncertainty. There's the uncertainty of the
affordable care act. There's enrollees not being enrolled when ??. So
that is absolutely the bad news. Here's one of the key differences: OSBM
respectfully disagrees with the final medicaid budget as prepared by the
general assembly's fiscal research division, because it had a claims
backlog analysis that appears to include a major mathematical error
treatment between the state dollars and whole dollars. It's not just the
nature of Carolina healthcare or other providers as a starting point.
The calculation's done on that and we look forward to work with fiscal
research to resolve what appears to be an error. But I will note
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? all the way to the very beginning, page four. Thank you. Right here,
you will see a fiscal research division memorandum that we recieved on
the 24th that had original medicaid backlog calculation. On June 17th,
10 days ago when this was revised on the 24th, the old backlog was $26
million. That got revised upwards to $212 million on June 24th. Fiscal
research numbers change, I understand they change, we're all getting new
information. The governor's recommended budget was based on information
we had through March that we had to go to print with in early May,
though in fact when we predicted $205 million difference between the
check write and the budget which is reflected of, includes difference in
backlog, we were actually  right on the point. But Senators, I think
this is one of the key issues, its a facutal issue that can be resolved,
between the fiscal research division and office of state budget
management, and then renarrow the differences between the House and the
Senate. Absolutely is one of the crucial issues</p>

<p id="100:00">
... that needs to be addressed and I think can be resolved, and I’m
sorry I just went past my end, but going back to there, you also have
the written statement, and I do think that Senator Berger and members of
the Senate, we are close on the application backlog analysis of
different approaches on PMPM, but as far as the numbers, I think we are
very similar there, so that’s not a major difference. I also ?? asked
about responding to a backlog increase of 151 million dollars, but due
to the lack of detail, I could not identify that number in the materials
we were sent. It didn’t say whether it’s talking about cumulate backlog,
applications and/or claims… We just couldn’t address that. If we can get
more information, that would be try and address that. In regard to 250
million dollar figures, absolutely, we do endorse the Governor’s
recommended budget. So far we’ve proved right by confirmation of how
much we thought the final gap would be between this year’s budget and
the check-writes on the actual revenue, and right on amount of cash we’d
be able to carry forward, and again, the methodology in funding’s good.
Senator Hise, whilst anticipating your question, the methodology in
funding level is based on the appropriations as to 2013, Senate Bill 402
and the committee report which I just referred you to, and again, as ??
indicated because there is risk and uncertainty, repeating myself, the
Governor’s recommended budget has 50 million dollars recommended to risk
reserve and we left 100 million dollars un-appropriated. If the Senate
agrees and we can work with correcting errors with Fiscal Research
Division, if we’re correct or if some middle ground there, on a factual
basis, I really do think that the Governor and the Senate may not be
very far apart on numbers. I think we may actually be much closer than
we think, and on behalf of the Governor, OSBM does look forward to
continuing to work with both the Senate and the House for a balanced
budget that meets the needs and priorities of the citizens of North
Carolina without incurring unnecessary obligations, and we very much
look forward to the continuing professional working relationship between
DHHS, OSBM and the Fiscal Research Division. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Pope for your report. Senator Tucker, we’re trying to wrap this up.
Do you want to go ahead and ask a question real quick? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir. I just want to make a comment. Mr. Pope and your staff, I
appreciate you being here. I hope you’re right. I want you to be right.
It would be my pleasure after four years of being a Senator to be able
to pass a painless budget, one that has virtually no cuts and everybody
gets most of what they want, but I do hope you’re right and I do respect
what you’ve done here for the Senate, and the press says we’re here to
trade barbs; no, we have a disagreement in methodology and numbers.
There’s nothing about trading barbs from my standpoint. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Pope. Appreciate it. Now Fiscal
Research is going to take about five minutes to make a few comments, and
then we’ll conclude with a question from Senator Rucho. Hopefully the
House Appropriations will bare with us just a minute. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair and members of the committee, we were asked early on this
year, Fiscal Research, to prepare a range, since we could not provide a
forecast due to data limitations for best and worst case scenario. This
year is significantly different from last year, as you’ve heard from
State Budget and you’ve heard from HHS because of the issues with the
two systems they’ve implemented. We feel like in Fiscal Research,
looking at actual data and looking at cash surplus is a risk, a very
high risk if you’re trying to say… if you want to equate  a cash
situation with an actual budget situation, and so what we’ve attempted
to do was say “Here’s the actual budget we have. Does it makes sense or
are there other factors that could be contributing to why we have this
excess cash on hand?” Is it because providers have not been paid timely?
Is it because applications have not been processed timely at the local
level? So these are things that you build into your worst case scenario.
It’s not an absolute, we don’t know that those are the absolute cases,
but it’s something that you build into your analysis if you want to make
sure you provide all the information you need in providing the General
Assembly with a worst case scenario, so that’s what we’ve attempted to
do. We’re happy to look at our calculations and get back together with
State Budget and follow-up if we need to with the General Assembly on
our calculations. We would like to, Mr. Chair, talk about areas where we
respectfully disagree with State Budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have
questions of the committee of Fiscal Research? Steve. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Steve Owen, Fiscal Research. Mr. Chair and members of the committee.
What I’ve been asked to do is really highlight those areas where there
are major differences. In terms of 2013-14, I think clearly the biggest
area of difference is the backlog, and how those are calculated and what
the ultimate numbers are. The importance of that number, the
significance of that number is that the 2013-14 spending is the basis
for the 2014-15 rebase and budget.</p>

<p id="105:00">
so we go into, in terms of a base spending level, the difference between
the fiscal research worst case and the LSPM backlog, with some 248
million dollars of difference. So that's the base difference of where we
start. The second area of difference is when you look at the growth
factors. Fiscal research assumed a 1.1% growth at enrollment, and a 4.2%
growth in utilization, based on CMS accuarial information and forecasts
for the futre. LSPM used a range of 3.9 to 5.7, which is an effective
rate of 4.8. So we start with  a lower number, and we're growing it and
fiscal research's number is growing at a higher rate. So you've got this
one lower number with LSPM and a lower growth rate. In terms of
annualized budget reductions, LSPM is slightly more aggressive in terms
of their assumptions around budget reductions and how they will affect
next year, about 11.5 million dollars difference in terms of state
dollars.
A large area of difference is the woodwork. We assume in the fiscal
research worst case a cost mixture of 59.1 million, LSPM assumes a cost
of 11 million dollars, so there's a 48 million dollar difference in that
number. There's also in the fiscal research worst case, a $5.5 million
impact for presumptive eligibility, and then there are also two factors
in the fiscal research worst case around assumptions around a changing
mix of enrollment, and then there was a more expensive average enrollee,
as well as changes in a provider utilization of practice patterns, and
result in response  to reductions in rates. The terms of the change in
F-map were pretty much the same.  But those were the major differences
when you look at what LSPM and fiscal research has done in the worst
case scenario.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that report. Questions to the committee? I know Sen. Rucho
has a question of [??] with the hospital association.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Hugh Tillson would be the one I'd like to
speak with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Mr. Tillson, Hugh Tillson, are you in the- There he is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, while he's coming up, on slide number 29 on Mr. Pope's
presentation talking about hospital and affiliated physicians numbers,
the estimated state share was $18.5 million, our goal Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee, is to be sure that we have sufficient dollars
set aside to make sure that the providers are taken care of, of course
backlog, and applications for the enrolees and the like. And you know,
we are sustaining about a 5.3% growth rate in the medicaid numbers. The
concern that I have, and I'd like to direct a question to Mr. Tillson if
I, Mr. Tillson, as you represent hospitals in this particular slide, Mr.
Pope's 18.5 million is what was estimated to be the state's share of
paying your expenses for your hospitals. Under I guess a yes and no
answer is, do you believe that 18.5 is sufficient to carry the cost for
the accounts receivable and unprocessed claims, yes or no?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question: The numbers that we get on our survey were
significantly higher, I think we were looking at 134-160 million, but
Mr. Tillson, it would probably be a very positive answer for us one way
or another to know exactly whether that is a legitimate number to make
sure our hospitals are protected and our patients are taken care of. I
guess the question to you then would be, and you can go back to your
CEOs, if that 18.5 is sufficient and if you have confidence in that
number will you go ahead and ask your CEOs to sign a claims waiver so
that it doesn't exceed that cost, and therefore we can be assured that
this number is accurate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, may I respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes you may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our interest is ensuring that number is right. I don't know whether 18
is right, we surveyed our members in April and asked them for their best
case scenario and their number was higher than that, and that's what's
in the data that we provided to your staff. We will go back and ask our
members what we think that that number is, how we've already started
that process as you might have anticipated given today's conversation,
we hope to have those data sooner rather than later and we will follow
up with you and your staff with the correct email addresses, and I
sincerely apologize for that, and we will do that as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p id="110:00">
?? I think that we’re all concerned about real numbers. I think we have
one agreement that the numbers are in question at best, because of the
computer problems of DHHS, and a prudent business person would take the
worst case scenario, as Senator Hise alluded to earlier, not to find
ourselves with a $200 or 300 million shortfall in the previous year as
we’ve done in the past. And I would hope that the Senate would continue
working with OSMB and basically come out with a real number that we can
have confidence in when we sign off on this budget. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Rucho. Other comments to
the committee? Senator Pate, are you getting ready to raise your hand?
[LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a
comment. Last night I was at an event in my district and there was a
large crowd there. The Governor was there as a guest. And he and I had a
few minutes together to speak with each other and of course the subject
quickly came up to the budget. And I asked about some of the disparities
between the budget that has been proffered by the Governor and the House
and our recommended budget, and I asked about some of the information
that we’ve talked about here today and his answer to me was not tell you
what we do not know. And that was reiterated a couple times and I just
wonder how that squares with some of the information we’ve heard here
today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Pate. There certainly are
lots of vagaries in these estimates but after this discussion hopefully
we will be able to get together and resolve the differences so that we
can come up with a budget for next year. Certainly the numbers for 2013
14 are vague and the numbers for 2014 15, we just can’t be sure of them.
But hopefully we’ll be able to get together and work this out shortly.
This committee is adjourned. Thank you.</p>
