It did allow however a surface owner to opt to have the department
sample this water supplies in lieu of the oil and gas operator. This
legislation would allow, would eliminate the option for the department
to test the water supplies but in lieu of that, allow a land owner to
slattern independent third party which would have to be a laboratory
certified by the department's waste water- ground water laboratory
certification program. At the top of page 15, the legislation would also
allow the developers and operators to share analytical results with each
other, and also would require them to provide the department the
analytical results of testing within 30 days.
The next section, section 13 is a provision that is modeled after nearly
identical provision in the statutes governed hazardous waste facilities.
The provision here would invalidate local ordinances that prohibit or
have the affect of prohibiting oil and gas exploration development and
production activities in specifically the draft would invalidate
ordinances that prohibit the siding of wells, prohibit the ease of
horizontal drilling or hydraulic fracturing or place any restriction or
condition not placed by the statutes that govern oil and gas upon oil
and gas exploration, development, and production activities or with
those ordinances or which would in any manner be in conflict or
inconsistent with the statutes governing oil and gas.
The next section of the bill, section 14 on page 17, there is a new
section that would outline 21, require the department to require from
oil and gas operators that all the natural oil and gas stations
associated with oil and gas operations be located inside a bath hold
building.
The next new provision on page 17, line 24 would be an explicit
prohibition on the subsurface injection on waste. This is already
prohibited under existing law in other statutes, the other chapters on
the general statutes, but this would include that explicit prohibition
in the chapter that governs oil and gas activities.
The next new section would be on page 17 line 29, it's titled
environmental compliance review requirements for applicants and permit
holders. This provision is modeled after similar provision that is
applicable to permits for land fills, and is often commonly referred to
as the bad after statute. The provision would allow the department to
examine an applicant and that includes their officers, directors,
partners, managers, and affiliated entities for their history of an
environmental compliance within our state and within federal rules and
regulations as well as other states, and would authorize the department
to deny a permit based on findings under their environmental compliance
examination.
The next new section on page 18, starting at line 23, is a provision
that concerns a size-mic or Geo physical data collection. It would
provide that no liability for a trespass would arrive from activities
that are conducted for the purpose of size-mic or Geo physical data
collection. If a person has a land owner's written consent enter the
land for these activities, or if they conduct these activities by under
shooting from an offside location, and without physical entry to private
land. If these activities are conducted through physical entry to land
without land owners written consent, that would result in violation, and
it would be a class one misdemeanor. The provision further provides the
persons that conduct sight.(END OF AUDIO)</p>

?? physical data collection are civilly liable for any physical or
property damage determined to be a direct result of the seismic and
geophysical data collection activities, whether or not these physical
activities were conducted by undershooting the land at an offsite
location or by physical entry to land. The next section: Section 15,
starting at line 36, on page 18, chapter 87 of the general statutes,
governs water well contractors. Section 98.4 of the chapter establishes
certification requirements. There are a host of exemptions under this
statute to clarify that these requirements are not applicable to well
contractors that are not water well contractors. So, line 49, oil and
gas well contractors are exempted from these certification requirements
as well. Now, Mr. Co-Chair, I'm going to turn it over to Heather for
severance tax. [Speaker Changes] Thank you, ??. You guys know why we
have the best staff in the world? Before Heather, before you move on,
I'd like to recognize, too, the ?? members we have in the audience,
Sharon Womack, thank you for being in here, Charlotte Mitchell, thank
you guys for being here today. Appreciate your hard work. We have a
little bit of change of schedule, I think Jeff Warren's gonna cover
Severance Tax, is that correct, Jeff? (laughter) Obviously not, I
believe Heather ??. Thank you very much, and you have, you have the
floor. [Speaker Changes] Thank you, and I'm happy to do so [Speaker
Changes] Heather, hold on, one second, ?? Haynes, I would like to extend
the courtesy out to you, if you have questions,  please ask them.
[Speaker Changes] The Severance Tax portion is  on pages 19 to 25 of the
bill and it's Section 16 through 18. At this point, it may be more
useful if you want to look on your bill summary on page 5 of the bill
summary is a chart of the rates. It may be better to follow along by
looking at the chart. The bill first repeals the old Severance Tax,
since we're currently not collecting any taxes over these, under these
old severance taxes. And it creates a new method to collect severance
taxes on oil, gas, and related ??. The tax base for oil ??, will be the
gross price paid. The tax base for gas will be the delivered to market
price. As you may remember from the March presentation on severance
taxes, you can either tax on the wealth people had or you can tax on the
delivered to market value of the gas. And that is actually actual gross
price paid minus the cost incurred by the producer to get the gas from
the mouth of the well to the first purchaser. So, if you'll refer to the
chart, it has the tax rate</p>
