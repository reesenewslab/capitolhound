Wapa de-annexation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They would like to de-annex a portion of the town.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabon, there is a motion by Senator Tillman
for a favorable report on house bill 1080. Any questions, or comments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Where is Wapa?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's along the portion of the railroad track that has
been pulled up between Wilmington and Wallace, and you can't really get
there anymore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You don't want to know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. Then, any other questions and comments
regarding house bill 1080. We have a favorable report for house bill
1080, all in favor please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed nay, aye's have it. Senator Rabin, you've got
one victory, so try member senate bill 731, Southport Occupancy Tax
Modifications.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. That's another local bill requested by the town
of Southport, twice in antiquity. Southport, do you want to take that
motion? Or you want me to??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, that's a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a technical amendment that we want to add to
this one, and then you can have a chance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Before he does, I have, I've got a comment on that
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, let us take the technical amendment ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Twice in antiquity Southport has been giving
the, given the ability to have an occupancy tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabon, Senator Rabon, we have a technical
amendment for your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh well, yes, we're gonna change one word, I believe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. We're just gonna change, on page one, line
six, the word enacted, should actually be the word amended. We will
delete the word enacted, and substitute the word amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, any questions about that
technical correction. Seeing none, all in favor, please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed nay. Ayes have it. Alright, we have a
favorable report from Senator Rabin. But, I have a question from Senator
Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Before we jump into that colonel. Senator Rabon,
that's in your neck of the woods, and whatever you do to those folks, I
usually say that's good. But now you're doing it to me. I come down
there for a whole week, second week in August. I spend with all of my
kids and grand kids with the place. I want to spend ten thousand dollars
in that week, what's that gonna cost me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Nothing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Because you're on Oak Island, but if you'll come to
Southport, we'll take your money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, dialogue goes through the chair. We only want
relevant, and pertinent questions Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, and since Senator Tillman said
this. Can we have the department of revenue audit his spending at
Southport, and see if he indeed, Senator Tillman ain't spent ten
thousand in his lifetime.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's taxpayer money, i'm spending. That's tax payer
money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, that probably has some relevancy to finance,
but not today. Okay. We have senate bill 731 Southport Occupancy Tax
Modifications as.</p>

… recommended for a favorable report. Any discussion? Any questions?
Seeing none, all in favor please say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, nay. Ayes have it. Senator Rabin, Senate Bill
846, Shallotte De-annexation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Shallotte, yes. Not Charlotte. It is Shallotte, and this is just another
simple de-annexation of a couple tracks of land in the town of
Shallotte. They thought they were growing at one time; they decided to
?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me Senator Rabin, one point. We do have a
PCS on this. I have Senator Meredith made a motion that we accept the
PCS for Senate Bill 846, Shallotte De-annexation for discussion, and all
in favor, please say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, nay. Ayes have it. Please continue to do your discussion on…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The PCS language, what I have to say about it’s the
same as what I was saying about the other bill, so it’s just a simple
de-annexation of a couple tracks of land that that the locals don’t need
and the people that own it don’t want to be there. They said “We want
out” and the city said “That’s fine with us.” [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a
motion from Senator Meredith that the favorable report for PCS Senate
Bill 846. Any discussions or questions? Seeing none, all in favor please
say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, nay. Ayes
have it. Senator Rabin, thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, members. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s move onto
House Bull 346, Governing bodies Collect Unpaid Judgments,
Representative Faircloth. Representative, welcome to the Senate Finance
Committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the
committee. This bill arose out of a situation where a person was
actually being taken against a person for a nuisance, closing up a
nightclub. The person brought suit against the city for discrimination,
lost the suit, and the court ordered that the person pay the city 11
thousand and some few dollars to reimburse expenses. Later on that
person ran for council, was elected to the council, did not pay his
judgment, refused to pay it. Assets were moved so that the city could
not collect; they tried several different ways to do it. So this bill in
a case like that allows the city, where the person refuses to  pay the
judgment, allows the city to garnish wages on behalf… in order to pay
the city back for the debt. That’s a pretty simple process. It wasn’t
available before; this makes it available. It also… [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Faircloth, we have a favorable report from Senator
Tillman on your House Bill 346. Members of the committee, any additional
questions or comments? Seeing none, all in favor of the favorable report
for House Bill 346, Governing Bodies Collect Unpaid Judgments, please
say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, nay. Ayes
have it. Representative Faircloth, who would you want to have take care
of that bill for you on the Senate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade. Very good. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Chairman and committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Let’s go
onto House Bill 1034, Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Finances.
Representative Howard, welcome to the committee. Members of the
committee, this is a PCS, and we ask for a motion from Senator Tillman
for willingness to accept House Bill 1034 PCS for discussion. Welcome,
Representative Howard, and during this, members of the committee, there
is a financial memo on this bill for your perusal, and would you,
Representative Howard, be kind enough to also explain the change from
where you had it to what’s before us with the PCS? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Yes sir. I believe there’s been one, actually it would be
considered a technical amendment, repealing a local act pertaining to
Mebane’s firemen’s supplemental retirement fund at the request of
Mebane’s fire chief. That’s one change, and the second change is the
clarifying the volunteer rescue EMS funds that’s granted for equipment
and capital improvements must be used for purposes related to emergency
medical service…</p>

… over a 20-year time span, so looking at all of those things, we just
felt if there was any other benefits that we could offer to these
volunteers, and they are truly volunteers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of
the committee, any additional questions? Senator Tarte. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just a comment, if I may. As a new
member, I think this is a classic example of how we deal with a very
important subject matter, and I tip my hat to the Chairs of the PED
Oversight Committee, Senator Hartsell and Representative Julia Howard,
and this is where I don’t think the public has a good appreciation.
There are months and months of work that went into this. Again, the
expert staff under John Turcotte and the PED people that worked on this
hours after hours, the vetting, the work with the stakeholders; this
demonstrates the process works well, and Senator Ford, I know that the
appreciation for the comments we make in this, but a lot of thought has
gone into this and this is a good bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith, did you have a comment or question? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
No thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any additional questions by members of
the committee? Representative Howard, I know we talked about this last
time wit Senator Tucker, and what you’re telling us after these hard
work that you put together and all that, that these folks are not going
to come back and visit us anymore along with honorable Debbie Clary. Let
her answer this one first. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I thought you’d come get me
out of that. The issue has been the workers’ compensation fund, and yes
sir, that fund is stabilized and there will be no further need for those
folks to come back and ask you to do general fund appropriations for the
workers’ compensation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Tillman, we
do have a seat for you if you’d like. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve been
sitting down most of my life. I think it’s interesting, that wonderful
speech that… I know he’s not a lawyer, but Senator Tarte needs the ??
for a committee speech. I don’t think we give them but that was a
wonderful speech. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Tillman. Members
of the committee, we do have a motion a little while back from Senator
Apodaca for a favorable report on the PCS of House Bill 1034, Volunteer
Fire and Rescue Finances, and an unfavorable to the original bill. Any
additional questions or comments? Seeing none, all in favor please say
aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, nay. Ayes have
it. Thank you. Representative Howard, who would you like to manage that
one for you? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, there’s a sequential
referral to Pensions and Retirement. We’re going to run it through.
We’ll get it through in the next couple days. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. And Senator Hartsell will manage that on the floor. Thank you.
Let’s go ahead and get onto Senate Bill 729, Coal Ash Management Plan.
Senator Apodaca, there is a fiscal memo in with this bill. Senator
Apodaca, welcome to this committee. It’s good to see you this early in
the morning. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Rucho. It’s also good
to see you. Senator Tillman, we’re not giving the ??; we’re giving the
Eddie Haskell award, for those of us who remember Leave it to Beaver, to
Senator Tarte. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Your discussion should be on coal ash
management. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, members. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] On the fiscal note, or the financial part of it, by the way,
Senator Apodaca. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would
you like staff to help you? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, are you prepared to…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Heather ?? I believe will be able to help you with this. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I think that would be great. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes sir. If you would turn to page 43 of the bill –this is in
the very back of the bill – the finance portion of the bill actually
creates a new regulatory fee. You’re probably all familiar with the
regulatory fee that is used to pay the cost of the Utilities Commission
and the public staff. This is very similar but it’s a new fee. It’s not
an increase of that fee; it is a new fee, and it will be a fee of .03
percent on the North Carolina jurisdictional revenues of each public
utility with a coal combustion residual surface impoundment. So this fee
will be used to pay for the coal ash management cost, and this fee is
going to actually be used to pay for the 25 positions in DENR that are
used for coal ash management and the four commissions at the Coal Ash
Management Commission, and that’s the only finance portion in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, would you like to add anything to the
previous explanation? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I would, Mr. Chairman. And
this fee must be paid by the utility; it cannot be passed onto the
consumer.</p>

<p id="20:00">
Alright, you've heard the financial portion of Senate Bill 729 who
Senator Apodaca's been working on diligently for quite a while. I need a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Curtis offers a motion for favorable report Senate Bill 729,
Coal Ash Management Plan. Any additional questions or discussion? Seeing
none. All in favor please say aye. Opposed nay. Aye's have it. Thank
you, Senator Apodaca, we appreciate you being here today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, let's go on to Senate Bill 742, Adjust Utility Regulatory Fees
and Senator Hartsell will be managing this bill today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Utility regulatory
fees again. This bill is a result of a study commission or an LRC study
that looked into the modifications necessary to look at utility
regulation in the telecommunications industry. It is a consensus piece
of legislation, insofar as I'm aware, to address jurisdictional and non
jurisdictional revenues and how that's impacted in what the nature of
the, how it's imposed, where it's imposed, the timing it's imposed, and
the gradation of it's imposition. For additional details I would, Mr.
Chairman, defer to Ms. Finnell but be glad to otherwise answer-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Finnell, you have something you would like to add to the explanation
of Senate Bill 742?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright. No additional members of the committee? Oh, pardon me. Okay,
I'm sorry. Senator Krawiec, please. Welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. A lot of work has gone into this bill. I think it's
long overdue and I would like to move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. We have a motion before us of a favorable report for Senate
Bill 742. Members of the committee, any additional questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, Yes sir, welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. I'm glad to be here early in the morning and of course
at our age we're always glad to be seen early in the morning. Question
for Senator Hartsell, Senator Hartsell this is just for
telecommunications?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's essentially what it's for, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now as far as I know that's what it's for, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Finnell will help with that explanation, Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, Senator Tucker, over the past 20 years the federal and state
governments have been largely deregulating phone service so it breaks
out the phone service retail services that are basically open to
competition and subjects them to a lower utility rate. All of the other
remaining public utility jurisdictional revenues that are not open to
competition, including the wholesale rate of telephone providers, are
going to be subject to the full utility reg fee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What was that last sentence? I did not hear the last sentence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, the wholesale revenue juris-, jurisdictional revenues, excuse
me, of telephone providers. So the wholesale component that's not open
to competition and all the revenues of all other public utilities, so
your electric providers, your piped natural gas, those will still be
subject to the full regulatory fee. We're breaking out the competitive
revenues for telephone and subjecting them to a lower fee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Simply because of the nature of the deregulation of the industry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, you all set?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright. Seeing no additional comments, questions, or debate we have a
favorable report from Senator Krawiec regarding a favorable report
Senate Bill 742, Adjust Utility Regulatory Fee. Seeing no additional
comments or questions, all in favor please say aye. The opposing opinion
say nay. Aye's have it. Alright, Senator Hartsell, and you'll be
managing that on the floor? Senator Brown? Okay. Alright, members of the
committee, we have no other business before us. As we start closing
down, hopefully, we will notified if there are additional meetings of
the Finance Committee but we appreciate you being here early this
morning and getting our business done expeditiously. Meeting is
adjourned.</p>
