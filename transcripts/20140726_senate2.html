Please join me as we pray.
Lord in the book of Psalm 191, you tell us this: He that dwelleth in the
secret place of the most High shall abide forever under the shadow of
the Almighty. I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress, my
God in Him will I trust. Lord you are our refuge and our fortress, in
you alone do we put our trust. We give you thanks, we sing praises unto
your name. You are God alone there is no other. We will make your name
known and your deeds among the people. Please receive our prayer through
the sacrifice of your son, Jesus. Amen.

House Bill 74, its third reading. Any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, for what purposed do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members, I know before
I&#39;d ask that you voted for it. That was very much conditional
because I believe that if we vote it down, we could have made some
changes. That&#39;s obviously no longer the case. So I will be
supporting this and ask that you support it. I think the regulatory
reforms that are in here are very important. I would just, I merely ask,
we&#39;re going to be back in several months and I have spoken to many
of you and hope that we can work to correct some serious problems I
think we have with student judicial on campus now. So, with that being
said, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barringer, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill&#39;s sponsor a question, if he&#39;ll
yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson? Go ahead, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. My concerns relate to the
part about the university honor system and if I could get some
clarification I would appreciate it. There&#39;s language in there that
says fully staffed by students. One of the clarifications I&#39;m
seeking is the UNC system, some of the schools do commonly use faculty
and staff in reviewing appeals. Would that violate the fully staffed by
students? What participation can faculty have in an advisory or
otherwise? Do you have any information there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, Senator Barringer, to my understanding
of this it would only apply to those that use all students.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. A follow up, please?

Senator Barringer we&#39;re going to cut your mic off pretty soon. For

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a point of personal privileged out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think now&#39;s the time. Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. On behalf of myself and Senator Warren Daniel, I
would like to share with you the exciting news that my hometown of
Shelby in Cleveland county, actually I&#39;m from Patterson Springs, but
the nearby town Shelby, is the permanent home of the 2013 Baseball World
Series and its going to be held on August 16th to the 20th. This is the
World Series for the American Legion Baseball. It&#39;s a very big deal
across the country. Legion baseball has been a wonderful, wonderful
influence on many, many players and many or most of the players in the
Major League played American Legion ball. I love my home area as much as
I do my adopted home, it is the home of Legion ball and liver mush. I
have sent forward this senatorial statement and I hope you join myself
and Senator Daniel in congratulating Cleveland County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator. We&#39;ll stand at ease for a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger,  for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To make an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Senate, it appears we have, and this number could change,
it appears we may have three more bills. One is the Charlotte Airport
bill that should be here, I think we&#39;ll be able to take care of that
in just a few minutes. The second is the Jordan Lake rules bill, which I
believe we have that one as well. I think there is a third bill that we
don&#39;t quite have yet for us to take care of so, once we have things
in place we should be ready to get started. Just for your purposed,
hopefully we can wrap this up within the next little, little bit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 380 CHARLOTTE DOUGLAS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT COMMISSION.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Current motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Senate, we have before us the Charlotte Airport
Commission. We&#39;ve had experience with a previous one dealing with
the authority. It was decided by members of the House trying to figure
out a way to work with the city of Charlotte and by no mean of my saying
that there was any negotiations of any sort. But by working with them,
they tried to come forward with a plan that would appeal to many of the
concerns that they had. What this bill does is establishes a commission
under the authority of the city. The city will maintain the ownership of
the airport and the facilities. The commission will operate the airport
and handle all the financial operations. The city will have the
authority for imminent domain and also will be responsible for issuing
bonds. They may employ the Executive Director as the city&#39;s
Aviation Department Administration has assigned to the commission.
During the interim, the airport advisory committee will be in place as a
commission until the appoints are made there will be thirteen members,
seven appointed by the city of Charlotte and the mayor and six by the
counties Mecklenburg and surrounding counties so it has the concept of a
regional airport. I urge the passage of this local bill and would
appreciate your vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if the distinguished gentleman would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You speaking about Senator Rucho? Senator Rucho do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Matthews.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He sure does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, can you help me since I ....
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Probably not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
...now know that I represent the 38th district in Mecklenburg County
which represents the west side. What exactly defines the west side in
section 5.53A?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The best I can guess there, for you, sir who serves the west side, is
folks that live in the vicinity of the airport on the west side of
Charlotte.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The west side, as I understand it, but not as you explained it,
encompasses more, but still the airport is so large. Are you open to
some language that would define that geographical area?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Graham for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the motion to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
More deception, more chaos, more confusion, more uncertainty, more
litigation. For what? And for whom? Last week, in this chamber, we
discussed the Charlotte Douglass International Airport. On third
reading, the bill sponsor said, enough has been said. All that needed to
be said was already said and he encouraged each and every one of you to
vote for the bill. The majority of you did. A week later, he&#39;s back
again. Bringing with him more chaos, more confusion, more uncertainty,
and more litigation. I said last week that...

  <p>end was in the beginning. Do you remember? It began with some members of
our community usurping the authority of the Charlotte city council. And
the mayor. Didn&#39;t even know about the airport takeover. Last night,
11:30 PM, calls around Charlotte coming to Raleigh asking &quot;What
bill are we talking about now?&quot; City council hadn&#39;t seen it. I
talked with the city manager about 11:30, quarter to 12, he was reading
it for the first time himself! The end is at the beginning. This is how
all this started. Now he&#39;s back again saying that he&#39;s doing the
city of Charlotte a favor. Now keep in mind, after the bill was passed
last week, the city council and the mayor fulfilled its fiduciary
responsibilities on behalf of the citizens of Charlotte and got the
third branch of government involved. And that&#39;s when the
backpedalling started. Everybody was moonwalking. Michael Jackson would
have been proud. Backpedaling because unlike the House or the Senate,
when opinions can pass as facts, in the court of law facts are facts.
Facts are facts. This compromise, as he&#39;d talked about, who were
they negotiating with? You can&#39;t go home and practice in the mirror
that you&#39;re negotiating and say that you&#39;re negotiating with
someone, you&#39;re negotiating with yourself. As chairman of the
delegation, I didn&#39;t know until 11:30, quarter to 12 last night!
There was no negotiation of folks working up here in a bipartisan way
trying to solve this problem. No no no, here we go again. Confusion,
uncertainty and deception. And you&#39;re a part of it. Because he told
you last week. Nothing&#39;s been said that this was a good bill. Do you
remember? Now here we are again in the wee hours of the morning
discussing a 12 billion dollar enterprise. No more answers this night,
this morning, than we had last week, and we&#39;re right back where we
started from. Right back where we started from. The city manager sent a
email and this is what he says about this supposed compromise where the
bill sponsors in the House and the Senate were negotiating with
themselves. Because they didn&#39;t negotiate with the city. Didn&#39;t
negotiate with the entire delegation, only a selected few. So who was
this negotiation compromise with? This is the city&#39;s high level
concern with this new last minute bill. We find more problems the more
we look. The bill is cobbled together with mishmills of municipal laws
and lacks any technical review of any airport financial or operation
matters. It seeks to improve optics through appointments, bond issuants,
and eminent domain. However a transfer from the city all responsibility
for control of the airport property, airport facilities, and all other
property held by the city of Charlotte, was with respect to the airport,
real or ??, tangible or intangible, and includes all cash. It looks like
it keeps the airport and the city, while at the same time taking away
from the city. It raises many legal questions that cause confusion and
instability at the airport. This is a huge gamble with the airport.

  <p>Why?  It&#39;s a simple question that I&#39;m asking my colleagues,
Democrats and Republicans, why?  In January of this year, the airport
was stable.  No uncertainty, clear direction, focusing on a major
merger, fulfilling its obligation to the region, and to the taxpayers of
the city of Charlotte.  Here we are, late July, regional uncertainty and
confusion.  Why do we want to pit the largest city in the state of North
Carolina against the state of North Carolina?  For what?  And for who?
Why would we want to do that?  Why would we want to take an enterprise
that&#39;s a, that&#39;s performing effectively and efficiently and
intentionally break it? For what and for who?  Why do we want to do
this?  Why do we want to create legislation in the middle of the night,
over bagels and coffee, and roll it out to the General Assembly to vote
on?  Why?  The Charlotte Observer&#39;s editorial states how not to
craft an airport compromise.  This is what happens when you rush, and
the slapsticks that play off legislative ineptitude this week,
Mecklenburg representative Bruce Samuelson has a one short span, back
peddled feverishly from a hasty and bad law that took Charlotte Douglas
Airport away from the city and ran with it.  Craft a hasty new
compromise bill with fellow legislatures over bagels in Raleigh, then
angrily pulled the vote Thursday when Charlotte officials decided it
wasn&#39;t much of a compromised, then decided to ram it through anyhow.
 Why?  Why?  Uncertainty, more confusion, more chaos.  I said yesterday
that this GOP has done a great job creating jobs.  The attorneys across
North Carolina are ecstatic.  The bond lawyers are jumping up and down.
Because even if you wanted to do it, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a
good idea, process matters.  Process matters.  We&#39;re not talking
about a business that, that we do in the Junior Achievement.  This is
real.  People&#39;s lives will be impacted from their employment.  No
one has even talked about the issues of the bonds.  We haven&#39;t even
got to that, and the impact that&#39;s going to have directly and
indirectly on every member here.  Every member here.  Your bonds, state
bonds.  No one has asked the question.  This is an embarrassment for the
Senate.  This is an embarrassment for the General Assembly.  This is an
embarrassment for the sponsors.  I don&#39;t know where we go from here,
other than to court, where we are currently. You, you might, you serve
the authority of the mayor, and the council, and the citizens of
Charlotte, but you can&#39;t do it to the courts.  At some point,
someone&#39;s going to have to put their hand.

but the truth about this airport situation. The nameless, faceless
business leaders who are supposed to support this are going to have to
show their face and stand by this bill and tell the citizens of
Charlotte why they think this is a good idea. And at that point, their
opinion doesn&#39;t matter. Only the facts. Who, what, when, where, and
why. And to what extent. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, this is a
fiasco of major proportion that will come back to hurt each and every
member here. I urge you to vote against the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Brunstead, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President it&#39;s been a long day, and I&#39;m tired. Some of the
arguments have started to repeat themselves to me, I must admit I&#39;m
getting a little tired of Sen. Graham and the way he&#39;s approaching
some of these arguments but he kept saying over and over again that this
was a usurpation of local authority. Usurpation of local authority. And
I thought that sounds awfully familiar to me. And then I went back and
remembered a fairly lengthy argument by Sen. ?? earlier on a Durham
bill. Usurpation of authority. Usurpation of authority. And I went and I
looked and at 2:30 this afternoon, Sen. Graham agreed with the
usurpation of local authority. But I guess that was an argument of
convenience. I think this was a good bill, I ask you to support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Ford, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, and ladies and gentlemen of the senate.
Those of you who remain open to a little bit of additional information,
I would like to share that with you from the city of Charlotte. But
before I do that, I want to remind my colleagues in Cabarrus, Gaston,
Iredell, Lincoln, and Union county who will receive appointments on this
board, that your neighbor, the city of Charlotte, has been a very good
neighbor. They have spent millions of their own money on regional
planning to benefit the region. So as you take your vote tonight,
consider what you&#39;re doing to your neighbor. The city of Charlotte
sent out some further information about this particular bill, and I want
to share them with you. The city of Charlotte continues to state
emphatically that this new bill is a cobbled together missmash of
municipal laws and lacks any technical review of airport or operational
matters. This bill is in reaction to our success in getting a temporary
restraining order against the bad bill, Senate bill 81, passed last
week. The city expects declaration of bond  default in issues with the
FAA. The General Assembly is gamblig with the airport, writing
legislation without knowledge of the consequences. The city is reviewing
all of its actions, to respond if the General Assembly continues down
this unneccessary path. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, this has no
end in sight. This is not good for the city of Charlotte, this is
definitely not good for our state. And we&#39;ve been taking up bills
all session dealing with each others&#39; local issues. And while I have
not been elected to local office, this is my first office, I continue to
believe that the local folks know what&#39;s best. This is a local
issue. It started in Charlotte and it needs to be solved in Charlotte.
One of the things that has disappointed me the most, and I shared this
with Sen. Rucho, is that when local businessmen cannot get their way,
they run up here like little kids to Raleigh, to try to get Raleigh to
manage our local cities. That&#39;s not a good idea. This is an idea
that was started by some local folks. The city of Charlotte has the
ability to solve its own problems. Further issues that I have with this,
and I&#39;ve

  <p>..this was Senator Rucho and I will share this with you. I shared it
with you before. I&#39;m an open minded individual. Senator Rucho came
to me with this idea and as a gentleman of this particular body I would
have been open because I want to do what is in the best interest of the
city of Charlotte. This approach, the way that we&#39;re doing this, is
not good for the city. I ask you to consider a cooling off period. Let
cool heads prevail, because right now you have two different bodies that
are going against each other. Spending tax-payer money to try to find a
solution, in my opinion, that we need to wait to solve. I thank you for
your consideration and those of you that might be open to giving this a
cooling off period and not supporting this motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to ask Senator Graham a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Graham, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know it&#39;s late and everyone&#39;s tired and so am I, I know this
is a local matter, but I&#39;m just trying to get straight on what
we&#39;re voting on and what&#39;s happening here. From what I&#39;m
looking at in this proposal, this bill is creating two agencies in the
city of Charlotte, from what I can read. One agency is the commission
that was described by Senator Rucho with the [seven minute??] members
from the city and other members from the region, that&#39;s one agency.
In the second agency has created a minor routine and oversight
committee. The second agency has five members on it appointed by the
Governor, the President Pro tem, Speaker of the House, the Mayor and one
from the city council and it is to monitor the commission. So I&#39;m
trying to figure out who is running the airport. The committee with the
state appointees predominating it, or the commission with the local and
regional people on it? Have I got this right and do you have an answer
to that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have it right. The commission would be responsible for the operation
of the airport and there will be an oversight the committee that&#39;s
watching as Big Brother, making sure they do their job correction.
Again, adding confusion, uncertainty, and a level of chaos to the
airport.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, to speak a second moment briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman, the model of the commission is already one that is
similar with the Charlotte Regional Visitor&#39;s Bureau, that is the
model that is followed. Secondly, what we have to pay close attention to
is, that TRO and I know everyone here understand that&#39;s the first
easy step in most cases when the judge says, hey we need to put it
aside. Unfortunately when a TRO goes into place, everyone is supposed to
stop. Unbelievably, the city of Charlotte and the manager decided,
irresponsibly, to fire the only person that knows how to run and operate
that airport, Mr. Orr, and that is an absolute disaster because now
it&#39;s floundering. And now it&#39;s in jeopardy. If this bill passes,
there can be some certainty established and that&#39;s something the
city, the region of the state needs to depend on and I urge that you
pass this immediately.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, to speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to address a comment that Senator Rucho made about the Aviation
Director. The Aviation Director in his haste and arrogance, chose to
write to the city of Charlotte, to inform them that he was no longer an
employee of the city of Charlotte and that he was going to be the new
Executive Director of the Airport Authority. What he did not know was
that the city of Charlotte was seeking a TRO. The city of Charlotte
obtained that TRO and the city manager accepted his resignation. Those
are the facts. This is a local, messy issue. We really need for a
cooling off period so cooler heads can prevail. The city of Charlotte
has stated it is going to do everything that it can do in its power to
protect that asset. Folks, I need your help tonight for you to be open
to give the city of Charlotte the opportunity to work this issue out
locally.

Sen. Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.
I figure since the area of Winston-Salem can weigh in on Charlotte,
certainly somebody from the mountains can. And we haven&#39;t got
anything better to do, we&#39;re sitting here waiting on stuff to come
in. I&#39;m gonna tell you what&#39;s missing in all this, this is
what&#39;s driving me crazy about this. We assume that when we turn our
faucet on the water&#39;s going to come out clean and pure like it
always has in Asheville. We assume that Charlotte International
Airport&#39;s going to continue to be one of the fastest growing, best
run major hubs in the United States of America and serve that region and
this state well. You&#39;re taking too much for granted, folks. When you
go mess with these kinds of structures, if you will, you risk losing
them or ruining them, and even if you don&#39;t, the threat of it is
enough to run everybody out of town. The governor&#39;s talking about
branding, and I found out when we did the clean smokestacks act, I
negotiated for a year and a half with business about how to do that, how
to pay for it. And I had a deal worked out where they could pay less in
their rates to do it my way. They ended up doing a deal with ?? to pay
more money, but it was guaranteed for a longer period of time because
they were scared somebody would have a rate hearing and costs would go
up. Business can&#39;t stand trauma. And if Charlotte loses that hub,
you will see, in my opinion, one of the biggest economic disasters we
could have in this state. And those in the surrounding counties that
think they&#39;re getting something, what you&#39;re gonna get is a
miss. If you don&#39;t have Charlotte humming, and the planes coming in
and out of there and the commercial hub of this state that they have,
you&#39;re gonna be in trouble. You&#39;re gonna have the unemployed
people, not the rural areas of the state. And I don&#39;t live there, I
live in Asheville. This is scaring me! But we&#39;re getting a bill a
week here! And if the last bill was such a great idea, do it! Anybody in
here think there wasn&#39;t gonna be a lawsuit? Of course there was.
Anybody think there wasn&#39;t going to be a TRO? Of course there was.
They&#39;re gonna fighting over this for the next 2 or 3 years. And
we&#39;ve got to quit doing this to want another. The people we
represent deserve more stability in their lives than to wake up and read
in the paper every day that something that&#39;s essential to the
economic vitality of their region had just been put in jeopardy. When
they went to bed, it was all right. And I urge you to think long and
hard about this at some point, we&#39;ve got to reach across the aisle
and stop this mess. Just because we have a partisan battle doesn&#39;t
mean the rest of us ought to jump in there and do crazy stuff.  What
starts happing is what happened to Sen. Pate, and all of a sudden
Granville&#39;s about to give its water system away to some little sewer
system up there in the corner of the county. It has about 3 employees.
And we had to get him out of the ditch. That&#39;s what starts happening
to you. Vote against this bill, let the other one play out, let them
have a good lawsuit and a good fight, maybe they&#39;ll get over it.

Senate bill 515. Let me make an announcement as we go into this, folks.
We have two more bills and that&#39;s it. They&#39;re here and we will
be going home after this. Senate Bill 515.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 515 Jordan Lake Water Quality Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I&#39;ll try to keep this real brief. First, let me just tell
you the difference between the Senate and House approach. As you do know
the Senate version repealed the Jordan Lake rules. What the House PCS
will do is this: it will keep in effect all rules that are currently in
effect. It will push out three years, rules that have not been adopted.
Also the House PCS will leave in the buffer rule changes in the original
bill that was filed and adds language to address the unique buffer
situations regarding airports. Just a little bit on the bigger picture.
As part of 515, it&#39;s kind of a three pronged approach that we are
using to improve the water quality in Jordan Lake, the bill itself only
delays the rules by three years that are not currently enforced. During
these three years, the State will front an in-lake water quality
demonstration project with $1.7 million from the clean water trust fund
and $300,000 from DENR, operating budget. By the way, DENR has worked on
this compromise bill and supports this action. Additionally, the
President ProTem&#39;s speaker can adopt an LRC study committee to
specifically study Jordan Lake policies during the interim. I appreciate
your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Discussion and debate. Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I tracked with DENR to find out the status of Jordan Lake. It is an
impaired body and it is at the point where it will go very quickly, past
the point where it can be restored. I&#39;ve spoken with experts about
whether it is possible to have some sort of technological fix. All the
experts agree there is no such technology, it&#39;s not even on the
horizon even though people have shopped something around. That the only
way to protect a major body of water like this, that is impaired, is to
not develop around the watershed. I urge you to reject this motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.   I will tip my hat to you all. You all were
honest. You just abolished the existing rules and then talked about
doing some technological marvel that was going to solve the problem. The
House just delays for three years so that I guess three years from now
they can kill the rules. While I commend your honesty, it was a bad idea
when you all eliminated the rules, it&#39;s a terrible idea to delay the
rules. I encourage you to vote against the motion to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none question before the
Senate, the motion to concur on Senate Bill 515. All in favor vote aye,
all against vote no. The clerk will allow five seconds for the vote and

  <p>The health cost transportation speaker and PPT standing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Who’s handling this? Senator Daniel, you have the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you Mr. President. I thought I was only
explaining Section 3, but apparently I’m explaining the whole bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator ?? senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would suggest Senator Daniel could defer to Senator
Rucho on the first part of the bill. Good luck on second and third.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will explain that. Ladies and gentlemen of the
Senate, the bill that we passed came back the same except for three
points. The first point that I can explain would be in an effort to try
to protect the patients as far as patients’ rights in many hospital
settings. A patient goes in, pays a lot of money, goes into the room,
asked to sign a consent form, then recognizes the full cost, and it puts
the patient in kind of a bad state when they have to just keep going.
Recognizing you, that they don’t know the full cost, though they know
they’re obligated because they’ve already got four or five hundred
dollars into it. Well the way this first provision is, is if you,
patient is in that circumstance, they paid a lot of money up front, and
they’re requested to do a consent form. Then if they choose not to then
they’re ineligible to get that money back. It’s a patient protection on
that part.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barefoot, the reason you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I arise to explain Section 2, and then I would defer
to Senator Daniel to do Section 3.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Senate, Section 2 of this bill, if
you’ll recall when we did the hospital Transparency Bill, one provision
in that bill created some limits on what hospitals could do in terms of
collecting on judgments that were rendered against the entireties’
property. What this provision does is it limits the protection for the
entireties’ property to basically the homestead. If someone has as their
residence or their real property, a house and an acre, two acres, three
acres, four acres, five acres, that’s protected. If what they have is
something that is not their home but it’s in both their names, but the
judgments against both of them, or it’s their home and fifty acres then
only the home and five acres is protected. This is an amendment that the
House wanted on the Transparency Bill, and it’s something we have agreed
to. It seems to address the concern many of us had about hospitals
taking away people’s houses as a result of judgments that may have to do
with one party, but the judgment ends up being against both the husband
and the wife because of the doctrine of necessaries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniel has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate,
Section 3 deals with a civil procedure process that’s called an
intervention, and I guess a simple example of intervening in a civil
case is when a county like Forsyth County files a foreclosure action
based on failure to pay property taxes that would cut off the right of
Winston-Salem to collect their taxes. The city of Winston-Salem could
intervene in the case to protect their interests. So that the language
on page two of this bill is basically self-explanatory. It applies the
right of intervention in the context of the General Assembly and says
that the Speaker of the House, of representatives and the President
Pro-Tem of the Senate as agents of the state shall jointly have standing
to intervene and on behalf of the General Assembly as a party in any
judicial proceeding, challenging the North Carolina statute or provision
of a North Carolina Constitution. They would be governed by the same
rule that all parties are across the state, which is rule 24 of the
North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. It couldn’t be done unless the
Speaker and the Pro-Tem agreed, and then they could do it jointly on
behalf of the General Assembly. So I urge your support for the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, will you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Some months ago- Thank you. Some months ago in the
health committee, you introduced a wonderful bill that would require
hospitals to post the cost, and all of this transparency, and I had, my
constituents were delighted over this. Where?

thing that I&#39;d like to do, is just make sure that we don&#39;t
forget to thank folks who, for the entire session have really helped us
tremendously. The clerk&#39;s staff, the sergeant-at-arms staff, and of
course our reading clerk. Sarah Lang and her staff, of course, has from
day one been there for us whenever we&#39;ve had a problem or a question

  <p>anything that has to do with what we filed, they&#39;ve helped us when
we&#39;ve made mistakes, they&#39;ve corrected things when they have

looking after us, taking care of us, making sure that only those folks
are allowed in the chamber come in the chamber, and of course Lee
Settle, our reading clerk, has done a magnificent job of keeping us on
track in terms of reading the bills. One other person I want to thank
today is Skyler Adams, has been a member of my staff since I was first
elevated to the position of President Pro Temp, and Skyler and his wife
have decided that they are going to jointly go to seminary. And he will
be leaving us and heading to Texas with his wife, going to the seminary
and beginning the rest of their lives together. I can tell you that
Skyler is one of the finest young people that I have ever met, he
started out as someone that kind of looked after me, would drive me
places if I needed to go somewhere, took care of my appointments, made
sure I got to places on time and Skyler, I personally am going to miss
you a great deal, I know my wife Pat is going to miss you as well, but
I&#39;m certain that our staff and the members of the Senate will miss
you just as much as I will. So thank you for your service, and thank you
for your friendship.
And Mr. President, one other thing. I want to thank the members of the
Senate for the high honor that you have given me to serve as the
President Pro Tempore of Senate for this session. I truly appreciate it,
I hope that what I have done in this office has met with your approval
and I look forward to seeing everybody sooner than May, but definitely
back in session in May. And I thank you for that.
And with that Mr. President, unless there&#39;s something else, I move
that the Senate adjourn in accordance with House joint resolution 1023,
adjournment resolution subject to the receipt of House messages, and the
enrollment and ratification of bills and resolutions to reconvene on
Wednesday, May 14th, 2014, at 12:00 noon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You&#39;ve heard the motion by Sen. Berger, all in favor say
&quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any opposed, say &quot;no&quot;. The &quot;aye&quot;s have it, and the
Senate stands adjourned.
