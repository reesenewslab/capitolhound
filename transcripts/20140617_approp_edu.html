While everyone's getting to their seat, I'd like to recognize the
sergeant at arms ?? Reggie Seals, Marvin Lee, John Brandon, Mike
Clampett and Martha Gadson. And our pages today are Olivia Sanchez from
Mecklenberg, Shaffer's her sponsor, Daniel Sanchez from Mecklenberg,
Shaffer's the sponsor, Ryan Donald from Gifford, Pricey Harrison, Aggie
Beets from Burke, Hugh Blackwell and Kelsey Whitehead from Wake,
Michaux. We appreciate the sergeant at arms and the pages, what they do
for us. One bill that was on the calendar was pulled, and the one bill
that we've got left is Senate Bill 719. Anybody that has a real big sigh
of relief, that's OK. Senate Bill 719 and Senator Soucek. Welcome
Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We got
that. Good. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Well, this is a bill that is
quite simply designed to present student groups, student organizations,
religious and political, to be able to come up with a set of goals, of
beliefs and to be able to adhere to that and choose leadership based on
that. Simple example is a strong republican should not be president of
the Young Democrats at a university. That type of thing. And it really
goes to the first amendment, protection of freedom of speech,
association, assembly. This is a bill that we have an identical bill in
the House and the Senate with Representative Jones. His bill passed the
House overwhelmingly, my bill passed the Senate overwhelmingly, and so
we just have this companion bill and we're asking that it go through the
House. I've spoken to students and faculty from around the district,
around the state even around the country about what the concerns are and
this is the bill that we put forth to address this. I'd be happy to
answer any question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Anybody have any questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Over here, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitmire, I mean Pittman, I was looking, you look a lot
different, Larry Pittman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Whitmire's glad of that. For
motion at the proper time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, over here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chair. Senator, in the example that you site, that a republican should
not be elected president of the Young Democrats at any community
college, why do we need legislation to protect that organization from a
republican president. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Perhaps I misspoke. It's not as
much a concern about who they elect, but say if someone were the
president and he decided I'm not going to agree with these beliefs
anymore, I want to change parties, I think that he should be allowed to
step down. If somebody no longer agrees either politically or with
religious beliefs, I think that that's something that's fair and the
right thing to do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again I. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I agree with
the sentiment there, but a bill to do that? Are you doubting that the
organization internally can handle the problem of a president of the
organization who suddenly doesn't share the beliefs of the organization?
We need a bill for this? That's my question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Soucek? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. In fact, because I talked to some student
groups who were afraid to seek student recognition because of
overactions from the administration who made them feel like they'd have
to compromise their beliefs in order to become a student organization,
and it was in response to them. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I just want to ask bill
sponsor or staff, is there anything in here that provides an appeal
process or review</p>

Process in case someone is denied admission to the organization or
required to leave the organization on these issues of their beliefs or
their practices, is there a required review process so that person does
not get victimized by an organization for some other reason and doesn’t
have a way to ensure his or her rights to be in an organization or
protected. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, I would like to refer to staff but
universities have a lot of policies and procedures in place. I believe
the existing ones would address anything that was brought up or was in
violation of law. Staff? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
restrictions that are placed in the bill have to do with the leadership
positions but not to the general membership of the organization. So on
lines 19 through 21, it relates to individuals who would serve as
leaders of the organization. It does also place restrictions on the
ability of the university to set determinations on internal disputes or
internal ordering or their internal affairs. Anything outside of that
would be subject to whatever the university has set up for recognition
of student groups and their policies. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Hall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman again my question is pretty specific and direct of
is there a required review for these organizations if they decide to
deny someone for their leadership position, or not. If they decide to
put them out of the organization or refuse them the opportunity to
participate, are they required as an organization on a campus, to have
some kind of review process to protect the individual who might want to
run for office or occupy an office? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The bill does not provide for any recourse for a student in the
situation that you described. It’s possible the individual campus may
have some recourse. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Chairman. I think this addresses both Representative
Leubke and Representative Hall. It is really weird that you need a bill
like this but there was a Supreme Court decision about 2 or 3 years ago
out of California, where the California universities would not let the
Christian legal society limit its officers to people who expressed
typical Christian beliefs. In other words, the university was trying to
tell them what Christian beliefs were. And of course this would apply to
Jewish or Muslim or whatever. And for that reason, you also don’t have
appeals to the university for this, these are the internal affairs of
these student groups. And that’s why you would not want to have an
appeal to the university as to who would be the president of the
democratic students at UNC Ashville. You don’t want to have the state
helping decide that question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d just like to take the
opportunity to thank the bill sponsor, Senator Soucek and as he
mentioned we’ve been working together on this issue for over a year now
and we’ve had companion bills and I’d just like to thank you for all
your good work on this. And just to reinforce what Representative Stam
just said, it is a shame that we have to have bills like this. But just
like recently in this committee, we passed a bill that said K through 12
students and teachers, they don’t turn in their first amendment rights
at the school house gate and today we’re saying that college students
don’t turn their rights in as well. It is unfortunate, but there are,
I’ve spoken with enough students and enough of their parents to
understand that there are problems that need to be addressed, and I
thank you sir for being here today, just to carry the ball a little
further in addressing them today. And my friend Representative Pittman
beat me to the punch, but I do recommend this bill to my colleagues.
Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Arne. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Question for the bill sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Soucek, after listening to Representative Leubke and
Representative Hall’s remarks, I just need some clarification. As I
understand your bill, this isn’t to set the bylaws of the operational
procedures of the organization, but to clarify their right to exercise

Bylaws without any interference from the college, or the community
college, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Question, uh, for the bill's -- I think this, was
this bill not before us about a year or so ago?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, the, this is, identical bill was passed through the House to the
Senate, an identical bill was passed through the Senate to the House, we
have companion bills, we're just moving forward with the Senate bills,
so this is, uh, the exact language you have voted on in the main
session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chair. Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Uh, okay. I had some problems with it then, still do, but lemme ask, you
know, I'm looking at the bills' analysis, and so, if you are not, if you
don't profess  the faith or mission of the organization, you cannot be,
uh, you cannot hold a leadership position in the organization, but you
can be a member, is that what this says?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Uh, follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Um, can you tell me what it, the other point here, resolve the
organizations' disputes, so that would be, there would be no input from
the university -- I served 40 years on the college campus and I'm a big
supporter of students, but I also know that there are some
administrative regulations that help students to do what they need to
do, so does this take the universities and the colleges completely out
of the process of helping to manage these student organizations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all, that is definitely not the intention of the bill to remove
them from the organizational structure of the university, and I don't
believe it does that. It really is just addressing when an organization
has a certain set of beliefs, that they can hold those beliefs. And then
they have to go through the process of application, they have to go
through the governance model of the university so that it's done in good
order, and is coherent with the mission of the university, but there was
problems with the university injecting, infringing on the core beliefs
of the organization, and that was what this was to address, so that they
could profess that belief, come up with their goals, what their core
beliefs are, affecting only leaders, but they would still fall under the
administrative rules of the college campus and procedures.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One last question. So, if the organization somehow contradicted the
administrative mission of the university, how would that be impacted
here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think there's a problem if the university has a policy that's
contradicting law. And if this was enacted into law, they couldn't have
a policy that contradicted the law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I just speak on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Well, I asked those questions because I think what it does, I
think it would create a problem for the university. I think overall when
students come to a campus, they come, in my opinion, to abide by the
rules and regulations of that institution. I don't see in what you're
proposing here that there would be -- and I'm curious about whether or
not you have had discussion with the university while this is a bill
that you say protects students, the students who reside on those
campuses are part of those campuses, so I'm not sure that you've had
that kind of input from those universities and colleges, and I think we
need to do that, but I just have some real problems with the kinds of
conflict that this kind of thing might cause on campuses, having worked
with students, having supported them, and I still do, but I still think
that the university's mission ought to be something that we need to
conform to, even students as they attend those colleges and on those
campuses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I've got a question. In reading the bill, does anything in here
take the authority away from the university to grant recognition to any
organization?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you repeat that question? I'm not sure I understood exactly what
you were trying to --
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What I'm asking you is, is there anything in here that forces the
university to grant recognition to any organization that wants to be on
this campus?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. It doesn't force them to do anything.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?</p>

In the department of Concorse to develop in-house programs so that they
identify companies that would use this money it requires monthly
meetings by both organizations and quarterly meetings jointly to select
projects to receive these funds and it requires a report  beginning
October of this year on the process that is implemented both  commerce
and DUT to make sure projects are identified  and a quarterly report for
those that are chosen.
(Speaker changes)
Section 34 30 is contingent and House bill 1099 or other similar
legistation become law so this authorizes the division of aviation to
use funds that are  by the act to administer the requirements of that
bill. Section 3431 pertains to the use of funds that are transferred as
an operating subsidy to the global Transport Authority of the 1,000,000
funds transferred 250,000 are exclusively used for onsite project costs.
(Speaker changes)
The title is at the bottom 231 but if you but if you flip over you see a
new study committee a house on me to look at the  implementation the STI
law lastly is the lust provision that follows money item 4 that
reestablishes transfer again can't be amended until the 4.
(Speaker changes)
What does lust stand for?
( Speaker changes)
Lust is the leaking underground storage tank program this goes to
noncommercial fund.
( Speaker changes)
And then the final provision in the package is JLTC recommendation and
is not included in the Senate proposal however this conforms to the
current contract for license production changing the materials that are
specified to be used for the licenses and ID forms.
(Speaker changes)
Thank you Stan at this time we would like to open the floor to any
questions or concerns.

provisions we're talking about provisions right?

Baseball if you're on 2nd base have a lead off and somebody fouls my
rule is you have to go and touch the back problem is if you don't do
that then there is no penalty used to make a point and never go back in
touch second base what happens underline 11 d.o.t for some reason which
I'm sure would be a good reason doesn't get it done by September 11th I
mean they say oops we're sorry but what's the penalty we've got to stick
to it I mean we've got a date what forces them to follow it.
(Speaker changes )
There is no penalty in that as you can see with the pre-construction
additional requirements are placed in future years they do not meet a
legislation directive.
( Speaker changes)
Going back to the lust is this appropriation $5,000,000?
(Speaker changes)
The cited budget actually funded this requested out of general fund
dollars but it did not restore this transfer that did exist the gasoline
inspection tanks it is in the money report in item 4 and it is 3 point
something million dollars if you look at the money report the amount is
there in item 4 was in the senate budget but it was.</p>

use that to bar, and that to me is the biggest issue. I would encourage
a fix of that if you're trying to get it exactly what you say and then I
think, maybe, ??. That would be my thought on it. Right now, because I
view that as the exclusion clause, maybe unintentionally, I think that's
the problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. I think Representative Glazier's correct on A of that it does allow
a university to not have any clubs but if it does have clubs it cannot
discriminate on certain bases. So that's the correct answer to
Representative Michaux. But I would disagree with changing sub 2 and the
reason is this, whereas typically just someone being a member is not
going to affect the organization. When I was at Chapel Hill there were
lots of student groups. I could not believe how many student groups were
getting money and my first foray into politics was moving that they all
be cut by about 50%. So I got booted off that committee, campus
governing held. I won by write-in by the way, only five people voted for
me. But here's my point, there are so many student groups that have very
small membership that the easiest thing in the world to do for a
competing group to just show up and take over. I don't know the current,
there was a time there when we could have easily taken over the Campus
Democrats just by showing up one day and out-voting them 5-1 'cause
there was so few of them. And that's probably true of the Campus
Republicans at other times. So you need to have some ability to control,
make sure that your membership are actually people that are in support
of your organization as opposed to there to sabotage it. There are
groups there with five people or six people and some fraternity could
say, &quot;let's have fun and go destroy this group next week. Just show
up and vote them all out.&quot; So I would not think it would be wise to
put any amendments on this bill that we've passed unanimously before and
that has obviously been written not by laypeople but by some
constitutional lawyer from somewhere.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Daughtry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not sure I understand how the institution can recognize certain
organizations, student organizations, and not others. How do you, do
they have their own policies or? If you can't discriminate can the KKK
go to Chapel Hill and organize and become an organization? How does that
work?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All the universities, well I should say I haven't visited every
university but I looked at App State for an example, and they have
policies on student organizations. I've got theirs here about how they
apply for recognition and there are lots of different things, safety, if
they're breaking federal law. There are certain things, you can't have a
bunch of people who, say, want to be butchers and want to walk around
cleaving meat with large meat cleavers. I'm coming up with an absurd
example but if it's public safety or against the law they definitely
have the ability to recognize and not recognize. This was just talking
about internal beliefs, that a university may have a different set of
ideals or beliefs than the student organization and they shouldn't be
allowed to tell a student that they can't exercise their first amendment
rights.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've got a quick question and then I want to comment. Is this bill
restricted to just our State Universities or this is public and private
universities alike?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good question. It is state universities and community colleges. We did
look, and when I spoke to some of the private schools, and I think
because they are, we have a tax funded system, we have, I think we're
either authority over them, a private school, a private organization has
greater ability to determine exactly what their policies are. In fact
when I, I believe it was Duke University, I spoke to students there,
they've got this issue there but I didn't put it to them because that's
a private organization and I was giving them greater flexibility to,
just like I want a student organization to be able to have their beliefs
and be able to recognize those private organizations, a private school
should be able to do the same. So no, it does not extend to them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a brief comment on the bill.

You have an ??

<p id="25:00">
the reservations but,honestly, working with some public universities
dealing with political work and the students there have been really
really, the administration has had a hard time dealing with democrats
coming in or republicans coming in and it's a state university and this
is a democratic university and they've had a hard time, and I'm not
going to mention the name of the institution, actually carrying out some
of their duties or what they want to do. I think the crux of it is that
universities have a problem with political or religious because they
want to separate from it because they are fearful of it. They're fearful
of people Christians and they're fearful of politics but that does not
mean that you don't have those organizations and the students there are
not allowed to exercise their first amendment right. And I think that
we're always going to have to keep clarifying these type of languages
because regardless of what's on the first amendment and regardless of
what we see on the constitution we continue to see day in and day out,
year after year after year people's rights being trampled because of the
fear. And so I think that if we can continue to clarify I think we would
be better off as a state and as a nation if we can clarify what actually
people's rights are instead of leaving that up to administrations and
folks to say we're going to deny you this barbecue we're in fear of it.
So, I commend the bill.

Representative Pittman, ready for your motion.

Thank you sir, I move to file a report a committee substitute to senate
bill 719 unfavorable to the original. If I'm reading this correctly it
says committee substitute.

It's the second edition, OK?

OK, whatever we got right here in front of us I move favorable report.
