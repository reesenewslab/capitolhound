The house will come to order. Representative Tim Moore is recognized to
send forth a committee report. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Tim Moore for Rules, Calendar and
Operations of the house. Senate Bill 355, planting and Harvesting Dates
favorable is to House Committee Substitute Number 2, unfavorable is to
House Committee Substitute Number 1.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Committee Substitute Number 2, Calendar without
objection for immediate consideration. House Committee Substitute Number
1, Unfavorable Calendar. Representative Moore. Senate Bill 355, the
clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Committee Substitute Number 2 for Senate Bill
355, a bill to be entitled an act to make technical changes and
clarifications in an act to establish a moratorium on filing of actions
by certain local boards of education challenging the sufficiency of
local funds appropriated to the public schools by the board of county
commissioners. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. Members, this is the technical
fix to the bill. So, whether you liked the bill or did not like the
other bill, you can vote for this one. This is the technical fix that
was agreed upon then we took it up in the rules committee. I think, even
Representative Glazier may vote for this bill. So, I would urge the
body’s yes vote, again, this fixes the technical – whether they were
constitutional issues or not, this fixes it. I urge the body’s support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For an inquiry, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would this be the point where members will need to get
close to their voting buttons, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be, Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The house will come to order. The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker and thank you, Members. Again,
I’ll be voting against the bill only because it contains the other
provisions but Representative Moore is right, it does the fix on
constitutional issue. If it just had that, I’d be totally pleased but
because it adds the rest in, it’s awfully hard to be consistent in the
other way. I’ve made the arguments about why I think the rest of the
bill is inappropriate but I do appreciate Representative Moore and the
Speaker and everyone working on the constitutional fix. I’ll still be
voting no for the other reasons though. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Richardson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate to be able to sit in on the rules
committee and observe the changes and my issues were not necessarily
with the changes but with the fact that we have put Counties in here and
now that we’ll resort to go into the State that’s gonna probably cost a
lot more money than mediation would but I will still be voting against
the bill. I thank you for the opportunity to sit in on the rules
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask the bill sponsor, a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Earlier it was mentioned about potentially since local
budgets haven’t been fully resolved at this point for Nash and Gaston
counties. Does this resolve or preclude the potential to where their
particular board of education could get a ?? and have no recourse.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill would prohibit in those three counties, as I
understand, the board of education from suing the county commissioners
on claiming that they did not receive the proper amount of funds. What
this bill did, what this language did was to narrow the scope to those
issues so that it wouldn't catch anything else that was unintended and I
think that was the problem, and Representative Glazier is nodding, and I
think it was the problem that Representative Stam, Representative
Glazier and couple other found. So, we've already made that policy
decision on the bill that we've already sent over to the Senate. This
just narrows that a little bit to give comfort to those who thought
there we some constitutional concerns.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the
question before the house is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute number 2 to Senate Bill 355 on its second reading. All in
favor, vote Aye. All oppose, vote no. The clerk will open the vote.</p>

22-24, by rewriting the lines to read:
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman's recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and welcome back. One more time with feeling,
you've all heard about this amendment that's come up. Maybe not this
amendment, you heard about a ghost amendment that was never there. You
got a lot of emails about it. And it happened, the emails you got were
about the Governor's language that he was trying to put into the budget
which did not make it into our process. Over a year ago in May this
House voted 101 to 14 to finally do something about the issue of animal
abuse for dogs in our state and yes, while we all accomplished together
something that the sponsors were told would never make it out of
committee, we got it to the House floor. House Bill 930 passed out of
the judiciary committee unanimously before our vote here and as we stood
the amendment that I'm offering I keep looking around for those meddling
kids, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo to show up 'cause they just don't happen to
be here. It's been amazing to me that such opposition would come over
our emails over an amendment that, again, never existed, while the
government had language in it's budget to address this issue Moore
County law currently provides standards for commercial dog breeders that
sell to pet shops and research labs that does not provide standards for
commercial dog breeders that sell directly to the public and so, given
the language that he had put forth, it didn't match. It wasn't with the
spirit of the bill of House Bill 930. As you'll recall, and as you'll
look on that amendment, we exempt sporting dogs, hunting dogs, field
trials, and so forth. The rationale being that I, as well as the
sponsors and my co-sponsors understood that those folks take good care
of their dogs and we wanted to avoid getting mixed up in the same old
debate that has come through the House and Senate as we look at this
issue that it somehow touches agriculture. So we got out of that. This
is very similar to HB-930, contains the same definition of commercial
dog breeder but does not spell out the standards which we did in that
bill. You can only go so far and I know what the appetite might be for
here today. The standards will established by the Department of Public
Safety. If all we do is move the animal welfare section from the
Department of Agriculture to the Department of Public Safety, which is
already in the budget that we're voting on tonight, without these
changes we do nothing to address this issue and this problem in North
Carolina. In fact, we go backwards. All the work that we have done along
with the help of the Governor and the First Lady, will be gone and we'll
have to start all over again. The language is much narrower than the
original Governor's, than the original language in the Governor's budget
proposal and only covers the large scale commercial breeders. North
Carolina's one of the most popular states in the country for puppy mill</p>

They know they can move in here because we don’t have state laws that
regulate them. Virginia and Tennessee do, but North Carolina does not.
North Carolinians had twenty puppy mills in the last two years. You have
seen images of these puppy mills in the local news. As a matter of fact,
since some of you need links, if you go to ?? News site and say North
Carolinians, there is one going on the deck. Almost nine out of ten
North Carolinians support regulations for commercial ?? I hop you would
support this language. I will add it in there. Will send it to the
senate  and we will see what they will do with it. You know the history.
I am not going to take up your night. We had a good word on this the
same issue back last over a year ago. I urge your support and appreciate
it
[speaker changes] Rep Dickson, please state your purpose
[Speaker changes] To debate the amendment
[Speaker changes] Gentlemen Right now is to debate the amendment
[Speaker changes] Thank you speaker. I was one of the positive votes in
the last session and was very pleased to cast that positive vote.
However, since then a lot of things has happened that should not have
happened. I hope it’s not a surprise and this is one of the only
disappointing things that I would have in reference to representatives
saying in his eloquent speech supporting this amendment. If there is
anybody on the floor of this house who is surprised that there is some
announcement that there is some raid going on today then I have got some
nice highway front property in the middle of goshim, which is a nice
area in ?? I would like to sell you. You could go to the human society’s
website and part of the web site you would find six pages of criteria
for states to be graded according to what they refer to is human state
rankings. On page 5 of those 6 pages, we would find this criteria. It’s
about 70 or 80 about this criteria. Then they check all of these states
whether these states meet  that criteria or not. And on page 5 is this
criteria. This includes basic human standards for dogs and puppy mills.
And North Carolina is checked as being in compliance with that. So, I
could stand here and say many other things. But believing that brevity
can be  powerful, I won’t say anything else less I have to asked to
speak again rather than tell you that on a scale of 1 to 10 and my
opposition to this amendment, I am at a 45 vote No.
[Speaker Changes] President ?? Please state you purpose
[Speaker changes] To debate the amendment Mr Speaker
[Speaker Changes] Gentlemen Right now is to debate the amendment
[Speaker changes] Thank you. I supported this bill when it came through.
Last session. I am actually the owner of a puppy mill rescue from
Brunswick county. Her name is Selvey and she had been in the cage for 3
years and I have no idea how many puppies she would have had. After the
raid, we were asked to be her foster parents. After about two hours we
fell in love and we decided to adopt her. But she could not walk. She
had never been out of the cage. Her feet all brown her paws were all
brown from  standing in her own waist. She had all sorts of illnesses.
Finally when she took her outside for the first time, the way she stood
there and looked at the trees and looked at the sky, she saw the world
for the first time. If we don’t find a way to make it better then we are
not doing the right thing. I strongly urge you to support this.
[Speaker changes] Rep Collins, Please state your purpose
[Speaker changes] To see if Rep ?? would be here
[Speaker changes] Rep ??, is there a gentlemen in you?
[Speaker Changes] I think so
[Speaker Changes] I believe I heard you say in there after the raid, is
that what I understand correctly?
[Speaker Changes] That’s correct
[Speaker Changes] Gentlemen in yours
[Speaker changes] This is one thing that I don’t understand about this
whole bill. If we already have laws in place where we raid this puppy
mill and take care of the problem, then what’s the need for this
additional legislation?
[Speaker changes] In my opinion it would and I have told to the local
sheriff department, we would give them more authority to do more often
inspections.</p>

[Speaker change]

Thank you Mr.Speaker. Members of the House, I am in favor of doing this I voted for the bill but I do have some concerns as some others have seen in the past now about policy going in to the budget. And I’m worried about what’s going to happen if we have bills that we pass and send over to the senate they don’t act on them as is their right as a body I don’t know why they do the things they do but I am concerned about loading up the budget with every provision we want to force them to accept in law. I’m just not sure that’s a sound practice that we want to get in to. 

[Speaker change]

Yes Mr. Speaker it’s just coming on screen.

[Speaker change]

The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.

[Speaker change]

Thank you very much Mr. Speaker and members, this relates specifically to a prevision that’s in the special provisions. It is the rural charter school development pilot program and I think I can speak with some history here because this was provision for the $300,000 to this private organization Parents for Educational Freedom was proposed last year in the budget and it may surprise some of you but I actually voted for that and spoke to it in the education subcommittee. And agreed with it and here’s how it was said last year, and specifically the reason that I voted for it. It was told that it was going to be used as an assistencing grants to try and get more rural counties to have the  wherewithal to create applications for charter schools. I thought that was a good thing still do. We are there needed because part of the issue about charters has been that they crop up in lots of urban areas but that places that may could use them the most we don’t have much charter development. I thought that was legitimate and whether it was going to the private group or not I thought that was at least enough to give it a shot. And I didn’t look at this provision when we were in subcommittee the other day because I assumed it was the same $300,000 because it didn’t pass the senate as I recall. We put it in and it didn’t pass. so I was fine with it. Until I read what it’s going for this year. If you look with me on the budget provision in section 8.31C last year this was sold to us as this is going to be money to help rural charters get charters and apply for charters to give more people an opportunity. It’s not going for that this year. PFNC shall require the grant recipients and here’s what it’s going for, it’s going to 12 charter schools, which is fine, in counties with currently with less than a 65% rate, but if you look at the criteria the only people who can grants are those that have already been approved by the state board to operate the charter. This isn’t going any longer for the purpose it was set out for, which was to help get more people to apply for charters and have better applications in communities that might not have had the wherewithal to really put together a good charter application. Now it’s not going for that at all. Now it’s going to a select set of charters that have already been granted for what reasons the provision doesn’t say with no criteria about how this private group is to grant  the grants. Look at the provision there is nothing

<p id="020:00">
Anything in there about the criteria that they will issue. This private
group will issue 12 grants, but what selection material? We don't know.
We get on DPI appropriately all the time because we don't have
supervision over what they're doing, who they're granting to, that it
could be political grants. We've put nothing in here. Well, that didn't
bother me when we were doing it to get charters. It bothers me a lot
about a private group selecting what charters are going to get state
money through their organization with no criteria. I think that's just
fundamentally wrong, and I take you back to a criticism the majority
legitimately had on the Hatney plan years ago that created a 13 million
dollar fund for after school and school improvement programs, and
at-risk students. The first year that came out, a legitimate criticism
was we didn't have sufficient oversight or criteria. We put in pages,
pages, in the next couple budgets of criteria and supervision because we
didn't want it being abused, and that was legitimately done at the
result of the argument. Here, we put nothing in, and we've changed the
total purpose they're seeking the money for. That is fundamentally
wrong, and I'm transferring it for now in this budget provision to
what's an open category where we have a huge deficit and we've cut
repeatedly and that is school supplies, because I would rather schools
get the money for children and supplies than not know where any of it's
going for a purpose that was completely different than how it was
originally set out, and I ask for your support on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen was recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, this concern that my friend Representative Glazier has
raised is not something that I think as he acknowledged, he had
discussed with us, I actually agree with him that the intent was that
this is entirely to be used in trying to develop new charter schools
where they don't exist in counties that would have the difficulty with
our assistance in putting together an application. Taking Representative
Glazier's word that he was for this before, and I hope would be for it
with that change, I would ask the house to defeat the amendment that
he's offering, or maybe Representative Glazier might consider
withdrawing it or displacing it. Representative Stam is already working
on amendment to address the concern to try to come up with language that
would hopefully say something along the lines of assisting those who are
in the process of applying or intend to or desire to. We'll be glad to
work with Representative Glazier to try to hopefully have language that
we can all agree serves that purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell, if the chair will, if the gentlemen will
indulge the chair, understands that Representative Stam may be sending
forth a perfecting amendment that may address the concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, if I might speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would temporarily displace the amendment in the hope as opposed to
maybe the easiest is to instead of perfecting to ?? the amendment that
does what they're trying to do, and I'd be glad to do that if we're able
to reach an agreement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we've displaced it once, why not again? We'll displace the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll move now. Representative Earl, is the lady ready to take up her
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I wish to withdraw my amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady's amendment will be withdrawn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am.

??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This amendment allows the department of cultural resources not to
allocate a grant to municipal or single county library from the aid to
public library's funds that exceeds 475,000. The original cap was
400,000, so by doing this it will not impact the wake or the ??
libraries as much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham, the chair understands that maybe we've worked
out a different ammendment, so I want to make sure the proper amendment
is before us. It's the understanding of the chair that the lady wishes
to withdraw the amendment ALG-67 and send forth the amendment ALG-69.
Does that...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen for those
of you who have been here for a while, this is a familiar amendment.
We’ve passed it out of the house twice, maybe three times but I know at
least twice. This amendment will repeal the board of governors authority
to give in-state tuition to out of state and out of country students
from the various and sundry foundations that fund students to go to our
universities. We presently have some 1,300 of these students in our
universities and these students being treated as in-state students mean
that 1,300 seats that belong to North Carolinians are being filled by
out of state and out of country students. I constantly hear the argument
that this brings in the brightest people in the world to our
universities and it may do that and I have no problem with that however
I do have a problem our rate payers subsidizing foundations to bring in
these brightest people. The foundations have sufficient funds, most of
them do I imagine, I can’t speak for all of them. Most of them have
sufficient funds to cover the cost of these students that they wish to
sponsor and they should be the one spaying the freight for these
students, not the rate payer of North Carolina. We shouldn’t be
subsidizing people from Brazil, from the United Kingdom, from Malaysia,
not Malaysia Morocco, from Canada, from Nigeria, from Vietnam. We should
not be subsidizing those students. I hope I have your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Jeter please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’m opposed to this amendment in it’s totality. A
little bit of history, we argued this policy in the house of education
last year and it failed in the house of education committee so it didn’t
get past house of education, didn’t make it in the floor so we’re going
to stick it in the budget this year. Here’s the problem, and I’m not..</p>

Going to sit here and deny that there are some cases where this makes
sense, but we don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water. Let
me give you a prime example. Let’s take the Levine Scholarship at UNC
Charlotte. Levine Scholarship is put out by a private foundation, the
Levine family, one of the most philanthropic families in the Charlotte
area. They have a scholarship that funds anywhere from 15 to 16
students, it’s 15 or 16, that scholarship mandates that 4 to 5 must be
out of state. Currently those 4 to 5 out of state tuitions get in state
tuition. That’s part of the process and that’s what Representative
Cleveland is trying to kill. The problem you get is, the Levine
Scholarship since it’s their money, gets to make their rules. And what
happens if this passes, is there are 8 North Carolina students at UNC
Charlotte that will not get a scholarship. You are not hurting the 5
people out of state. They’re coming anyway. It’s a mandated part of the
funds. Who you are hurting is the people of North Carolina who are no
longer going to be eligible for the 248 thousand dollars in scholarships
because of this vote. We go to the Moorehead Caine, you go to the Park
Scholarship, they’re all over the place. These aren’t state funded
scholarship programs. These are independent philanthropic scholarship
programs that will take money, or take students’ opportunity, North
Carolina students’ opportunity away from attending our UNC system, if we
pass this amendment. I urge you to defeat it as we did in House
Education last year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Question for Representative
Cleveland. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, does the
gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Cleveland,
you didn’t give us the names of the scholarships. Could you do that?
We’ve got a lot of new people here you mentioned a sundry, but what can
you? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you asking? Mr. Speaker? Are you asking who
the groups are that give the scholarships? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you’ll bear with me, I have, I thought I had, we
have Chancellor Scholars, Wilson Scholars, Park Scholarships, Moorehead
Caine, Robertson Davis United World, Thomas Wolfe, Keenan Music, Levine
Scholars, Ground Scholars, and that’s about all I have on my list.

you, Mr. Speaker. Just real quick, I’m opposed to the amendment for this
very reason. And if you’ve attended one of our public universities in
North Carolina, you know that students from other places bring value
added to our students. Students from North Carolina learn a lot from
folks from other places. It enhances their educational experience. I ask
that you vote against the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Glazier, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To briefly debate
the amendment, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, and I
appreciate Representative Cleveland and I have had this debate many
times. There used to be two sets of out of state. One was academic and
one was athletic. He and I were in much agreement and eventually
actually in 2009 or 10, we got rid of the athletic ones, because I
thought that was an inappropriate use and I think a majority of this
body did. But the academic scholarships are a different story for a
couple of reasons. One, this affects as he said 11 campuses. On all 11
campuses it’s hundreds, three or four hundred total, maybe 450 actually,
students involved. The two important points, or three important points I
would say. Number one, not only what Representative Jeter eloquently
said that a number of these scholarships have mandated specifics as to
the number of out of state they can have, which then supply an
inordinate number of in state students with their scholarship money and
saves the state an enormous amount of expense because they’re funded
through that scholarship. Second, listening to the bodies debate over
the years, these scholarships have also tried and Moorehead is a classic
example last year, they added 10 additional North Carolina students to
the scholarship rolls. By having the state support to reduce the out of
state to in state, it allow</p>

<p id="035:00">
a lot more money to be available then to in-state students to get the
scholarships. If we take this away, we’re not just hurting the out of
state not getting it, we not just keeping those globally competitive
students from being here and staying here, who we are really hurting is
North Carolina students. Who otherwise might not be going to Carolina,
or Chapel, or to State or to Charlotte or to Winston Salem State and all
the campuses that have these because there the ones who are going to
loose out on the scholarship money. it’s really, in a sense counter
intuitive, but it’s exactly right. By doing this the people we’re
hurting the most are the in-state students who have the scholarship. I
don’t think that would be worth it. For the money we’re getting from
these scholarships, it is saving us far, far more. And I would really
encourage the defeat of this amendment. Thank you.

Thank you, Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, I think the case has
been well made. And, at the risk of and rather, to ensure that I don’t
say what’s all ready been said, I will say that the ed. chairs have
reviewed this policy and this program. We’ve debated it in Committee.
It’s been debated, as you’ve heard, several years in education as well
as in appropriations. And I urge you strongly, on behalf of all the
chairs, to oppose the amendment. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister Speaker. I really need to reiterate Representative
Horn’s point. Don’t want to say what’s all ready been said. But as
someone who has concern for our obligations for our in-state students, I
do think Representative Glazier appropriately put it that we have, at
the end of the day, scholarships are one big pot of money. And if you
lower this, you lower the pot of money, these out of state scholarships
are not going away. And so it actually end up hurting the scholarship
money we have for in-state students. So I would urge you to vote against
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister Speaker. I appreciate all the arguments against my
amendment. However, I have a problem with my tax payers supporting
foundations who have ample funds to cover the cost of any student they
want to send to our universities. I think your arguments are fallacious,
and I did not buy into them. If a organization requires five out of
state or out of country students and they’re going to have eight
in-state  students, then that organization should pay the fee. Not the
tax payer of North Carolina. The idea that we need these people to
better our state or better our universities, I don’t think is true
either. We are taking seats away from North Carolina students that want
to go to universities. We have give or take around thirteen hundred
seats in the universities that belong to North Carolina students. And
our rate payers are subsidizing to make these seats to make sure that
our North Carolina students don’t get them. That’s wrong. I don’t care
how you try to cut it, that’s wrong. I would hope that you will support
the amendment.

Members, these scholarships are historic and many of them were funded by
very generous private philanthropists who cared about the university and
the future of the state. And I think that we’re honoring a tradition by
having the in-state tuition. It let’s us spread the money over more
years and support more students. These students that come in are very
bright. They stay in North Carolina. Many of them stay in North
Carolina, start businesses here and make a real contribution.</p>

raises the cap from $400 to 475,000 for the library grants and by doing
that it lessens the impact on Mecklenburg and Wake County and it also
spreads out the rest of the reduction to all the libraries so it’s more

Increases the budget for UNC need based financial program, aid program,
by five million dollars. This would take the current amount from 125 to

reduction by five million dollars. The management flex cut is currently
19 million, 19.8 million. This would increase the budget cut to 24.8
million. The five million equals less than 0.2 percent. That's 0.2
percent of the UNC budget. This amendment would give 2.5 million for
need based aid at Elizabeth City State University, and that is my alma
mater, and you've heard that over the past few weeks what the attempt
was. Last fiscal year, the UNC need budget for need based grant program
served 1,629 students at Elizabeth City, using a total of 2.2 million.
The average award was about 1,350 dollars per student. This amendment

I would urge my colleagues to vote &quot;No&quot; on the amendment. If
there is the need that representative Mobley states here it would be
certainly appropriate for the board of governors to make that decision,
and to allocate additional moneys to these schools or to other schools,
but we have a board of governors for a reason. Taking money, putting
more of a burden of a cut on the board of governors and giving them less
flexibility in how they spend their money I believe is really a mistake,
and again, this is in some ways a precedent issue here. I just don't
think we ought to go down this road, because once we start down here and
are making these sorts of decisions about how we're going to send
financial aid to one school and not to another school, we put ourselves
in a very, very difficult position. I urge my colleagues to vote
&quot;No&quot; on the amendment.

Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the house, a few moments back,
before we took the recess, Representative Hanes made an impassioned plea
aimed particularly at minority community, along with Representative
Brown. I noticed the applause that wasn't aloud supporting what they
were saying. Here you have an opportunity to really express your wishes,
and I say that because, understand, Elizabeth City State University was
put on the chopping block by our friends across the hall. There was a
lot of publicity on that, and that publicity caused a lot of harm. Even
though they pulled it out, it caused a lot of harm to that school in
terms of recruiting students, in terms of recruiting faculty. One of the
things they said is that &quot;The student enrollment had dropped
off.&quot; Well, if you use this two and a half million dollars, it can
increase that student enrollment. Elizabeth City is a very significant
university in the system, and I don't mind telling you that I had a
client, speaking of ladies and gentlemen, that gave, and even in spite
of that, had came out and gave a half a million dollars to an endowed
scholarship in Elizabeth City State University. Now, it is a viable
institution, and it ought to remain that way. The other two and a half
million in there is for the other historically black colleges and
universities in order to get more students in there, and it affects the
minority of the community.</p>

Like I said, since we heard what you did from impassioned please by
Representative Heinz and Representative Brandon, this is your
opportunity to really express your feelings about that and particularly
the minority community. But I simply express to you the fact that you
live in the city state university, it is the third most viable economic
engine in that region. And to equate it in a position that they are in
right now, it was certainly attainable. And I know that the board of
governors, now, come on, folks, face it. Y'all have changed the board of
governors, basically, all the way around. So we don't know what that
board of governors is gonna do. We don't have a much minority
representation on that board of governors as we've had in the past. And
so we just don't know, it's up to us and this body, to maintain those
institutions and I ask that you support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair would take issue with one comment made by
the gentleman from Durham. The chair gobble down the applause as I have
done in every incident when that occurred over the last three and half
years. Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has recognize to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen, I can't
add a whole lot to it. I've spent 40 years on the camp for 7 HPCU, I've
been at college, I did my graduate and undergraduate work in North
Carolina NTC State University. I've been on every HPCU campus in the
state of North Carolina. Lead the North Carolina legislative black
caucus foundation and raise in scholarship. We appreciate all the
support that you've given us to help keep students in school and to make
education accessible and affordable. We talked a lot tonight about
opportunity. So here's your opportunity to help students who need that
opportunity. Some of these students, a lot of these students are from
North Carolina, but all of these students, as we look at the attendance
and the financial status of many of our students who attend HPCUs, all
of them are in dire need of help. Many of them are first generation
college students as I was. And so I think we have a responsibility as
well to help these students. They are trying to help themselves by
getting a college education. That is the way for young people to move up
and ahead, and too many of them, if they are not from North Carolina
will remain here as I did, become a productive citizen and tax payers.
But we do know, and I have to share Representative Michelle's concern
about our board of governors. It is not diverse anymore. And I think we
also have to have people who know about these schools, because either
they have attended them or they've been on those campuses, they have
relatives but they know something internally and intrinsically about how
they work and the needs of those students, and I guess, you can't teach
want you don't know. But, it is really imperative that we not only help
our students and these colleges and universities to survive but they
must thrive. And here's an opportunity that we have to create
opportunity, and maybe we can get Representative Haines to get up and
give another passionate speech about the opportunity for these young
people who are attending this college. It's a beautiful campus. They've
got great programs there. But they simply need some help and some
assistance, and this is the way for us to do that. If we say we care
about diversity, if we say we care about students and what happens to
them, because what happens to them will enable our state to be
maintained and to grow. So I would urge you to support this amendment.
It's certainly very favor. I mean, we got a lot of things in this budget
that are giving our people and other entities and opportunity, and these
young people need it. I would encourage your support of this amendment.

...think. From my discussions with members of the board of governors.
They are very well aware of the situation at Elizabeth City State
University. Everyone is concerned about the health of that institution.
At least people that I talk to quite often for some time. I think there
are efforts underway  to resolve a number of the issues at Elizabeth
City State. And to make sure that, that can be a very viable institution
for many years to come. And I think obviously the point is well made
about the impact on the economy of the Northeast that Elizabeth City
State has. But I want folks to understand something, um, we on the
republican side have had to ask for restraint from some of our members.
I have had to restrain myself in certain ways. When the thought comes to
mind let's have more restrictions on what the board of governors can and
can't do. We have been moving in a direction over the last several years
and certainly this year to give the board of governors the opportunity
to actually implement reforms and modernize things in our university
system, and ensure that in future generations we will have the type of
university system that we want in this state we have a tremendous board.
And I'm not saying that in relation to any of the past boards, but I can
say for this board, it is one of the most accomplished boards of
governors that I have ever seen. The collection of individuals. They are
very accomplished, they are very serious, they are very dedicated. And I
think they take very seriously the issues that have been raised in
Elizabeth City State and all of the 16 university campuses as well as
the schools of math and science and other responsibilities that we have.
So, I believe that we need to not include this amendment. To feed this
amendment and give them the opportunity don't, let's not shackle them
let's give them the opportunity to do the work that they need to do as a
board of governors and I think we will be- I think all of us in this
chamber will be very pleased with the results and be able to strongly
support them moving forward. Thank you.

their lack of support within the family they are unable to do that. This

that they need maximum flexibility. But in this case, when we look at
universities like Elizabeth City State, and you look at their decreased
enrollment. Ladies and gentlemen, all you have to do is go to Elizabeth
City, look at the area, look at the region.  Their decreased enrollment
has nothing to do with whether kids want to go to college and better
their lives. It has to do with what they have in terms of resources. Go

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pierce, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Mr. Speaker, Ladies and gentlemen, I rise this afternoon to support this
amendment for a couple of reasons. You spent a lot of [wuss] in the
chamber, in the general assembly of the last two sessions. We've heard
about consolidating and I think, I heard representative dollar talk
about some things, how good a job people are doing but there was some
[wuss] a couple of years ago about consolidation. I think that's still
in demand of some folks so we need to consider that and what happened
just a few weeks ago I think that you'll remember that legislative black
caucus had a press conference to lay us out against the proposal that
was on the table in dealing with Elizabeth City. But with that proposal
on the table, what you end up doing was you put a nail in the coffin.
Because of what happened students who were thinking about going to
Elizabeth City, you put something in their minds they can then believe
that maybe for a year or two the school could close down. So, I think we
set a dangerous precedent for Elizabeth City by doing that. Black
Universities have been underfunded for years and I think we all know
that and they face a very difficult time and we've got a lot of issues
that we definitely need to deal with but I think we're setting a
dangerous precedent dealing with Elizabeth City because I think that the
[competition] is still gonna be out there. I think the board of
governors still have a mind to find some way somehow to close that
University down. We don't need to run from it, we don't need to hide
from it. I believe they're still talking about it while they're drinking
ice water in back rooms, they are still talking about that. Why do you
say that representative Pierce?
Because we've been talking about it for two sessions; each time we would
beat it back but I still think the reality is on the table to try to
find a way. We're pulling programs, we're pulling curriculum, I remember
that. Keep right on pulling that and eventually students would not want
to go to that University. So, Representative Mobley has a good proposal
on the table. And you're right. I think when I stand and speak, people
say well he's preaching. What's in like everybody else who deny who
don't have a life has been preaching so, I guess I need to preach. But I
think we really need to take a hard look at this and let's be fair to
this university. You have dug a hole for this university in the last two
sessions. Ladies and gentlemen, you did that. You have sent a negative
signal across this state and to surrounding areas. Students who would
consider going there, you sent the wrong signal. So we're asking
tonight, I agree with my colleagues, we need to do the right thing. It's
not gonna hurt the budget. This will help them recruit, this will help
them sustain programs already at that University. Let's give them a
chance. I ask you to vote yes on this amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker
and Ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak briefly on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, for many
years I've represented in my district, the North Carolina central
University and we're proud and ?? of the work that NCCU has done for our
community and for the state and for the nation. The reason I'm speaking
to support the amendment is because the amendment is about financial
assistance for students and I learned a few years ago in research and in
conversation at NCCU some realities about income of the families at the
HPCUs of our state and Pembroke State vs. UNC Chapel Hill and NC State
and the reality is this that for the five HPCUs, the average family
income is 30,000 dollars. At NC State and at UNC Chapel Hill, the
average family income is 90,000 dollars. It's obvious then that the
young people who are attending these schools badly need financial
assistance and that to me is enough reason for us to make a special
step, an unusual step that ?? to provide assistance for young people.</p>

are hanging out in the streets or getting into trouble or doing bad
things, these are folks that can’t afford to go. Elizabeth City is
providing them an opportunity to get a four year degree and I think we
need to support that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Brandon please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do rise to support the amendment. I went to an HBCU.
I will let you know that one of the things that I notice is everybody
has talked about the disadvantages that students have at the HBCUs but
one of the things that I noticed about HBCUs here is that we have a
disadvantage is that we did not have the same type of influence. I see
that the UNC, Chapel Hill, and NC State lobbyists here are making sure
that they are getting funding in all different types of ways. We’ve seen
bills come through here that NC State engineering program is somehow
better than UNC’s engineering program and they deserve more funding than
us. This is something that has been going on in this chamber for a long
time. I think that we can rectify some of that by number one
understanding that the same things Representative Brown and other folks
have talked about that there are disadvantages. People do not go to
college on the same level, $30,000 and $90,000 is a tremendous
difference and it’s also a difference in mindset, but just in the matter
of being here, just witnessing how other universities know how to
manipulate the system better than some of the HBCUs do that alone gives
you a tremendous amount of more coverage and more money that HBCUs just
simply do not get. This is a small drop in the budget and I think that
we should support this amendment because Elizabeth City, not only
Elizabeth City but UNC Pembroke and other HBCUs and schools of color
definitely need a little additional support and even with this support
that we would have we would still probably be 40-50% behind the rest of
the universities in terms of funding, even with that support. Just think
about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Terry please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. I have listened to the
various opinions about this and I stand in support of this amendment as
a person who has ten years of experience working in an HBCU some years
back, but one of the things that I want to bring up here is the
opportunity, and I’ve heard the word opportunity used, to allow us to
help Elizabeth City State University reach the potential that it has,
particularly as an economic engine for that region of the state. I have
heard and I have been in the committee sessions where our department of
commerce has established prosperity zones and from my perspective that
northeastern corridor of the state of North Carolina is an excellent
place for us to begin the investment to allow Elizabeth City to be a
part of the prosperity zone for that region that some of our other
universities, particularly the flagships have always and have always
been known to help with the public private partnerships that help us
with entrepreneurship and job development and all of that. I understand
that there’s a fabulous aviation program there that has made the state
very proud.</p>

And considering the size of this budget and all of the things that are
done, I’m new so I cannot possibly understand everything but I do know
within my judgment and the judgment of most people, $5 million here in
an area that is in desperate need of something to help it understand
what it’s endless possibilities may be, particularly for a prosperity
zone in the northeastern section of North Carolina, I cannot understand
why you would not be in favor of that. I recommend and support and hope
you will find, just a place in your heart to understand that we too
would like to be able to prosper. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Blackwell please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker I want to again ask the house to reject
this particular amendment. It really isn’t in my judgment about whether
you want to try do something to indicate your support for Elizabeth City
State or any other particular institution. Keep in mind what this
amendment would do if adopted. It doesn’t create any new programs at
Elizabeth City, it doesn’t build anything. What it does is provide more
scholarship money that is specifically designated for students going
there, but there’s no evidence that anybody has presented to us in
subcommittee and certainly not on the floor today that there is a
shortage of funds available to needy students desiring to attend
Elizabeth City State or any other school that would be benefited by this
amendment. Currently there’s over $300 million available..
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Pierce please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ask the member a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Blackwell thank you for your remarks
there but you made a part that it’s not building anything, I think it’s
building students and it’s building people to go out to do things in our
state. Let me ask you a question, do you not believe it’s building
people? Buildings are not always important, sometimes it’s more
important to be a student and to suggest that students don’t have
financial problems, that’s just not true. Do you think that’s true, that
students don’t have financial problems?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I believe if I understand your question that I agree
that any individual obtaining a college education is building for the
future and improving their prospects, improving the prospects for the
family that they have or may have, and that’s a good thing. I’m trying
to make a distinction though that what this bill would do is designate
specific funds for scholarships and the university already has over $300
million that will be distributed in the coming school year to students
on the base of need and there’s been no demonstration by anybody here on
the floor and certainly not in the committee that considered this
legislation that there is an unmet need at Elizabeth City or at any
other particular school. Moreover, this would take $5 million from the
university system in the form of an increased flex cut which they would
then have to distribute back out to the universities which would mean
Elizabeth City in order to get this extra money for students that may
not need it, would have to maybe distribute a cut to that same
university in order to come up with the $5 million. Moreover, there is
nothing with the present flexibility that the board of governors has to
prevent them from saying well if they’re going to make a special
provision for Elizabeth City State, we’ll push some more money into
other places since they’ve already gotten theirs from the legislature.
This just isn’t the way we ought to do it, if we want to do something
special for Elizabeth City we ought to discuss it in the long session
and we ought to decide what it is and then we can vote on it but this is
not the way to vote on it in my opinion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Another question for the member.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] And Representative Blackwell the gentleman still has
the floor, you’re yielding to a question at the end of the question you
can either sit down or continue your debate..</p>

<p id="075:00">
I will yield if I have the floor still.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Representative Blackwell, you - I'm just going to make a point, then the
question - you're a very knowledgeable person. I've enjoyed the time we
fellow shipped here today so, but did you not believe, of all the
schools in the system - do you not believe, of all the schools in the
system that Elizabeth City is suffering at this point? From all that
we've heard and all that we've stood on the floor and talked about 35
minutes, it's obvious that Elizabeth City has a problem and we need to
rectify it today in this General Assembly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] With due respect to my colleagues here on the floor, I
understand that some claims and statements have been made to that effect
and because of that I think it's certainly would be something that the
Education Committees and the Appropriations Committee should look into,
but this is not the place to decide that an extra 2.5 million for
scholarships for students at Elizabeth City, whose needs for
scholarships may already be met out of the 300 million dollars that the
University is going to be able to loan out this year. I'm not sure
that's going to help Elizabeth City. It allows some people to say they
got it in there and it may look like we're doing something, but I'm
suggesting to you that if your purpose is to support and build up a
school that you think is in need of it. That this is not the way to go
about doing it. I would encourage you to discuss this with the Education
Committee and the Appropriations Committee and let's look at the facts
and if in fact they have specific needs that we can meet to try to build
them up then we can address it. I think this does it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up to the member.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell, time is of the essence for
this University. There's no doubt about it ad I would hope that - you
made a point, let's wait till next year. I don't think, we don't have
the time to wait. I think the time is now while we can. We cannot wait
and I would hope that my fellow friends on the other side would
understand that. I just believe Mr. Speaker, I know I'm going a couple
ways here, but if it was any other university - and I don't want to go a
place that I don't, I don't want to go to a certain place with this -
but it just makes me, it troubles me that for two sessions, this
Elizabeth City has been proposed to be on the chopping block and here we
are still talking about it and had not the Black Caucus raised their
voice a couple weeks ago and that amendment would have gone through, I
think we'd have had some problems. So that's were my problem is. That
we're not being really genuine about what we're talking about tonight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker, Mr. Speaker. I'm gonna assume there was a
question there and I'll respond in this way. In the last two sessions,
to my knowledge there's been no discussion on the House Educations
Appropriations subcommittee about consolidating, closing, or doing
anything that I can think of that would be negative as it is directed to
anyone or more, certainly not Elizabeth City State at the university
level. So I really don't think it's been on the chopping block, except
that maybe somebody in the other body is talking about it, but we
haven't taken that up. But my final response to your comments and I hope
I'm not being repetitive or redundant in saying this is, I don't think
this amendment accomplishes anything to advance your purpose. We don't
know that there's students that aren't going to be able to go to
Elizabeth City State because they don't have scholarship money. What we
do know is if this amendment passes is that the Board of Governors is
going to have to distribute 5 million dollars in additional cuts and
that some of those cuts, that might not otherwise go to Elizabeth City
State, may well go there because they got to find the best places to go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One more just quick, Mr. Speaker. One more question
and I will have it in the form of a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell, were you aware that 97.5% of
the full time, undergraduates going to Elizabeth City receives financial
aid and did you realize that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't know that exact number. I would have assumed
that it was a high percentage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm gonna be fair to what I said. This is the end of
it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.

Representative Moore has moved the previous question. The motion is not
debatable. Question before the house is the motion to move the previous
question on the Mobley amendment. All in favor vote aye. All opposed
vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will let the machine
record the vote. 64 have vote in the affirmative and 48 in the negative
the motion passes, now we ate back on the bill about roll 3 minutes to
be allocated to each side, representative Hall may choose the speaker to
delicate the comments. Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker I will accept the three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a period not to exceed
3 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman we had a good discussion and the
reason we have these budget sessions obviously is because this is the
place we do business. So when I just hear for a vacation we here because
we here to do business tonight and we have changed this process that we
don't go through the self-committees and give proper disclosure and
opportunity for everyone to get their proposals in and get them fairly
heard. So we have pushed the budget to now to become a document where we
have these kind of decisions made in big appropriations meet right
before hand and yes we do better than the Senate but that's a pretty low
bar and then we do it here than we do it here on the floor. Now I am not
gonna preach because I don't have a license. I can get one do I rest
assure but let me tell you this because I did getter earlier tonight how
important it is to be consistent and we are taking about supporting an
institution that's the third largest economic dreary in the eastern
region of the state, we know they need help out there period, no
question no dispute on that but I want to tell you about consistency,
those of you know in darn we got a school of math and science so
everybody knows about it right? Party university system, everybody knows
about school of science and math in darn. Well we don't do things like
this but in yesterday in appropriations everybody was dead no one knows
what we did. We took 5 million dollars and say it hey we don't have the
studies we need another school of math and science in the university
system but we took 5 million dollars and provided plan and money we took
1.2 million in ferns to be used by board of governor's university
directed them to plan for another 800 thousand to sight it and then
finally directed them to distributor 1 million 200 thousand in the
section not be spend for any purpose other than just advance planning.
So we create a whole school, we create a whole duplicative school in the
region of the state because somebody either is from that district or
they just got the power to do it and it is in your budget, it's in your
budget not to pass inappropriations yesterday but tonight when there is
time try to save 4-5 schools and at the moment after we damaged their
public reputation and their ability to function I am getting notes and
their ability to function we decide this is not the place to do it and
now no such objections were raised yesterday in appropriations nobody
see this is not the place to create a whole new school in the university
system. Board of governor is gonna ask for it, scolds of science and
math in darn didn't say we need help we got too many students we need
you to build another campus. There is no study that recommended it. So
when we talk about consistency we talk about fairness, we talk about
what we would be doing and when and where we should be doing it then
this consistency issue comes in again and I gotta note here lemme see,
alright I am not gonna repeat what's been said already about the impact
but yes I am about what happened with the Senate last year proposing the
close of this ?? state university and then coming up again this year in
the discussion, thank you very much for your vote we consistent and
support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen just as a point of clarification.</p>

Fact and in calling the previous question on an amendment, there is no
obligation to provide the three minutes. The Chair used his discretion
to do that. The question before the House is the passage of the
amendment sent forth by Representative Mobley, for the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 744. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote
no. The clerk will open the vote. [LONG PAUSE] The clerk will let the
machine record the vote. 49 having voted in the affirmative and 66 in
the negative, the amendment fails. Representative Glazier, the Chair
understands that the gentleman wishes to withdraw amendment AMK-102?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct, Mr. Speaker. There will be a
different amendment coming. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam is
recognized to send forth that amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stam moves to amend the bill on page 39, lines
50 and 51, by deleting those lines and therefore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Mr. Speaker. We were sort of like ships passing in the night,
not really understanding what was intended. This limits the grants
before school opens, the charter school opens, but allows it to also be
used before the charter is granted. But mainly it’ll be used for the
planning year which is between those two events. I move adoption of the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to Representative Stam’s amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And although this is a bit
broader than it was last year, I think it’s limited in this way. It’s
still going to help charters be developed in rural counties. It is only
for that purpose, and then to assist them as they’re planning to open.
It is not the ones that they’ve assisted in getting the grant. They are
not, it cannot be used for operations. It cannot be used to help the
charter once it’s operating. There’s going to be no distinction. So this
is I think still essentially tied to its purpose, albeit a touch
broader. It is my hope that over the course of the interim, that there’s
some criteria that continues to be put for purposes of accountability.
But I think this is back to its original purpose and would urge adoption
of the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate.
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the amendment
sent forth by Representative Stam to House Committee Substitute number 2
for Senate Bill 744. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. [PAUSE] The clerk will let the machine record
the vote. 114 having voted in the affirmative, 2 in the negative, the
amendment passes. Representative Davis is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Davis
moves to amend the bill on page 279, line 37 by added immediately after
the line the following language to read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen
of the House. The present film incentive program in North Carolina is
set to expire at the end of this year. In the spirit of further
consensus, I would like to offer this amendment not only to keep the
film industry viable in North Carolina but also to allow the film
incentive issue to proceed for further discussion between the House and
the Senate. Mr. Speaker, Representative Ruth Samuelson and I worked
together on this amendment and I request that you recognize her to
explain it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Members, basically what this amendment does is convert the film
credit into a grant program. You may be familiar with that. As you know
simplifying our tax code so it helps all people who want to create jobs
do so in North Carolina is one of our objectives. In doing that for the
film industry as a grant program through the division of commerce will
be very helpful. Ultimately this will allow the secretary of commerce to
negotiate and prioritize film projects based on jobs created in North
Carolina, infrastructure improvements in capital investment, and
economic impact. There are several things in it. It will allow her, her
or him, in the future</p>

<p id="090:00">
Prioritize grants based on an economic impact analysis that will be
conducted by the Labor and Economic Development Division. It will
require production companies to offer marketing opportunities in
promotional value for North Carolina for things like our logo and
call-outs.
And it will also allow the Secretary to enter into 3-year contracts with
a sunset in 2020, and this is there to help provide the needed certainty
that any business needs when they're going to have a grant.
And then it requires a full audit before the grant is ever paid. The way
we did this for the budget is it only appropriates five dollars in
Fiscal Year 2014-2015 to put the program on the table for negotiations
in the conference process. If you all have been following the news
around the country, these film credits and film programs have been up
and down all over the country, and so this will give us a chance to look
at it and figure out within our budget constraints in working with the
Senate to figure out what is the appropriate amount to put in the budget
for this year.
Our intent is to keep North Carolina competitive, to retain the jobs and
capital investment we have now, and create new opportunities in this
expanding job sector. I encourage your support.

Representative Carney, please state your purpose.

The Lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Ladies and Gentlemen of the House that just rised to support the
amendment, I'm sorry that we didn't have -- we weren't able to keep in
place what we currently have for the film industry, but I will hold this
up to remind you of the jobs that are created in this State by the film
industry. If you have not been to visit a set, I encourage you to go do
it. But if you go on a set,  you're gonna meet people that are your
neighbors. They're not people from out-of-state, these are people that
over the last 20-some years in North Carolina, if not longer, they have
grown this industry, and it is continuing to grow.
I know some of you have received a bunch of e-mails. I keep in
constantly receiving emails, and have been for the last 2 years, when
we've had this every year come up, &quot;Are we going to extend the
credit-- the deadline for the credit?&quot;. Well, the sunset, excuse
me. Representative Danny McComas, from Wilmington, for years stood up
here and defended this credit, fought for it, and kept it going. And I
applaud the Representatives to night that have stood up and put
something forward for us to keep talking. You've heard me say that, and
I'm gonna keep reminding us of that.
This is an industry, and again, it creates jobs. Go talk to welders who
have jobs today because of the film industry. Talk to the printing
companies, who during the recession -- there's a guy in Charlotte  that
has been across the state promoting this incentive -- but just promoting
the fact that the film industry does promote jobs. Talk to him about
during the recession, how he was able to keep his business afloat from
the industry. From a TV show that was being filmed right in his area.
I could go on and on with the stories, but I want you to have an
opportunity to hear from these workers in North Carolina, people that
are buying a home for the first time, young people. It is an industry
that crosses all ages. Yeah, I'm passionate about it. I wanna get you
passionate. I wanna get you excited about it, because it not only is
about somebody standing in front of a camera, like we do up here --
we're all actors. It isn't all about that. It is beyond -- beyond those
big-name peoples that don't live in North Carolina. It drill it down to
our homegrown jobs in North Carolina. So I urge your support for this
amendment, and let's keep the ball rolling.

money will not be used for grants of more than certain dollars. $5
million for feature length film. The next part is the one I’m a little
concerned about. It says more than $5 million for a single episode of a
television or video production. Does that mean that on a typical I think
it’s maybe 13 episode or some are 9 episodes, some are 13 episodes a
season, that we could be out for as much as $65 million for a single
television production? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
have a follow up, then. Can you tell me what that means then? $5 million
per episode. Is there a limit to how many episodes we’ll support?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’ll look at the next page, please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Okay. I don’t see it anywhere. That’s why I ask. Two episodes
for $5 million.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen, what
this amendment will do, will be to extend a program that we put in place
last year to fund the group homes that were housing the individuals who
had last their PCS coverage due to changes in the rules and we said in
that original language that the funding would end either on June 30th of
this year or when the funds were fully expended and due to the beginning
of a slow process, it’s not been completed yet and what we’re actually
doing is just extending the ending language to June 30th of next year or
when the funds are completely expended and I would ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the
question before the house is the passage of the amendment sent forth by
Representative Avila to the House committee substitute number 2 for
Senate Bill 744. All in favor, vote Aye. All oppose, vote No. The clerk

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. What we’re trying to do here
is to standardize an operation that consumes a lot of people’s time
simply because one part – the authorization and billing uses a fiscal

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. We’ve had a good number of
amendments and I can appreciate the time that we spent on the amendments
and the compilation of this document. By and large, I sincerely
appreciate the many improvements that we’ve made in education
particularly, I suppose, to what we received from the Senate. Our
attempt to give teachers a decent raise is quite laudable and
commendable. Our attempt to give state employees a raise, it’s
commendable. However, the uncertainty of the stability of these raises
gives me concern. Reliance on the lottery proceeds, the increasing
lottery proceeds gives me a bit of heartburn. I wish we had a more
stable source of revenue. They use our public school fund to fund
vouchers for private education, greatly disturbs me. We.</p>

Speaker: Have received passionate please that poor children cannot or
will be deprived of a decent adequate education without those firms.if
you would allows me a bit of personal testimony i would ?? you but
that's just not true.You see I'm the sixth child of my seven children
family to my parents my mother and my father.My mother was as stand hold
mother.My dad received only fifth grade education and he worked as a
laborer all his life.Never earning ten thousand dollars a year.But he
felt like it was his responsibility  to educate his children because he
didn't get what.So he served a dual role so does a labor during a day
and a farmer during the night.he said that was his responsibility.That
day labor job would feed the family,that night job would send us to
college with subsidies in the summer by working in tobacco fields and
doing the night jobs in the after noon not the lot of time for leisure
or just patience.The first six of us complete college and i would say
that you would judge the quality of education that we were received the
seventh my baby brother i think my dad was tired at that time and he
just said his son just do whatever you want just go to military.But his
rules were you are collage the, was which one that's the only question
we had ,which college which stipulations you will not left anything
because you are spending his money.?? but that's the just my day and the
other thing that he was very very diligent on you will not receive any
kind of hand out there will be no free lunch in his family you work and
earn for everything you get,so we knew that we have to finish
college.Again this budget i think in the education side will learn it's
?? not lot but some for else. i think we could ?? to other
places.Insulation of a western magazine school with a no origin from
anybody to do so again gives me concern.just a few tip bits of concern
they are other than that the budget and the words of king of ?? when he
was facing a parcel ?? would be that almost almost i could be persuaded
to spot it but i think we could do better.Thank You,

You are correct, you had to vote within that 20 seconds.

Just to be clear on the rule, when I was in the dais, the rule was
because many members were stepping out of chamber delaying the vote, we
were having to record the vote, the chair extended the time by 30% to 20
seconds, giving every member ample time to be at their seats to record a
vote. The chair is allowed two votes to be changed: one from the
minority, one from the majority, because they cast their votes within
the 20 seconds. That is the rule.

To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House, in today's debate there
were very many amendments, which I thought was coming from the
Democratic side, from this side of the aisle, which were voted down.
Without being specific, I really regret that, because I think all of
them were amendments that would have improved this budget. I think the
biggest issue that faces all of us in North Carolina is whether we're
going to do a great deal, not just a bit, but a great deal, to move
aside from 46th place in teacher pay.  I think it was possible for this
House to have done better than 5%.  As it is, this House is gambling
that the money will be there so that the 5% can be provided.  But to
gamble on the future, particularly the gamble with the Lottery, and also
to say with the lottery, and many of my friends across the aisle who
were here when we voted for the lottery remember that many of us
thought, (and I was one who voted against the Lottery) many of us
thought it was really wrong. Not just for reasons of morality for some,
but for the fact that we were taking money disproportionally - it's
clear as the day is long - that you are disproportionally taking money
from people in the lower end of the economic scale. And we all knew
that, we debated that, and it continues to be true, so it's somehow
ironic that in the attempts to improve education in our state, the
majority has chosen to use the Lottery, and encouraging people to play
the Lottery so that there can be money for the 5%.
Actually, I would say to you, there was money, clearly, money there that
we could do better than 5%. But to do just 5% and rely on Lottery money
seems to me a big big mistake, and I will not be supporting the bill.
Thank you.

Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members, I was here nine years ago,

General Assembly. And I had many objections to the Lottery. I personally
believe that gambling is immoral and wrong, and I certainly believe it's
wrong for the State of North Carolina to be...</p>

Speaker: Particularly on the folks that gentlemen from ?? noted a lot of
most effects.One of also reasons that i oppose the lottery  because i
that believe the gambling is addictive.i believe that the folks out
there who are gonna play the lottery get addicted and we saw the
evidence to suggest that was true.Wat i didn't suspect the time though
folks that get addicted to gambling will be the general assembly of
north Carolina.We liked the first head of it so much we like the double
head of it a double amount a double dose  of the addicting substance and
then to use that try to pay for teachers salary.Juts many other things
wrong with this budget but that alone did not make me vote against
it.I'm gonna vote no and hopes that my colleagues are across the  hour
who with me nine years ago who oppose lottery but also vote no lets go
back to drawing boards work together and find the way to give the
teachers the pay raises with need without continuing addiction to
gambling,
Speaker Changes: Mr Speaker speaker,
Speaker Changes: Representative Stamp please state purpose,
Speaker Changes: I would represent ?? to yells that question,
Speaker Changes: Representative ??,
Speaker Changes: yes sir,
Speaker Changes: He yells,
Speaker Changes: Representative Martin perhaps remember the last session
in which governor easily proposed the expansion of the lottery to get
more money by changing the formula.it was about 100 million dollars in
more money from changing the formula.This change is been by 100 million
more money by making a change in the advertising including making ??
adverting.Do you recall that how you voted on that budget i believe it
was 2007 or 8 in which you voted  to expand the lottery take.Here by 100
million employing gambling provided by about another 300 million,
Speaker Changes: Let me clear about my objection on my point here ?? i
appreciate the language you have got in there to try to put truth in
this lottery supported the form with off course is this gonna have the
people actually believe it is gonna pay the lottery much and therefore
we are not gonna exceed the bill on pay ?? so that you can be able to
pay here.The ?? with this is by increasing the advertising you are
getting more folks get on the gambling.You are actually reaching out
there to them at athletic event i see the ads on TV cant go fill up the
gas station without seeing the ad scratch off and that sort of things
actually reaching not more for ??,
Speaker Changes: Mr.Speaker,
Speaker Changes: Representative Stamp will represent martin for the
second question,
Speaker Changes: Yes sir,
Speaker Changes: He votes,
Speaker Changes: Representative Martin do you recall in 2007 i believe
voting for that budget which took about additional sales of about 300
million dollars  lottery tickets to produce about 100 million of
education your call how you voted,
Speaker Changes: Again i did voted for that budget but i let me be very
clear that the difference here you are taking and marketing,you are
sending the dealer out there,advertising twice as much as they are
people who are already addicted to gambling and using that somehow to
pay to teacher raises to teach the children of those folks that you
aren't get addicted to gambling is just wrong ,vote no let's go back to
the drawing board  and find a better way together to pay for this ,
Speaker Changes: Mr speaker,
Speaker Changes: Representative glacier please state your purpose,
Speaker Changes: I wonder if Representative martin might yell for a
question please ,
Speaker Changes: Representative Martin you yell ,
Speaker Changes: Yes sir,
Speaker Changes: Thank you very much Mr speaker so Representative Martin
you voted for that 2007 budget that included the lottery money fro other
money than supplement as oppose as to plan for it not ,
Speaker Changes: That's correct follow up Mr speaker ,
Speaker Changes: Gentlemen you,
Speaker Changes: Yes sir ,
Speaker Changes: He yells,
Speaker Changes: Representative martin in this case the concern you are
expressing with in fact this money is what is being used out for any
plans for subsequent use as a planning in order to make the current
expenses unlike like the example in 2010 when there was a planning in
the height of the expression in order to meet the deficit for one year
only with that be correct,
Speaker Changes: That's correct i think i go by my district when the
biggest complain i hear why do we need to,why we are having the problem
of teacher salaries with the lotteries suppose to fox everything and
that goes to the hard of planning issue,
Speaker Changes: Members there was one additional amendment that arrived
the Clark before the deadline that therefore we have one more,</p>

Amendment to take up at this time, before we continue the debate.
Representative Adams is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk
will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams moves to amend the
bill on page 120, line 23, by rewriting the line to read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Adams is recognized to debate her amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, this amendment adds a section 12-1J for the Department of Health
and Human Services to ensure that organizations that receive funds under
the maternal and child health block grant for the provision of
reproductive health services or education, provide comprehensive
non-directed reproductive health care counseling. Now, it doesn’t really
matter whether you support choice or my right to choice or whatever you
support, we believe that unbiased reproductive health information should
be provided. Now, the funds that are in the budget that provides for the
crisis pregnancy centers don’t provide comprehensive accurate education
in terms of reproductive health. And that’s what this amendment will do.
It will ensure that the information that women receive is accurate, that
it is not biased, and regardless to where you are on the issue of
abortion, you still need accurate information. So that’s what the
amendment will do. It will allow those individuals who make choices to
get information that’s accurate. And that’s all we’re asking, that
comprehensive information be provided, that whatever the pros and cons
are, that information will be given to those individuals who come to
these centers. That’s the amendment. I hope you will support it,
regardless how you feel about it, everyone can agree that people should
not be mislead or misguided. They shouldn’t be coerced. But that this
information be given to them freely and that’s really what the amendment
does. And I would ask for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Moore is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move the
amendment to lie upon the table. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion to lay the
amendment 31, the Adams amendment, 37, the Adams amendment on the table
having been made by Representative Moore and seconded by Representative
Cleveland, we will now vote on the motion to lay the amendment on the
table. Those in favor of tabling amendment 37 will vote aye. Those
opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock
the machine and record the vote. 67 having voted in the affirmative,
excuse me 69 having voted in the affirmative and 45 in the negative, the
motion to table amendment 37 has passed and members we are back on the
bill. Representative Holloway, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Folks, in the ten years that I’ve been here, I’ve seen a lot of budgets.
And is this budget perfect? No. But I’m going to have to say it’s the
best budget I’ve seen in ten years. This budget gives teachers the raise
that they deserve and not only does it just give them 5% if you look
very close, we’re moving back to try to get teachers to where they’re
supposed to be on the pay scale. To help correct the wrongs that we were
forced to have to do because of shortfalls. It funds TAs, does not cut a
single cent from teacher assistants. It funds HHS, we’re taking care of
the elderly and the sick, and those who need special care.</p>

All the resources that is there, it could be provided to them to help
lift them out of the current situation that they are in and better that
northeastern portion of our state. I urge you to support this amendment
so that we can try to help continue moving Universities like Elizabeth
City State forward and continue and try to move the State forward. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pierce, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Mr. Speaker, Ladies and gentlemen, I rise this afternoon to support this
amendment for a couple of reasons. You spent a lot of [wuss] in the
chamber, in the general assembly of the last two sessions. We've heard
about consolidating and I think, I heard representative Dollar talk
about some things, how good a job people are doing but there was some
[wuss] a couple of years ago about consolidation. I think that's still
in demand of some folks so we need to consider that and what happened
just a few weeks ago I think that you'll remember that legislative black
caucus had a press conference to lay us out against the proposal that
was on the table in dealing with Elizabeth City. But with that proposal
on the table, what you end up doing was you put a nail in the coffin.
Because of what happened students who were thinking about going to
Elizabeth City, you put something in their minds they can then believe
that maybe for a year or two the school could close down. So, I think we
set a dangerous precedent for Elizabeth City by doing that. Black
Universities have been underfunded for years and I think we all know
that and they face a very difficult time and we've got a lot of issues
that we definitely need to deal with but I think we're setting a
dangerous precedent dealing with Elizabeth City because I think that the
[competition] is still gonna be out there. I think the board of
governors still have a mind to find some way somehow to close that
University down. We don't need to run from it, we don't need to hide
from it. I believe they're still talking about it while they're drinking
ice water in back rooms, they are still talking about that. Why do you
say that representative Pierce?
Because we've been talking about it for two sessions; each time we would
beat it back but I still think the reality is on the table to try to
find a way. We're pulling programs, we're pulling curriculum, I remember
that. Keep right on pulling that and eventually students would not want
to go to that University. So, Representative Mobley has a good proposal
on the table. And you're right. I think when I stand and speak, people
say well he's preaching. What's in like everybody else who deny who
don't have a life has been preaching so, I guess I need to preach. But I
think we really need to take a hard look at this and let's be fair to
this university. You have dug a hole for this university in the last two
sessions. Ladies and gentlemen, you did that. You have sent a negative
signal across this state and to surrounding areas. Students who would
consider going there, you sent the wrong signal. So we're asking
tonight, I agree with my colleagues, we need to do the right thing. It's
not gonna hurt the budget. This will help them recruit, this will help
them sustain programs already at that University. Let's give them a
chance. I ask you to vote yes on this amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker
and Ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak briefly on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, for many
years I've represented in my district, the North Carolina central
University and we're proud and ?? Of the work that NCCU has done for our
community and for the state and for the nation. The reason I'm speaking
to support the amendment is because the amendment is about financial
assistance for students and I learned a few years ago in research and in
conversation at NCCU some realities about income of the families at the
HPCUs of our state and Pembroke State vs. UNC Chapel Hill and NC State
and the reality is this that for the five HPCUs, the average family
income is 30,000 dollars. At NC state and at UNC Chapel Hill, the
average family income is 90,000 dollars. It's obvious then that the
young people who are attending these schools badly need financial
assistance and that to me is enough reason for us to make a special
step, an unusual step that ?? To provide assistance for young people.</p>

Domestic violence commission that is a citizen led board of experts and
leaders. And all of these things are just going to be wrapped up, tied
up, and moved to the department of public safety. And when I asked the
question in subcommittee about why this suddenly appeared in the budget,
no one could really give me an answer. It just is. Transferring this
agency to the department of public safety will result in significant
delays in federal and state grant funding to over 239 non-profits in
North Carolina agencies do not maintain 3 to 6 months of funding to
sustain services.
And these agencies reach people that are in need until January 2015 and
so, what do they do between July 1 and January 2015? This could result
in the possible closing of shelters in North Carolina. Shelters that
protect women and their families. This is going to disrupt services that
are supported by federal funding. Federal funding that comes to North
Carolina because of the programs we supply through the council for
women. And basically what this has done is really eviscerated a program
that deals with women, children and family issues that's been running
very efficiently and very well for very many years. And we don't know
why it's suddenly moving. Transferring this agency to the department of
public safety will impact the maintenance of the council for women
regional offices, and those regional offices with the services that they
provide to citizens in Charlotte and Asheville and New Bern and
Greensboro areas. All of those regional offices will be shuttered. And
so what i'm trying to get at here is the sort of random nature of taking
one very well run program, a program to whose council I was appointed
back during the time that Governor Hunt was Governor in North Carolina.
Why would it suddenly be moved to a whole other department? And for that
reason, and for many other reasons that just give me real pause about
this budget, I have to vote no. And I encourage my colleagues to take a
look at the random sort of things that have happened throughout this
budget and give thought to voting no with me. Thank you.

[Speaker Change] The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker change] Thank you Mister Speaker. I would venture to say that
i'm 100% correct in making the statement that not one person on the
floor of this house are 100% sure that they are happy with everything
that's in here. And i'm just going to ask you one question, and the
question is the same for several areas. Think about your objection to
the budget. Now, is your objection of a higher priority than maintaining
the Medicaid eligibility that covers some of the most vulnerable people
that you represent? Is it a higher priority than 9 million dollars extra
in pre-k that will possibly change the direction of peoples lives? Is
your objection of a higher priority than 27 million new dollars in child
protective services? Is your objection higher than an increase of 5
million dollars for our foster care programs? For fully funding school
nurses? For keeping the right school open? Answer those questions and
cast your vote. Please support the budget. Thank you.

I would just like to make sure that we all recognize that infect no
teacher with more than 8 years of experience will be getting a 5% raise
and any teacher with 10 year experience or more will actually get less
than 3% raise based on this budget. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the budget Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the authority to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker I had not actually much to
probably your thinking not true not plan to debate the budget this
evening. And I am gonna tell you why and then I am gonna tell you why I
am debating. And no one notes which is always been my way of doing it,
may be the lawyer and me I don't like to go anywhere where I am prepared
but this gonna be truly extemporaneous this evening for me because
literally I have fall elbow with myself for three days over whether to
vote for this budget or not and I am going to tell you why I am not
going to. But I am going to set out first reasons why I have almost did.
I don't think the majority in this body should be commended for doing
couple of things, first for understanding particularly in the education
arena, where I think the couches disserve immense credit for how they
have tried to deal with the restriction in the budget and I think they
deserve credit for saying something that very few of us find easy to say
and that is we made mistakes and they should receive credit for
acknowledging that, weather it is on teacher pay or masters pay weather
it is on carrier statics. We are making some corrective course change
here and that is something we all should be grateful for but I will day
we are making corrective changes impart because of self-inflected wounds
that many of is in the minority warned you about and warned us about for
several years and the results this year can come home to roost in far
greater way than may be anyone of us imagined. We are suffering enormous
enormous difficulty in public education and I credit the majority by
trying to put their fingers in the breaches in the dam and had they
turned that 2 and 3 and even last year we might not be facing a dam that
has multiple beaches where simply stopping a few is not going to hold up
the dam. We have teachers retiring in an ?? numbers. They have literal
confidence in what we do and so that is something we all should share
responsibility for. So while I credit the fixes I have to say that in
this sense for some degree the budget that we pass tonight all be it
many times better than the enormously destructive Senate budget that
passed just a week ago. Is a budget a paraphrasing something president
Bush said years ago remains of budget that is suffers from soft ?? of
the lowest expectations it has its core structural deficit that we do
not fix tonight and we make no plan to sustain a fix for it which in
large measure concerns me greatly. And while it may or may not be true
weather there are other ways for doing things. I cannot in good
conscious some who stood up here and told you last year that I would if
I could change one vote in this building and either it was my vote on
the lottery but now we sit here and try to suppliant completely and hold
our hopes on fixing those things we have done wrong to public education
and elsewhere but the hopes that more and more people will gamble and to
the tune of hundred and 10 million more dollars I think that is just
inherently died way to run a government and it doesn't do justice to
what the majority is trying to do.</p>

Found other ways to fix the teacher pay issue and get us started in the
right direction. Took that lottery proceeds that are there and try to
use  them in other capacities to bolster the budget as a backdrop. There
might at least be an understanding. But that’s not what’s been done
here. And the second thing I would say, in doing this, we are praising
ourselves tonight for giving teacher the pay rise and we should give
them the pay rise. And much more sustainable, I suppose in the relevant
scheme of things between the house and the senate. And we are 46th in
the nation.And we allowed ourselves to get here. And we have no plans to
truly improve it pass it this year, except some good intent, I hope.
Although we fixed the masters pay and some worked through the status.,
can you honestly look at yourself and say, we would have done anything
to the status had the court not joined us.  We are doing this as we
almost have to. But at the same time what we failed to say on this floor
is that the last several years, including years when we were in chair,
we have made over 500 million in continuing cuts to public education.
Thousands of positions that we don’t try to remedy at all  tonight. We
just assume that they can continue to live with it. We have made
multiple digit percentage cuts to office supplies, to central office
personnel, to non certified personnel and we don’t attempt to fix  it
tonight. Because we say we can’t. That is fundamentally a self
fulfilling prophecy. We can we simply chose not to. I don’t agree with
that.  My god. I simply don’t agree with that. Even if that’s the way to
go  given what’s happening in the school today, it cannot be the
confidence builder that we need to have. I looked at the JPS budget. I
sat in and was privileged enough to sit in on Chairman ?? and Chairman
Davis, had good discussions. But the Unanimous report that came out of
that that includes the plead by nearly every aspect of the court system
for help. One of those was by the crime lab. We have lost 50% of the
personnel in a couple of years because they were simply not paid
anything approaching the market rate. We sit on this floor and talk
about the justice system and then the one thing that might help totally
move through the criminal justice system and we do nothing about that.
We sat in that committee and we listened to the fact that ?? defense
services is nearly $ 6 million in back payments and we do nothing
seriously to help them.But we did say, we would try. Are we really
trying?
Chairman Dawry said enormous times how much burden exists on AOC and the
justice system and in truth we don’t do much to help them. Simply we try
to see that there is no further damage. In Helping human services,
majority should be commended for fixing some of the problem that senate
caused in the budget, because this medicaid budget is simply better. But
can we honestly look and  say that we solved any of the issues that we
really say exists with the service needs that are there. Probably not.
The best that can be said is that we are inflicting more damage. Is that
really the vision for the state that we are inflicting it more damage.
On the environment front, we had a few people back. But that after we
terminated  20% to 30% of the department over the last coupleof years.
Is that really the best we can do?. So, I came very close. Because I
wanted to commend the majority for at least admitting responsibility and
moving  in the right direction on several fronts. But I can’t do it
because when the fix is a lottery fix. And I can’t do it, when there is
no sustainable effort that appears to be there to get us past this year
and to really move us to a different place. I may  speak more in the
morning when I have my thoughts together after a long day. I want the
majority to know that I appreciate everything they are trying to do. But
it is as Representative Lucas said and as Rep Martin said, we can do and
we have to do much better than we are doing tonight. And I believe in
higher expectations for all of us. I believe that’s what the citizens
have. And I believe we owe them a better effort that we put in forth
this budget. Thank you.

Please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I appreciate all the
members who have given a lot of attention and effort, my sympathies to
Representative Holloway who says this is one of the toughest things he’s
had to do. And certainly he now empathizes with many of the people who
had to make this happen in the past. I’d probably ask you to close your
eyes and just think good thoughts. And that would probably be emblematic
of some of what we have of this budget that’s critical. Because our
teacher pay crisis deserves more than we’ve given them. And we’re part
of this body too, and so we’ll be looked at as well. And unfortunately
it’s hard to explain to people that hey, we didn’t have a vote. It was a
super majority. We were just along for the ride. We’ll share the blame
for what we did here. Our best teachers will still decide to leave our
state, or they’ll keep working two or three jobs until they just can’t
carry it anymore, and leave the profession. And we’ll still have this
problem in front of us. Many of you have businesses and you understand
and have served in government and you understand maintenance cycles. And
when you fail to do that maintenance, what’s needed to keep things
operating at a good level, and you go to the next cycle, you understand
that you’re doubling the costs. In some way, form or fashion, you’re
doubling the cost. And that’s what I fear that we’re doing now. Our per
people spending will still rank among the worst in the nation, even with
this budget. It does nothing to dig us out of the hole that we’ve
achieved or has resulted from the past cuts of the past few years. And
it doesn’t really give our students then a fair shot and a fair chance
at success. I want to talk about the lottery issue because either a lot
of people fell asleep on it, a lot of folks didn’t really want to see
the truth here. And I certainly want to talk about that because it’s
critical as we talk about funding education. Now we put our lottery
commission in an untenable situation. We told them to figure out what
additional advertising would do as far as revenue it would generate. And
they came back and said well if we did this additional advertising, it
generates $65 million to $105 million. $65 million to $105 million,
about a $40 million spread.  And somehow the absolute top end of that
number got legs without examination and vetting. I don’t know how it got
by you. I trusted in good faith that somehow it just got accepted.
Everybody closed their eyes, thought good thoughts, and we had $105
million all of a sudden. Now, that was before Representative Stam’s
amendment got in on this lottery act. That would by his intent and own
admission, should and probably would decrease the amount of funding that
could be achieved even under that maximum best-case scenario that’s been
put out there to fund these teachers’ raises. I don’t think it was
irresponsibility. Maybe it was a blind spot and we’re reaching for a
solution here in an election year and we’re not being as careful as we
normally are, not doing as much due diligence as we would normally do.
But if you think about it, if just doing more advertising would generate
that additional revenue, then they’d never get fired on Madison Avenue.
Advertising executives would never lose an account if that’s all it
took. Another item in the budget that we need to look at, we’ve decided
that we’re going to move the SBI from the Attorney General to the
Department of Public Safety. And you’ve heard some people comment
already on the problems that’s going to</p>

There are currently ongoing investigations into the governor's office
regarding Duke Energy and the Coal Ash Bill and the Dan River into
donations that were given from sweepstakes gambling on the internet. So
we all know that these things are happening and they're challenging the
confidence the public has in us and our process. And they certainly are
coming to rely on the Attourney General's office to be the one person
standing outside of our process that they can look to let them know
what's going on. And then you think about it, you say, &quot;Well, why
the Attourney General's office? What difference does it make?&quot; 290
investigations into public corruption and influence over the past few
years, since 2009. That's a large number. That's a lot of work. That's a
lot of responsibility. And the public relies on us to provide them that
assurance that we're not down here inside trading and inside dealing
with their interests. The one thing we know after all of these budgets
and again Representative Holloway has my sympathies. I understand and he
now better understands what it's like and the great effort he's put in.
And everyone who's worked on it. As he said late nights, et cetera. But
we chose to do this budget in this fashion. Thats your choice. Could've
done it like the Senate, done it over night. Wham bam, thank you ma'am
and roll something out. We could've had more involvement by community
groups and others in the hearing process. We did have a hearing process
though, and that's to our credit, over at the Senate. But we still have
that problem of our budget. You heard a comment about teachers'
salaries. Let's talk about what this budget is going to do about
teachers' salaries. And we talk about it's going to give a pay raise.
Well, if you're a teacher with 36 years in, you get 0. 35.64 percent. 34
1.30. If you're seventeen years in, you get a 2.21 percent pay raise.
Eighteen years, 2.25. Nineteen years, you're 2.29. So, as was already
commented, once you get past the eighth year, you head downward on the
sacle. So are we really giving our teachers what they deserve and
thereby giving our children what they deserve? I continue to push the
majority to do more and do better. Some people say that's the job of the
worthy opposition. And I know some of you would say I'm not worthy, but
that is part of what we do. And that's why we need to be in the process.
To push you to have better ideas and come up with a better solution for
North Carolina. We can't fund our teachers, we can't fund our children's
education, we can't fund the future of this state on a lottery and on a
number that's the top of the range before we minimized our ability to
reach it. Why is that important? At the end of the day. And we'll get
there. At the end of the day both the House and the Senate has said the
budget's fine as it is. We can go home. We don't need to reach an
accomodation. So with those statements out there, I can't now support
what I don't know because we know this would need to go to conference.
And both chambers have expressed that they don't feel they have to come
to an accomodation on this budget. So where do we go from there? And
once again I look to the majority leader. Excuse me, the Speaker Pro
Tempore. And he says he's not concerned if teachers' pay raises are now
tied closely to a prominence of increased lottery sales. If they don't
get met, we'll just find the money somewhere else. Well we know what the
solution has been on that. We shoud all be honest. The solution has been
let's cut employees, let's cut teachers, let's</p>

Cut teachers’ assistants, that’s what the solution had been the last
couple of cycles and this lottery fix is not a fix so where do we end
up? We either end up in a bigger hole next year or we end up reducing
teachers, reducing state employees, and not fulfilling the promise in
the illusion we’ve created by saying this budget will provide that
assistance. Now I know lots of folks are going to say well you know
you’re in the minority and you need to sit down and be quiet and let us
do what we do, but that’s not really our job. We got elected like you
did, we represent districts just like you do, we have people who are
relying on us, the future of North Carolina, our family members, all of
those. So we can’t sit down and be quiet, we can only push you to be
honest with yourselves and do the best you can do. So again I can’t
support this budget right now, I know it has to go to conference ,I know
there’s been effort made on the house side. I remember the last budget
we sent over to the senate and I implored you, I said please after all
the work we’ve done, do not sell out, do not give up and give in and
give away the principles that we espoused and said that we had when you
did all the work you did to put this together. Don’t just roll over, lie
down, and walk away and then that’s a disservice to everyone that
participated in the process for that to happen and so although it’s been
said that that might be what happens, that people could live with that
and accept it, I hope you won’t do that. I hope you’ll go and fight for
what you claim is in this budget that’s important and I hope you also
find a way to legitimately sustain these raises because there is no
study and I checked with the North Carolina lottery commission, there is
no statement from them saying they can reach this number since we put
this damn amendment on and we’re being irresponsible and closing our
eyes and apparently thinking those good thoughts and just whistling on
past the graveyard so I you’ll open your eyes, look at reality,
negotiate hard, and serve the people of North Carolina and when you
bring back whatever it is that comes back from the conference committee
I hope it’s something that we can then support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dollar please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker, members of the house, I find it very
interesting it’s like a basketball game and you’ll have some fans and
they’ll sit up the stands and they’ll criticize and say oh they’re not
playing hard enough and they can’t shoot, they’re not working together,
this is bad, that’s bad, but when are they going to get in the game and
actually play? I hear all the time criticism but who is there soldiering
with us in this endeavor to try to have a budget that meets the needs of
our citizens? And so when people only want to sit on the sidelines and
don’t want to get in and don’t want to vote for things and don’t want to
move forward, I don’t take them quite as seriously, but I do want to
answer some things that have been raised. You talk about teacher using
the lottery for teacher pay, we do it already, $220 million. You already
have $505 million there that the budget relies on coming from the
lottery and what does that fund? That funds teachers in the classroom.
That funds pre-K. That funds school construction. That funds a whole
host of things that are continuing expenditures and it’s been done that
way for years. The percentage of the lottery that has gone to education
has been dropping over years. That was the other side that said what
we’ll do is take off the percentage, the restrictions, on the
percentages that could be used for prizes because what would it do? It
would increase sales. Well it did increase sales, but you also drop the
percentage that’s coming into education from the overall take of the
lottery.</p>

We went to Lottery this year and said, look, we want to know what we can
do to generate additional money for education. Let the Education Lottery
be the Education Lottery. They came to us with the idea. We didn’t
create the numbers. They came to us with these numbers.   Some are
criticizing for the teacher pay schedule. I am just amazed. It’s your
pay schedule. It’s the one, as a matter of fact, as I recall, you froze.
And now you don’t want to help us to unfreeze the pay schedule. That
makes no sense. And I don’t mean to quibble. But when I hear things like
well, the people at the top of the pay range are not getting any salary
increase. Obviously they have not read the budget. They get a bonus.
It’s average of the pay increase at those top ranges.  Everybody is
getting an increase and nobody is left out o this budget. And what do we
do for the future. And we are trying to plan for the future to modernize
the total compensation system with career pathways. And we are trying to
address the fact that we are losing teachers by rising entry level
teacher pay by substantial amount. And we had made a commitment not just
for this year, but also for the next year that we are going to keep and
you can bet on it.
Let me mention a couple of other things. This budget and it has been
brought to everyone’s attention. We are putting in ?? for medic aid to
protect those programs. We have got millions more going in to  job
protective  services. We have got money to address coal ash that
everybody say as a major issue that they want to be addressed by this
general assembly. We are helping veterans and veteran education. We are
putting  money  in, we are fulfilling the community college’s number one
request to the tune of $ 50 million in closing the skills gap. These are
great things that we are doing in this budget. Who is going to come with
us? Who is going to be with us to get these things done? We are putting
money in mental health crisis. I remember when mental health was being
cut by this chamber by the majority by $ 174 million. People seem to
forget that. Few years ago. I haven’t forgotten it. I remember when
those cuts came through. Now we are trying to get money back in to the
system. where is the help for that? I get the impression often that it
is simply a matter of Ok , what people really are saying is they want us
to rise the taxes. But they don’t want to say that. When I hear remarks
like, where you could have done better , you could have done more on
teacher pay, you could have  done here, you could have done it without
funding mechanism since you are looking at doing instead of having
funding mechanism. What you are really saying is you want to raise taxes
but you don’t want to say that. Got to have the  courage and say look ,
we have got a solution. we want to raise taxes. That’s a legitimate
policy. Bring it forward. Be happy to talk with you about that. And what
the alternatives are? I got to mention one another thing and that’s the
whole business domestic violence. The program is moving intact and there
are no cuts. The program is moving intact and will operate. And we
believe it may even operate better than it’s currently operating. There
are so many good things in the budget. The budget is structurally sound.
I just have to laugh out loud when people bring the question, it’s not
structurally sound as it should to be.   Really? You are telling me the
budget we have inherited from you in 2011 with a $2.5  billion
structural hole in it. Compared to this budget. It doesn’t have
structural holes that pay with recurring expenditure with recurring
dollars. That’s exactly what everybody said in this chamber that we want
to have it in this budget and we have been doing that in very difficult
times. So, I would say to all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
I believe we have crafted a very strong budget that is sound that is
responsible that funds our top priorities in very difficult times. Who
is going to ?? their share of the load. Who is going to shoulder?</p>

Responsibility to the citizens tonight and vote for this budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Robert Brawley please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ask Representative Dollar a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dollar does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dollar you made some very good points,
you and your committee have worked very hard. Would you accept a thank
you?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I would accept a thank you on behalf of the 22 full
chairs and subcommittee chairs of the committees and on behalf of all
those who have worked with us on the appropriations committee, thank you
very much. And the finance committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dwayne Hall please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak to the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the budget as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Members, I walked in today because of the teacher
salary increases and reinstituting the steps program with the intention
to vote for this budget. A lot of members of my caucus tried to convince
me not to, leadership tried to convince me not to, but it was actually a
member on your side that changed my mind. It was a representative that
after we stood up with a great amendment that I know a lot of you guys
agreed with and again laid it on the table so Representative Dollar
asked us to get in the game. You guys don’t allow us to play, you
haven’t allowed us much of the session so this budget is your budget,
this budget that cuts money from DENR, this budget that takes the SBI
and puts it under the control of the people that it’s investigated,
including a lot of members in this gallery. This budget that cuts pre-K
childhood development, this is your budget, this budget that cuts legal
aid and indigent defense services where I started my legal career
defending people who can’t afford to take care of themselves, this is
your budget. So don’t tell me to accept my responsibility, my
responsibility is to the people that voted for me and I’m voting against
this budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Burr please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Will Representative Hall yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall does the gentleman yield? The
gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall you just mentioned that this budget
cuts pre-K, can you please show me where this budget cuts the overall
pre-K spending?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] It cuts who is eligible for pre-K, it eliminates a lot
of people that could have had that help that is no longer going to be
there.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative Hall can you show me what page in this
budget we’re cutting eligibility for pre-K?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I don’t have the page in front of me now.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] So are you positive we’re cutting funding from pre-K or
cutting eligibility for pre-K?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’m certain we’re cutting whose eligible for pre-K.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall I would suggest that you actually
read the budget and would ask that you take a look at that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Burr is the gentleman framing a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir I’m getting there. I would recommend that you
read the budget, specifically the section dealing with education and
pre-K and health care and maybe respond to the question when you have an
opportunity to look at that but you will see that pre-K is not cut,
eligibility, nor funding.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Insko please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’d like to ask Representative Burr a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] If the members will yield, Representative Hall did you
rise a second time to be recognized to debate the budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I did Mr. Speaker. The eligibility cuts are on page G5
of the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall does the gentleman yield for a
follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] No Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Insko please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’d like to ask Representative Hall a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall does the gentleman yield for a
follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Are you aware Representative Hall that we changed the
eligibility for childcare subsidy in the health and human services
budget we previously had given childcare subsidy for children at 75% of
the..</p>

The average income in North Carolina would change that to 100% of
federal poverty level.
[Speaker Change] I am aware. I think we changed it to 133%.
[Speaker Change] Do you wish to ask a follow up question?
[Speaker Change] Yes.
[Speaker Change] Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Change] Do you have the numbers on how many children that will
cut in that age range? That would no longer be eligible for that
program? I believe it's about 2,500 children. Is that the number you
have?
