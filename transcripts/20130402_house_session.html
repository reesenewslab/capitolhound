Representative Tine, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill is a local bill that includes Dare and
Brunswick Counties. It came from our County Commissioners and the
attorney for the county. Basically what it would do is allow the county
to remove sunken vessels or those vessels that are left at someone
else's dock for more than 30 days without permission. Right now, they do
not have the authority. It does rest with the coast guard or with the
Corps of Engineers, who don't tend to have the interest or the funds in
order to remove those vessels. In order to safe-guard the rights of the
property owners, we patented after the existing automobile laws. So it
provides notice and it also requirements of storage and sale of the
abandoned vehicles. I ask for your support on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I found out this bill was being filed by
Representative Tine and we have a situation in Holden Beach in Brunswick
County. A sunken shrimp boat about 65, 70 feet long. It's been there
over a year. It's left at the dock, I guess because of the economic
reasons somebody has walked away from it. And it is a hazard to
navigation in my opinion, because the intercoastal waterway is very
narrow there even though the co-engineers has chosen not to remove it.
So I appreciate just right be given to the county to remove it. Please
support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Commissioners first and I ask for your approval.

Murray's written as simple and amendment of article rate
this Mindel a online student for rewriting the lines read the rest of
economic and initial speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
the purpose of this amendment is to allow the individual who is placing
their property into a storage facility to elect whether they would like
to receive notice, either by mail or by their electronic mail, e-mail,
so the occupant of the of person who's engaging in this leasehold
agreement and choose whether they want to receive their information by
e-mail or by certified mail, and it's a verified e-mail address, which
means they leave their companies out there that help help these help you
identify whether the e-mail address is actually being received in this
country that help verify that so that's the purpose of the amendment is
to put the good, the the Lisa, unless the person is entering in
hiscontract in the driver seat and let them choose whether they want to
receive certified mail or by e-mail.
night is recognized and
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
identified out there much in support of this amendment is another deals
with a lot of people 's concerns about getting notice that the person
who is actually under the contract help comply with the notice
requirements. NSB sport of amendment presented built Raleigh police that
your purpose. the only amendment we don't underestimate in an is just
bigger house and had an amendment to address this issue,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
which was somewhat tighter. the problem with this choice goes back to
the problem we had last week. there is no proof that notice was given.
you can send it to a certified e-mail address you send a certified
letter, but it certified return receipt letter after twenty days after
the letters say the auction takes place with no decision whether it is
received or not, most people in the self-service industry self storage
industry are reputable businessman who will act in a responsible manner.
unfortunately that's not the people for whom we make regulations, we
just said everybody be a good neighbour. be honest. be fair, be
friendly, we wouldn't have a problem we can't do that. the people we
have to address of the ones where ewe have to ensure receipt was made
where we have to ensure notice was given this amendment does not achieve
that. it simply changes it from something imposed to a choice of you
either get an e-mail. or maybe you get a mail that you don't know there
is not a duty to ensure delivery I'm opposed to the amendment

I will say the more I learn about this bill, the more problems I have
with it, but I will also say that the little amendment that I have,
which is on the third page and moves things back to the way they were,
that is to say, back to $15 and 15%, it is a good idea. You may remember
last week really when I asked why was this happening, it was just sort
of like, well, we thought we could get a little more money or there was
no answer to it. So I appreciate that ?? supports this. I know of no
opposition to it. So I do think this puts us back in the right direction
and urge a yes vote on the amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

To simply speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is

Representative Luebke for coming forward with me and working on
resolving that issue. As you can see, some of the problems you probably
have with the bill altogether is the existing bill, which is certified
mail which is $10 or $15 and 15%.  So it's always been there, we're
simply trying to tighten it up and make it more available for people to
get things done. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Further discussion, further debate
on the amendment. If not, the question before the House is to pass the
amendment sent forth by Representative Luebke for the House Committee
Substitute of House Bill 243. All those if favor will vote aye, all
opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will now
proceed to record the vote. 105 having voted affirmative, 8 in the
negative. The amendment passes. We're back on the bill. Further
discussion, further debate. Representative Bill Brawley, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I've actually made an
inquiry of the Chairman of the Rules Committee to find out if my
amendment is now out of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The House will be at
ease. Representative Brawley, the substance of your amendment is not out
of order. It would only be out of order because of the amendments that
have passed to this point. Therefore, without objection we will displace
this bill to allow you time to revise the amendment. Ladies and
gentlemen, we are now, I see a number of interested parties in the
gallery.  We now are going to move back to the top of the calendar and
go to House Resolution 487. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House
Resolution 487. House Resolution expressing gratitude and appreciation
to our veterans. The House resolves. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative
Brawley, the Chair understands that the affect of the amendments on the
prior bill will carry that bill over anyway so you will not have to rush
to prepare that amendment and it will be on the calendar for tomorrow.
Representative Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To request that the resolution be read in its entirety.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The clerk will read. The House will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Whereas throughout our country's history, generations
of men and women have worn the uniform of the United States and have
valiantly defended our nation and its inalienable rights.  And whereas
our veterans have personally sacrificed so much for the greater good of
our nation. Some of these brave men and women made the ultimate

citizens and all Americans. And whereas six major Department of Defense,

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House and veterans who are
with us today.  This nation, conceived in liberty, was founded by a
group of men, which former justice Joseph Storey of the United States
Supreme Court called architects of consummate skill and fidelity, and in
defense of the newly declared liberty, they, with a firm reliance on the
protection of divine providence, mutually pledged their lives, their
fortunes, and their sacred honor.  No one has more epitomized that
example of our founders than those who went and served in our armed
forced to defend that liberty that we enjoy today.  We would not be here
today in an institution which embodies the very core of the ideal of
government, by the people, of the people, and for the people, except for
the willingness of so many to serve in defense of that freedom and of
these institutions, and we are forever in their debt.  Many willingly
marched into the valley of the shadow of death and chose death before
dishonor, and we're humbled here today to have you here and to honor our
veterans, for we know it's the soldier, not the politician, who gave us
our republic.  It's the soldier, not the rabbi, priest, or pastor, who
gave us freedom of religion.  It's the soldier, not the law professor,
that gave us the right to free speech.  It's the soldier, not the TV
news anchor, who gave us freedom of the press.  It's the soldier, not
the community organizer, who gave us the right to protest, and it's the
soldier who saluted the flag, who served beneath the flag, and whose
blood-soaked coffin was draped by the flag, that gave the protester the
ability to burn the flag, so we're humbled to be here today.  Without
the sacrifice of those who served in our armed forces, there would be no
freedom in the world today.  Tyranny would have triumphed, the brutal
dictator would have triumphed, or the pernicious doctrine and fanaticism
of it we see today would have triumphed, and liberty and freedom would
have been extinguished, and we have seen this now over two centuries on
battlefields in land, on air, and on the sea over and over again, often
in conditions that can only be described as hellish.  In fact, on
Guadalcanal in World War II, there was a saying of those who finally got
off that wretched island after months of brutal combat and
half-starvation in jungle conditions that when I die, I'll go to Heaven,
to St. Peter I will tell, one more Marine reporting, sir; I've served my
time in Hell.  And we've seen these conditions over and over again.
Often forgotten are the men of the 32nd Infantry Division at Buna and
Gona in New Guinea whose conditions were really more wretched than
Guadalcanal.  They had to hike over the Owen Stanley mountains through
jungle and were eaten with dysentery, malaria, and disease not relieved
and in a division that was months in combat without relief, serving
literally in swamps.  The water table was only three feet deep, and the
Japanese had built reinforced emplacements that the men of the 32nd ID
were told again and again to take in their weak and barely could stand
condition, and they endured that for months, and finally</p>

…We have seen this repeated over on ___[00:03] almost 6,000 marines
died, Admiral Chester Nimitz said of them, “Uncommon Valor Was A Common
Virtue.&quot; In the Leyte Gulf, when the Japanese had successfully
created a rouge and had the admiral Halsey Steamer of North with his
carriers the troop transport in the minor ships were naked before the
full battleship and cruiser force to the Japanese Navy that it’s
___[00:33] channel and it was only six or seven destroyers that
suicidally charged battleships that held them off long enough and fought
them hard enough that Admiral try to turn around and left before
inflicting incredible havoc to the landing force. So, we have seen this
over and over again personified throughout our history over 200 years
maybe by James Laurence Captain of the Chester Peak in the War of 1812
who said gave his dying command, “Don’t give up the ship.” I think
that’s now inscribe that the Naval Academy. Admiral I think it was
Farragut, David Farragut in Mobile Bay reflected the interrupted spirit,
“Damn the torpedoes full speed ahead.” And we have seen that even later
in our history at the present time often forgotten is the operation in
Mogadishu where a black hawk went down in American pine with a leg
broken was pinned in it and staff Sergeant Randy ___[01:44] and Master
Sergeant Garry Gordon volunteered to be landed at the back hawk with
2,000…I don’t know what you call them opponents with AK-47 is about the
overran and they two men went in there and sacrifice their lives
willingly to try to hold off that arm pored. Just last year in Benghazi
former navy seals Tyron Woods and Glenn Gardy ordered to stand down,
they were off sight where the terrorist attack occurred ordered to stand
down disregarded the order because they put death before dishonor and
they went in and did their job and gave their live. So, we are still
seeing that today and I can tell you ladies and gentleman and veterans
sometimes it gets discouraging to see the example of our men and women
in uniform and those who came before us and contrast that to those
characteristics of the people in political class and wonder, “Why can’t
we capture that same courage that same commitment that same devotion in
this by the people, within the people who are institutions.” And I think
that might be why people looking at us to give us such slow ratings and
I’m not clicking on anybody that’s a cross government ___[03:24]
institutions now and I think we need to follow that example more and I
can tell you sometimes I’m discouraged by the way things are going when
I see still in the face of a populist that sometimes is cynical and
sometimes itself possessed and self observed, there are still young
people being produced in this country today that come forward in the
same spirit we have seen and volunteer and go do incredible deeds and
incredible sacrificial deeds and I think there is still a reason to keep
fighting, there is still a reason to keep trying and the example you
have set for us and the veterans have set for us stands as a testament
to us for all the time to keep going and keep defending this liberty and
keep up the admonition of President John F. Kennedy, inaugural address
that we would pay any price, bare any burden, meet any hardship, support
any friend, oppose any foe to assure their survival and success of
liberty and that’s what we need to do today to really honor you veterans
so I support the resolution.

And ladies and gentlemen of the gallery, you have a distinction not
shared by anyone  else.  When you applauded,  you're the first time in
my three years as speaker, that that has not been met with a gavel.  So
that just shows the utmost respect that you have and  the appreciation

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepherd, the gentlemen will be appropriately recorded.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are back on the calendar.
House Bill 89, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 89, a bill to be entitled, &quot;An Act to Require the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources to Support the
Application of a Regional Water Supply System for all Required Federal
Approvals, as Recommended by the Environmental Review Commission.&quot;
General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, colleagues, this is a bill that comes to the floor the
Environmental Review Commission, although it took a dip in the
Environment Committee, also, before coming here.  It's really in the
nature of a technical correction to a bill; that we passed last year
regarding water reservoirs.  Last the bill required DENR to be a
co-applicant when seeking federal approval on water reservoirs and in
the Environmental Review Commission, we realized that we still wanted
DENR to be a full supporter of any permit that was put forward and had
cleared DENR in the federal process but making them a co-applicant was a
mistake because they really didn't have control over the application.
So, if you look at the bill on the second page, you'll see basically the
same wordage reinserted into the statute.  It is a technical correction
and actually was a bill that was originally put forward by our former
colleague Mitch Gillespie, so please don't vote against the bill on that
grounds.  I recommend the bill to you.

risk of repeating everything the Clerk just said, this is a very simple

held on even-numbered primaries or even-numbered year primaries or on
the municipal or general elections. It does have a caveat in there for
public health and safety emergencies and also sheriff’s elections. This
bill passed last year in the House overwhelmingly and was not acted upon

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, it’s my
privilege to tell you a little bit about Andrew Heath, who has been
appointed by the Governor to fill a position on the Industrial
Commission. Mr. Heath is a Wilmingtonian. He attended the University of
North Carolina at Asheville. He later attended and graduated from the
Indiana University School of Law. He’s been practicing for some time in
a law firm in Wilmington where 100% of his practice is dedicated to
workers’ compensation litigation. He represents a full spectrum of North
Carolina employers in all phases of workers’ compensation claims
including investigation, invincibility, analysis, mediations and
depositions, deputy commissioner hearings and appeals to the full
Industrial Commission and North Carolina Court of Appeals. He provides
presentations for clients on legislative and case law updates affecting
the North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act. Prior to working with that
law firm, he worked with another law firm where he represented injured
workers in workers’ compensation claims. I’d like to say that he was

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. This just a narrow... our sanitary landfill, it
would allow a buffer to change from a gameland buffer from a mile to 500
feet in a very specific way. If it was a county of less than 15,000
population, and the town, it's only for c and d, construction
demolition, and if this town were located in this county which was only
15,000 population, and the gameland and the c and d landfill were also
divided by a US highway. Sounds kind of like a local bill but you can't
do a local landfill bill. So this is a statewide bill which is limited,
very limited, and I ask for your vote. Thank you.
