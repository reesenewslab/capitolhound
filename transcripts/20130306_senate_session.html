The Senate will come to order. Sergeant-at-Arms, close the doors.
Members will go to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery will
please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is
the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in
the gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let us pray. Dear Lord, every time we meet we pray you
that you cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of your
Holy Spirit. We think a thousand thoughts in a minute. As small as a
cell phone or loneliness or good food, and we trust that you do in fact
hold all these things in your sight. You turn the wind. You examine our
hearts. You are the great physician. Now unto him that is able to keep
you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of His
glory. With exceeding joy, we give you thanks, Lord. In your name we
pray, Amen.

[Speaker Changes] Folks, as I sit here and address you today, 116 people
are waiting, right now, on organ transplants nationally, and 3,500 of
those individuals are right here in our beloved state. Eighteen people
waiting every single day die from the shortage of organ donation. Every
10 minutes, another name is added to the national register. Do you
realize that one organ donor can save the lives of eight people, and
improve the lives of 50 people, through tissue and cornea donation.

Voter vehicles has played a critical role in organ donation. With 99% of
donors having registered when receiving their North Carolina driver’s
license and ID card.  Our state is blessed to have a state donor
registry.  That is the sixth largest registry in the country with, get
this, 4.3 million North Carolinians having registered with the Division
of Motor Vehicles through Donate Life North Carolina’s online registry.
The state of North Carolina joins Donate Life North Carolina, our
state’s organ recover agencies, Carolina Donor Services, the North
Carolina Eye Bank, Life Share of the Carolina’s, many health care
professionals, volunteers, educators, government agencies, faith based
and community groups and private organizations in an effort to boost the
numbers of organ, tissue, eye, blood, bone marrow and stem cell donors
throughout North Carolina. So what I bring for you today for your
consideration and hopefully your heart felt support, is that we will
amend Chapter 103 of the General Statutes to read as, Organ Donation
Awareness, Donate Life Month.  The month of April of each year is
designated as Organ Donation Awareness Donate Life Month in North
Carolina.  This act shall be known as Duffy’s Law, of which Mr.
President and a point of personal privilege I will explain more. I
commend this to you.

Thank you.  I would like to thank Senator Gunn for bringing this
forward.  As we’re sitting in Committee, many showed their IDs with the
hearts and I remember at the age of 16 going and becoming a donor and
many things that we see in this Chamber, in many ways when we submit
this through this bill, it may indeed help save lives so thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, thank you so much for this vote today and this vote of
confidence for these fine organizations in North Carolina, which are
doing such important work to give life to many, many folks who are in
desperate need.  You see on your desk today I have provided each of you
with a Donate Life pen and some information on the Donate Life North
Carolina and also on the Duffy Collin Organ Transplant Foundation.  I
cannot tell you the efforts that have been made in this state to make
the awareness of organ donation more visible and the results that have
occurred from that. And we do need to give thanks to the licensures at
the highway patrol and the DMV.  They worked tirelessly to make sure
that people are aware and that these opportunities are there.  Think
about it.  4.3 million, 4.3 million folks have registered to donate
life. 4.3 million in this state. Something we can certainly be proud of.
As legislatures, what can we do? I think it’s highlighted on the end of
your flyer there. But wear your Donate Life pin we will have in April
there will be another day here and I’d like to each of you to take that
pin and keep in your desk drawer and when we have a Donate Life day.</p>

&lt;h3&gt;The bill was passed a few years ago restricted them from
getting that final permit and the piece of it that kept them from doing
that was the piece mentioned then within a certain distance of a

region to where the sandy landfill can be built and this recycling

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ?? will be recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, this legislation comes as a result of a five month study
through the legislative research commission during the 2011-12 interim.
We invited input from all interested group who shared a lot of the same
concerns. We had a round table discussion. The participants included Art
North Carolina, Nammey North Carolina. Disability Rights North Carolina,
the UNC School of Government, Department of Health and Human Services,
administrative doctors of the courts, North Carolina sheriff's
association, North Carolina Attorney General's office. The district
attorneys association, the ?? defender, and the North Carolina Psych
Association. So you can see by that listing that we have a lot of people
talking at that round table discussion. We found common ground on most
issues resulting in the bill that you have before you today. I know of
no opposition to the bill. The bill's content pertains to criminal
defendants whose capacity to stand trial is raised in the preliminary
face of the trial and the process that follows. Under section one, all
misdemeanors will be evaluated locally with only felons being evaluated
at central prison. It also sets time frames for reports made to the
courts. Section two causes restoration of competency to be a part of
treatment and requires a reevaluation for capacity to proceed before
release from a state hospital after involuntary commitment. Section four
expedites the trial process upon release from a state hospital to avoid
deterioration of the defendant while sitting in jail. Under section five
there's an inclusion, a provision allowing the prosecution to reinstate
proceedings upon the defendant becoming capable to proceed. The
exception being where the defendant has already been held for the
prescribed maximum term of his imprisonment. You know we talk about
efficiencies in government, and this is in the area that we should
command efficiency. This allows the defendant their day in court and
brings closure to the victims. I ask for your support. Thank you.

all ?? this bill does, in 2011 you remember we done a lot of things to
change the way DENR operated and sort of to assist folks in getting
things done.  Well, we might have got a little bit happy in that aspect,
and so one thing that this bill does is tweaks the language from the
2011, and provides solutions to some early problems that we have
detected.  Currently as it stands DENR may be a co-applicant on a
federal permit if the local governments request it.  DENR does not have
administrative control over these water projects, so in turn if anything
goes wrong five, ten, or twenty years down the road, DENR could be on
the hook.  Or, in other words, the state could be liable being it's the
co-applicant.  This is one issue that this corrects.  This is a
reasonable solution-oriented fix.  We actually instead require DENR to
assist in any way they can as long as certain conditions are met.  And
some of those conditions are acquiring the necessary property for
construction of a water reservoir or supply resource, implementation of
the appropriate conservation measures, developed measures to replace
leaking infrastructures, and contractual agreements has been reached to
pay for the expenses the law still included.  To my knowledge I know of
no opposition to this bill, and I'll be glad to answer any questions you
might have, and I would ask for your support.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate?
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the bill sponsor will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Jackson.  So, under current law,
there can be a co-applicant, and the DENR can be, but under this
revision, they can't be a co-applicant but they can endorse it, and by
endorsing it there's no risk of future liability?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I don't know that endorsing is the correct term
to use.  This bill ba-- your first part is correct, yes.  The second
part to your question, this would require DENR to assist them in getting
this federal permit, but it would not hold DENR culpable five to ten
years down the road because they would be out of it at that point in
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead, Senator, he yields, you have the floor,
Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President.  In terms of the provision
that gets struck, which is Section E where it gave them the authority to
be a co-applicant, it says that the department _may_ become a
co-applicant on lines 30 and 31 of page two, if the conditions are met,
and this language on the, that we're adding, saying that it providing
'full support and favorable endorsement'.  It says that they '_shall_
provide the full support and favorable endorsement.'  Wouldn't we want
to make that conditional that they _may_  provide it, just like it used
to be conditional, or at their option, when it came to being a
co-applicant?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, that's a good point, Senator Stein, but the ERC
Committee recommended that we leave the word 'shall' in there so that we
could instruct DENR to assist these small communities and municipalities
to make these changes or to get these federal permits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And did they s-- Follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.  Go ahead, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did they explain why they wanted it to be that DENR
had to do it without being able to exercise discretion, versus being
able to do it if they wanted?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I think with the history that some of us out from
the beltline here in Raliegh has seen with DENR, if we don't put, be
specific in our law, we don't get much help.  So 'shall' is certainly
better than 'may' in this particular instance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.

Route Restriction for NC 5-40 Loop [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin is recognized to explain the bill [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Guest Presenter of the Bill [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, What the house
bill does is earlier we passed legislation that took certain
environmental impact studies out of the loop, if you will, and in order
to get funding, and to complete the 540 project around Raleigh, these
studies must be completed. Now what this bill does is it allows those
studies to go ahead and be completed, so that 5-40 can move ahead. This
is a very important project for the state as a whole, and certainly a
very important project for Wake and the surrounding counties. That's all
this part of the bill does. This bill also removes from statute all
projects that have not been started in the Turnpike Authority. It fully
funds the Monroe Connector Bypass and it fully funds the work on the
5-40 loop. It takes these other projects and it puts them into the
regular state program. They will be data-driven, they will have the
local input as to whether or not they continue to move. But by doing
this it does a very important thing for the state. It's taking...It's
adding to the current fifty eight millions dollars we have currently in
the mobility fund, an additional sixty three million dollars per year,
which brings us to one hundred and twenty one million every year, from
now on, going to the mobility fund. That greatly accelerates those
projects that are data-driven, those that have come forward by the
prioritization schedule, and will move them up quite a bit as the DOT
and the department goes forward. I strongly suggest that we support this
bill. It is time sensitive to get the 5-40 project moving, and get this
stuff done again, and moving again, so that we can complete the project
and that we keep all of our federal funds and keep these projects intact
so, thank  you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator you have the floor to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senate colleagues, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on
this. I am opposed to this bill for the specific reason that when the
legislature put in the provision that required the state to be
prohibited from studying the red route. That was the only thing that's
protecting the southern part of my district in the town of Garner from
having a road that could potentially be built through sixteen
neighborhoods, two historically black churches, and basically decimate
the economic development of the town. And so, for that reason, I have to
oppose this bill. I do, however, appreciate the fact that in Sections 2
and in Sections 3 a right has been reserved for legislative oversight of
the process, which is greatly needed to restore the relationship between
the DOT and the Town of Garner. And, the DOT should act quickly in this
so that economic development in my district is no longer held up with
this hanging over it. I think that this is no fault of the legislature's
but it is the fault of both the federal government, the communications
between our departments that happened in the past and I remain opposed
to this bill but I hope that in the future the actions that we take will
not have effects like this on towns and communities and their ability to
create jobs. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, for what purpose do you arise. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]</p>

?? Interstate 540, make believe Interstate 540 since it’s going to be a
state 540 rather than an interstate. The road would never be built. We
simply can’t go through and eviscerate the town of Garner, but first
again, it would be too expensive. Secondly it would be too disruptive. I
plan to vote against this bill just to let the Federal Department of
Transportation know that it’s stupid to require us to study it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there and further discussion or debate? Senator Nesbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Would the gentleman yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Senator Rabin. I’m trying to digest the rest of this bill. As I
understand it, you’ve killed three projects. I would assume one of them
is in Gaston County, one of them is in Wilmington, the Skyway project,
and one of them is the bridge in former Senator ??, now Senator Cook’s
district.
Am I correct that those three projects are being scuttled in here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Two things. First, I’m sorry the bill gives you indigestion. Number two,
and to answer your question, no it does not. What it does is allows
these bills to be put into the TIP program and to compete with every
other project in the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would he yield to another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And prior to this bill coming along, they were in a category where they
were going to do a toll road. Is that the difference?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They can or they can’t. That would depend on how the fall in the TIP
programs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would he yield to another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, do you yield for a third question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll give you one more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
An there may be more. I’m trying to understand this because we really
didn’t explain this part. The Turnpike Authority. Does the Turnpike
Authority, is that the authority that builds toll roads?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Turnpike Authority, as you will recall, a couple of weeks ago we
removed and put back under the auspices of the Department of
Transportation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Senator Jenkins yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jenkins, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m trying to get educated about what we’re doing here. Were these three
projects originally put under the toll road bill? Is that what we did
with them? We’re going to build them as toll roads?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When the Turnpike Authority was organized and created there were
projects in here and yes, these three projects were three of the
original projects that went into Turnpike Authority.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And the Turnpike Authority designed toll roads?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Would he yield to another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jenkins, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Mobility Fund. Can you tell me where that money goes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I cannot. That was created after my involvement with the department.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Would Senator Rabin yield to that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you tell me what projects are included in the Mobility Fund?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. Every capital project in the state that is not in the Highway
Fund can qualify for the Mobility Fund, including certain other projects
like New Starts and other projects that are in the equity. What happens
is the Mobility Fund helps people with their equity so the locals can
decide what they want. It takes projects that are not in statute and
puts them on a level playing field and allows the data that drives the
individual projects to do its job.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would he yield to another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And who makes the decisions on which projects in the Mobility Fund get
funded?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The projects in the Mobility Fund come under the prioritization that we
passed in the last session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would he yield to another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What was that priority? I’m trying to determine what the Mobility Fund
is. That’s something new that we created last time, but, for the life of
me, I don’t know what roads are entered or how you get a road in it. Can
you share that with us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Mobility Fund, Senator, as you will recall I’m sure, is part of the
Highway Trust Fund. It is not brand new, it’s something that’s been
around.</p>

What are your hopes on that request?

Senator Raven do you yield?

What roads are in there or how do you get a road funded under the
mobility fund? Does it go through the TIP? Does it go to the board of
transportation? Does the governor decide? Who makes the decision and how
do you get something funded by it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
TIP projects I believe are Senator qualify. Basically, any shovel ready
project in the state can apply, and can be qualified.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, members of the Senate. I think the best thing to do is to
object to third reading and try to get some information on this. If
we’re appropriating 60 some million dollars here in March. You
understand we haven’t done the appropriations bill yet, but we’re moving
60 some million dollars from one fund into another as we go into the
future, annually. That money will go in there every year for a number of
years. I think we need to know where we’re moving the money to and who’s
getting it. I’d like to at the proper time object to a third reading and
try to get some information on exactly what we’re doing here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hunt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just going back to the original part about the red route. We are in the
unfortunate situation as been described that the federal government
requires this route to be studied. There’s no question that it aint
going to be built. Nobody wants to build it, but it’s got to be studied.
If we want this 540 route to be done in Wade County, then we need to go
ahead and study the red route. The mayor of Garner is a friend of mine
and he advises me that he is absolutely in favor of studying the route.
He absolutely doesn’t want to build it, but he wants to move this bill
forward. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill’s sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What? Yes, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, first of all thank you for funding the Monroe bypass. We’ve only
been waiting on it thirty years longer than Senator Nesbitt’s been down
here. I appreciate that. In no way will the funding of 540, which as I
understand it is the second built road around Raleigh. Will it impact
the completion of 485, that first built road around Charlotte? It won’t
impact that all will it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator you have the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the bill we have here. First of all, let’s start out with the
language dealing with the 540 issue. It did get amended in today’s
committee to deal with some of the financial issues. The thing that I
would point out is that the federal government absolutely will not under
national environmental policy act proceed with this project at all
unless the bill that was passed previously is rescinded. It must be
rescinded. It’s almost a perfect illustration of what we should stay
away from doing. When we start micromanaging and trying to dictate what
roads will or will not get built here in the general assembly. We should
leave that to DOT and the transportation planners. If we had not gotten
to this point, this bill would not be needed, but we need to rescind
what we did previously. I’m sure that when we did it, it was well
intended. We did not want to see those businesses out in Garner
adversely impacted. The motivation was 100% genuine. But, by doing it
the only thing we’ve done is slow down this process. I think what
Senator Hunt has indicated, Senator Raven have indicated is indeed the
way we should vote on this bill. It’s the right thing to do. More
importantly, we should take heed and not put ourselves in these type of
positions in the future.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate. Senator Rabin, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I’d like to speak on the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator you have the floor to speak on the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members. The debate that is going on here
today is one that we have had. We had it last year during the government
budget. Let me be clear on a couple of things that I failed to mention
the first time I talked. First, this passed unanimously in the committee
this morning. The members of that committee…

<p id="45:00">
see the need for this, and the need to move forward.  Secondly and to
clarify for all those present, this bill does not kill any project.  It
simply, to use a quote that I heard recently, brings the wrath into the
daylight, and it makes everyone compete on a level playing filed for
every project in the state.  It's that simple.  It doesn't point a
finger at anyone, it doesn't take anyone out of any plan.  It just makes
everything fair, and legal, and transparent for everyone and every
project in the state.  Any project that wants to stand on its own merit,
any project that the locals, who have a big input in the prioritization
system, want to move forward, they're perfectly able and capable of
moving those projects forward.  I would also like to mention that some
of these projects, and some of the divisions for which these projects
are, have a tremendous, tremendous amount of equity dollars, that they
can spend on any project in their area that they want to spend.  And so,
we're not cramping anyone's style.  We're simply giving everyone a fair
shake in allowing this process that we started 2 years ago to move
ahead, and to move ahead fairly.  And I again, would hope that the
Senator would not object to the 23rd reading.  This is very important to
move forward, for Wake County, and this area, and again, I would
appreciate your support.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Any further discussion or debate.  Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is the passage of Senate Committee Substitute
to House Bill 10, on its 2nd reading.  All in favor will vote aye,
opposed will vote no. 5 seconds will be allowed for the voting.  The
clerk will record the vote.  Cook, Cook, Cook?  Up or down?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Clark, no.  No, Cook changed his vote to no. 37 having
voted in the affirmative, and 13 in the negative, the Senate Committee
Substitute to House Bill 10 passes its 2nd reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Apodaca, for what purpose to you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Will Senator Rabon yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Rabon, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Rabon, am I incorrect in assuming by placing
these additional funds in the Mobility Fund, that any of us that have a
particular project in our area, that would be more funds available to do
our project.  Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Rabon do you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]So if I have Interstate 26 between Hendersonville and
Asheville, that feeds into the connector to go around Asheville, that
we've been denied for more years than I think I've been borne, that
would be funds available so we could move the connector up a little
quicker.  Is that not correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'm not familiar with that specific project, but I
would assume that all projects would be moved forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay.  To speak on the floor please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator, you have the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]In my opinion, a vote against this, you're setting back
any project in your area by some days, or even years, so I encourage
your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Without objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Objection.  Objection, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Nesbitt.  Senator Nesbitt objects to the 3rd
reading and Senate Committee Substitute to House Bill 10, will be placed
on the calendar.  Senators, upon the motion of Senator Michael Walters
of Robeson County, the Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the

[Speaker Change]
Thank you members of the Senate. I would like to take just a moment to
extend a special recognition to the North Carolina Chapter of the March
of Dimes in observance today of the seventh anniversary of the March of
Dimes. March of Dimes is a foundation that is a pioneer in premature
birth prevention, birth defect prevention, and the establishment of a
nationwide network in birth defect monitoring and programs. This June,
March of Dimes was instrumental in passing a federal funding, funding
for the federal national screening saves lives act. Which established
guideline for newborn screening. I say from a personal note, being the
father of twins, and having to spend several nights in a NICC unit in
Ashville. When you go into those environments, you can quickly see the
value of the March of Dimes and what it can provide and what it can
prevent. And with that being said Mr. President, I would like to send
forward a Senatorial statement of personal privilege.
[Speaker Change]
You can send forth your statement Senator.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Hise, what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President, I would like to ask that the statement of personal
privilege, request that it be read aloud following the General Session
and included in the journal.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Senator. Senator Walters, what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
Moment of personal privilege.
[Speaker Change]
Senator you have the floor for a point of personal privilege.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you body and thank you for allowing me to stand today. As you
heard earlier, the Mayor of Proctorville North Carolina is with us
today. It’s a small community of a hundred and seventeen. But a
community was founded in nineteen thirteen on March seventh. It was
formed, or started around the eighteen seventies, a rural community in
Southeastern Robeson County with a huge, agricultural background with a
lot of small business people come from there Senator Apodaca. But it’s
my pleasure to say on Saturday at eleven o’clock, that we’re going to
honor the hundredth anniversary of the town of Potterville. It was
formed around the railroad so it tells us how important infrastructure
is to the State of North Carolina as we move this State forward. And at
this time I’d like to thank Mayor Fowler for attending today. Thank you.
And I’d like to send forth the Senatorial statement.
[Speaker Change]
Senator, you can send forth your statement. Thank you. Are there anymore
notices or announcements? Senator brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
A moment of personal privilege.
[Speaker Change]
Senator you have the floor for a moment of personal privilege.
[Speaker Change]
Ladies and gentlemen, the Senate, last year you may recall that I tried
to tackle the issue of property insurance in the State of North Carolina
and the beach plan, so called beach plan and the issue that we’re trying
to deal with in the State. I got a Bill passed that I thought would
address this issue but I don’t know if you have seen, who you should of
gotten in the last few days the proposed rate increases for property
insurance in the State of North Carolina. And I just wanted to tell you
how broken this system is in my opinion and not sure how to fix it, but
just how much it needs to be fixed because of what’s going on. The new
proposals that came out with this, that were effective on July first
that the insurance commissioner sent out. I’m going to give you a
breakdown on what this means. The Coastal North Carolina, if you live in
Brunswick, Carter, New Hanover, Onslow, or Pender County, and you live
on the coast, your insurance is going to go from four thousand six
hundred and eight. Now this is on a three hundred thousand dollar home,
which is probably a moderate home in that region, your insurance will go
from four thousand six hundred and eighty four dollars a year to five
thousand six hundred and fifteen, or twelve dollars a year, a nineteen
percent increase. Alright, if you live in the rest of, say Onslow
County, your premium on a three hundred thousand dollar home, is going
to go from three thousand two hundred and thirty two dollars to three
thousand five hundred and eight dollars. Three hundred thousand dollar
home. Let me say this on the coast, right now you have rules as far as
building codes that you have to build a home, pretty much to within
stand about a hundred and forty mile per hour wind, which adds about a
five thousand dollar cost to a home. If you build one on the coast right
now. Plus if you buy a policy on the coast, most policies will have from
anywhere of a two to five present deductible on that policy. So if
you’ve got a three hundred thousand dollar home, you’ve got.</p>

306:
Speaker 1: Fifteen thousand dollars deductible of your five percent. So
you can lose every shingle on your house, and you have no coverage
basically. Or else you should live in Charlotte; if you live in
Charlotte you are paying on a $300,000/ home,  a $ 1058 dollars, you
will now go to $ 1148. So if you are in the Coast you are going to pay
over five times more and you are in Charlotte. If you live in Wake
County you are paying on analysis $1250 it will go to $ 1284s. So again
about $5000 more if you live on the Coast and if you live in Wake
County.  I’ve always known this is wrong, because everybody wants to
talk about all the rich homes on the Coast. I can say  we have a lot of
senior citizens who are on fixed incomes and live in the Coast xxx a
redeemable issue.  But if you live in Bladen?,  Columbus or Robeson?]
county probably you could say all four sections in the state your
insurance will go from $2108 to $ 2324, on a three hundred thousand
dollar home in those counties. I hope to just illustrate how bad a
problem we have is on xxx  insurance in the state. I can tell you right
now, that I have got senior citizens in my district; even today I don’t
know how many xx I’ve had about this rate increase. We have got a
serious problem .I don’t know the fix.   I wish I did. But as an issue I
think all I need to think about it and give a fixed loan because it’s
going to be an issue; you can’t live on the Coast any longer. If you are
a senior you definitely can’t live on the Coast because you can’t afford
to pay your insurance any longer. That’s how bad this problem is. I just
felt like I needed to bring it every one’s attention how bad this issue
is, and just how much we need a fix for this problem.
