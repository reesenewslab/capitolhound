[SPEAKER CHANGE] Let's pray. This is Psalm 46: God is our refuge and
strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear,
though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into
the midst of the sea. Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,
though the mountains shake with the swelling. There is a river, the
streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the
tabernacles of the most High. God is in the midst of her; she shall not
be moved: God shall help her. The heathen raged, the kingdoms were
moved: he uttered his voice and the earth melted. The LORD of hosts is
with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Thank you Lord for being
our refuge, here, in Christ' name we pray. Amen.

learned about her, I think you'll find interesting as well. In addition
to bein' an avid golfer, with a ... usually a 300 yard drive...in

Wounded Warrior Project. And I'm going to, as soon as Senator Pate
leaves Senator Raven alone, I'm going to toss it to Senator Rabin
because I think that he would like to add and make some comments. If I
could, Mr. President, I'd like to yield to Senator Rabin. Rebecca, thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Newton. The golf tournament that I
went to when I arrived that was organized, I found out, by a young
teenager. I was a little bit dismayed because as you can get, you want
everything to run real smooth. And I found out as we went through the
day that Rebecca was really in charge. She had organized this tournament
to collect funds for the Wounded Warrior fund. She greeted everybody
that got there. She got everybody kicked off at the shotgun start. She
came around with refreshments and at the end, she was gracious enough to
be the one to hand out the prizes.
All of that demonstrated a great organizational skill and great
leadership on her part. I'm proud to have met her, made her a friend and
made friends with her family. It's a great family. A great young lady
with great leadership skills and she deserves all of the honor and
credit we can give a young teenager. In fact, when I see this young lady
and all the pages that come by it sort of renews my faith that this
nation is going to stay great because we have great people like Becca
and these young people who work here. Thank you, very much.
[Applause]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a brief point of personal privilege. I'm not sure
if the school children are still here, but I ran into some children from
Wilmington from Eaton Elementary that were having a big day up here on
one of the last days of school. And I just wanted to recognize them if
they were in the room. If they're not, they're still out touring around
and we're happy to have them. I'm glad they stopped in. I got to get my
picture taken with them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Senator Hise, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forth a Senatorial Statement on the continuing
inclusion of wrestling as a core sport in the Olympics.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You can send forward your statement, Senator. I have a
number of microphones turned on here. Senator Pate, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a point of personal privilege, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You can have floor for a point of personal privilege,
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. These words were written by
my colleague, Senator Rabin, but you know, we don't allow freshman much
time in front of the microphone so he graciously passed that on to me. I
have vivid memories of D-Day, the sixth of June, 1944. The news washed
like a tsunami over or nation that we had finally invaded Hitler's
fortress Europa. Patriotism was at its peak, but as the newsreel
pictures of the Normandy beaches began to be shown in the theaters, we
realized the magnitude of the sacrifice that had been made in order to
restore freedom to the world. We have seen the invasions and battle
scenes in the Pacific theater and in North Africa and Italy, but we knew
that this invasion was the beginning of a new dawn of peace and freedom
in the world. We must not let time dim our memories. On days like this,
we should always remember that this great nation is founded on the
sacrifice and hard work of those that went before. We must be willing
and able to pick up the torch to keep our values and to keep our flag
flying on the highest of masts. The United States of America remains the
greatest force for peace and freedom the world has known and we must
remain strong to deter those who would again try to deny those
inalienable rights granted to us by God. I salute Colonel Rabin for
coming up with those remarks and certainly I salute all of the people
who were involved in D-Day that long time ago. Thank you, very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other notices or announcements?</p>

about the ways of the law and so I would encourage you to do two things

veteran in your neighbourhood or in your town or inter county. I make

world that Tom on nineteen eighty four doesn't seem like that long ago
in the output saw but time marches on and thought they could do those
two things is weekend. you'll love your continue to have a great
