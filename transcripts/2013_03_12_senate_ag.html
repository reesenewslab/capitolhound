Will call the agriculture meeting. I'd like to thank our pages that are
here today, Eliza Mills from Winston-Salem in the back, she's sponsored
by Senator Parmon, and Keyanna Brower from Rural Hall from, also
sponsored by Senator Parmon. I've got some friends from Rural Hall on
Keiger Street. Senate Sergeant at arms today are Charles Harper, Leslie
Wright and Ernie Cheryl. And the first bill that we will have, we do
have peanuts today in case you all missed them last week, but the first
bill we've got, we're going to move into the top of the agenda first.
The House Bill 33, Representative Whitmire is here, Cleveland, Polk and
Rutherford Trapping. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. You have
the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning everybody. Thank you for
hearing my bill. House Bill 33 is simply a local bill that attempts to
put Rutherford and Polk Counties on the same set of regulations for
trapping as the other 98 counties of the state. It also does impact
Cleveland County and in 1975 there was a law passed that severely
restricted peoples' personal property rights, being able to effectively
manage various wildlife species, particularly today the beaver
population is very abundant, much different than it was 38 years ago
when this law that I seek to appeal was passed and the coyote population
is running rampant and 38 years ago coyotes hadn't even entered the
state. So simply put at your desk there is a letter of support from the
wildlife commission. It sums it up very well and I ask that you support
House Bill 33 to repeal a restriction that restricts peoples' property
rights and in many ways impedes public safety and if there are any
questions I stand by to answer those. One final note, we do have subject
matter expertise from the Wildlife Commission should we need it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, what's your pleasure.
Senator Walkers, move for a favorable report. All those in favor.
Senator Cook seconds. All those in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All those opposed. Thank you. Next up we're going to
take 171 off the calendar today and move that to a future meeting. Up
next we have Senate Bill 38, Senator Jackson, Various Emergency
Management Changes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good
morning. This bill basically is a. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson,
hold on one second. We have a proposed committee substitute, Senator
Cook moves. All those in favor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those opposed, ayes have it. I'm sorry Senator Jackson, proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, I should have recognized that myself being I had
it drafted. This bill basically is a recommendation of the Joint
Legislative Emergency Management Oversight Committee that met during the
interim. The reason for the PCS is we added the react international into
this bill and this sort of, other than this react language, this bill is
identical to House Bill I believe it's 15, I believe is correct on there
that we've already heard or either is in committee 1, but basically what
this does, it will allow the division of marine fisheries and parks and
recs and the department of agriculture's forestry services to use
vehicles for exclusively law enforcement, fire fighting or other
response purposes they will be allowed lights and sirens and the lights
will be the use of red and blue lights for agency vehicles authorized in
this bill. It also allows them to exceed the posted speed limit but of
course with care. The motorists are required to yield right away just as
they would for an ambulance or a current highway patrolman or law
enforcement officer. I mentioned that the PCS is to authorize the use of
react and I'd like to read a statement from the new director of the
division of emergency management Michael Sprayberry has signed off on
the act and has said they will add value as another responder to enhance
public safety and react's general mission statement is we will provide
public service communications to individuals, organizations and
government agencies to save lives, prevent injuries,</p>

and give assistance wherever and whenever needed. We will strive to
establish a monitoring network of trained, volunteer, citizen based
communicators using any and all available means to deliver the message,
and, basically, there is react districts scattered throughout the state,
and, from my learning, they have become extremely helpful in the event
of when we have emergencies of a statewide effort, and I'll be glad to
entertain any questions, and I would appreciate a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move for a favorable report to the PCS and not to the other.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook moves to make a unfavorable to the original, favorable to
the PCS.  And a second?  Senator Randleman seconds.  All those in favor,
say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those opposed?  No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right.  Thank you, members of the committee. We are finished for
today.</p>
