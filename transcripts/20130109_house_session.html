From Wednesday, January 9th, 2013, the following is voterradio.com's
coverage of the daily session in the North Carolin House of
Representatives.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I ask all members and guests in the chamber to rise for
our opening prayer, which will be offered by our Lieutenant Governor Dan
Forest.  If you will, please remain standing for the presentation of the
colors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Please bow with me in prayer. Our gracious and merciful
heavenly father, we humble ourselves before you in this solemn occasion,
as we acknowledge you are the sovereign God of the universe.  We
acknowledged you ordained this motion before the face of the Earth, and
even before the beginning of time.  And we acknowledge Lord, that for
your purposes, you establish leaders, and you dispose leaders.  And
thank you God, for this day you created, and we ask that you lead,
guide, and direct the representatives that you have appointed for such a
time as this.  You tell us in Romans, Chapter 12, to offer our bodies as
living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, that this is our spiritual
act of worship, and we are not to conform to the patterns of this world,
but to be transformed by the renewing of our minds.  Lord, these men and
women whom you have called, have made great sacrifices to be in this
position of leadership, and we ask that you bless them with a great
wisdom as they perform their duties in the House.  As your word tells
us, if we lack wisdom, all we have to do is ask you, and you will give
us wisdom, generously, and without reproach.  We ask that you protect
these leaders from the failings and temptations of this world, and you
protect their families, especially during times when they are separated
from one another.  Lord, will you establish new relationships, build
friendships, and grant understanding that stretches beyond political
boundaries in the time frame of this session, and break down any walls
of political instability.  Now Lord, we pray that your hand in favor
will be upon this North Carolina House of Representatives during this
2013 session, and that the decisions they make, and the laws they
establish will honor you, and bless the people of this great state.  I
offer this prayer in the name of my Lord, savior and redeemer, Jesus
Christ.  Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The presentation of colors will be by the North
Carolina National Guard Color Guard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Please join me in the pledge of allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of
America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Please remain standing for the National Anthem that
will be sung by Miss Emma Thornes of Wake County
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light.  What so
proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming.  Whose broad stripes
and bright stars thru the perilous fight.  O'er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming?  And the rocket's red glare, the bombs
bursting in air.  Gave proof through the night that our flag was still
there.  Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave.  O'er the land
of the free and the home of the brave.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Please be seated.  The Secretary of State, being the
custodian of the North Carolina election returns, has deposited in the
principle clerk's office, for inclusion in the journal, a complete
certification</p>

Chamber when the question is put to the body. The floor is now open for
nominations. What purpose does the lady from Davy [??] rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady may proceed to the well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Fellow members of the house, distinguished guests,
ladies and gentleman, today I have the distinct honor of placing into
nomination for speaker of the house an individual who was born to be a
leader. Our next speaker's leadership skills have been recognized
throughout his entire adult life. In high school he was elected student
body president. In the business world he became a partner in one few the
worlds largest [AUDIO DROPS]. Microphone problems. In the business world
he became a partner in one of the worlds largest accounting and
management consulting firms in almost record time. In the world of
public service his leadership and consensus building skills have allowed
him to rise form serving on his local town council to serving as
minority whip [??], to now serving as a speaker of the North Carolina
House of Representatives.
Leadership is the ability to transform vision into reality. Over the
last two years our next speaker has done just that. he has set a bold
vision to move North Carolina form great to greatest. He has championed
bipartisan solutions to some of the toughest problems facing our state.
These successes including helping this house address a historic budget
deficit by prioritizing state spending on our most pressing needs while
at the same time protecting taxpayers. His leadership has also resulted
in common sense problems that will create jobs and put people back to
work. Our next speaker will continue to reach across the aisles to find
the best ideas from both parties that will help us solve the challenges
facing our great state.
He has the right leadership qualities at the right time in our state's
history to help North Carolina back on the right track. Ladies and
gentleman it is my honor and great privilege to place in nomination fro
speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, my friend, the
gentleman from Mecklenburg county the honorable Tom Tillis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Johnston,
Representative Daughtry rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I rise to move the second nomination for Tom Tillis.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is a high honor and a privilege to second the
nomination of Tom Tillis for speaker of the North Carolina House of
Representatives on this historic occasion. Tom Tillis is not a silver
spoon man.</p>

He arrived here on the wings of hard work and fair dealings. He knows
the struggle of everyday North Carolinians because he lived them in
full. He understand the cost of success and the value of family. He is
an honest and decent person with a forged vision and a determination to
make our state government work. He will keep us from getting side
tracked on matters that are not germane to our important work. He will
push us to do the people's business with a clear understanding that we
all, regardless of political party, love this state.
And we can, with good ideas, put our collective shoulders to the
grindstone of this state and work for the good of everyone: Rich and
poor; sick and well; young and old. For our wonderful state, these are
not altogether the best of times. It is easy to look around government
and find a plethora of difficult problems that involve almost every
facet of our deliberations and require our collective skills. Providence
has sent us a leader who can stand on the mountain and see what is best
for our state. That leader is Tom Tillis and I unequivocally second his
nomination as Speaker of the North Carolina House of
Representatives.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Are there further nominations? The gentleman from Cleveland County,
Representative Moore is recognized. We continue to have microphone
problems. You may come to the well.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
For a motion, Madame Clerk.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The gentleman has the floor.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
I move that the nominations for Speaker be closed and that
Representative Tom Tillis be elected by acclimation.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Moore has moved that the nominations be closed and that
Representative Tom Tillis be elected by acclimation. Is there objection?
Hearing none, the Chair declares the nominations are closed. As required
by the North Carolina Constitution, Article 6, Section 5, all elections
by the General Assembly shall be viva voce. All in favor of the election
of Representative
Tom Tillis as Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives

the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives 2013 Session.
The following members are appointed to escort the honorable Tom Tillis,
Speaker of the House, to the well of the House. Representative Arp,
Avila, Catlin, Hager, Hurley, McElraft, Samuelson and Starnes. If you
will please retire to the rear of the chamber.</p>

Congratulations, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  That’s for my dad.  Before I get started on my comments, I
wanted to tell you I as thinking as I as coming up with the Escort
Committee I was a freshmen in 2007 and we entered the freshmen class
with I believe 6 ladies and 5 men, no that’s not right now.  It was 4
ladies and 5 men. Well I’m the only man standing so I can only affirm
from that I was a faster member than the other  4 who are no longer in
the Chamber. But my friends a colleagues and freshmen mean a lot to me.
And Representative Avila and Representative McElrath, I know how to
properly pronounce your last names. Thank you Madam Principal Clerk, and
Governor McCrory, Lieutenant Governor Forest, Justices Martin, Edmunds,
Newby and Jacson.  State officials and other distinguished guests. Thank
you for honoring us with your presence today. Now Governor McCrory and
Lieutenant Governor Forest come to us today in their new capacities as
the top two constitutional officers in North Carolina. But these two
gentlemen have come to me many, many times before as personal friends.
And I want to welcome you to the House.  To the returning members of the
House, welcome back.  I look forward to continuing the work that we
started two years ago. To the freshmen class, 40 strong, fully one third
of our body. Thank you for your willingness to serve. And welcome to the
People’s House.  We are thrilled to have the experience that you all
represent.  Teachers, small business owners, business executives,
engineers, doctors, school board members, just to name a few of the
skills  that you have graced us with by being willing to serve and I
want you to know from the bottom of my heart that I appreciate it and
we’re going to work ya.  Now to the spouses of all members, I want to
thank you for sharing your loved ones..  With the people of North
Carolina, with their colleagues here and all the other people that they
serve back in their districts.  You too are public servants and your
sacrifice is to be commended and I appreciate it from the bottom of my
heart  I’m also blessed to be joined today by my greatest supporter. My
chief advisor and the love of my wife, Susan. Along with our daughter,
our son, my mama and many other family members. Welcome and I’m so
thankful.</p>

?? Two years ago I stood before you and accepted to the highest honor of
my professional and political career. I’m deeply moved and doubly
honored by unanimous support given to me today. To the minority leader,
Representative Hall and all the democratic caucus, thank you for your
statesmanship. I pledge to you and all members of the democratic caucus
that we will work together and in times when we disagree we will ensure
civil and respectful discourse. Now for the freshmen members,
particularly the members of the democratic caucus I have a special
message for you. I was sitting where you were just six years ago, a
freshman member in the minority caucus, the so called back-bencher. I
also got into office in what was considered one of the worst in the
legislative building, sorry about that Representative Jeter. But when I
received my office assignment and my seat assignment I have to tell you
I did utter two words, thank you. I tried to figure out how I could
focus on legislation how I could get the support of the leadership and I
worked within the political realities of the time and four years later I
was blessed to be elected speaker. Now I tell you this to to brag, I
tell you this to demonstrate that you have tremendous potential and??
Many opportunities to do great things and you have my personal
commitment to work with you on legislation consistent with our policy
direction because I owe it to you. I owe it to you because it was help
from the democratic majority members like representative Wilkins and
Representative Lucas, the true gentlemen of the chamber and former
Representative Grier Martin that helped me have an impact early in my
tenure. And I could go on with another long list. I see Representative
Luebke back there in the finance people and a number of other people who
treated me with respect and we owe it to you to do the same. Now their
approaches may vary. Our views are driven and their driven by different
ideologies. I firmly believe that we all have a common goal. We all want
to improve North Carolina and make our Great state even greater. In fact
I think we all want to make North Carolina the greatest state in the
union. Over the past two years we have made significant progress but
there is much more to do. We made hard choices in the face of economic
uncertainty and we've governed responsibly despite heated rhetoric and
political battles. And I have to say that the doomsday predictions of
those who opposed our decisions truly have not come to pass. North
Carolina is doing just fine. In fact, there are clear indications that
the state’s economy is beginning to move in the right direction, yet, we
have a lot more work to do. So how do we make North Carolina truly the
greatest state? I think we’ll do it by continuing to implement policies
that position us to deliver the best possible service to our
constituents in a professional business-like manner. You know, the best
businesses have the best products the best services, the best paid
employees and the best employee morale. And while the democratic
processes of the general assembly are not a business. Its messy, its
noisy, and a lot times inefficient there is the business of government
and there is substantial room for improvement in North Carolina and we
simply must commit to advancing an agenda that will transform our
business, our state with the goal of being the very best of everything
we do. We must be willing to make tough decisions and we have to
implement forward thinking policies that result in better education
outcomes, better health care outcomes, improved public safety, reduced
tax burdens, and responsible, I call it right sized, regulations. We
must continue our work on sound fiscal management by passing responsible
budgets that force us to live within our means and that minimize the tax
burdens on citizens and businesses. We must fully exploit North
Carolina’s position as the home to the best workforce in the nation.
North Carolina workers are experienced, diverse, and their dedicated.
They’re our greatest asset and their success</p>

as will secure our future prosperity. We must protect out workers and
their right to work, and we must send a very clear messages to
businesses already in North Carolina, and those considering expanding
here, and North Carolina will continue to be the least unionized state
in the United States. We also have to place a priority on securing our
leadership position in higher education, and we must step up our efforts
to improve traditional K-12 education. Education counts for over 60% of
our state budget, or just almost 60%, and therefore deserves a ??? of
our time, and our best efforts. North Carolina's higher education system
is truly a national standard, our community colleges and universities
are second to none, and they produce some of the brightest minds in the
nation, but we cannot rest on our laurels. Our community college and
university systems must preserve their leadership position in the
nation, and in fact we need to put more distance between North Carolina
and the rest of the pact. That's very important, but to me this is one
of the most important things. Many of you know this is my last term,
this is my last time to be elected speaker. There's a legacy we all have
an opportunity to leave behind, and that is meaningful change in K-12
education. And we're gonna do that, we have to redouble our focus on
traditional K-12 education. The problems with our K-12 system didn't
begin a year or so ago. The problems have existed for decades, and the
state and federal government have made it even more difficult for
educational professionals to pursue their passion. Have you ever seen a
teacher or principal that just wasn't thrilled about trying to teach a
kid? That's all they want to do. What we must do is open our minds, and
our eyes, and our ears, and we gotta each out to hardworking teachers
and principals and superintendents, and implement policies based on
their experience in the classrooms, practical experience, the enormous
training that they have. We can, and we must give teachers and
principals more flexibility to run their schools and their classrooms
and they see fit. We must continue a tradition started in 2011,
incidentally, to give local school districts budgeting certainty, by
passing our budget, before we expect them to pass their budget, which
depends on us. We must cost efficient innovation in our schools by
focusing on new technology, such as digital learning, and we must reward
school systems for becoming more efficient, allowing them to keep the
money that they save, and reinvest in into areas that they believe will
improve education outcomes. About a month ago, I had a discussion with
the superintendent, one of our largest schools systems in the state, and
he said that he and many of his colleagues were considering applying for
a charter school within their public school system. And when I asked him
why he would do that, he said that he thought that that added
flexibility would provide more opportunities for them to innovate, and
do some good things for those traditional K-12 kids. And I asked him,
rather than simply giving you one or two schools in your district that
you can have that flexibility, why don't we work on what we have to do
to give every school in your district that flexibility. Now, thousands
of children are receiving education that do not live up to our high
standards, not a single parent in this room can look at the education
outcomes today for every child in this state, and say that it truly
lives up to the standards that we know we're capable of achieving. So,
what he have to do is get rid of the list and list of regulations,
controls, and other impediments that just get in the way of teaching.
They get away from teaching, they get away from the student, and we must
find meaningful ways to deregulate K-12 public schools, to put the power
back into the schools, and back into the classroom. Now, we will
continue to advocate for charter schools, and parental involvement in
where their children go to school, but I firmly believe North Carolina
can build on many promising efforts already underway in traditional
public schools. There are many success stories that have received
national, and international attention, and I have visited many of these
schools to see it</p>

Mr. Speaker, honored guests, ladies and gentlemen, and members of the
House, it is my honor and distinct privilege to place a nomination the
name of Paul Stam of Wake County for the office of The Speaker Pro
Tempore of the North Carolina House.  Paul Stam has a long and
distinguished record of service.  He has served his country as a Marine.
 He has served his church as a Sunday school teacher.  He has served his
community and profession as a noted attorney.  He has served his party
as a local and state leader and Paul Stam has served this House as both
its Minority and Majority Leader.  Over the years, Paul Stam has been
one of the leading conservative republican activists in North Carolina.
He has worked tirelessly for the enactment of conservative principles
and drafting of our [??] platform in the election of Carolina state and
local officials and in his service as a caucus leader.  Paul Stam is a
legislator's legislator.  Long respected on both sides of the aisle for
his knowledge of the issues and the law, his ability to craft
legislation and his steadfast honesty and integrity.  Paul Stam is an
open book and his word is his bond.  He is a man of unshakeable
character.  After difficult legislative battles with rhetoric can often
become heated, Skip Stam is quick to offer a smile and a handshake to
his adversaries as he is his allies.  He serves as an example in our
democratic process that you can fight passionately for deeply held
beliefs and when the battle is over, win or lose, hold no grudges or
ill-will for his opponents in a campaign in court or in this chamber.
The best compliment and highest recommendation I can make on behalf of
Paul Stam is simply this.  He lives, works, and serves with the
Christian ideals he believes in.  Allow me just a moment to close with a
true story.  Jack Veach was a prominent businessman and community leader
in Western North Carolina, and also a national leader in the forest
products industry.  One year after helping a young man get elected to
Congress, Mr. Veach went to see the new Congressman Elect.  His advice
was brief and to the point. &quot;Son, when a person gets elected to
Congress and goes to Washington, they have two choices.  You can grow or
you can swell&quot;.  After a moment of silence Mr. Veach leaned forward
and said &quot;grow&quot;.  Jack Veach's words challenge us all, newly
elected members and veteran members alike.  Over the years, Paul Stam
has become a trusted and valued servant leader in this house.  He chose
to grow and this body has benefited from that choice.  I finally ask the
members of this house to choose him today as our Speaker Pro Tempore
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The lady from Carteret County Representative
McElraft is recognized to state her purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I pushed that button.  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I
rise to second the nomination of Representative Paul Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The lady is recognized for that purpose and may
approach the well of the house.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Ladies and gentlemen of the house.  It is my honor
to second the nomination of Representative Paul Stam as The Speaker Pro
Tempore.  Representative Stam has served seven terms in our house
serving as the house republican leader since 2007, and the House
Majority Leader since 2011.  He has been a strong and steadying force in
the legislature.  As a true statesman, Representative Stam is someone
who can respect opposing views without wavering from his consistently
conservative principles.  These are just a few of the reasons why I
encourage you, my colleagues, to join me</p>

Representative Samuelson, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To place the name of Denise Weeks before the House as our nominee for
Principle Clerk. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized and may
approach the will of the House. [PAUSE] [SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to say
nice things about her. I want her here. [PAUSE] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It
would be just like her, principle clerk, to be out working while we’re
trying to elect her. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, and all our friends and
family gathered with us this special day. It is my honor to place into
nomination Denise Weeks as our principle clerk. We often hear folks talk
about the ideal of servant leadership in our society. Yet we also often
hear those same folks lament that they believe they see so little of it.
Well, this chamber in this great state of North Carolina has been
blessed for the last 20 years with the servant leadership of Miss Weeks.
Her generous and faithful service to us has been and will continue to be
the model for how we should treat each other and the people we serve. In
a very tangible way, she has loved us. So if you chose the Christian
Bible today for your swearing in, you’ll see in I Corinthians 13 the
type of love I have in mind. It says love is patient. Love is kind. It
does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. It is not rude. It is
not self-seeking. It is not easily angered. It keeps no record of
wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices in the truth. It
always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Mr.
Speaker, I believe this describes Miss Weeks and qualifies her in every
way for another term as our House principle clerk. And members, I urge
your continued support and encourage you to emulate her leadership as we
work with one another. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To second the nomination of
the House principle clerk. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized
for that purpose and may approach the will of the House. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] [PAUSE] To all who are present. To all who would be here in
here, I want to tell you about our House principle clerk, and why she
should be elected to another term. You know, service spans generations
and from my 88 year old mother who’s in the gallery to my nephew who’s
on the floor, to all of you and your children and families who are
throughout this chamber, we have benefited from the service of Denise
Weeks. As I sat there and we by acclimation elected the speaker for
another term, it came to me that the person probably most qualified to
lead the House and who leads this House without that distinction, has
been Denise Weeks. The person who’s probably most responsible for
legislation is not any of you, whether you’re long-serving members or
freshmen. Or anyone you replaced. But the principle clerk who has guided
so many of you through both training and through the movement of your
bills. And so as we continue to look for our official leader, and our
unofficial leader who really makes things happen, regardless as to the
party in charge, we still look to Denise Weeks for her leadership. She’s
the referee on the field, she’s the guardian of the game that goes on
here sometimes, but she’s the one who has the credibility to keep us all
in bounds on every play. So again, I would second and commend to you
Denise Weeks as House principle clerk.</p>

Without objection, so ordered. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members
and guests, it’s my honor to extend the courtesies of the floor to Mrs.
Susan Tillis, Ryan Tillis, Lindsay Tillis, David Hixson, Margie Tillis,
Ron Tillis, Carrie Pullis, Ken Pullis, Jeanette Campbell, Richard
Campbell, and to other family, friends and guests of the Speaker of the
House. Welcome. [APPLAUSE] [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I assume you all know
the story, I named my gavel up here, is named after my father. And after
someone out of western North Carolina heard about that, I had a friend
of mine turning the wood out of heart pine. He heard the story and I’d
mentioned that I guess in some article that I’d like to have one named
after my mother. And sure enough, a couple months later, this beautiful
gavel turned out of dogwood, the state flower, came to my door. And I
named it Margie. And y’all may not have noticed it but my mother’s name
is Margie. You may have not have noticed it but I presided over the
short session with it. Now I thought I told my mom about that but one
day I just offhandedly said Margie was doing good in there and she said
what are you talking about? And I said Mom I’ve got a gavel named after
you. And I think Mom, that has finally secured me as your favorite son,
or favorite child. [LAUGHTER] But welcome. And ladies and gentlemen, we
also wanted to extend the courtesies of the gallery to every family
member and every friend who’s done everything to bring these wonderful
people to this chamber. We appreciate y’all. We’d like for you to stand
so that we can welcome you. [APPLAUSE] We’ll now move to the
announcement of caucus leadership. Representative Starnes is recognized.

?? Former Representative Bonner Stiller, former Representative Greg
Thompson. And also, to Commissioner Barry, who is seated up here with
Representative Howard. Welcome back, and thank you for all that you do,
Commissioner.
[applause]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, we also have former Representative
Russell Capps here with us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair was just about to ask, and as always,
Representative Blust is just a little bit ahead. I want to make sure, if
there are any other members who are here or joining us, please stand and
let us welcome you and Representative Capps. Great to see you back. Oh,
and Karen Ray. Please stand, let us welcome you.
[applause]
And, ladies and gentlemen, there's one other that I have to provide a
special acknowledgement for, there's a couple, before we close out. Two
years ago, when I was nominated Speaker and I had everybody asking me
what we were going to do on opening day. Oh, we got another one we got
to recognize, a good friend. But on opening day, I had people- Most
people that know me know that I'm not a whole lot about protocol and
pomp and circumstance, probably to a fault. But I had everybody asking
me all these things we needed to do on opening day. I said, &quot;Guys,
I don't know. Do we have somebody who really understands protocol and
the proper respect that we should be showing our elected officials and
others in the room?&quot; And everybody said, &quot;Yeah, Theresa
Esposito.&quot; She was the protocol officer in DOD, in fact, I
understand that she used to practice funerals before people were dead.
[laughter]
And, I'm serious. And so we ask her to do it, and it really was a
special day, as today, I think, has proven to be special as well. This
lady is just a lioness and a wonderful friend that I have come to know
over the past few years, and she served in this body, and I think she
probably counted everybody in this chamber her friends when she was
here. So, Theresa Esposito, from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank
you for making this day a truly memorable day. Please stand and let us
welcome you.
[applause]
And there are two other members. One is Senator Presnell, whose wife is
now in our chamber. Finally, the family got it right.
[laughter]
And also, a good friend who's moved on and a good friend of ours and was
just here in the last term, Representative Efton Sager, over by
Representative Ross. Please let us welcome you as well.
[applause]
I'm going to do this one more time, but I swear we're just going to
start having people call off, because how could I miss someone who's
coming back to work and help us out in a very important part of
government, I believe in the Treasurer's operations. This is
Representative Bill McGee, the man in the bow tie up top.
[applause]
Ratification of resolutions, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Enrolling court supports following resolutions duly
ratified, properly enrolled and presented to the office of Secretary of
State: Senate joint resolution 2, &quot;A Joint Resolution Adjourning
the 2013 Regular Session of the General Assembly to a Date Certain, as
Provided by Law.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, before we go to notices and
announcements, one thing I'd like to do- I think that most of you are in
your offices now, and I know there were a lot of movements going on. If
any of you need anything, please contact my office. I try to walk
around, and I saw a number of members in both caucuses and tried to get
my own punch list a couple of days ago. But if you're still waiting on a
computer or you haven't been informed when you're going to get it, I
understand that you'll all be receiving updated computers very soon.</p>
