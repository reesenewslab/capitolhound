Senate Bill 112 the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Committee Substitute #2 for Senate Bill 112: A bill to be entitled
an act to improve and streamline the regulatory process in order to
stimulate job creation, to eliminate unnecessary regulation, and to make
various other statutory changes. General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members before we get started the Chair understands that the members
that was intending to object the third reading is no longer intending to
do that. So, the only reason the schedule that I mentioned earlier today
will be in place so if there is objection to third reading before we
complete this bill it is the intent of the Chair to move this bill out
of the chamber before we leave this week. The house will come to order
Representative Moffett is recognized, Representative Moffett please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the house I understand I
mean I realized that we have been here for five and an hours I’m equally
as tired as you are. Senate Bill 112 is a consensus bill between the
house and the Senate. We have been developing this bill over quite
sometime I have spoken with Representative Floyd and have agreed to
minimize my remarks so we can expedite description of the bill. One
thing that you will find on your desk is something I have passed out
earlier regarding this bill and essentially what it does is it organizes
the presentation of the bill section-by-section in regards to the member
of this actually gonna present that section. At the end, we will be
considering amendments and also taking questions and if you could direct
your questions to the member of the section refers to. So, with that I
would like to go ahead and get started. As we travel to state all of us
hear that one of the things that is the greatest impediment to creating
jobs is burden some regulation so the short side of this bill is to
create jobs through regulatory reform. Section 1 simply deals with the
description of what a policy is and a little back story there and
discovering the history of regulating or creating laws in our state I
discovered that in large measure a lot of our agencies have either
exempted themselves all or in part of the administrator procedures act
and for those of you that are not familiar with the APA that is simply a
construct of this body that was created in the early 70s that basically
forced rule making to be done in the sunlight. So, therefore, do process
could be afforded to everyone the rule would affect and therefore, we
had our constituents were clear because we knew our agencies would be
making rules in the sunlight and all of those that wanna to be heard
could be heard. Well, since that time the number of our agencies through
outright direct legislation or sometimes a bud into budget have been
able to exempt themselves from actually creating rules in the sunlight
but that’s not good public policy and one of the first meetings I had
when I accepted the rule as Chairman of regulatory reforms is a little
opposition research and I met with a Representative Debra Ross and I was
shocked to find out that she and I agreed entirely in regards to this
particular part of rule making in our state. She and I agree that the
exemptions need to be peeled back that rule making needs to be done in
the sunlight but we also need to streamline the rule making process and
generally one of the things that we discovered is that a lot of our
agencies adopt the policies so they are not exempt to rule making what
they do is they adopt the policy that has the same form and effect as a
rule essentially putting your liberty or your property at risk if you do
not comply with the rule. So, the Section 1 simply explains what a
policy is and there is a brief description on Section 1, Section 5 which
is on page 6 the reg of Legislative Administrative Procedure Oversight
Committee to actually study the exemptions so instead of going in and
removing the exemptions ___[04:45] I thought it would be prudent if
during the interim between the long session and the short session that
we actually looked at the exemptions the agencies in to find out why
they have the exemption and be able to address these in an appropriate…

<p id="005:00">
?? Section 6, on page 6: ?? prohibits delayed enforcements of ordinances
by local governments.  And essentially it creates somewhat of a 10 year
statute of limitations. Essentially if you have a ?? established in your
community, and you have a nonconforming use, and they do not catch that
nonconforming use, or enforce that before 10 years expires, then they
cannot come in after 10 years and enforce that.
Section 8 on page 7: ?? the definition of the term private club
contained in the public health law, to include the definition of the
term contained in the ABC law. Members what you'll see, is that
regulatory reform takes shape in many ways.  It could be and outright
regulation or rule repeal, it could actually be a clarification of an
existing regulation, or it could be a simplification of what we
currently have on the books.  And as we go through this bill, I believe
we'll be touching on all 3 of those areas.
Section 9, on page 7: For those of you that were here last term, we had
quite a contentious debate regarding a selective vegetation removal
regarding outdoor advertising.  Section 9a, addresses a, there's a
conflict between the DOT, and the outdoor advertising industry in
regards to interpretation of that bill from last session.  This simply
clarifies the selective vegetation removal on on ramps and off ramps.
Section 9b, addresses the modernization of existing billboards. There's
nothing in this bill that actually allows the creation of any new
billboards.  This second section 9b, simply says that they can upgrade
the billboard from a multi pole billboard, to a monopole. And that's
simply what it does.  It allows them to maintain their current asset.
It allows them to ?? repair the asset, but it allows them to upgrade the
pole system from a multi pole to a monopole. There's no digital upgrade
allowed with this particular revision.
Section 10, on page 8: Simply deals with retention of medical records.
This was developed with industry, as well as Department of Health and
Human Services, and essentially what it says, is that once a provider
goes out of business they must retain the records for 3 years.  At that
point, those records are either destroyed, or they're turned over to the
Department of Health and Human Services for permanent storage.
Section 14, on page 12: Deals with Bed and Breakfast.  Most folks in
this body, probably do not realize that by statute a Bed and Breakfast
can only serve breakfast.  So this simply amends the statute and allows
a Bed and Breakfast to actually serve meals outside of breakfast to
their guests. This was actually brought to us by some Bed and
Breakfast's that actually live quite a few miles outside of the closest
area where other restaurants are.  They will not be competing against
restaurants, but this does allow them to serve more than breakfast to
their current guests.
Section 16, on page 15: Again is another common sense provision.</p>

a background check must also take place while the, for that same person.
So essentially what we're doing is we're allowing them at that point, if
there's a delay in getting the background check done, to go back to a
provisional employee status which is going to be highly regulated while
the background check is being done. We anticipate that there should be
very few of these provisional statuses applied but there is a quirk in
the laws that stands right now that if they, on their third year
anniversary, they do not have that criminal background check completed
they must be terminated. So this allows them to remain gainfully
employed during that process. Section 20 on page 19, I dub this as the
agricultural right to work section. Essentially it prohibits a contract
purchaser of agriculture products from forcing a farmer, someone that
they receive these products from, from having to unionize or hire union
labor for their, delivery of their product. Section 31 is a severability
clause and it simply says that if any part of this particular bill is
found unenforceable that it does not affect the other parts of the bill
and section 32 is the effective date which basically says it's effective
when the bill becomes law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If you'll follow along with me in your copy of
the bill on dashboard or if you've got it printed off. I'm going to
begin on section 3. Section 3 deals with, it amends the Administrative
Procedures Act provision with relation to fiscal notes. This amendment
would streamline the rule-making process by making the review of the
fiscal note and the public comment [??] run concurrently rather than
consecutively. This is an efficiency in the rule-making process. Section
4 deals, is the exact contents of House Bill 74 which has already passed
this chamber previously in this session. Section 7 deals with a
prohibition that a local or local zoning or unified development
ordinance from differentiating between fraternities and sororities that
are approved or recognized by a college or university. It prohibits a
designation so that if a fraternity or a sorority should lose their
designation by a university that they don't lose their house and the
zoning of that house. Section 7, that's 7A and B, 7C deals with the
allow that make sure that a student organization that goes before a
disciplinary proceeding at an institution can be represented by an
attorney or a representative. Section 11 on page 8 is a program
evaluation study on licensure. We're looking at potential, if there's
any ways to be more efficient in how we license certain professions and
to potentially do some consolidation in some licensing boards. Section
12 deals with the Industrial Commission. It amends the law governing the
Industrial Commission to exempt the administrator and the deputy
commissioners from the state personnel act. There will be some
amendments to some of these, this provision specifically. We're going to
limit it, I believe Representative Stam's working on an amendment to
limit this that this authority for the Chairman of the Commission is
limited to July 1st, 2014. And so that's going to be the limitation.
It's not a open ended deal. Just to let the new commissioner get in
there and make a fair evaluation on how the deputy commissioner's are
performing. Every other state employees who's salary is set by the
General Assembly is an at will employee so this, that just wanted to
make that as a clarification as well, just so you would know that.
Section 15 deals with professional employer organizations and just to
bring this all home, ADP is an example of a professional employer
organization. PEO's are companies that help small businesses by
providing outsourced human resources services and help small business
make sure they're cost effective and efficient on their payroll tax and
benefit services. This, the changes in this section of the bill, section
15 on page 13, it makes, we have consistent, across the</p>

<p id="015:00">
board bond, $100,000 bond. This is consistent with every other state
around us that regulates PEO's. It also replaces ambiguous financial
qualification standard with a clear requirement that the PEO's net worth
has to exceed its net liabilities in order to obtain a license. That's a
little more clearer standard. The bill also updates certain requirements
that must be included in a contract between a PEO and its client.
Additionally, current law permits the insurance commissioner to charge a
PEO for an inspection or a cost of an examination even if no violations
are found. This bill would limit that to recover the cost of an
examination if only violations are found and this is also consistent
with our neighboring states. Additionally, this bill removes a reporting
requirement that could force a PEO to pay a client's insurance cost if
that client, that small business client, chooses not to renew their
insurance. There's some ambiguity in the existing statute that could
result in that PEO being responsible for that small business insurance
lapse. So these changers will improve the licensing and oversight
process and make requirements less burdensome and costly for PEO's
operating in our state. Section 17 deals with regulating on-demand car
service reservations. In recent years, with the proliferation of smart
phones and innovative GPS devices and dispatch software, companies have
been, begun providing service that allow licensed professional drivers'
ability to receive and fulfill on-demand car service reservations. They
operate in 20 major cities. This regulation will bring these companies
to North Carolina very quickly and they want to do business in some of
our metropolitan areas. They would like to operate in North Carolina but
they need assurance there will be, there won't prohibitive regulations.
So this sets a protective hedge on how these companies can operate.
Section 18 deals with electronic notice and workers' compensation cases.
This is a consensus provision that was worked out between several
insurance companies, the Independent Insurance Agents of North Carolina
and the North Carolina Trial Attorneys Group, and so this just deals
with being able to have electronic notice and make sure that it's much
more efficient on how notification for workers' compensation can, this
is an opt-in provision for e-notice and it will help with cost savings
and how we do notifications and worker compensation cases. Section 19
deals with veteran hiring preferences. Any private employer that offers
the veterans, a veteran hiring preference, this will limit their
liability so they can't be sued for discrimination for hiring, having
that veterans hiring preference. So that's what this does and I think
Representative Moffitt has already addressed the severability, if any
portion of the legislation, in section 31, if any portion, then it can
be severed from the rest of the legislation and continue on. I believe
Representative Brawley would be available next to discuss section 13 on
page 9.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To explain the sections of the bill relating to local government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is section 13 beginning on page 9. The
first portion of this is section 13.A and B, Prohibit Transportation
Impact Mitigation Ordinances. This is the language from a bill that
passed earlier to prevent local governments from fining employers for
the carbon footprint of their employees. This does not impact ride share
programs sponsored by local governments to encourage carpooling. It
simply does not allow cities and counties to fine employers when their
employees refuse to do ride share or carpooling. Section 13 relates to
cities. It clarifies local government preemption and the change is
actually on page 10, section 5A. It relates rules that are, or powers
that are denied cities and that is the enaction of an ordinance that
regulates a field that is also regulated by a state or federal statute
and enforced by or a regulation promulgated by an environmental agency
and that is more stringent than state or federal statute or regulation.
The others are already exist in current law. This is similar to a
provision about criminal offenses. This is not, since this isn't a
criminal offense but an infraction, but it essentially says if the
federal government or the state already regulates an environmental that
the cities cannot exceed that. Now, there are several exceptions to that
pro</p>

Obition that among the the amorous serious and unforeseen treat there
are several thing of force majeure, if the general assembly or congress,
if the state budged or federal regulation court, order requires them to
enact a stronger regulation they are authorize. There are also two that
really make sense for the cities here in North Carolina. If there is a
unique geographic, meteorologic or environmental condition, and the city
complies with the requirement with Subsection D. And then number 7, and
this was particularly brought up by representative Hamilton, I believe.
Condition necessary to achieve a discounted flood insurance rate under
the national flood insurance program.
Now the Section D relates to the exceptions to the exception, it does
have to be related to something that's unique, it has to have three
quarters vote of the city counsel, and they also have to demonstrate for
the environmental agency, that there really is a environmental reason,
for the more  stringent regulation. Section 13.2 does the same thing for
counties that 13.1 with for cities. Section 13.3 is repeal a protests
petitions. This is a part of zoning that dates to the 1920s at that time
zoning laws where very slight and because of the wide latitude, within a
permission, neighbours where given the opportunity to create a need for
a super majority. That is less necessary now, because with the
granularity of our zoning ordinances, of the cities and so many other
things that we do. That regulation is probably not need, is frequently
use as a tool, to get lost of concession, run up the cost but I don't
know know that any longer contributes to the healthy and safety of the
people. Essentially what the protest petition does, it require  three
quarters  majority to rezone property. That is a higher bar than
overwriting a governors veto. That is a higher bar than amending the US
constitution, and a higher bar than suspending the rules here. So what
this would do would basically put zoning decisions back to a majority of
the local city counsel, and they can run on there record on that issue,
and at this point mister speaker I would like to yield to representative
Dixon to continue explanation.

people being hospitalize for carbon monoxide. So this is just going to
require for lodging establishments that carbon monoxide detector shall

Thank you mister speaker, for those of you who are diligently following
along, I'm on page 23, to be very brief this a section here section 27
and 28, deal specifically with a threshold farm issue. Specifically with
regard to confine cattle, to be very short, if you have confine cattle
over the head of a hundred, you are required to have a division over
quality permit. If something by chase happens, where you go under that
threshold, the current stature is hotel California, where once you get
in you can't get back out. This actually provides in the light in
regulatory reform, a responsible mechanism, for if you drop bellow a
hundred of ?? cattle, to be able to get back underneath the threshold
requirement for a division of water quality permit .

Water and irrigation sent back the use of reclaimed water for irrigation
is a good thing. I think this comes from the golf course situation and
those of us who play golf know there’s often water where we lose our
golf balls, near the green or someplace like that. So this allows the
sent-backs to be suspended in some cases but it does not eliminate the
exemption of any discharge of reclaimed water to the waters of the state
that exceed the permit conditions. The next section, section 20, is a
relook at the smoking ban rules that were passed by this Assembly in
2009. There have been some differences of interpretation of the enclosed
area. I know in Wilmington they determined that a particular restaurant
did not meet that requirement. Up here in the Raleigh Durham area that
same restaurant does meet that requirement so this refers the
requirement to the [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dixon, please state

gentleman is recognized to wake up, and debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Members of the House, this is very simple. It’s just an
additional definition relevant to agriculture. Some of our grain dealers
have facilities in multiple locations, multiple counties, and it just
expands the definition to include the warehouses, that’s not limited to
but you know, elevators, equipment, warehouses consisting of one or more
warehouse sections, and considered a single delivery point with the
capability to receive load-out, weigh, dry or store grain. Many of these
facilities have different locations and they just wanted to be sure that
those different locations were included in this definition. [SPEAKER

Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this is a simple provision that says

purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth and amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The
clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt moves to amend
the bill on page 2, line 43 by deleting the phrase [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, this amendment is a six page
amendment. It’s fairly comprehensive, which is one of the reasons why we
pushed the bill from earlier on the today’s calendar to right now. And
if you could just patiently work with me as I go through it. Lines 1 and
2, essentially it moves the 3 million dollar threshold for fiscal notes
from 3 million down to 1 million. It’s currently 500,000 so we’re
actually doubling the threshold right now but it does kind of get us
where we need to go. And that’s an agreement we made with the Senate.
Lines 5 and 6, essentially that just kind of shows that we have a new
section below regarding rules required by federal law. And if you’ll
look on lines 15 and 16, it says the commission, referring to the rules
review commission, shall not, shall have broad authority to modify the
schedule and extend the time for review in appropriate circumstances.
And if you look on lines 22 through 24, which is a new section D1, this
says rules adopted to conform to or implement federal law shall not
expire as provided by this section. The commission shall report annually
to the committee on any rules that do not expire pursuant to this
subsection. The next is a technical correction to statute. On the next
page we have clarifying language regarding local preemption 5A and 5B,
basically it is rewording to actually make those areas read more
clearly. We have a new section actually a new way to explain number 1
under C, lines 15</p>

Through 17, and basically as you can see it says a serious threat to the
public health, safety or welfare that is related to local conditions,
and not adequately addressed in state wide statutes and regulations
adopted or enforced by an environmental agency. So this is moving to
some of the concerns that we've heard in regards to our unique
circumstances that we have in each one of our towns or each one of our
counties or adjacent communities. So this does allow for that latitude
to where the folks locally can adopt ordinances that are pertinent to
where they are. On the next page, we [??], the same language appears
again on lines 15 through 17 under the county section.
On page four, we have some clarifying language regarding the protest
petition, and basically it says that if there's currently one underway
that even though this becomes law does not invalidate or affect a
current protest pending in occurrence to that effective date. On line,
excuse me, line ten, page 16 lines 19 through 22, removes a provision
from the bill that would essentially would have forced this bill to go
to finance. This is one regarding taxis and the new way of actually
securing taxis through Uber and a couple other things. So we've taken
out the ability for - or we're leaving in the ability for localities to
actually charge a tax for that.
Line 12 refers to page 17, lines five through eight, by deleting the
lines. Line 14 refers to page 21, line 31 by rewriting the line to read
that taxicabs, excuse me, causes of action arising on or after that date
and as strictly a workers compensation issue to that workers
compensation claims would not be affected by this bill coming into law.
The next part actually cleans up the carbon monoxide language so that it
is effective to existing establishments. And crafting the language
itself with the Restaurant Lodging Association we felt comfortable that
it would be applicable to existing establishments, but according to some
correspondence back and forth with the buildings code council they were
not so sure, so they ask us to actually make it apply by mandate and
that's what we're doing in this part of the bill.
And lastly, on the last page, line 12, we're actually inserting a new
section which is a study that we actually passed out of this body last
year, and we actually passed it out of the body this year. It's an
important study regarding sanitary districts water and sewer authorities
at all, and we think it's important that we actually get this study
underway. It's sitting over in the Senate so we've actually taken it out
of the bill, it's holed up over there and we're sticking it in this
bill. I urge adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McGrady please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to publicly thank the bill's sponsor for
working with me on portions of this amendment. Two of them I just want
to highlight. The local preemption provision which is I believe on page
one, line 22. Local ordinances sometimes need to address local
conditions that are not covered by state law. And I understand my
colleague Representative McElraft gave a good example in the regulatory
reform committee involving some barrier [??] towns in our district that
had terrible problems with storm water run off. However our state storm
water rules aren't written to protect - are written to protect water
quality and not deal with these other issues. And I put together some
language and am pleasantly surprised to see that they've largely kept it
word for word intact in this bill. Don't let that scare you folks.
And then the other issue that I was trying to just fix was the concern
reading automatic expiration of rules required by federal law. And again
I believe while the language is somewhat different than what Ive put
forward I believe it addresses the issue that I think really seriously
needed to be fixed, and that's at page two, line 15. And so two of my
major concerns were addressed by this amendment and I just wanted to
urge your adoption.

Yes, Mr. Speaker.

The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. For those of you who weren’t in ?? reform, we
did have a discussion about these regulations that may not address every
different area.  The overcoat is in my area.  The water tables at two,
three feet in some places so to have a rule there that also fits in the
mountains might not be pertinent so I thank Representative Moffatt for
helping with this and I urge the adoption.  Also, it still allows us
safeguards from having cities or counties from overstepping their bounds
and making some arbitrary decisions by putting some requirements on it.
I thank you for creating a balance amendment on that. I urge the
adoption.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I stand here about the amendments to Section 26, the carbon monoxide. As
many of you may know, we’ve had a tragedy in our district.  The three
most recent carbon monoxide deaths were in  Boone, ??? County and this
language is extremely important.  May state coders have worked with us
on this language and the amendment just makes sure that this addresses
current existing establishments so that these monitors can be put in in
the rooms where it’s appropriate. I urge for support on the amendment.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further debate? If not, the question before the House is the passage of
the amendment offered by Representative Moffatt to the House Committee
substitute number 2, for Senate Bill 112. All in favor, vote “Aye”.  All
opposed, vote “No”.  The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will ??
machine record the vote. 113 having voted for the affirmative, none in
the negative. The amendment passes.  Representative Samuelson, please
state your purpose.

The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know today, you all, I’ve been really busy handling controversial
Senate bills, but I sent them over this non-controversial bill that they
just couldn’t get around to acting on so we put it in here. This has to
do with a rebuttable presumption that taxi cab drivers are independent
contractors.  It is on page 21, section 23. It passed through the
judiciary committee with only one “No” vote.  I think it passed here
with only one “No” vote. It has to do with taxi cab drivers are
definitely independent contractors and yet, regularly, they end up in
court trying, having to prove that they are independent contractors for
the purposes of workman’s comp. And so this bill would simply create a
rebuttable presumption that they are independent contractors just to
hopefully cut down on the amount of times they have to go to court and
prove it and win. Thank you.

Representative Queen, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen, you’re getting a lot of members’ participation for
a single question. Representative Moffatt may yield for the gentleman’s
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The effective date is actually when this becomes
law and talking with the restaurant lodging industry, they wanted to go
ahead and move as expeditiously as possible.  The reason a building code
council asked us to go ahead and go with a mandate is because they would
not be able to address this with existing structures for quite some
time, but they would be for new structures moving forward.  So we’ve
actually moved unless we’re told differently here.  I am going to be
told differently? I yield to Representative Murray.

The gentleman is set to refresh a record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murray may now continue to respond to Representative

Representative Stam, please state your purpose [speaker changes]  To

Stam moves to end the bill on page 25 line 41 by rewriting that line to
read [speaker changes] The gentlemen is recognized to debate the
amendment.[speaker changes] 12B is somewhat of a controversial section
that perhaps is needed for a time but not needed permanently. You want
to have deputy commissioners who really are judges to have some job
security so that you'll get good people in there and number two they
wont worry so much about how they rule whether they can be fired the
next day so this amendment would allow the section that's there for a
year but then after a year it would revert back to current law.[speaker
changes] Mr. Speaker[speaker changes] Representative Glazier, please
state your purpose. Oh, I'm sorry representative Jackson I did not
recognize the gentlemen yielding. Please state your purpose[speaker
changes] I have a question for representative Stam [speaker changes]
Representative Stam, does the gentleman yield? [speaker changes]I do.
[speaker changes] The gentlemen yields.[speaker changes] Representative
Stam, so current deputies would lose their SPA protections is that
correct?[speaker changes] That's right.[speaker changes] And so why
would it be important for future deputies to SPA protections but not
important for the current, I believe your word was judges to have these
same SPA protections? [speaker changes] This is a compromise that I ran
by a bunch of people and I'm trying to minimize the downside and
maximize the upside. Representative Jackson, vote for it , please.
[speaker changes]Representative Glazier, please state your
purpose.[speaker changes]. I'm to speak on the amendment Mr.
Speaker[speaker changes]the gentlemen is recognized to debate the
amendment[speaker changes] thank you. Although I find myself agreeing
with both of the prior people, Representative Jackson I think has
highlighted exactly the issue as had Representative Paul much earlier
today. Represenative Stam , his amendment, I will be voting for because
I do think that its better then whats in the bill but lets understand
exactly what we're doing . The hearing officers are being made from
non-exempt to exempt and while Representative Murry  mentioned this that
many and most employees in this kind of capacity are exempt, hearing
officers and judges are different. There's a reason why they had been
non-exempt and it precisely what Representative Jackson said. It is to
provide them with independence and to insulate them from the political
pressures that exist on their decisions. I understand the new
commissioner is concerned that there may be deputy commissioners who may
not in his mind be doing their job and that is an issue but i am not
persuaded that allowing all of them to be fired at will is the answer.
Nonetheless, because Representative Stam's amendment brokers some
in-between ground i'm gonna vote for it but i will also  vote for any
amendment that seeks to eliminate the provision period for exactly the
reasons Representative Jackson said and to protect the independence of
the commissioners. I think there remains under current law a way to get
rid of those commissioners and I don't think  this is the way that we
want to do it .Thank you. [speaker changes] Representative Dollar,
please state your purpose[speaker changes] To speak on the amendment.
[speaker changes] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment
[speaker changes] Mr. Speaker, members of the house, I would urge you to
vote no on the amendment to vote red on this amendment and I will tell
you why. first of all my dear friend Representative Stam, he and I have
rarely taken opposite issuers in the last nine or so years I've been on
the floor of this house but today we are very much on opposite sides
what the gentlemen tries to do what he wants to do is he wants to
eliminate the section as Representative Glazier mentioned in his remarks
but he knows he cant do it.</p>

<p id="045:00">
So he knows he can't get the votes to eliminate this section, so what
he's trying to do is he's trying to come up with a limitation on it for
a year but that cure is worse that whichever side you would want to
take. The bottom line is this, and I have been a personnel director in
state government, I've been in exempt and non-exempt jobs myself, I've
dealt with this area in state government for a number of years, and I
had a wife who was a Deputy Commissioner in one of these positions for
thirteen years so I know about this. It's the positions are either
exempt or not exempt. You don't say, well, this position is going to be
exempt for a short period of time and then we're going to make it
non-exempt. And not only is that illogical, completely illogical based
on what we are doing in state government, it is also really not good for
those employees. Because those employees will come up and say 'well, gee
for a year I've got to be concerned what my situation is.' It's not
really fair.In my view I like the provision as it is in the bill. These
positions used to be exempt, they do set policy every day by the
decisions that they make and they impose civil penalties for employees.
And when someone says that judges, and these folks do have the power of
a Superior Court judge within their narrow section of the law,  are not
subject to politics, that's not true because - with one exception: every
other judge District Judge, Superior Court Judges, Court of Appeals,
Supreme Court, they're all elected. They're all turn limiting. They all
have a certain period of time they serve, and if they want to serve
further they've got to get elected, and in a few minor cases,
reappointed. So that really doesn't wash. But no matter what side of the
issue you're on, whether you like the bill as it is or whether you think
they ought to stay in a non-exempt status, this amendment is the
absolute worst of both worlds and I would urge your defeat.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Beeker, respectfully disagree with my colleague, Representative
Dollar. The amendment put forward by Representative Stam, is an
improvement over the bill as it's presently worded. It is a fact that
Deputy Commissioners go out into the state and they conduct what are
judicial functions. Employees that are injured on the job are guaranteed
that if they can establish that they have a work related injury they are
entitled to receive some benefits. It's the function of the Deputy
Commissioner to hear the evidence, take testimony, make rulings on the
evidence, make findings of facts in conclusion of law and decide who's
right and who's wrong in those disputes. And because that is guaranteed
to an employee, the employee is denied the right to sue his employer in
a regular court. Where, if you otherwise get injured by someone, you can
sure them for negligently injuring you. A simple example of that is an
automobile accident. You sue someone for negligence, you go to court,
you can have a jury trial, but in worker's comp a decision was made many
years ago to do a trade-off. We will deny employees certain types of
benefits that they might get in a normal negligence case, but in
exchange we won't require them to prove negligence. We just say prove
that you were injured on the job. That's what these Deputy Commissioners
do. They need not to be pressured by people above them to make certain
decisions that don't necessarily relate to the facts that are before
them in a hearing. And that's why they need this protection.I agree with
Representative Glazier the correct way to do this is to leave them with
protection from political influence from above. They should be making
decisions on the facts. There is</p>

an appeal from that to the regular court system, ultimately. If somebody
thinks they’re on either their interpretation of the law or their
understanding of the facts. Representative Stam’s amendment at least
destroys the protection and the independence that these judge like
deputy commissioners have for only a year, and then it restores it. We
ought not to take away their independence at all because of the function
that they perform for our employers and employees. But if we’re going to
do it, let’s only make the mistake for a year rather permanently.

Thank you Mr. Speaker.  To speak on the amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is an interesting amendment, here. What
we’re advocating, what Representative Stam, and Representative Black
were advocating is if we’ve got a guy that we think will do a good job,
but we’re not going to let him do his job. Only for a year. Go out there
and do your job, but you can only do it for a year. We don’t want you to
go out there and work with any other personnel director like
Representative Dollar is talking about in any other industry that we
deal with to do their job. What you’re saying here, if you pass this
amendment is, you can do your job, but only for a year. After that,
we’re not going to allow you to do your job so why have that position if
your not going to allow them to do their job. I don’t know of any other
industry we tell somebody that. We give them what we give them. A
direction to go to, but oh yeah, you can’t do anything with these
people. What I’d ask you guys to do is if that’s what you want, if
that’s what you want, a chairman or commissioner to do, then vote for
this amendment. If you want them to do their job, then don’t vote for
the amendment, vote for the bill.

This is amendment ARI-83. Representative Duane Hall moves to amend the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, I think the last debate pretty well explained what this section
of the bill does. One more time, what it does is it makes members of the
industrial commission, as everyone has explained, essentially judges.
Makes them exempt from the state personnel act. Mean that these
commissioners can be fired at will. As most of these members are aware,
most were here before this last session and this session. When we passed
general statute 126, we gave the governor originally an extra 500
positions that were exempt. Earlier in this session, when the new
members, I think we added another thousand that were exempt. But this
body also carved out some positions that we felt should remain exempt.
Chiefly among those in the statute were hearing offices who conduct
hearings, take evidence, enter a decision based on findings of fact,
conclusions of law based on statute legal precedence shall be designated
as exempt. Members, we made that exception because we didn’t want our
judges to be subject to political pressure. What I’m urging the members
to do, when they vote for this amendment, is to be consistent with our
previous decision and let our judges make rulings without fear of
political pressures. I urge you to vote for this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry, please state your purpose.

and so I would just ask that you oppose this amendment.  This is at the
request of the chairman of the Industrial Commission.  That's why this
section is in here. We need to let him do his job, and make a fair
assessment of the folks that are working over there at the Industrial
Commission, to make sure that they're operating in the most efficient
way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]And I will vote for the amendment, but Representative
Murphy and Dollar, you all got to get your story straight.  Which is
worse, Representative Dollar said my amendment was the worst.  He said
that Representative Halls amendment would be much better.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]First to see if Representative Murry might yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Murry, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you Representative.  I
think everyone kind of understands the gist of it, but what I want to
get at is a question relating to section 1265 of the Personnel Act.
And, the reason I want to ask is, the last line, 16 and 17, that the
area that Representative Halls tried to eliminate, the sentence says,
'Deputies appointed pursuant to this sub-section, shall not be
considered hearing officers within the meaning of the personnel system.'
 And in doing that, the reason I understand the language is there, and
I'm going to get, Mr. Speaker, my question in a minute because this is
predicate, the reason I understand that language is there is because
section 1265D7 says that, 'except as otherwise specifically provided by
this section, no employee by whatever title, who's primary duties
include the power to conduct hearings, take evidence, enter decision,
shall be designated as exempt.'  So in order for this to pass muster,
you have to eliminate that section, and the way that it appears it's
being done, is by simply saying that despite the fact that these people
have always been called hearing officers now, they're not.  My question
is, in doing that, where you're saying the deputies are no longer
considered hearing officers, what other affect does that have on what
their job is, and what their ability is, and have you explored in that
regard, any consequences beyond simply the personnel consequence of what
you're saying by no longer calling them hearing officers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, we just heard arguments, Representative Glazier,
that they were judges,  And so, the duties that they enact on a daily
basis are still the same.  But what it does, is subject the
commissioners to at-will employment, similar to judges.  And so, our
hearing officers that work for OAH,  are separate and district in how
they do their job compared to the Industrial Commissioners.  Clear
statutory guidance on what commissioners can do, evidence and all that.
It's statutory law.  It's not like the rules of procedure like when we
go down to the courthouse, it's very prescribed, and narrowly.  That's
why you have Worker's Compensation board certified attorneys, because
it's, you give up your rights as an injured worker to go under the
Worker's Compensation system.  And similarly, these hearing officers, I
don't think they're hearing officers either, they're more like superior
court judges, as been discussed.  And so they wouldn't fall under this
definition to be subject to at-will employment, similar to the at-will
employment that our judges have every election cycle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you Representative.  And I
understand the argument you just made, and my question, and it's not a
set-up question, I'm really asking this because I want to make sure.
Even though we disagree, I think, on the amendment, I'm concerned that
there's more repercussion.  So my question is, has the question been
asked, and has it been explored with staff, whether there are any other
consequences to no longer calling these folks hearing officers, beyond
simply the personnel issue we're discussing.  That's my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The duties of a hearing officer are not defined in the
State Personnel Act.  They're defined in Chapter 96, or 97, for these
commissioners, so that's the duties.  This deletes the reference in the
State Personnel Act, because the definition of a hearing officer isn't
in the State Personnel Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Last question
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]And the last question, and I think I understand your
answer.  So, we can't be assured, that by no longer referring to these
folks, the commissioners, as hearing officers, it is strictly.</p>

going to be a personnel issue. And their duties, their functions, their
responsibilities, their abilities are not changed, even though we are
now doing this. That is, Hearing Officer has a definition as relates to
their job, Hearing Officer apparently has another definition as it
relates to their exempt status. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is--I believe that is correct. I think we're actually communicating
now. I think that's exactly where we are, the duties, responsibilities
of these deputy commissioners are set out clearly in statute, and this
provision is not intended to affect that at all. That would take an
amendment to the--I would think the Workers' Compensation statutes in
order to change the duties and responsibilities of these deputy
commissioners.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A question of Representative Murray.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murray, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Murray. Actually it's probably a series of
questions, but you said the Chair in the Industrial Commission ?? of
this right. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Was the subject of this provision in any other bill prior to this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And when was this provision first put in this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When we--we heard it in Regulatory Reform yesterday at 10 a.m. That
was--that's when we discussed it. It was presented to the Regulatory
Reform Committee and the Commerce Committee yesterday, twice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman--follow up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman compared deputy commissioners to Superior Court judges as
being--or Superior Court judges being similar to an at-will employee. Is
that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say the election cycle is about as at-will as it gets in an
employer/employee relationship. Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And the gentleman would agree with me that Superior Court judges or any
other type of judge that actually has a specific term, and if he decides
against Party A on Tuesday, he can't be fired on Wednesday. Would you
agree with me on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And folks that are deputy commissioners have had essentially no term
limits, since in many cases they've been on the bench longer than some
Superior Court judges. And so their terms have been longer than Superior
Court judges, and so we're just giving an ability for someone to have an
oversight, and the Chairman of the Industrial Commission is probably the
most appropriate person to have that oversight for these deputy
commissioners.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Was any debate in yesterday in Commerce or Reg Reform given to the fact
that maybe we should do terms so that one specific decision couldn't be
the source of being fired the next day?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We did not discuss term limits or any set terms for deputy
commissioners.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, could I speak on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I speak on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Thank you, Representative Murray, for yielding to all those
questions. It's somewhat sometimes difficult sometimes to make these
points in question format. But I would ask the members to vote for this
amendment. This is a good amendment. And what we're doing is by passage
of 12B is going to create an instance where if the Industrial
Commissioner does not agree with an individual decision a deputy
commissioner made, they'd be subject to being fired immediately. So
every decision is going to be political in nature, because if they, if
there's a big company that supports, I don't know, who supported the
governor in the last election, and they have a case before, and the
deputy commissioner rules against that company, then boom. The
Commissioner could fire that deputy commissioner in the next day. I know
of no other judge that that happens to in this state. Yes, Superior
Court judges, District Court judges, Court of Appeals judges, Supreme
Court judges--they do have at-will employment in that they have to run
for the next election. But it's a term, it's a term that's four years,
eight years, and it gives them the ability to go to the voters and
explain their reason for their decisions or reason why they did what
they did. And then people make educated decisions. This will allow one
person, who's an appointed position--Industrial Commissioner--to just
unilaterally, without, with no protections, just fire someone. And this
would allow that not only for this year, because Representative Stam's
amendment failed, but going forward, so these people will not have--this

Representative Carney moves to amend the bill on page seven line 43,
through page eight  line 20 by deleting the lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
the lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the house. As those of
you that where where in the last session recall, we had quite a
controversy over bill boards. There was some dependencies, about at the
eleventh hour at the end of session. The house passed one version of
local control. It when over to the senate they change it, it came back.
We thought that we had continue to protect local control over billboard
ordnances. An then in fact when it when over to the DOT and the rule
making process. We where wrong. I'm just asking you in this last minute
hour to take this section out. I think the locals, I know our governor
at the time was still in Charlotte, and he was opposed to all of that,
and I know allot of you got a lot of grief over it. I sure did. And so
I'm just asking if we would take this part out today. there are some
good things in this bill. I just don't think that we need going down
this road in this session dealing, jet again, with giving more leeway to
the industry. They got quite a bit last time. I think is time to just
sit back, let it ride. And I ask for your support of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moffitt please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognize to debate the amendment .
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you that you
oppose this amendment for two reasons.  The language in this bill is
strictly clarifying, language in response to the senate bill 182, that
passed this body last year. The first section simply resolves and issue
between the out door  advertising industry and DOT. In regards to
selective vegetation cuts along on raps and off ramps. That's it.
The second part simply codified  into law. North Carolina supreme curt
case in 2007, witch was Lamar VS Stanley county. That basically says
that out door advertising signs, even if non conforming to local
regulation, can continue and be maintain in accordance whit DOT
regulations and not local regulations. so what we are basically saying
is that the out door advertising industry is being limited by local
ordinances to maintain their properties, maintain there assets, maintain
their lively hood, by simply taking a multi poll sight. Not increasing
the size of the sight but simply replacing the signs multi poll
configuration with a mono poll. We are not looking at increasing  number
of out door advertising sign in our state. we are simply looking at
clarifying what local ordinances can do regarding out door advertising,
when it come to DOT regulations. And we are also clarifying a miss
interpretation of the law, between DOT and the out door  advertising
industry. So I would urge you to vote NO against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.

The gentleman is recognize to debate the amendment .
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had several members ask me, whether this amendment relates to a
massage I send  all y'all just little wile ago, it does not. One of my
amendment that will be coming out soon addresses that issue. And I
believe will be supported by the sponsors. You can say that we are sort
of and inadvertent issue. The amendment put forth by representative
Carney,  basically would strike the billboard provision in this bill and
you say what are those billboard provisions. For those who were here two
years ago. This billboards position are to some extent all the things
that they had to give up as part of the compromise, such as it was, two
years ago.
If you remember I put forth amendment, those of you were here. That
strip out a bunch of the billboards stuff last time it went to
conference comity. The billboard industry got 90, 92% and this is to
come back and get another 8 to 15%. That's what this bill ting does, I
wouldn't for all the respect for</p>

<p id="075:00">
They'll sponsor and appreciate his work with me on a range of different
things. This is just the billboard industry wanting more. And the key
part of this is the second part 9B. That's what I would call preserve
billboards forever. Because 9B relates to both conforming billboards and
non-conforming billboards and non-conforming billboards under 9B are
going to be able to continue to be able to be put up in whatever way and
expanded in as necessary to how billboards have changed over the years.
That's really the heart of this thing. I will add just for your
information, Representative Carney's amendment strikes the revision,
which would be fine by me. I do have an amendment that is more directed
at a handful of things, as opposed to the whole provision. I certainly
respect Representative Carney for what she's put forward here and I'll
probably vote for it as all of you would expect. [Speaker
Changes]Representative Cunningham, please state your purpose. [Speaker
Changes] I need to change my vote Mr. Speaker on the previous motion to
no. [Speaker Changes] Let it be recorded as having voted no. [Speaker
Changes] Thank you. [Speaker Changes] Representative Ramsey, please
state your purpose. [Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker, I would like to
request to be able to change my vote on Representative Powell's first
amendment SV1-12-A3 from yes to no. [Speaker Changes] Let it be recorded

Changes]I'd like to speak a second time on the amendment. [Speaker
Changes] The gentleman is to debate the bill a second time. [Speaker
Changes]Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, currently in
statute, general statute 136-131.1 basically says the following,
&quot;No municipality, county, local or regional zoning authority or
other political subdivision shall without the payment of just
compensation accordance with provisions applicable to the Department of
Transportation as provided in the preceding paragraphs of the above
section 2,3, and 4 of general statute 136-131 remove or caused to be
removed any outdoor advertising adjacent to a highway on the national
system, interstate defense highways or a highway on the federal primary
highway system for which there is in effect a valid permit issued by the
Department of Transportation pursuant to the provisions of Article
11&quot; and there's some additional language there.  Essentially what
that means is currently in statute is that a properly permitted
billboard that is permitted by DoT is a permanent billboard. The
clarifying language offered in Section 9 of this bill does not mean that
billboards can be permanent. What it means is that they are currently
permanent as per statute, but this allows them to maintain their asset
and keep their asset in proper shape. You can argue that that proper
condition or proper shape can be aesthetically pleasing, for safety
reasons, for any number of reasons. There is, and I can tell you,
someone in the mountains who appreciates a quality view ?? more than I
do. So when I was faced with looking at this particular set of issues
regarding this industry, everyone in this chamber should know, it
started off as two and a half pages. We walked it back to where you have
what you have before you now, which I consider very appropriate,
clarifying language to add to statute to preserve the jobs that are
currently enjoyed by the outdoor advertising industry, that does not
allow for expansion of the outdoor advertising industry by increasing
the number of signs.  It does not allow them to digitalize their signs.
It does not allow them to increase the square footage of their sign. So
again, I would ask you to look at this as a property rights issue. We
should be protecting the property rights of the citizens of our states,
the employers of our states. Again I urge you to vote against the
amendment. [Speaker Changes] The question before the House is the
amendment sent forth by Representative Carney for the House Committee
Substitute of Senate Bill 112.  All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote

There were a number of people that were pointing out that we may have

is another billboard amendment, but hopefully not as controversial.
There are a lot of towns, including the town of Apex that had not had
billboards for a long time, and this amendment just makes clearer that
the local preemption does not preempt an ordinance enacted by a city
prior to July 1, or city or county, of this year prohibits placement of
new billboards within the jurisdiction of city. In other words, if your
city or county has prohibited billboards already, they stay prohibited.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this is the
section that deals with the protest petitions. I was glad that
Representative Brawley gave a little bit of a background description of
the process because it didn't get any discussion in yesterday's
committee meeting. This is a provision, as he's pointed out, it's been
in the state law for about 80 years. I think if we were actually going
to deal with this issue we ought to be doing it in a different form than
as a provision in an Omnibus Regulatory Reform Bill but that's the fact
that it's in this bill so I am asking that we repeal that provision that
repeals the protest petition opportunity for the citizens of North
Carolina. Some of you may remember that bill in 2009 that restored the
protest petition rights to the citizens of Greensboro. They had been
exempted from that law since 1970. This was something the citizens have
used to negotiate with potential developments near, in their
neighborhood, and it gives them a little bit of leverage. I, it's been
important because these zoning boards and these boards of adjustments
are often full of representatives that the real estate industry,
developers, and builders so this just helps even the playing field. When
the zoning board makes the decision that the neighborhood disagrees with
the neighborhood has an opportunity to gather the signatures, submit a
petition to the city, and the city will have to have a super majority to
over, to approve, to overturn a zoning decision. So I think this is a
really, been a very important tool for neighborhoods. This is something
that is super important for my citizens back home in Guilford County. I
urge you to support this amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bill Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to speak in opposition to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In, I don't have experience with Representative
Harrison's district. I do have experience in my own where someone will
file a zoning petition, will go through several iterations with staff to
get to the point where they then have to hold community workshops,
notice, bring in people from the community, take comments, and as a rule
of thumb no straight re-zonings are acceptable. It has to be conditional
district. There will be a series of iterations of that plan before it
goes to the planning and zoning board. There will be a joint public
hearing with the city council and the planning and zoning board. It will
go back to the zoning board for a vote. It will come back to the city
council. This is not a trivial process, currently, and there is ample
opportunity for citizen input unlike the days when this was created. It
made sense in the 20's because of the way zoning was then. It doesn't
make sense now. I would just ask you, how many bills have we passed
today that received over 90 votes? If we had protest petitions on this
floor a protest petition could require us to receive 90 votes in the
affirmative before passing any bill. Would that make sense? Thank you.

Representative Faircloth, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have to agree with my colleague across the aisle there. This is a
problem that is faced by, once in a while, not that often, but when you
have a situation in where only 5% of property owners can file a protest
and then it takes 75% to override that protest then you've got maybe one
property owner controlling a large piece of property. This amendment
needs to be defeated. I ask you to.

I served seven years on the City Council in Huntersville and I actually
think this is an effective tool. We used it quite effectively in
Huntersville in a situation where we had five people under the, if
someone filed a protest it required four of the five votes instead of
three of the five votes. It was not an onerous obstacle to overcome
because in zoning issues, typically, they were in 5-0 anyway unless they
were controversial. It was effectively</p>

<p id="090:00">
used in Huntersville. It was effectively done and I think it's a tool
that protects, I look at it from a private property standpoint. We talk
about a one owner who owns five percent of the property, well you're
changing the zoning of the piece of property they bought next to. You're
changing the use. In essence, that property owner should have a right to
have a say in that and by filing a protest petition and the way it's
worked I don't find it onerous. It never exacerbated or lengthened the
process in Huntersville. It was an effective tool. It very rarely worked
but when it did it proved that it was a good program and I would ask for
you all to support this amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Over the last 25 years I've had a little more experience with this issue
than I would have liked. If you want a device that will allow a vocal
minority to override majority rule than you'll like this amendment.
Protest petitions are in the way. We can have extensive planning, we can
go through long processes at the local government level, the
professional planners, the politicans decide on land use for an area,
you can come in and want to comply with that land use, meet every
requirement of the staff and, whether they are extortions or soft
sticks, meet with all the requirements of the politicians and still a
single land owner can stop a project. And they can stop it not just by
moving votes, a protest petition requires a 75% vote of the members of
that board whether they are there or not. So members of the council can
actually kill a project just by being absent on the night of the vote.

I would have to stand with my colleagues Bill, Representative Brawley

and actually Representative Faircloth was a little bit wrong. He said 5%
of the property owners, it's actually if you own 5% of the border of the
property that's being rezoned, 5%. You can now, with this current
protest petition, thank you, turn your vote at the city council from a
majority to, not a super majority, to an ultra majority. If you got five
members on your city council it's going require four of them. If you got
nine it's going to require seven. We've all heard how the
ultra-conservatives are taking over. This is an ultra majority vote
that's required by this. We need to defeat this amendment and take care
of this, removing this, repealing this, end this bill. Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is an amendment that seeks to amend the
provisions that Representative Carney sought to strike and for the most
part the, there's the four parts to the amendment. The first and the
last one you can fairly well look at and figure out what they do. The
one in the middle, basically, just re</p>

<p id="095:00">
Leaves two words, regulate or, which is on, well I don't have the line
sixteen of the bill under that section. And then perhaps the most
important part of this is the third and it is where you add the word
conforming after the word any. You have two types of billboards. You've
got conforming billboards, billboards that are completely in conformance
with whatever the zoning and everything is in place and you got
nonconforming billboards. And nonconforming billboards are certainly
fine over time, things change. But the nonconforming billboards, they
are typically your problems, the old billboards, and by not allowing a
modernization of the nonconforming billboards you are not preserving
billboards forever. And my colleague Mister Wells, Representative Wells
and I had a long discussion on this, I hope he'll jump into the debate
because I think a real estate guy is probably better able to explain why
it is we seem to be treating billboards different than we would treat
buildings in a time when you're having to replace them. I would urge

I thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house a mere few
moments ago my colleague Representative McGrady talked about the outdoor
advertising coming back, getting a second bite at the Apple for things
they did not get in a consensus agreement last session.  This amendment
essentially goes the exact opposite direction. What I have brought
forward to you today is simply clarifying language to settle differences
of opinion between the DOT and the outdoor advertising industry
regarding on ramps and off ramps. The second part simply codifies the
statute, a North Carolina Supreme Court decision. In regards to this
amendment, it essentially eviscerates that, goes back to Senate Bill one
eighty three, goes back in the statute, and essentially hurts the
industry and harms it moreso than current statutes actually do in
regards to limiting what it can or cannot do. So Mr. Speaker if I could

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, my amendment does one thing, it  eliminates section thirteen of
this bill. And the reason is, it takes away a lot of local control from
our cities. Throughout North Carolina's history our cities always had
the ability to work with employers to share cost.  I represent the town
of Kerry.  Kerry is opposed to this bill.  One example is we have a new
huge company comes in and infrastructure needs requires a new lane for
traffic.  Possibly a new offramp.  The way our laws are now corporations
can work with the city and share the cost of all these new needs, but
the way this bill is written it's going to say that cities cannot have
any ordinances that allow them to do that.</p>

Metlife, Metlife just relocated to Cary. That's one example. We've done
it this way in North Carolina forever. We've had no trouble attracting
companies to cities like that. If we don't eliminate this section every
city in every one of your districts is going to lose their ability to
work with employers. So I urge you to vote for this amendment.

Representative Moffitt, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

I move that the amendment offered by Representative Hall be lie upon the

The motion, having been made by Representative Moffitt, seconded by
Representative Burr, is to lie upon the table the amendment sent forth
by Representative Duane Hall for the House Committee Substitute No. 2
for Senate Bill 112. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Briefly. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the House.
I do appreciate the fact that Representative Moffitt and Murry have
worked very hard to put changes in this bill that fix some of the
problems associated with the original language but I am troubled by the
provisions of House Bill 74 that require the automatic review and
expiration of our rules and it seems like it would be particularly
problematic with our environmental rules and our rules to protect the
public health of the citizens of North Carolina. I'm concerned about the
vegetation provisions. I'm concerned about the fact that we are
repealing the protest petition that has provided such a good tool for
citizens of North Carolina. I'm concerned about the local ordinance
problem. The city of Greenville has been dealing with flooding and
erosion due to storm water and they've got to enact ordinances that are
stronger than what's in state law but they're not going to be able to
now. There are lots of provisions in this bill that are problematic.
I'm, urge you to vote no. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute No. 2 for Senate Bill 112 on its, as amended, on its second

Point of privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I really regret, but rather than have us come back
tomorrow, 15 minutes after the session adjourns today, tonight, 15
minutes after we adjourn, the Government Committee will need to meet for
a short session in Room 544. And again, we have about 7 bills to go
through really quickly, and I’d appreciate it everybody attending.
Although, Mr. Speaker, I’d like to say in regards to my colleague,
Representative Ford's birthday. I’m really surprised he’s 56. I thought
he was much older than me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative West, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Report of personal privilege, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The House will come to order. The gentleman is
recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to remind
everyone that didn’t hear that former senator, Zeb Alley, passed away
today. He was a friend to many of us here in the House. He was a dear
friend of mine. I don’t think there was a day went by that he wasn’t in
my office. Zeb, a funny story, Zeb only lobbied me one time in my whole
career here, and he came in and I told him I couldn’t help him. So Zeb
said, “Let’s talk about the mountains.” I just wanted you all to know
that Zeb had passed away.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As previously noticed the House Commerce Committee
will meet minutes after session. We have two bill, Senate Bill 73 and
Senate Bill 614. Room 643, Room 643, I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] See if Representative Moore would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative.
Representative, I know we’re getting ready to end the session, and my
question is whether there is going to be any re-referral of bills that
we need to know about or prepare for, for next week because session’s
obviously coming to a close? It would be nice to know before we leave
and adjourn if there are any substantive bills that are being moved and
wonder if you would do that on the record please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They probably will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, what the Chair would require
is that any re-referral of bills that would be done before, if we
adjourn subject to, that they be issued by email no later than 7:30 this
evening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate that notice and
would just note would like the opportunity if there are any to state any
objections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s okay. The Chair wasn't sure if he had it
immediately before we would have had to stood at ease, but it sounds
like he does now. So the gentleman will report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There’s several that I know of right now. There may be
a couple more after session, but I think the gentleman’s question is
anything really substantive. I don’t know if these are deemed
substantive. I’ll tell you what we have: House Bill, excuse me, Senate
Bill 321. This is the bill concerning the cap to reimbursement of
counties. Bill was sent to judiciary. Judiciary is now shut down. Move
that bill go to rules. That’s my motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 236, an act to authorize counties to
assume responsibility for construction improvement, ownership and
acquisition of public school property. Move that bill be removed from
the committee on government and referred to the committee on rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection having been raised. The gentleman wish to
take a vote?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would, and I’d like to explain what the purpose in
the motion is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may his motion. The gentleman has made
his motion. The gentleman may explain the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks. Mr. Speaker, members of the House, it is
customary at this part of the year, in fact, when I was in the minority,
I don’t think we ever objected to the former rule’s chairman leaving
these bills. This bill has been requested to go to the committee on
rules. Don’t know if we’ll take it up or not, but the government
committee is shut down now. And the bill could potentially be used for
something else, may not be used at all, but it is standard practice to
take these bills. Committees are shut down and send them to Rules
Committee. There’ll be 3 committees operating next week: Rules,
Appropriations, and Finance. So, you know, I personally have no dog in
the fight on this bill. I don’t care what happens to it, but it needs to
go to the Rules Committee. So, Mr. Speaker, I move the bill be referred.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman’s recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>

and generally Rep. Moore, I wouldn't disagree with you and certainly if
the bill is not going anywhere I would fully agree. But because this
bill contains controversial provisions that I think were defeated
earlier in a House committee, and my concern is that they will rise from
the grave in rules in a different form. I think this creates a different
problem If there is insurance that those provisions earlier defeated
would not come back, I think that's a different story. And if you can
give that assurance I certainly would agree. But right now, that is my
concern and I think the concern of a number of people on both sides of
the aisle. And so unless that concern is met, I would be voting against
the re-referral. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to speak on the motion again a second time. Again, I'd remind the
gentleman that when his party was in control, this was the kind of
motion that when we were in the minority we'd never object to something
like this. I've spoken with Rep. Stone who chairs the government
committee. And it's the opinion of the government committee that it
needs to go on to rules. And they're not planning on taking it up. If
the gentleman wants to vote against the bill,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not going to yield. If the gentleman wants to vote against the bill,
that's his prerogative. But this is simply moving a bill, and the fact
that someone's objecting to such a procedural thing  is- I haven't seen
it in my ten years here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the House.
I would urge you to vote against the motion to re-refer, and many of you
who are on government committee know why. The government committee voted
today not to give this bill a favorable report. There was a motion to
give this bill a favorable report.  This is a bill that would give
control of school construction to county commissions, ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke, please remain focused primarily on the motion before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, and I am doing so sir.
The motion will revive this bill. The bill is now sitting in government
committee with an unfavorable report. If the motion is approved then the
bill is revivable in the rules committee. And members for that reason I
would like us to respect the committee process for all of us, Republican
to Democrat alike, respect the committee process and vote no on this
motion. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If all members would yield for a moment, Rep. Luebke I do believe you
misspoke, I do not believe the bill received an unfavorable report, I
think that it failed to receive a favorable report. And so for the
freshman,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I meant to say that the bill did not receive a favorable
report and I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the information of the freshmen who may not understand what's going
on here, there was a vote apparently in committee today for a bill, and
it failed to receive  a favorable report. Unless there'd been another
motion that acutally moved for it to have  an unfavorable report. Which
is to say a majority of the members present and a member was so inclined
to issue an unfavorable report, then it would have gotten an unfavorable
disposition in that committee.
That's not what has occurred. What's occurred is they simply failed to
get the favorable report, so on any given day if the government
committee were meeting again, then that bill could be brought up again.
And so the motion by Rep. Moore is to move this bill to rules. I'm not
encouraging you to vote one way or  the other on the re-referral, I'm
just trying to explain to those who are new to the process the matter
that's before you.
Rep. Stone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, I did want to acknowledge that he misspoke on the
fact of it was not an unfavorable, but more importantly, it was a voice
vote. It was taken today in the government committee when decision was
called, it was a final vote at that point. So it was somewhat
controversial in the way it ended, I think this is a good move to Senate
on rules, and let Rep. Moore move forward with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Carney, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the rules chair a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you remind the body and myself please about if a protest petition,
if a bill passes- gets an unfavorable in committee and it's dead, and ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Carney, again, I must explain again. I think the confusion is
coming from a comment, it may have been a misstatement on Rep. Luebke's
part. This bill did not receive an unfavorable report. It failed to
receive a favorable report, which simply means it's lying in the
committee. There was no motion for an unfavorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Continue the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yep.

Representatitve: …committee and does it… a protest petition, someone
voting in the prevailing side, file my petition, is that correct?
Representative: A minority report can be filed if a bill gets an
unfavorable report, that is when you can file a minority report.
SpeakeR: Representative Carney you may be confusing that with a
discharge petition, which would be, in the case of the freshman, which
would be by house rule and the ability for any member to have a bill
removed from a committee if they are able to get at least 61 members to
sign the discharge petition to get it removed. That is not relevant to
this particular matter. Representative Floyd, please state your purpose.
Representative: To speak on the bill.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to speak on the motion.
Representative: Mr. Speaker, I think that in government this morning, I
think, in fact, our chair, because the vote was taken and he gave it
back to the body. So there was no confusion: he pronounced the vote back
to the body that the motion was deleted. I respect him for that and he
adjourned the meeting. So it’s not that it was taken illegal or done
illegal, or done improper: the vote was taken.
Speaker: Representative Holly, please state your purpose.
Representative: I have a question Mr. Speaker.
Speaker: The lady may state her question.
Representative: If we are still having a government committee this
evening after this session, can it not come back there? Let’s fix this,
I mean, it is close to where we are meeting in a few minutes.
Speaker: Representative Holly, whether or not that particular bill would
be on the…well there are a number of things, for example, where the
government committee meets this evening is at the discretion of the
government committee chair. The government committee chair could put it
on the calendar. To my knowledge it is not on the calendar at this
point. At the same time, the chair could also report it out of that
committee. I do not believe they intend to have that happen. To try and
have that happen, the lady should get with the chair and determine what
their will is. Representative Quain, please state your purpose.
Representative: I would like to be recorded as voting aye on senate bill
112.
Speaker: The gentleman is voting aye on senate bill 112. Representative
Glacier, please state your purpose.
Representative: To speak to the motion a second time.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion a second time.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. I want to follow Representative
Holly’s point because I think that it is the avenue out, but in a
slightly different way. If the bill, as I understand it, is still
retained in the government committee, it hasn’t been transferred to
rules yet, so it seems to me the government committee still has
jurisdiction. They are meeting right after session. So it would seem to
me that if in fact the government committee feels that it is appropriate
to transfer to rules rather than even  reconsidering the bill, they
simply have to agree to a motion to transfer it to rules. If the
government committee doesn’t then it seems to me that is a sense of the
committee that needs to be honored. So it seems to me that the meeting
that follows is exactly the way to handle this and resolve the
controversy. Again, I would move to not object to Representative Moore’s
moves, particularly in light of the fact that there is an easy way out
by decision of the committee in a few minutes. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Speaker: Representative Glacier, again, I would refer to the government
chair. The chair understands that apparently there was a discussion
between the chair and the rules to make this motion to begin with.
Representative Ford, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the motion.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
Representative: I am on the government committee and today there was a
voice vote. It was very close and the vision was called, and the vision
was not given. There was confusion at the end of the vote, so I would
like to refer it to rules.
Speaker: Representative Pimpin, please state your purpose.
Representative: To inquire to the chair.
Speaker: The gentleman may state his inquiry.
Representative: I am  not saying that this is going to happen, but if we
go back to government tonight, if a member who was on the prevailing
side of the vote this morning, were to ask for reconsideration, would
that put it back with government or are we just going to be done if we
vote on this motion here?
Speaker: The house bill it is. Representative Pimpin, unfortunately,
because it is a voice vote, there is no recorded record of who was on
which side; therefore, for that reason, we believe the motion to
reconsider would not be in order. Representative Wilkins</p>

&quot;Thank you mister speaker, members I would just ask you to vote no
on this motion, the last fifteen minutes have given you a good idea, if
this bill comes back to the floor next week what it's going to be like.
We've got the budget, we've got tax reform. We don't need to get on this
bill, this bill will take a great amount of time with both the rules
committee, and on the house floor. I'd ask you to go ahead and vote no
on this motion, lets go ahead and dispose of this bill today.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Representative Dixon please state your purpose&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Inquire the chair &quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;The gentleman may state the inquiry&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES}
&quot;Mister chair, I'm opposed to the county commissioners having this
authority so which way do I vote on this motion?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Again this will be another education moment,  if the intent would
be to try and prevent consideration of this bill most likely for the
rest of this session, then the motion you would vote, against this
motion. Which would essentially require to continue to lie on this
committee, which will after this meeting, will no longer continue to
meet for this rest of the meeting. The chair does not necessarily mean
that that would prevent some other action through some other course, but
for all intents and purposes that would probably hault this as a
vehicle. So voting no would effectively be a no vote for the bill
itself. This may be the most interesting discourse I've had in the last
three years I've been speaker. Representative Lewis please state your
purpose.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Debate the motion.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Thank you mister speaker, I know that it is 6:40 at night, I rise
on a procedural point that I think this is a very important vote that we
are about to take. I understand that there is some controversy with the
bill. I just want the members to understand that if it is the rule's
chair's intent, for a senate bill to emerge from the rules committee
with the content of that bill in it, there are other bills sitting in
rules. So I say that to say, yes indeed you can vote no as a protest
vote against this motion to move this bill, but please don't think that
that solves the concern you're trying to solve. I would ask you to vote
with the rules chairman, and because the result; and I hear loud and
clear the concern with the bill, but the result that you're trying to
get won't be achieved by a no vote on this motion, mister speaker&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Representative Robert Brawley please state your purpose&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Could I ask Representative Lewis a question?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Representative Lewis does this gentleman yield?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;I do.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Gentleman yields.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Representative Lewis if this bill goes down in defeat on this
motion, don't you think this will tell the rules chairman how tough it
is to get another bill out with that subject in it?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Well Representative Brawley, I would say the past 20 minutes of
the wasted part of my life has indicated to everyone in this chamber
that theres concern with the content of this bill, I was just trying to
say that with a matter of respect, and out of protocol, and out of
precedence, I don't see a problem with a re referral of this bill.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Ladies and gentleman just to further clarify what representative
Lewis is saying, I think and something that representative Moore had
said earlier, I do not know the intent of the bill. I know that theres
some concerns with it and the chair shares some of those concerns. But
the fact of the matter is that there are a number of bills lying in
rules that could be used as a vehicle for this same purpose. The
tradition as ..&quot;

it’s been stated by Representative Moore in the past is that moving a
bill between committees, particularly to rules, has been on that I think
is generally been honored at least in the five years that I’ve been
here. Representative Holley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have another question, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady may state her inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In committee this morning, by division, Wake County was taken out of the
bill, so which bill are we talking about? The original bill or the one
at the end?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holley, I think, to technically clarify what you’re
saying. Not by division but by amendment, Wake County was taken out of
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And as a result, the bill that currently lies in committee is a bill
that does not have Wake County in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the motion. Representative Duane
Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize, Mr. Speaker, but if I could ask a question of the chairman
of that committee please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Warren or Representative Stone?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Either.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The presiding chairman was Representative Warren. Does the gentleman
yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Anything to perpetuate this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry, Representative Warren. There seems to be a bit of a debate
over the last question whether Wake County will be in this new version
that completely decides my vote on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am not an authority on it, but my thought is that because the bill did
not receive a favorable report that the amendment would not be enrolled
into that bill and we would be looking at the original bill as submitted
bill this morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, I was about to make the clarification. Because it
failed to get a favorable report, apparently the amendment reversed, the
chair stands corrected. So, Representative Holley, the bill is in its
original form which would include Wake County.
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I’m sitting here trying to figure if you have had the bill
in committee and one of the first…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The House will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
...one of the first votes you took on, it took out a portion of the
bill, and then the bill went for a vote, the vote was taken on the bill
without what was taken out, wouldn’t it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, Representative Michaux. The motion, I believe, that would have been
put in the committee was a favorable report for the bill as amended in
the committee and I believe the effect of the amendment was to take Wake
County out, however, having failed, then the bill that lies in the
committee is the bill before it was amended according to the clerk.
Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion, very briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a procedural vote.  A procedural vote. The Senate Bill was
sponsored by one of the full chairs of the Senate appropriations
committee. Let’s extend a very basic and fundamental courtesy that’s
been extended in this House and the Senate for decades and vote in favor
of this very simply, vote green on this very simple procedural motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady may debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m a freshman, I don’t know what happened in years past. Most of us are
freshman. But at some point we have to say a vote is a vote. We worked
very hard in that committee and it was a decisive vote.  At some point
we have to accept that without games being played, because that’s what
is happening. Political games are being played and I say vote against
this, whatever we’re voting against. Whatever this is called. Motion,
referendum, rules, re-referral. Vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holley, it’s actually a motion to re-referral.
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I don’t mean to break any protocol that might
have existed in the past…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wish to debate the motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I’d like to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess I was breaking protocol just then. I don’t want to break any
protocol or respect for anyone that was held in the past and certainly
the number of times we’ve laid things upon the table and called to
question certainly...</p>

must be set in some record, so I guess we're about set in protocol, or
setting  records, or breaking protocol, so I don't know that that would
be a reason for us not to follow it.  I believe Rule 18 says we can have
a motion to reconsider, and the restriction would be in the case of a
recorded vote that the person on the prevailant side would have to make
the request.  so, if the bill is still in the committee, hadn't been
reported out, I guess it's still with the committee, I guess that's a
question, or.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Hall, the challenge is, because it was
not a recorded vote, it was a voice vote.  There is no record of someone
who voted on the prevailing side, so you that can make that motion
reconsider in the opinion of the clerk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, Mr. Speaker, I was just reading what the
regulation says, and it appears to say, when a question has been
decided, it is in order for any member to move for reconsideration, or
on the same, or succeeded legislative date, provided that if the vote by
which it was originally decided was taken by recorded vote, then only a
member on the prevailing side.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]And I think the point there that your making, is that
it says recorded, and this vote was not recorded in terms of the members
voting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, Mr. Speaker, but  I think what it says is in the
case of a vote that was recorded, then only a member who was on the
prevailing side, based on the recorded vote, could make the motion.
But, prior to that, it just says a member can make it.  I presume we
would be on our honor system, not to make the motion unless you were one
of the people who voted on the prevailing side.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Hall, the clerk who on 2nd inspection
says you are right, and that is within the rules.  When I consulted
earlier, I think that it was in the mist of other discussions.  The
clerk has said that her position is that you are correct in you
interpretation of the rule.  The Chair stands corrected.  Therefore, for
the freshmen members and the members of the Government Committee, that
does mean, that since this matter came up today, if you go to the
Government Committee, and someone who voted on the prevailing side, then
that person may make a motion to reconsider the vote.  Just so you that
know the procedural options that are available to the committee.
Another option would be for the committee to report it without prejudice
to any other committee within the body, and that could even be to rules.
 The Chair would encourage the Chair of the Government Committee to
bring his rules book with him, but either of those 2 motions would be in
order at the time that you meet in the Government Committee.  But for
now, it may be rendered moot, because before us, we have a motion to
re-refer, and based on the outcome of this, it may no longer be in that
committee when you meet. Representative Floyd, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, an inquiry to Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, we try to make all of our committee
meetings, and I'm a strong believer that if an action, and I'm just
asking for clarity, if a vote is taken in committee, amendment was added
to that, the bill was defeated in the committee, and so I'm
understanding now that that bill is alive in the committee, with
everything that it had in the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Floyd, your point is well taken because
the process is somewhat complicated, but in fact the bill was not
defeated in committee.  For a bill to be technically defeated, or
literally defeated in committee it would be because the committee voted
for an unfavorable report.  In this case, it was an understanding of the
Chair that there was a motion for a favorable report had simply failed,
which means that bill still lies as a valid bill to be taken up at a
later time if the Chair so chooses, and at that time someone could make
a motion for an unfavorable report, and if that motion prevails, then
the bill would be dead in committee.  If someone makes a motion for
favorable report, or a motion to re-refer without prejudice, then the
disposition would be different.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, thank you for that information.  So for
now when I make a motion, you know, that how I'm going to approach the
motion, and I appreciate those words.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak briefly on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman may debate the motion.</p>

<p id="140:00">
Thank you. Mr Speaker. Sitting here I've got my rules chairman that has
made a motion that has traditionally been just a procedural motion that
everybody goes through. We have done that. I've got the chairman of the
committee over there saying this is what he wishes. I'm looking at the
rule book on page 144, Rule 39.2 to say this is well within the rules
for us to do this. So my point is, let's go by the rules, let's do what
the wishes of the committee chairman wants to do, what the wishes of our
rules chairman wants to do, and let's refer this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I would, just as a clarification for everyone,
because this is an interesting dialog, that the fact of the matter is,
these rules – everybody's statement, including Representative Hall's
statement on being able to reconsider the vote, that's why the rules are
there. Any rule and any of the motions that are taken today, all of
those have been in order and I think that it's clear that the Chair
has... when the rules clearly stipulate, the Chair has sided on the
advice of the clerk and the rules as they're stated. Representative
Holley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr Speaker, can I make a motion to lie the re-referral
on the table?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady may make a motion to lie upon the table the
motion to reconsider – the motion to re-refer..
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I make a motion to lie this upon the table.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion having been made by Representative Holley
and seconded by Representative Luebke is to lie upon the table the
motion to re-refer the bill in question. All in favor vote aye. All
opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. [background noise] The
clerk will let the machine record the vote. 34 having voted in the
affirmative and 71 in the negative, the motion fails.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that the rules chairman be directed to move the
previous question on this motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move the previous question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This may have been the most accelerated parliamentary
procedure session I've ever participated in. Now the previous question
does not require a second nor is it debatable. The question before the
House is the motion to move the previous question on the motion to
re-refer. This is just simply to get back to the motion to re-refer, and
to end debate. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk
will open the vote.. All members please record. The clerk will let the
machine record the vote. 83 having voted in the affirmative and 22 in
the negative, the main motion is before us. By rule, this is a motion,
it does not require a three minute debate. The question before the House
is the motion to re-refer... quite honestly at this point I've forgotten
the bill number. To re-refer Senate Bill 236 from the Committee on
Government to the Committee on Rules. All in favor vote aye. All opposed
vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will let the machine
record the vote. 71 having voted in the affirmative and 34 in the
negative, the bill is re-referred. The motion passes. Representative
Moore, do you have any other re-referrals?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well Mr Speaker, everybody was raring to go, we have
about 20 bills we could add to the calender tonight, but...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But we won't.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But we won't, thank you. Mr Speaker, I move that,
subject to ratification of bills, messages from the Senate committee
reports, conference reports, I don't think we have any additional
re-referrals. Well, re-referral bills and resolutions, but they would be
non-controversial. Modifications to the calender that the House do now
adjourn to reconvene on Monday, July 15, 2013 at 7:00 p.m., and members
we'd ask for you to note... I would ask, Mr Speaker, that we do adjourn
in memory of former Senator Zeb Alley. [RECORDING ENDS]</p>
