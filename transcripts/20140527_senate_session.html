Thank you Mr. President. Today we honor a great man in Eastern North

huge man in the community and representing everyone in Eastern North
Carolina from the farming communities we heard today, to school board,
to serving as Mayor of Chadbourn for fifteen years, school board member
and also served in the House for 4 years. I can remember as a young man
coming back home from college and Mr. Leo, as we all referred to him,
was just the man you saw in every civic organization and every part of
the community and county. He was a great man and he served his county,
his town of Chadbourn who he loved dearly. And we all know Chadbourn has
the Strawberry Festival of North Carolina, one of the oldest festivals
in the state, agriculture festivals in the state. Mr. Leo was there to
the end. He never gave up his love for this great state. He never gave
up his love...</p>

?? County, and today I’d just like to commend this resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Is there any further discussion or
debate? Senator Rabin, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin you have the
floor to speak to the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Folks, I
first met Mr. Leo in 1965. He was quite a character then and he was
quite a character last year when I saw him this last time. When he would
come to Brunswick County after I moved down there, he would always stop
by my veterinary office on his way to his house over on New Pine Beach,
which has a Mercer Street named after Mr. Leo. He was the quintessential
democrat. That’s all that were in Columbus County where I grew up. But
he was a fine man and he supported me wholeheartedly the first time I
ran for office. I remember him so well. I knew his sons and his family,
in Chadbourne. And what I remember about him as he aged, Mr. Leo never
gave up. He walked with a walking stick, and on top of his walking stick
was a carved turtle. Because he said he could keep up with that turtle,
and if he needed to he could pass him. But he was quite a man. Every
year in the strawberry festival which Chadbourne has the strawberry
festival and the best strawberries in North Carolina, I would take Mr.
Leo a quart or two of strawberries. And I think last year or the year
before, Senator Walters you and I shared a flat, and we made sure that
he had one. But Southeastern North Carolina, all of North Carolina will
miss Mr. Leo. He’s a fine man. And I’m certainly proud to have this
resolution come before this body. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator.
Senator Sanderson, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak to the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Sanderson has the
floor, to speak to the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
President. As to Senator Rabin’s acknowledgement of the democrats in
Columbus County, there’s still a lot of them in Columbus County Senator
Rabin. In fact, I’m still trying to talk some of my family members into
making the right decision. But I’m not sure that I’ll ever be able to do
that. A lot of times we have a lot of great things written about us. A
lot of times we have a lot of awards given to us, and to me that really
does speak to the nature and the integrity of a person. And when I look
at this list of Mr. Leo and that’s how I know him also, it speaks a lot
to what this man was made up of and what this man believed. But I think
there a couple of other things that speak to a man’s integrity and what
he means to a community. A lot of times I go out in public, to public
events, and a lot of times I’m able to speak to people. A lot of times I
talk to a lot of my constituents. And sometimes when I walk away from a
group or walk away from a person, the thought crosses my mind and says
now I wonder what that person really thinks about me? I wonder what that
person really thinks? The kind of person that I am. Because sometimes
our position requires or brings about certain things that maybe it
wouldn’t have if we were not elected officials. I think one of the
things that really speaks to a person’s integrity is what people say
about you after you have been in that position of authority, in that
position of power. I was fortunate enough and Gwen and my brother are
here tonight, and I was fortunate enough to convince my brother to marry
Gwen and to marry into this family. I’m going to take credit for it,
anyway. I probably didn’t have a lot to do with it but I’m going to take
the credit for it. But I think that one of the things that can really
speak to a person, is what do people say about you afterwards? I had
many occasions to see Mr. Leo in places in public, after he held this
position, after he had reached the age of retirement. And what really
spoke to my heart was the number of people that came up to this man
after he was no longer in this position of authority, and really revered
him and really spoke to him and really spent time in talking to him.
These were constituents that he had lived with all of his life and I
know beyond any doubt that these people had a tremendous respect for
this man. Another thing that I think you can measure is that there is
nobody who knows you like your family. And when I just think about the
dedication and the commitment and the love that Gwen showed her father
in his latter years, I’m just totally amazed. And that’s the same kind
of love and commitment that I hope I receive from my own children.</p>

<p id="15:00">
When I’m in that position, but I know behind any doubt that this man was
a champion for eastern North Carolina and I grew up in Columbus county.
I was not in Columbus county, I had moved to the coast by the time Mr.
Leo was elected to the state house, but I know beyond any doubt that
that man spent countless, countless hours trying to help the people in
his district and if he was still alive today and still had the capacity
to serve in this kind of a public office he would still, to do this day,
be championing the people in his district. Ladies and gentlemen he was a
fine man, it’s an honor to stand and to commit this resolution for your
consideration. Thank you Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you senator. Senator Blue what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak very briefly on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Blue has the floor to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. President. I couldn’t let this time go by
without remembering fondly by friend Leo Mercer. I served in the house
with him and I’ll tell you he took any task that you gave him very
seriously. He served with distinct on various committees that I
appointed him to, but more importantly he taught me a lot. I grew up in
the county adjoining Columbus county and Robeson county and one day I
was going down there. They have this tradition down in Columbus county
where the stump speech. You hear about it, it was the first time I’d
ever seen it, you may have experienced it yourself Mr. President, but
they actually take a stump, they put it on a stage that’s elevated about
two or three feet and the stump is about two or three feet, and if you
want to talk to the crowd you’ve got to get up and stand on the stump
and you’re looking down about six or seven feet and if you misstep or
get nervous you likely will fall off the stage. So I went to that event
with Leo and he was humorous the whole while. I didn’t fall off the
stage but I learned a lot from him then. Of the people I’ve served yet I
think Leo exuded a certain pride representing that part of the state but
in representing the state period. When he left legislature and then went
to work doing constituent service and agriculture-related things for
Governor Hunt in eastern North Carolina, he carried that same kind of
pride with him. I would run into him at various events and he was one of
the friendliest fellows you ever wanted to meet. He went out of his way
to be accommodating and I think that the pride and honor he displayed in
representing his constituents, and not only those in Columbus county but
across North Carolina, is something that we could all emulate I think
and be very pleased at it. Lastly I had an opportunity to work with him
on several ?? events and other things of that nature. He took the same
kind of pride into that and so I think of the people who served, Leo
Mercer certainly stands out among those who’ve served with great
distinction and I commend this resolution to you.
