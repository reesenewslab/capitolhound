Ralas from Nash County sponsored by Representative Collins and Edgar
Starnes glad to have you with us. Montgomery County Representative Burr.
And our sergeant in arms today, now do I say Mr Fred Hines or Sergeant
Fred Hines? Just Fred Hines, ok. Fred Hines, Reggie Seals, John Brandon
and Mike Clampett. Glad to have you with us today. Our first bill on the
calendar today with be House Bill 257 Unclaimed Property Improvement
Programs. Representative Hurley.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Hello Committee. This bill this morning is sort of
a follow up for the bill that I did last session and it gives the
treasurers department a little bit more leeway in trying to find owners
of unclaimed property. And for those of you who don’t know much about
the Escheats division it is part of the treasurers department and it is
money owned by your constituents that has been lost or they didn’t
realize they were due or it could be a dormant checking account that has
been sent to the Escheats division.
[Speaker Changes]
A question Representative Warren?
[Speaker Changes]
Not at this time sir
[Speaker Changes]
And this bill is to, the goal is to make various technical changes that
need to be done to bring the Unclaimed Property statues into alignment
with legislation passed in the 2011 session. The bill will also reduce
the amount of paperwork that private secure unclaimed property holders
are required to submit and eliminate a fee that is current paid by some
of these holders, which is costing more than it is making to do this. In
section 1 the bill amends the statue to accommodate changes made with
the passage of House Bill 692 during the 2011 session. It gives the
department of state treasurer access to a variety of personal
information about the owners of unclaimed property such as driver’s
license numbers that may not be fully protected by the state privacy and
the want this to not be able to be sent out to the general public.
Something like your social security number and things like that. The
name and address of the person can be sent out. You know if we needed it
and some of you use the Escheats division to let your constituents know
that they have money there, like at NC cash and you go there you can
find these people’s names. And in section 2 of the bill amends the
statue to accommodate the changes made by the passage of House Bill 692.
This bill requires only financial institutions that hold property
physically located in a safe deposit box or other safe keeping
depository to report such property. Hospitals and other entities holding
intangible property are no longer required to report such property. The
intent of the bill was to eliminate the need for hospitals and other
entities to report miscellaneous personal properties such as clothing,
umbrellas, costume jewelry, etc. which often have low value and would
cost more to receive, maintain or sell than the actual proceeds. The
change in the language did not take into account any actual cash
property so this is to cover that. And cash will be escheated to the
treasurer’s office. And the other thing would be that section 3 that
clarifies the means by which holders reporting unclaimed property may
certify and verify their records and it eliminates the fees for
unclaimed property holders who request an extension of time to file
their holder reports. North Carolina is the only known state to charge
holders a fee for the extension request and they only collected 1800
dollars last time and so they think this change would be beneficial. So
I ask your support and this and if there is any questions I’ll ask Jeff
to help us.
[Speaker Changes]
Before we take any questions I have a request that the commissioner
deputy treasurer of unclaimed properties, Brenda Williams, would like to
say a few words on this bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Good morning and thank you. I just wanted to introduce myself as the new
deputy treasurer for unclaimed property, again I am Brenda Williams.
Some of you may have worked with me already as a financial literacy
director for the department for the past two years. So, again, I just
wanted to introduce myself and let you know that I am looking forward to
working with you and helping your constituents get their unclaimed
property back. So thank you for hearing the bill this morning.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you for joining us. Representative Ross was first I believe.
[Speaker Changes]
Well thank you Mr. Chairman and at the appropriate time I wanted to make
motion for a favorable report.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Warren?</p>

Mr Chairman I bring before you this morning Senate Bill I believe it's
97, it's very near and dear to Representative Davis and myself. It
allows the City of Wilmington to not tax the people in the area that was
deannexed. It deals with annexations for less than 6 months. No tax bill
has been sent out by our city and our mayor and city council called us
and said could you please help us out, we do not wish to cause any
further ire to be raised on the part of those deannexed people who
didn't want to be annexed into the city to begin with and we would like
to not send them out a tax bill. We'd appreciate your support of the
bill. I'd be happy to answer any questions, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to make
a motion. This one's obvious. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes
for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. We have a number of deannexation
bills that come through every session and they're always site specific
for certain towns, you know, and they want to take an area out maybe as
annexed improperly, but is this saying that this long we give relief to
areas that have been deannexed within 6 months. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So in other words if you're down the road and the
town says well, we did this and we want to deannex it, those people
still have to pay their tax. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. And again,
we've already dealt with that issue, this is simply dealing with the
bill that we dealt with last year where we stopped forced annexation. We
had an area in Wilmington that had been annexed for less than 6 months.
No tax bill had been sent out. There are other areas that have already
actually taxed, those taxes had been paid. We're not dealing with that
and causing any problems for anybody. This bill was drawn up to deal
with our specific situation in New Hanover County. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair, and if I
could comment. This is, as Senator Goolsby said, this is something that
was specifically requested by the city. They do not really want to issue
tax bills for the time that the people in ?? junction were annexed but
they have to by law, so what this statute will do is enable the city of
Wilmington to do that. And also as Senator Goolsby has said, the city
has talked with me and I assured them that if it passed this committee
and went to the floor that I would support it there and I ask you also
to do that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley is recognized for a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair, move for a favorable
report on Senate Bill 97, Finance Committee substitute. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I apologize for being late but was it stated that the city of
Wilmington supports this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] They
asked for it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a motion, Representative Brawley
has made a motion to give Senate Bill 97 a favorable report. Any further
discussion. If there is no discussion, all those in favor let it be
known by saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All
opposed no. The ayes have it, Senate Bill 97 will be given a favorable
report and it's my understanding Representative Davis will be handling
it on the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It will be my pleasure Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
House Bill 174, Representative Howard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? (background
noise) [SPEAKER CHANGES] While they're handing out those copies, we have
House Bill 193, expand the uses for Mecklenberg Charlotte local taxes as
in our committee and it will be assigned to the subcommittee on
occupancy taxes. That subcommittee is chaired by Representative Moffit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. I'm sorry, can you remind me the other
members on that subcommittee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffit,
Carney, Cotham, Davis and Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? (background noise) Does everyone have a copy of the proposed
committee substitute? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair.</p>

I move that we have the PCS before us for the purpose of discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Representative Howard is recognized to comment on House Bill 174
Proposed Committee Substitute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We’ve had really good cooperation with the
railroad and with all of the parties that are concerned with this bill.
In 2011 session law, there was a requirement that the program evaluation
division do a review of the corporation’s mission, the economic
development benefits, the tangible and intangible value, and the
governance. The law required the program evaluate whether the North
Carolina Railroad should be sold, transferred to the North Carolina
Department of Transportation, or transferred to another agency, or
should its private corporation maintain that private corporation
structure. Since the state of North Carolina became North Carolina
Railroad’s sole shareholder, and many of you were here in 1998 when
those shares were purchase, the final shares by the state, the
corporation has been very profitable and solvent. However, the state of
North Carolina has not received any direct financial benefit from owning
the North Carolina Railroad. The joint program evaluation division
completed their study and had direct input, again, from the railroad.
Then the oversight joint program evaluation oversight committee, met,
reviewed the recommendations, reviewed the study and made...accepted the
recommendations by program evaluation division and that’s where this
bill stems from. I will tell you briefly what it will do.
A. It allows the governor to cross a point, one board member each from
the board of transportation and from the economic development board. It
expands annual reporting and disclosure requirements for the North
Carolina Railroad to include a host of things that I will go through
those things with you. A, a strategic plan and capital plan and whether
objectives have been met. 2, anticipated dividends for the next three
fiscal years. 3, description of the North Carolina Railroad business.
They’re in the marketing of what’s going on with the railroad. A list of
the properties that the North Carolina Railroad owns. Description of the
code of ethics and possible conflict of interest. A list of the
directors and the officers and their experience. A list of the
compensation of paid directors and officers. The nature of disagreements
with its accountants. If the the North Carolina Railroad changes
accountants. Any transactions that are between the North Carolina
Railroad, the directors, officers, and family members. Those are
requirements that are now in this bill. Effective June 30 of ‘13, when
the PCS places the one time $15.5 million dividend, and the future one
time net proceeds of properties that are being transferred to the state
budget and renovation reserve fund. In the annual cash dividend of $3.7
million, which is equal to 25% of the trackage rights agreement with
Norfolk and Southern is due January 15 of 2014. That’s essentially what
the bill does and I’ll stand to answer any questions, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Actually, if there are representatives of the
North Carolina Railroad.</p>

<p id="20:00">
I have a couple of questions for them if that's appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is the representative of the railroads here? Scott Saylor? Are you
available to answer questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. I have about three questions if that's
okay. Thank you for being here. My first question to you is: What
position does the North Carolina Railroad have on this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In January, Representative Ross, the board of directors adopted a
resolution asking for really four provisions to get looked at. Three of
those four issues have been resolved in the PCS. The fourth item is that
the board had asked, of course this is up to the general assembly, you
all, as the shareholder, that the dividends if they're diverted be used
only for transportation or economic development related purposes. So
that was the four provisos.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, may I keep...So, Mr. Saylor, your only objection to the PCS now is
the use of the proceeds. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's not an objection. Just a statement from the board on our position.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My question to you is: if you didn't give this
money over to the General Assembly, and now I see in the PCS it's going
to the repair and renovation fund for state buildings. If you didn't
give the money to the General Assembly, what would the North Carolina
Railroad do with the 15.5 million dollars in one-time contributions and
with the other funds that would be transferred? Would you be
re-investing that in the railroad or what would you do with it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We would. They would be re-investing for economic development and
improvements in the transportation, the rail assets of the railroad. It
would not stop, but it would delay some of those projects, depending on
contributions of other partners for those projects. Things, for example,
re-locating tracks or adding tracks where double tracks are needed
today, where it may be singles tracked. Or replacing bridges. But we
would still have 75% of the resources to apply to those projects going
forward under the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more follow up question, thank you Mr. Chairman. So, you said that
those projects would be delayed. Could you, is there anyway that you
could quantify the economic impact of those projects. Because, we know
that North Carolina relies a lot on freight rail. There are plans for
high-speed passenger rail. And so, what would be the effect of those
things being delayed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are three primary projects that may be delayed. Those would be the
double tracking the three miles of the North Carolina Railroad between
downtown Raleigh at Boline Junction or where you know where the Amtrak
station is. It's single track and there are five bridges on the railroad
between there and the belt line. That's going to be about a 57 million
dollar project ultimately. Another project that may be delayed is
relocating some storage tracks and yard properties in downtown
Newbourne. A lot of the railroad is downtown in sort of a legacy
property there that should be relocated eventually. And the third
project that would be most significantly affected would be double
tracking the railroad that is currently single tracked between downtown
Carry and Morrisville to dovetail with the DOT project which will double
track the line from Morrisville to RTP.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, just for a statement. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. I
just think that taking this money out of an organization that has
managed it's funds effectively, contributed to economic development,
contributed to freight rail which is something our businesses count on,
and is working on improving passenger rail in one of the highest
population areas of the state is pennywise and pound foolish. And why
are we going and dipping into an organization that is providing crucial
infrastructure for this state at a time when we have basically ceased
investment in infrastructure? It makes absolutely no sense and I'm ...</p>

adamantly opposed to this ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  President ?? is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Let me ask the gentleman from the railroad a couple
of questions.  You're talking about these improvements that you're
wanting to make. What's the dollar cost of these improvements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The double track between downtown Raleigh and the
belt lines is about a 57 million dollar project.  We currently have 10
million dollars budgeted for that project.  The double track between ??
and Morrisville is estimated at about 60 million dollars, we currently
have 10 million dollars set aside for that project.  And the relocation
of the ?? yard would be in the order of about 18 to 20 million dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Another question, then.   All right, so you're
setting aside money for these projects, so then what is the timeline?
When do you anticipate that they'll be completed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The timeline for these would push out to around 2018
to 2020, depending on the contributions of other partners to those
projects, so they are funded at about only one-third currently.  What we
will do is once this legislation passes, depending on the final result,
is we'll need to go back and re-prioritize those and take a look at each
one and decide how they ought to be prioritized.  We're also waiting on
statements from the Governor's office about rail policy and the
philosophy there, because DOT is a strong partner of ours, and a lot of
these projects.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So can you say, for certain, then, how long these
projects will be delayed if this 25 percent is taken away?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Three to five years is what I would estimate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Just a comment, Mr. Chairman.  These are long-term
planning projects that they've got on the books, but I think it's a good
deal that we've got.  I mean we own the railroad, and the state is
entitled to get some sort of return on its investment, and what we're
asking for is not unreasonable and I support the bill.  I think that the
rail projects will be completed and they'll be completed in a timely
manner.  They may not be done as quickly as they wanted to, but they'll
get done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] President ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ah yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.  ?? representative could
you tell us what the original investment was in 1998?  I think I heard
it, I want to doublecheck.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stone, I believe Mr. Turkot with the ??
division can give us those numbers.  that was when we invested in the
final piece of the stock, it was a substantial amount of money.  Mr.
Chairman, if you would recognize John Turkot?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Turkot?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.  As
we understand it, the transaction, the total value of the transaction
was 71 million dollars.  It involved a complicated credit swap, but the
bottom line was that the ?? revenue paid 71 million dollars into the
railroad to buy out the 25 percent of shares that had been previously
owned by private stockholders.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  President Stone, a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I just want to complete, finish his statement.  I
think this is a good deal, we're moving forward here.  But what I would
really encourage is I'd encourage the railroad to look at a way to buy
out North Carolina, and then run the railroad privately, and then invest
their own money.  This is the process when you get involved with state
money.  This is the kind of things that come around, and we ought to
protect the stakeholders interest, the taxpayer, and we have 71 million
dollars invested, and I think it's time we get a dividend on the
taxpayers' money.  But I would strongly encourage them to eventually
look at a way to take back the railroads, run it privately like the rest
of the businesses and corporations in North Carolina do.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A quick to ??.  President
Howard, the dividend that comes back from the railroad, what will that
money be used for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Right now the money is being directed to the repair
and renovation fund.  We sort of struggled with that, but we felt that
as Representative Stone said, the people of North Carolina have quite an
investment in the North Carolina Railroad, which we're very proud of.
We have never asked previously for</p>

Plan just for you and those two projects were included in the now
seriously and if it things have changed your conditions have changed the
course that's important for the committee affect understand what his
followers the PD reporters concern will redo the projections the cash
flow projections and forecasts for list of basically we took in
consideration what those plans for the time this came in at 4 o'clock
yesterday afternoon I personally had a conversation with the thoughts
with you North Carolina rewriting answer questions have your plans
changed there anything different in this mail that you need to change
and even into reliving any of the property that had been dating surplus
value on I was not given an answer that things work had changed on
blinker gentleman from the rarefied is stands to address this question
must direct response to a questionnaire to clarify this juncture can't
is correct to the PD staff took into account our long-term plans are
projects to require partners to help with the funding for those and we
can support the legislation it will require some adjustment to capital
program with the John's correct the staff took that into account we will
have resources to move as many projects Florida's we can and I got one
major verify that represented whole represented thank you Mr. chairman
and just to state briefly and may have a question for Mr. silent on this
is I am a entire evaluation and shared with chairman that atenolol
heartburn either the scale and she's not at times fast having chair
transportation for a couple of years on the policy found in this is just
a hard one for me I had when I came here's the Flashman one of the big
issues out there was that there the cabin at that time had gone was take
many from lines entire money and put it into the general findings I have
my indoctrination as a freshman at here 10 years ago on that that
variations I have maintained in and submitted the Senate committee and
there were several others that have had that this money would day I
given today transportation and said that is investing reinvesting in the
stay may investment of the stagnate years back and and and I still
believe that's where the money that we have huge infrastructure needs in
the state and I think we all know that from wades to teleports to mail
to transit and there is no secret that doesn't last for Mecklenburg are
very committed and went County and in the other parts of the state now
to transit and even people from place to place in a more ex-expedited
way and we're running out of friends that dart to Belgrade sound where
are getting more and more congested and I do have one question for Mr.
silent and that is an is just confident, and usually I get this
information beforehand that Westside for instance the airport in
Charlotte all the money that comes from that airport at self-sustaining
is federal money and savings and that the federal money comes with a
time to let that it has to be spent on the airport and airport
operations and projects how does the federal many found for the valorize
operate as far as extending so we will receive any federal
appropriations the federal investment it typically becomes your partner
transportation you're finding the and you get that none from the program
is correct That was a disappointed glance at the fermata I understand
your children your research about English be can ask questions and have
a problem with resolutions to repeatedly</p>

I'm glad everything cannot and will is that mantis and it's just I just
wanted to thank Is nonpublic else on anyway just wanted to emphasize and
I will say this there as well within the initiative on this started out
in it has come a long way and I do commend the chair and the and the
division for the work that can on this and the Ballarat it started out
and I think about never that women stelae well acted and this is why has
been salvaged and that another think it says about good news: I just
still have met Jackson about the money not going to transportation
representatives and that is chairman I think that it's a good thing the
we are pursuing alluvion if it's it has set the state owns the asset
that I do also think that there is a deep philosophical difference the
repair fund as I recall it barely discussion about the number oh
renovations and repairs that we had been deferring for low key with
talking diligence so that the amount of money it's going to come from
this Vivian and the lady that would come in the future is a proverbial
drop in the bucket on the other hand we have a number oh admit
transportation needs and clearly out regardless of what has been said
about stretching out projects in this spring this money into
transportation will give us more bang for the transportation will and I
think that is not something likely to be dismissed the are number of
things that we are pursuing will group slowing tries to build high-speed
rail the railroad commission or company owned right-of-way is is that
can be valuable redeveloped going forward as the economic development a
decent this dear partnerships they are all 40 and I think it's important
that we don't*the investment aspects him back into transportation him
him in the Charlotte area we have learned their the property along the
rail corridor as valuable and Nick inappropriate economic conditions and
with appropriate partners you can develop medium and high density
projects that are a bit benefit to local communities in terms of
increasing the tax base circular choice I think it is much more
important for us to interest this view million dollars in that direction
as opposed to trying to to give you a veritable bucket of water in
Florida on the raging fire over admit renovation and repair needs and
because of their I found it difficult to vote for this bill in committee
and would hope that in the legislative process that we can come to
modifying the year the development use of these funds to an and you
really think about where we going with this beckons chair I cannot
handle it like this German hit cannot connect to begin with a question
about the fiscal note on Wednesday I guess the staff of the preparers of

Trying to understand the up to 3.68 million , what does that mean there,
in which year approximately that between 3 and 4 million dollars, what
does that mean and How is that related to 15.5 million that we have been
discussing.
[Speaker Changes] [inaudible] is recognized
[Speaker Changes] Mr Chair  [inaudible] of the fiscal research division.
If you see with fiscal year 2013-14 there is an annotation there  which
indicates that the 15 and half million in the lump sum cash dividend is
to be credited to the state no later than the fiscal year end in the
current fiscal year. And we would treat that as as an unappropriated
balance on  future appropriation by the general assembly  should that
not be appropriated we assume it would be allocated according to the
current provision which would require half of the balance to go to state
agency projects and for the remainder to go to UNC system projects. In
the out years, you see that 25% of the [inaudible] income assumption at
3.7 million  roughly increasing my 2% based on an adjustment factor
included in the [inaudible]  is assumed.
[Speaker Changes] Follow up
[Speaker Changes] Follow up
[Speaker Changes] So what you are saying is you are assuming  that 15.5
million is coming as income and then the minuses represent the outlay.
Is that correct.
[Speaker Changes] This is assuming just the net revenue impact and no
monetary
outlets.
[Speaker Changes] Let me now proceed. I am not quite clear with what
that was.
[Speaker Changes] Representative is recognized
[Speaker Changes] Thank you. Let me support my colleagues who have
spoken in defense  of transport of rail  and by extension  bus as an
alternative to the private automobile. I hope this general assembly this
majority is not  with this signaling that it is abandoning our efforts
in North Carolina to move forward with public transportation. I just
think if any of you are reading [inaudible] any of us read important
economic magazines we understand that there is problems with carbon
emissions, there is problems depending on the automobile and that for
that reason other reasons as well, crowding on the roads and all that.
And so in this state a few years ago and actually since I first visited
in 1991 where there were not a lot of support in 1991 for public transit
but has risen over the years so that our state had made was making
through the general assembly a considerable commitment to public
transit. And now what it seems we are doing here is not a whole lot of
dollars but it’s awfully strong symbolism.  Make a symbolic statement
with this bill and  where you are directing the money that public
transit by which I mean rail roads and bus etc is not important . In
fact as Mr [inaudible] has been very diplomatic, I suppose is good for
him to be in his role. But the fact of the matter is that he has got
very good projects that could very well be paid with his money , they
planned it that way and why should we delay this. This is a benefit as I
heard it benefit for Craven county Newburn. There is a benefit for
Western Wade county and carried to Morrisville. And for goodness sake
this carried to Morrisville work that the [inaudible] is planning ties
in to an NCDOT project to go  to the research triangle park . And surely
all of us recognize how key to North Carolina’s economic development in
the past and in the future , the research triangle park is. And here is
a project from minimum amount of money really from rail roads that moved
double tracks from Kerry Morrisville and dove tails and fits to NCDOT
plan to double track the RTP. How can you take away these kind of
dollars from the rail road when it’s doing such amazing things for
economic development. RTP is known worldwide for its economic success.
I d not understand why you are taking these money away from rail road.
As Rep Ross has said about itself I would include myself in those who
understand importantly how important R&amp; R fund is. But why you are
picking on the rail roads. This just doesn’t make sense to me  I think
its bad public policy and Rep Howard if I am wrong.</p>

<p id="50:00">
understand this I mean I guess I should ask you this way are they
planning to be sub student appropriations from this general assembly for
public transit? That is a question for Miss. Germund Forosen if she can
respond. [Speaker Changes] Dr. Likey, I'm not on appropriations so I'm
not in a position to answer that, but for many years this issue has been
out there and as Resemty Carney said no one literally paid any attention
to the asset or what was happening we found that there was numerous
pieces of property that could be declared surplus. It was a very in
depth study. I will challenge anyone that I agree that public
transportation is very important. Particularly important for the folks
in Rolley and perhaps Charlotte. There's an advantage in having public
transportation, but this is a state owned asset owned by the people of
Lincoln county, Kataba county, Davey county and every other small
community in the state and we have never ever asked the railroad to do
any kind of contribution for anything. It's a beginning. It's a very
comprehensive bill to pull the properties together, to try to have those
declared surplus the ones that the railroad has indicated they do not
need do not have any purpose for, and it is a beginning. We initially
with the private evaluation the money was going to be sent to the
general funds sixth floor. Now what do you think is going to happen when
it gets to the sixth floor? There's all kind of needs up there. So,
therefore, if we move the money into R&amp;R I agree it's an eye dropper
in the ocean but it is a beginning to see we are looking to the railroad
and we're very proud of the railroad, the job that they're doing. But
it's trying to sell these surplus properties, put that money into
R&amp;R trying to have the 15.5 million dollars moved over to R&amp;R
and then the annual tricage fee will also go into R&amp;R and I believe
that will be imported. That's money that the sixth floor doesn't have to
move over into R&amp;R so there can be dollars that are available for
the transportation needs that you pointed out so clearly Mr. I wanted to
say Mr. Charman, I'll call you Dr. Lukey or representative Lukey or but
this is an ongoing project and it is a start to, again every bill that
I've stood here and tried to debate and discuss and present that come
out of program evaluation I know that you remember why this bills are
coming forth. It is to try to fix critical problems that we see in this
state and this being one I would ask for the support on the bill Mr
Charman  now I know that you give the PCS a favorable report unfavorable
to the original bill. [Speaker Changes] Thank you for your notion, I
have five other people here waiting to make that notion. I would remind
the committee that by design when we pass tax bills we're taking money
from success so it can be used somewhere for a need so this committee
does that all the time. We have a notion that the PCS begin the
favorable report unfavorable for the original bill. The question I have
down here representing Hamelton and Whydel would like to speak. Ann
Collins Representing Hamelton. [Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Charman.
Just for a statement about the bill, first of all I want to be very
clear, I love this bill . I think that it's long overdue.</p>

<p id="55:00">
I think we're in the unique situation here in that this is a state-owned
asset that is actually providing revenues, which is an anomaly in
itself. It's long overdue to utilize those revenues for some sort of
public benefit. My concern about the bill - is just what's been
discussed here this morning - is basically where we are directing those
revenues, those funds, that are coming off the-- coming from the
railroad. I would be much more comfortable directing those funds to a
more analogous use. We've talked a lot today about public transportation
and mass transit. I would also agree with Representative Howard that
those things are very important in some parts of our state, but down
around my way we're much more interested in developing the railroad for
freight, for economic purpose that support our state [poor]
infrastructure. So I would strongly encourage us to consider a change in
this bill at some point along the process that would provide those
revenue sources strictly towards rail operations. I would even go so far
as to exclude any sort of public transit in this particular case. I'm a
proponent of public transit, but that's not where these revenue sources
are coming from. These revenue sources are coming from the North
Carolina railroad that has provided connections for our industrial and
manufacturing uses throughout the state, to supplement with CSX and the
other rail lines, [excuse me] North or Southern. The work that they've
been doing for the past couple hundred years to bring productivity and
economic development into the state. So that's my only objection to it
at this point is where we're directing the money, and I would like to
see that money directed toward the rail. But otherwise I think this is,
again Representative Howard, long overdue. Thank you for bringing it to
us, and great work by the program evaluation division. Thank you Mister
Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I have three more people down to speak, and
then I'm going to call for a vote on the bill. Representative Waddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've heard the extended
debate about the railroad and where the money's going to go. I'm from a
rural county, Columbus, and we don't even have a railroard. We have what
is called a railroad. I guess Representative Davis over here will allude
to the fact that we have revolution come down and work in [Chabernsome],
and they use the railroad there as a prop. So if you have a
consideration of where the money should go, I would direct you to
Columbus county. Because I'm telling you-- when you're looking at jobs
bill now, and you're looking at a jobs place to put the money, we have
Georgia Pacific that's been idle in Columbus County. We had over 350
jobs that were taken out of that county. And we have been told
indirectly from Georgia Pacific that unless the railroads back up and
operational again, they're probably not going to open that company back
up again. It will be shuttered forever. We've been working with South
Carolina on a rail deal trying to get this private enterprise out of the
rail business, the short-line rail business, because they have used up
all of the assetts of that rail without doing what Representative Ross
was talking about: putting money back into repair and renovation. So,
once again I would totally urge my colleagues in here, if you would like
to put the $15 million I've got a good place to put it that will create
some jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Wow. We've had a lot of
fighting over this $15 million. And we started off with collecting some
dividends and the next thing you know we're debating whether we're
committed to rail or transit. I've got a little history on this. I was
on the committee that studied selling the railroad, because we're the
only state in the lower 48 that operates a railroad - Alaska's the
other. And when we found that we didn't have a railroad it was the only
way we were going to get one. Now, I think we could get somebody to
operate it if we wanted to sell it and monetize that for a lot of needs.
We've heard about should the money go to transportation. We've got high
speed rail, we have all kinds of people movers. And let's be blunt guys:
$15 million. If it goes to repair and renovation we can actually fix
some buildings. We can take smaller projects and complete them, and have
something to show other than we slightly raised the level in the account
that is still.</p>
