call the meeting to order. Our Sergeant At Arms today for House ?? is
Bill Bass, Joe Crook, Charles Godman, and B.H. Fowl. And our pages are
Jessica Nothan, from Orange, Insco the sponsor, Richard Seebolt from
Wake, Avila as sponsor, Cayanna Swinson, Wake, Hall as sponsor, Gregory
Stewart from Wake, Cotham sponsor, and Cameron Tallot from Davidson,
Dockham sponsor.
On the agenda today, Senate Bill 636 has been pulled, so we’re going to
start with Senate Bill 376, Senator Bingham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Actually, this bill allows land owners
and lessees to request an out-of-season tracker permit year round. And
as you probably know, if you have livestock or poultry owners, etcetera,
this has been certainly a serious problem for these folks, as well as
deer hunters. And both of these groups, the livestock organization and
also hunters in the area came to me about this bill, and there was a
study done in Texas that showed that coyote diet consisted mostly of
fawns, 70%, and there was a study done in South Carolina that indicated
one litter of coyotes, they did a night photography study on this and
found that there was 27 fawns, one litter, the adult coyote would bring
27 fawns in one season into the den for them to feed on. So deer
hunters, it’s been sort of a negative impact, especially in my area of
the state, in the Piedmont, to alleviate or get rid of the deer
population. And of course in leasing land, no one wants to lease land to
hunt if there’s not any deer there to hunt. And this bill was approved
by the wildlife commission, and I’ll be happy to try to answer any
questions if anybody has any, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to let members raise their questions, and then
we got some people that are in the public that wish to speak.
Representative Whitmire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Very briefly going back to the beginning of the
session when I ran a bill on a much smaller scale, I will simply say
from personal experience on our farm, as a hunter and also as one who
has livestock, that landowners need this bill to be able to more
effectively be able to control a predator that has no natural enemies in
the environment that it’s in. And I strongly support this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have a question for the bill
sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may ask that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The coyote, what are the wildlife requirements for
killing coyotes or not trapping but actually killing those animals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think, Mr. Chairman, I think Gordon Meyers is here.
I think I know that, but I would prefer he answer that if that’s okay
with you, Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, that’s fine. Gordon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gordon Meyers, Executive
Director of the Wildlife Resources Commission. Relative to coyote
hunting, coyotes may be hunted year round and in 95 counties they may
also be hunted at night with the aid of a light.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Of course, I come from rural Robeson County and
there’s a concern with coyotes down there as well, but I guess one of my
concerns is animals that are not coyotes getting in these traps.</p>

Becoming maimed and eventually we'll face death as a result of that.
What's the position of the, do we have a Hunter's Association or, and
another concern is their, their dogs, their animals when they're out
hunting, and getting in those traps. Do we have anyone that can speak on
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do have some people who wish to speak that represent those groups.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. That's my concern. I just wanted to share that, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Lewis. I think there is someone here that wants
to speak. Mister Chairman I don't know how you want to handle this, but
as we all know that, nothing, if you set traps you certainly can't be
100% effective and not have negative outcomes and, and of course with
the protections we have and, and the interests we have, I feel like that
this is going to be well, at least from the land owner's perspective,
they're not gonna, certainly don't want to catch any of their neighbor's
dogs or anyone else's so, anyway, I'll make that comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chair. I certainly agree that we need to do something
to eradicate if we could, at least reduce the coyote population. They're
in all one hundred counties if I understand it. But I also know that
steel traps don't discriminate. They will catch your pet dog, they will
catch your, your hunting dogs, they will catch any animal that happens
to go by. And since we do have universal hunting on these coyotes, you
can kill them any day of the week I believe, except on Sunday where it's
not allowed to hunt on Sunday. You can kill them at night. You can even
spotlight them. And if we want to really reduce them, I think that's
probably the way to properly go about it rather than kill somebody who's
training, kill somebody's dogs who are out there training their dogs in
out of season. They're running their dogs to get them in condition, this
kind of thing. Those traps really ruin, people get a dog into a steel
trap, you ruin that dog. So I just think we ought to shoot them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr? Oh no Brody, I'm sorry, I'll get you next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. Senator, can I just ask you a real quick
question on, on just what's in, part that's in this bill it says, you
can't remove a coyote that's still alive. Why would anybody ever do that
in the first place?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I had, I had rather, if, if you don't mind, Representative, that
the Commissioner answer that. I've heard, but I don't want to, I want, I
want to make sure that I get this correct, because I'm not as familiar
with this as some of the gentlemen in the room so, anyway. Gordon's
permissible, mister Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gordon Myers again, Executive Director of the Wildlife Commission. The
reason that provision was incorporated into the bill was as a result of
concerns that came forward largely from, from outside fox hunters who
have some concerns about the sale and perpetuation of sale of coyotes
to, to fox pens, and under, under certain conditions, under certain
local laws as well as through rules of the Wildlife Commission during
the fur bearing trapping season, coyotes that are captured can be sold
to fox pens. This provision was added to, to negate a year round season
in which the coyotes would be provided to these pens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brody, the, you got your answer? Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chair. I don't know who could answer this, but I think
I read somewhere that the coyotes were reintroduced back here a few
years ago. Are they still being reintroduced or are we still trying to
get them out of here? And I don't, I, what I've heard there's so many
deer that they're, being killed that I was surprised that you didn't
have any deer. But I'd like an answer to that question please, thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hurley, I do know that, that they were introduced, and,
and of course the concerns that I had were from deer hunters, especially
from deer hunters, and because of the population dwindling so much and
also from livestock owners et cetera and so, and I think maybe Gordon or</p>

?? or whoever, Mr. Chairman, if that’s permissible. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may speak. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My name’s Colleen Olfenbuttel; I’m the
black bear and fur bear biologist for the Wildlife Resources Commission.
In order to address your question, from the 1930s until about the ‘70s,
we did have a handful of coyotes that were illegally brought into North
Carolina for the purposes of hunting; however, starting in the 1980s,
coyotes eventually naturally migrated into our state on their own, so
the coyotes we have now in North Carolina are ones that naturally came
in on their own. The commission did not reintroduce coyotes into North
Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dixon. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. We can spend a lot of
time talking about this. Let me tell you something: For the livestock
industry in eastern North Carolina, the coyote is a very, very
significant problem. Of my own personal experience, I’ve lost birds four
different times from coyotes. One time it was over 860 turkeys in one
house. Representative Lucas, the idea of shooting these coyotes, the
coyote’s a very, very smart animal, as you well understand. The time is
now that we have to use every means possible in order to reduce or try
to eliminate this population of coyote. It’s a very, very imposing
financial liability to the livestock producers in eastern North
Carolina, and this bill is not perfect, it doesn’t actually go as far as
I think it should go, but I have no love lost for the coyote, and I
think we need to do everything, and the pet owners and folks need to be
responsible for their dogs to the best extent possible, but I’m telling
you, the coyote problem is a very serious problem to our livestock
producers in eastern North Carolina, and I commend this bill to you in
the very strongest of terms possible. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Whitmire again. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Couple more thoughts just from a
factual standpoint, and then I’d like to move that we approve. Trapping
versus shooting coyotes. The effectiveness on traps is a little over 7
to 1, as far as effectiveness. Coyote’s a hard animal to hunt and kill.
They’re… Wile E. Coyote’s sly, and we know that and that’s there.
There’s significant speculation amongst the veterinarians in my area
about them crossing with feral dogs, and including the red wolf that was
introduced, so their aggressiveness has increased. That’s been observed
by many in the western part of the state. I’ll also add that the type of
trap and the regulations with when you are setting traps, you have to
check them every 24 hours, and when they reintroduced the otter into
some of the rivers in my area, they actually trapped them in other
states and used traps to… Just because an animal gets in a trap, does
not mean that it’s doomed, so just to make sure we know that. In Clay
County last year, there was a full-grown horse that was taken down by
coyotes. Of course it was hemmed in a barn and beat itself to death
trying to get away from them, but it’s not just calves, it’s not just
fowl, turkeys and chickens, but on the farm that I live on, we too have
lost turkeys and chickens and calves, so this is all very a legitimate
threat that has very little predators at all, so with that, at the
appropriate time I’d like to move that we pass this. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not yet. We’ll keep you in mind. Representative Horn. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Coyotes aren’t a problem just in the rural or farm areas and
just to folks with chickens and other livestock. I live in a rather
urbanized area and I’ve seen coyotes twice coming through our area at
night. They are incredibly profligate. The question I have though is
something ?? that you brought up about deer population, and although
that’s not exactly on this subject, I am curious if you or someone from
wildlife can tell me, are we really having a decline in deer population
in North Carolina? Because I find that hard to believe. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well I can tell you that in my particular area there’s
definitely a decline, and I know one gentleman who is an avid deer
hunter and he has killed a couple of these coyotes.</p>

<p id="15:00">
And they've very, very difficult to not only see, but kill or shoot,
because they're savvy and they're smart, but the study that was done
about them being a predator, the fawns, and 27 fawns, which has been
noted and I've had many of the deer hunters ??? indicate that they've
noted a decline in the deer population in forested or timber areas
especially, because that's the majority of what they feed on, but I'm
sure the Wildlife Commission may want to comment on that one, your
permission as chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gordon Myers, again, Executive Director of the Wildlife Commission,
certainly at a very localized, there are very localized impacts of
coyotes on deer, in terms of the overall deer population in the state,
it's remained very stable, it had been increasing quite a bit, and it's,
we would characterize it as stable today. The coyote mortality is what
we consider to be capacitory mortality, it's mortality that would have
otherwise occurred, either through hunting or through other factors, but
it does certainly take away from hunting opportunity at the same time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We had some people that asked to speak on this bill, so now I would like
to take them no more than 3 minutes a person, and when you come up to
the mic, tell us who you are, so we all understand that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Harry Ennis, I'm president of the Eastern North Carolina Fox
Hunters Association, and I'd like to say to begin with that I'm no fan
of the coyote, but I am a fan of the other animals that these traps can
catch during the gestatation period, the nursing period, and the raising
of the young that will occur. We have depredation permits that you can
obtain in North Carolina, if you have a nuisance problem, and you can
use those to catch coyotes anytime during the year, that you show that
you have a cause, and that's my main objection to the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Pete Warren, I'm from the North County, I've come today to
oppose this bill, because this is just a bad bill, I do not like this
herd that's shared with you, the coyotes followed it personally, they
are here to stay, you can do whatever you want to, you can try to
eliminate them, but they've been trying to do the same thing in the
state of Texas ever since the beginning of time. I wish there was a
simple answer to this, but there's not, I've been representing fox
hunters and the hunters on outside since 1972, I've been up here again
and again and again, my concern again is not a coyote, my concern is
what's gonna happen to your red foxes, what's gonna happen to your gray
foxes, what's gonna happen to your raccoons, because the same trap that
is being used by the majority of people that's trapping animals and will
be used are used for all 3 or 4 of these animals, and I've been known to
a lot of you, if he spends any time at all in a trap, he is no good of
whatever purpose. Second thing I'd like to share with you is that no
matter what we do, we tried to pick you guys to represent us, and come
forward with ideas that is fair to everybody, and not just fair to what
we think is a nuisance, like I said again, I do not have an answer for
the coyotes, I do know what the biologist says, they said the last
living thing on Earth is going to be a coyote, because he's gonna live
on anything. I've heard a lot of recommendations from different ones on
how to do it, we got laws in existing now that control them, will they
work? I don't think so. But I will disclose with this thing saying to
you, that, no matter what you've been lead to believe, by the North
Carolina Wildlife Preserve, or the North Carolina Wildlife Protectness,
they will not be able to control this bill if it's put in place, and I
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Joe McClees, and I represent North Carolina Sporting Dog, we are a
26,000 member group in North Carolina that has all the different hunting
dog groups in the entire state. We oppose the bill, I want to talk to
you a little bit why. First of all, we are not friend to coyotes,
coyotes don't have many friends, no matter where they are. They have got
a lot of enemies, what we are concerned about, is the way this bill is
written and drafted, at</p>

...present before this became law, if you were a farmer, or you were a
merchant, or you were someone who had livestock, you can apply to the
Wildlife Resource Commission, Gordon Myers, and get a declaration
permit. Catch, kill or do whatever to the animal. We don't have any
problem with that. This is not dog hunting versus trapping. We don't
have any problem with trapping. What we have a problem is during the
period of time that this proposed bill would come in effect is the
gestation period of time for the red foxes and the grey foxes, and the
raccoons. You're killing the mothers or the seed of the animals that
we're going to hunt down the road. Ladies and gentlemen, we ask you to
oppose it on this ground. But again, we're not anti people trying to do
something with a coyote problem. The coyote problem has been addressed,
I know, for the last five or six years in the General Assembly. We
haven't come across a perfect answer. But he answer is not this bill and
the manner in which it is written. I would appreciate your opposing this
bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Anyone else from the public wishes to speak? If not,
Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please tell us who you are?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Stephen Brown. I'm just a regular ol'
person, farmer and a trapper, a hunter and sportsman. All I've heard
today is everybody just likes to coyote. I can't agree no more.
Everybody wants to have something done about the coyotes. And I am not
affiliated with the dog people, so I don't want you thinking I'm siding
with them. I ain't siding with nobody. I'm siding with regular people.
This bill will be detrimental in the long run if it is passed to what I
think that Senator Bingham and other sportsmen of like really want to
accomplish. I'm also a damage control agent with the North Carolina
Wildlife Resource Commission. I'm certified through them. I go to their
school. This is our rules and regulations right here. I pay money to be
certified. We trap coyotes 12 months out of the year. We're trained to
do so. It's a program in the wildlife commission that is also self
sustaining. It takes in $34,300 in revenues and it operates on $36,656
of costs. It's almost a perfect cost revenue ratio. This bill shouldn't
be passed. It will duplicate a program which has already been paid or by
the citizens of North Carolina. It will duplicate this program. With all
the budgetary restrictions that we're going through in North Carolina,
why on earth would we duplicate a program that's going to incur costs?
And we've already asked the Wildlife Resource Commission to trim up
their budget. Why put a bill on the floor and pass it that is going to
create a cost when we're cutting their budget? It's already there. The
statute is in the book. I'll read it right quick. It is North Carolina
statute 113:274, 113, 291.4 gives the authorization, North Carolina
Administrative Code 10B 0106, it completely outlines everything in this
bill that's on the floor today is already in effect and there's people
doing that. The problem is education. We're not education the farmers
and the people in the rural and the city areas that this program does
exist. It is at no cost to these farmers. They call, they get a permit,
they can trap them themselves, the can hire somebody that's a
professional to do it. We are professionals. We go to be certified to do
so. Just let me end up and I want to, one thing about our dog friends
over here, they really want to do something about the coyote problem,
then the State of North Carolina needs to get out of the business of
selling live animals. Period. No live animals to be sold. Foxes, coons,
anything else. You get away with the live animals, you'll see a problem
starting to be served. And I'd like to see my friends from the dog lobby
over hear agree with that. Thank you.</p>

I’ve actually been sitting on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Ramsey?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, a motion at the appropriate time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Anybody else? Representative Wilkins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair, but Representative Luebke just
went down the path I was going to travel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. We’re ready Representative Ramsey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, despite the fact that I probably receive
more emails about this one matter than any other matter since I’ve been
down here in the General Assembly, opposing this, I will make a motion
for a favorable report of Senate Bill 638. Is there a referral on that,
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 639.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I apologize, 639. And…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There’s no referral.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’ve heard the motion? Any discussion on the motion?
If not, all in favor say aye. All opposed no. OK, the bill passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you members on that one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 638.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a rather lengthy bill. There’s 24 or so
sections in this bill. This bill passed unanimously in the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, this is a PCS and I need to have it…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry. It is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Daughtry moves that we have the PCS
forced. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The original bill passed 48
to nothing in the Senate.  The House has added a few things to it, and
I’ll go through those. Part 1 basically is just the title and we had a
joke in the Senate that when the reading clerk got done with reading
this title, he need the oxygen meter. So I apologize that the title is
so long, but this is a rather lengthy bill with many sections.
Part 2 basically provides that producers certified by the USDA, GAP and
GHP of a verification program, or similar programs designated by the
Commissioner of Agriculture, have rebuttable presumptions against
charges of negligence. This was added by the House, and what this
basically does is if you have met these food safety standards that you
should have some type of rebuttable case when you’re taken to court. And
it just not be automatic when your guilty, especially when you have met
these criteria of these stringent food safety guidelines that are
coming.
And with FDA coming onto the farms of cantaloupe growers and fruit and
vegetable growers in North Carolina this year, we felt like this was a
good addition to this bill.
OK, part number 3 eases the worries that petting zoos and animal
exhibited, the North Carolina State Fair, and many other carnivals and
festivals held throughout this state, can get liability insurance for
their petting zoos. Currently the way the law is written, with the
problems that they’ve had, they cannot get petting zoos. They can’t get
the liability insurance. This will give them some coverage on that. To
give them some help.
Part 4 gives the North Carolina Department of Agriculture boards,
commissions and officials, with the authority to assess civil penalties,
to assess non-monetary penalties when appropriate to address the
underlying violation. Basically what Part 4 does is of someone from the
Department of Agriculture comes out and realizes you have a violation,
this gives them the authority to help you assist to correct that
violation without forcing them to have to give you a penalty. Currently
under our general statutes they would have to fine you. This just allows
them to help you correct the mistake, and let’s move on. Then if they
caught come back I’m sure they would fine you.
Part 5 decreases the frequencies of the surveys of persons who withdraws
10,000 gallons of water per day or more. Basically what has happened in
this they’ve collected data for the last 5 or 6 years. One thing is they
have enough data through droughts, through plenty of rain that the data
is not really needed every year. But the other thing that has happened
due to sequestering and other things that are going on in DC, the USDA’s
National Agricultural Statistical Program has been moved out of North
Carolina, and into Kentucky. So we don’t have that close relationship we
had just a few years ago. So they’re asking this be done every two years
instead of every year.
Part 6 provides that no information collected by  the Department of
Agriculture for its animal health programs, including certificates of
veterinary inspections, animal medical records…</p>

...laboratory reports or other information that may identify a person or
a private business subject to regulation by the department may be
disclosed without the permission of the owner. This is sort of some of
the privacy acts that there's been some things going on and they're
getting requests all the time for different types of organizations
wanting information on veterinarians and other folks and this way, they
have to prove that they have a legitimate need. They also have to have
the owner's permission to release this information. And I think this is
a good part of this bill.
Part 7 corrects the name of the structural pest control and pesticide
division found in our Article 4E of Chapter 106 of the general statutes.
The department has brought this error to our attention. Currently our
statute reads structural pest control division. The structural pest
control division and pesticides division were merged in 2006 but the
change of the name was never updated and this will update that
throughout or general statutes.
Part 8 would allow retailers to advertise the eggs for sale in the same
manner as other products sold by the retailer, excluding sales or
promotions. This is another item that was added by the House. Basically,
what had been happening due to our general statutes, eggs, the sign for
them had to be much larger, so large that it was normally put above the
case, the dairy case and this way it will allow them to just have the
same signage like all other commodities, which to my knowledge there's
no opposition to that. They're trying to make it codified or unanimous
or whatever you would like to use there.
Part 9 repeals the interstate pest control compact to IPCC found in
Article 4 of Chapter 106 and the statutes dealing with cleanliness and
purity standards for ice cream plants, creameries and cheese factories
found in General Statute 106-246 and 248. The department has asked that
we repeal this language, not that we're all about having dirty and
unsanitary ice cream plants and so forth, but the IPCC was formed as an
interstate compact in 1968 but has not been active in recent years and
even earlier this year the IPC closed to dissolve because of an issue
with their tax exempt status. The department notified us that the North
Carolina Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of General Statute 106, 129, has
rendered these older statutes obsolete. The North Carolina Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act prohibit adulterated food from being entered into
commerce so basically we're just trying to clean up some more rules.
Part 10 will conform set backs and burn times for debris, stumps, brush
or other flammable materials resulting from ground clearing activities
to current statutes. In 2011, House Bill 119 became Session Law 2011-394
and changed the set back distance and burn times or debris, stumps,
brush or other flammable materials resulting from ground clearing
activities and we are just updating the statutes and the department has
notified us that these changes were not property updated and this will
just permanently update it to what they were supposed to be.
Part 11 repeals the sulfur content standards in gasoline found in
General Statute 119-26.2. The department has asked that we repeal this
section because it was adopted prior the EPA standards for sulfur
content in gasoline. In other words, the EPA is now regulating it and so
this standard is obsolete and this standard set by General Statute
119-26.2 is actually the same as the EPA standard.
Part 12 exempts foresty and several cultural operations from the
department of transportation's temporary driveway permit process for
State roads except for controlled access facilities if the temporary
driveway operator has completed an educational course in timbering
access and obtained a safety certification. This is another item that
was added by the House. The North Carolina Foresty Service notified us
of inconsistencies throughout the State for loggers building temporary
driveways to transport the timber off the site. Basically, what was
happening it appeared that we had 100 different rules and regulations
scattered throughout our State because one county didn't regulate at all
while the other one might over regulated in some degree. So this is
trying to codify it. And also, we worked with DOT on this language and
to my knowledge they are comfortable with this and currently the North
Carolina Forestry Association runs an educational course that is an
annual requirement and has been successful throughout the logging
industry.
Part 13 exempts migrant housing from requirements for installation of
automatic sprinkler system if the building meets certain requirements.
And those requirements would be they have to be one floor...</p>

Part 18 directs the Department of, directs ?? and the Department of
Transportation to jointly petition the United States Corp of Engineers
to allow for greater flexibility and opportunity to perform wetlands
mitigation outside of the watershed where development  occurs.  This
vote was voted on by the Senate and passed.  It allows ?? and DOT to
report back to the, to petition the Corp of Engineers to the
Environmental Review Commission no later than January 21, 2014.  Part 19
accelerates the sunset date of the patrol unit displacement plan to the
effective date of this site.  This was added by the House.  The patrol
unit displacement plan requires off state agencies, universities and
community colleges that have state-owned vehicle fleets to develop and
implement plans to produce the amount of petroleum consumed, the amount
of petroleum products consumed to 20%.  This statue has been amended
twice since its inception in 2005, in general statue 2009451 and
2011145.  It is our understanding that the state has achieved a 19.92%
reduction in petroleum use compared to the original baseline in 2005 and
at this point it takes more resources to create the report and perform
the functions than it is worth.  So in other words, it costs more to get
that other eight-tenth of a percent than it would be worth to get.  And
Mr. Chairman with that I'll stop and entertain any questions.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator we're not supposed to take a vote in the last 10
minutes of the meeting and we all got a session at 2 o'clock. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So, what I think would be appropriate is, now that he's
presented it, is that we'll have a call meeting to take the rest of it
up later in the week.  And were you can have your questions answered and
that kind of stuff.  And I think that would be an appropriate thing to
do.  And give everybody time to actually look at it carefully and do
that.  And we want to move the bill pretty quick but what you do is
watch your emails and we will call a meeting to take up nothing but
this, and to vote on it.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sounds fine.  Thank you all
very much.  Appreciate it.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  That's what we
get for taking up coyotes, right?</p>
