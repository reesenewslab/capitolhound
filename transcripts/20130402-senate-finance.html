Good afternoon and welcome. We're going to hear one bill today for
discussion only. Before we get into that, I will recognize our pages and
sergeant at arms staff. Our pages are Courtney Baptiste, Chapel Hill
Senator ?? Welcome. ?? Senator Bruntstetter. Alec Harvin Gastonia
Senator Harrington. Hailey Ashley, Burlington, Senator Gunn. ??
Burlington, Senator Gunn. Sergeant at arms staff Anderson Meadows,
Justin Owens, Steve Wilson, and Ed Kessler. Now that we have that out of
the way, we're going to discuss increased funding for dredging today.
Senator Brown. And I understand we have a PCS.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] We do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion to hear the PCS by Senator Wade. All those in
favor say aye. Opposed. Motion carried. Senator Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. It's always good to have a bill that everybody
likes, you know? [LAUGHTER] First I think we need to start with a little
history.  For many years, the federal government pretty much took care
and paid for most of the dredging that took place on the coast of North
Carolina. Well in the past few years, with some of their budget problems
in Washington, dredging dollars for the coast have pretty much gone
away, except for the two ports that the federal dollars continue to help
keep dredged. But all the other shallow draft inlets across the state of
North Carolina, those dollars have pretty much gone away. And I don't
think I have to tell anyone that the coast of North Carolina is pretty
unique compared to most other coasts. We have probably more, I think we
do have more shallow draft inlets than any other state in the nation.
And of course, what they mean to the economy on the coast, if you live
on the coast, I think you truly understand that because here in about a
month or so, if you'll get on Interstate 40 on a Friday afternoon, and
see all the traffic that's heading toward the coast, I think you'll
understand exactly what I'm talking about. And probably about of all
those vehicles, probably a fourth of them have a boat tied to the back
of it. And they're heading to the coast to take advantage of the waters
there on the coast, and do a lot of fishing or water skiing or whatever
it may be. Well, with those federal dollars drying up on the coast to
keep these inlets dredged, what that means over time, and there are
several inlets that are pretty close to this point now, those inlets
start to fill in. And when they start to fill in, what you'll find is
the Coast Guard will start to pull buoys that mark these channels. I
know in ?? it's my understanding the outside channel in ?? was recently
pulled if I'm not mistaken. So as you pull these buoys, then all of a
sudden if you want a dangerous situation, try to go through an inlet
that's not marked, or shallow, and I tell you, you won't put yourself in
a more dangerous situation than being in that inlet. A lot of people
get, have boats turn over and drown in inlets than any other place on
the water. So that'll tell you how important it is to have these inlets
marked and dredged and taken care of. With those dollars going away, I
felt like we had to find a revenue source to take care of these inlets.
I've had a lot of emails just like I'm sure you have, talking about how
these fee increases aren't fair, and that you know, why should if I
don't live on the coast why should I be paying for projects on the
coast, and I think we've all heard them. I would argue that those waters
are everybody's waters. And again, if you get on Interstate 40 in the
summer, you'll see how many boats are headed to the coast to take
advantage of it. And it's a lot, I can assure you. And what they don't
tell you when they send you those emails is that a lot of this money is
being used throughout the state for boat access in all the lakes and
rivers throughout the state of North Carolina. Well that stays in place.
The bill states that 50% of those dollars will remain in place to do
just that. Continue to take your boat access in other lakes and rivers
throughout the state, while the other 50% will go toward dredging. So
all the state will benefit from these dollars. Now it's not hurting any
part of the state. It's just helping the coast with an issue that I
think</p>

<p id="05:00">
It's important to the economy on the coast, what it means for tourism
dollars on the coast, and I think what it means for safety on the coast.
The other issue that everybody is, seem to want to talk about is that
the recreational fishing industry is gonna pay more than the commercial
guys. Well, the PCS takes care of that. When I recently drafted the
bill, I didnâ€™t realize it was in a different statute. We didn't take
care of it, but the PCS does take care of it. Where commercial vessels
will pay the same thing as a recreational boat if they register their
boat in North Carolina. What I tried to do is come up with a revenue
source that would generate somewhere in that 6 million dollar range to
dredge the inlets of North Carolina. And I know Tom Reader's here today,
and I think Tom probably can tell you more about dredging than anybody
else can, but that's probably a minimum that we're gonna need to
probably take care of this issue. And I looked at all kinds of revenue
sources to try to figure out how to pay for this and I couldn't figure
out a better way to do it than the way that I drafted this bill. A lot
of people have talked about taking it out of highway trust fund or out
of transportation, and I don't think I've got to tell anybody here that
those dollars are scarce as it is. We're what, we're about 70, 80
billion dollars short of dollars we need to take care of our roads, so I
don't know that that's the place to go get the money. So it almost has
to be a user fee to find the money needed to take care of these dredging
issues in the state. I can go over the fee structure. I think ya'll have
all read it. What it does basically is for a 14 foot boat or less, it
doesn't change, it's still $15 which is in place today. It does take
care of the piece where if you buy three years in advance, you used to
get a five dollar break. That takes that break away. I think being able
to buy three years in advance is a break in my opinion, so you can go
ahead and can get three years of registrations out of the way at one
time for a $45 fee if you have a 14 foot or less. If you have a 15
footer to 19 footer that fee goes to $25 a year, or $75 for three years.
I think that's a pretty reasonable fee. That's $10 more a year basically
for a boat to be registered if it's under 20 feet. For a 20 footer to a
26 footer, it goes to $50 a year, and then from a 27 footer to a 40
footer it's $100 a year, and then for a 40 footer and above, it's $150 a
year. And the reason I've scaled it that way is I feel the bigger the
boat, the more you're probably gonna use an inlet. And it becomes more
of a user fee. Again I can't stress that it seems to me like this has
become why do I take care of the coast issue. Well, I guess we could
say, well why should people on the coast pay for something that may be
good for the mountains or another part of the state? I mean we could
argue that up here every single day if you want to, and I think there's
not a person in this room that can't think of a project that may be in a
different section of the state that everybody pays for across the state
that benefits that particular area in the state. That happens every day.
So I just think that's a poor argument, personally. Plus I think the
coast is a place that everybody takes advantage of. Again, if you're
down there, probably starting in a few weeks until the end of August, I
don't think I have to tell you how many people go to the coast to take
advantage of the activities that are there, and a lot of those are
boating activities and they're important to those people that do come to
the coast. One other thing, if these inlets do close up, I can't tell
you what it would probably cost the taxpayer in a different way. Because
I can tell you, if those dollars go away on the coast, somebody's gonna
find a different way to find those revenues, and those tourism dollars
will go away if these inlets close up. So it is important to the coast
and it will cost the state in a different way in my opinion. Again, just
looking at the bill, you see what it does, still half the money goes to
the rest, to all of the state as far as vote access goes. About half the
money will go to dredging. It all</p>

So it increases the title fee from 20 dollars to 30 dollars. That fee
hadn't been increased in about 30 years I think. I think I've pretty
much touched the bill and I'll sure try to answer any questions but
that's pretty much what the bill does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Senator Brown. Questions from the committee? Senator Cook. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you for bringing this bill. You draw attention to an
issue that's surely, surely needs this. Those inlets are critical to, I
believe, the whole state. If you don't have those inlets it turns the
bay into one big swamp with polluted water. Your goal is admirable. The
problem that a lot of folks have with the bill as it stands now, at
least the emails I get, is that the fees are too high. And I, like you,
looked in. I had some calculations made. Different revenue sources. I
can't find anything either. Although maybe some general funder
propitiation wherein you don't hit somebody pretty hard. So I don't know
if there is it, and maybe somebody here hopefully has a better answer
but so far I haven't been able to find one. However, here's my best shot
at it.  I don't know if you've considered this, you probably have. What
if you did, instead of hitting them all at one time, say phased in this
increase so that folks who are so upset about the high increases and
some of the increases percentage-wise are very high. We're looking at
1000 percent or more. People ?? log those percentages left and right.
It's still not a lot of money, but the percentages sound big. So, all
that to say, I would propose and ask you if you'd considered phasing in
these increases so that maybe Year 1 you get maybe a quarter of the
increase and Year 2 you get another quarter and so forth or something,
so that people aren't hit a big increase at one time. Just a thought.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook, I appreciate that. One other thing I
probably ought to mention real quick too that I didn't mention is also
these dollars are dollar for dollar match dollars. So the communities on
the coast are going to have to match these dollars to get the money. So
a community on the coast that needs these ?? dollars are going to have
to come up with like money in their communities as well. So there's
going to be some ?? game for people on the coast as far as finding those
dollars. Senator Cook I understand what you're saying as far as that
goes but from 15 dollars to 25 dollars if you want to put that as a
percent increase I guess you can say that's a pretty big percent
increase. But I look at it as a 10 dollar increase. If we want to talk
about percent increases let's look at what happened at ?? insurance on
the coast. When you look at a 19% increase based on a 2500 dollar
premium compared to a 5% increase based on a 500 dollar premium, who's
paying the most? You know, the coast is getting hammered on that and you
don't know what percentages mean when we talk about that. In my opinion
I think the percentages are being skewed because of the dollar amount.
If we were talking about large amounts of dollars then I think
percentages could come into play but to me we're not asking a lot, I
think, for a user. If you've got a 20 footer to a 27 footer and it's a
50 dollar a year increase you can't put 10 dollars worth of gas in that
boat for that. And I ain't going to tell you what those boats will take
and yet that's the very person that wants to use that inlet going in and
out of it every single weekend to fish. It just, to me, it's a poor
argument in my opinion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Brown.
Senator Hise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. First question I
have is kind of looking at this by boat size and not having much
experience in boats coming forward. Can you tell me, what for example,
you would say and average bass boat or those types of things to used in
lakes and others - what kind of size is it looking toward compared to a
size of a boat that would typically do on inlets. Are those the same or
are they different? Those types of things. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I know Dick
Hamilton is here. He might answer this better than I can or someone from
wildlife can. I'd say your average bass boat is a 20 footer or less. 18
to 20 feet. It's going to be a typical bass boat probably. I think
that's gonna be pretty close. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] A follow up question I have, and this probably has more to do
with the</p>

<p id="15:00">
fiscal memo thatâ€™s attached to the bill, but the bill has an effective
date of July 1st 2013. What is the assumptions in this as to if you put
a July 1st hard date say mid-June, whatâ€™s your expectation for how many
boat owners in the state of North Carolina are going to go purchase the
three-year permit under the old and make it to where itâ€™s three years
out kind of before they move, as compared to making it when effective?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s going to happen, but most people, to
be honest, itâ€™s kind of like yourâ€¦ Do you get your car inspected, and
until itâ€™s expired, you donâ€™t realize itâ€™s time? I think thatâ€™s the case
for most people in this situation, but youâ€™re always going to have some
who would take advantage of it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Ron
Rabin. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I think you said, if Iâ€™m not
mistaken, that the ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I know the titling fee; itâ€™s
been a long time. Jeff might can answer this better. As far as the
registration fees, itâ€™s also been a while, but I canâ€™t remember that
exact date. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If itâ€™s been any significant time at all,
itâ€™s not really an increase because youâ€™re talking ?? dollars instead of
?? dollars, and if you crank in inflation and what it costs now, itâ€™s
kind of a wash I bet you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Rabin.
Senator Tillman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Chairman, thank you. Senator Brown,
Iâ€™m looking at the fiscal note here, and I noticed you mentioned this
would net about 6 million dollars for the dredging that we need in a
fund, and you and I know that we do a complete job now â€“ we need 30
million or more, but this is a good start. I see itâ€™s going to bring in
12.9 million in a couple of years, 10 million in the current 13-14 year.
When you say that itâ€™s going to net us 6 million or so, are you
deducting the temporary positions or the positions which are to be
hired, or where are we getting 6 million? I see 10 million right away,
soâ€¦ [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, only half of that money can be
used toward dredging. Thatâ€™s how much the fee increase will generate, or
how much it will create total in the pot. Half of that still goes to
boat access across the state. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I got you. I got you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniel. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Senator Brown, I just wanted to clarify; does this still
maintain the exemption for non-motorized boats thatâ€™s in current law, as
far as registration fees? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I know there is an issue on
the sail boat, and I may ask â€“ [SPEAKER CHANGES] Iâ€™m just meaning kayaks
and canoes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, it does on kayaks and canoes. Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Senator Allran. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, I am really familiar with your issue, the need for the
dredging and all that on the coast, having been a landowner there for
many year and a great appreciator of the coast, even though Iâ€™m from the
foothills in the west, but I have gotten lots and lots of people very
opposed to this from around the area where I live, and their contention
is their boats are not going to go off of the lakes where we live to the
coast, and I believe that. If youâ€™ve got a boat on Lake Norman or Lake
Hickory, you will not be driving it down I-40 to get out there. My
question is, why donâ€™t we have a fee, and maybe a bigger fee, on boats
when the votes are registered in the counties that are affected, as
opposed to the counties way out in the west which quite frankly are
irrelevant to all of this? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Allran, I think the
best way I could answer that is if Iâ€™m not mistaken, I think federal
dollars help with the Blue Ridge Parkway, and if those federal dollars
went away, should I on the coast help pay to keep the Blue Ridge Parkway
up, through any kind of dollars? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well our tax dollars
keep up the state parks at Fort Macon and Fort Fisher and all the other
parks down east, so we already do all that, but this is a different
thing. This is putting a tax on boats that do not go out of a geographic
area. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And Iâ€™d argue that Blue Ridge Parkwayâ€™s not on
the coast, and if that was a situation that could happen, and that could
happen, the way federal dollars are being cut, and my argument would be
that still half of these dollars would go toward boat access for those
very lakes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But Fort Fisher and Fort Macon donâ€™t go to
the mountains either but we pay to keep those up, so the state parks
issue to me doesnâ€™t cut it because thereâ€™s state parks everywhere and
federal parks everywhere.</p>

<p id="20:00">
Wherein everybody shares that burden. We're talking about boats that
move.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm talking about a parkway that a park's not on. If you wanna compare
what could happen. I'm talking, it's the same thing. We could talk about
the beltway around Raleigh. It doesn't benefit me necessarily from the
coast, but my tax dollars help pay for it. There's a lot of things
across the state that things don't pay for that benefit the coast.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me ask you again. Why are you not putting the tax on the boats of
the people who live in the counties that are affected as opposed to
putting the tax on the boats of the people who live in the counties that
are not affected?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Allran, several boats, all the boats on the coast, pretty much,
will be taxed, or increased on this fee like anybody else. But for you
to say that someone from Catawba County doesn't come to the coast and
use those inlets, I think's wrong. That's not ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I didn't say that. I just told you I do do that. But I don't take my
boat from Lake Hickory out there, and neither does anybody else.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But I think you do use them. That's the point, I think.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Sanderson, excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I don't think anybody in this room will argue
the spirit of this bill, and, or argue against how important our shallow
draft inlets are. In fact, it's incalculable. I don't think we can even
put a price tag on what it brings in to not only Eastern North Carolina
but also to the coffers of this state, because when tourist money is
spent, when tourist dollars are spent, a lot of that money finds its way
back. I've had conversations with probably a dozen marine operators in
my district. There's a lot of folks in our state right now that find
themselves, for lack of a better phrase, boat poor. They've got more
boat then they would really like to have, but they're stuck with it. And
I say that to say this, a lot of our marine operators, and this is just
for food for thought, a lot of our marine operators are having a very,
very difficult time now just collecting dock rental, and if we go and on
a 35 foot sailboat, 35 foot motorboat, put for three years, a $450, from
$45 to $450, a lot of these marinas don't know how the people are gonna
make them. And I know that it doesn't seem like a whole lot of money on
its face, but when people are already stretched to such a limit as they
are now, it can be a lot of money. And so that's a concern of a lot of
the people that service the boats. Another concern is that a lot of my
folks think that they already pay money to keep our waterways open. It's
been estimated that a minimum of 1% of the fuel that's used in the state
of North Carolina is used in marine vessels, but out of that 1%, and
that's the minimum amount, only 1/6th of 1% of the taxes that we pay in
gas, for gas taxes, go to keeping our waterways. Folks feel like that if
taxes are used, gas taxes are used to maintain our highways, then if we
can estimate how much gas taxes are used for our waterways, that more of
that money needs to go to help our waterways. Another thing that a lot
of folks are concerned about is that when people buy boats, sales tax on
boats, not any of it goes towards helping maintain the waterways. It all
goes to the general funds. And so there's a lot of folks that feel like
they're already paying this money. And then on top of that when you put
local property taxes on it, and I'll be the first to admit that the
counties don't chip in, under this they might have to chip in some, but
as it is of today, they don't chip in anything to help these people
utilize what they're paying these tax on, to be able to utilize. And so
I just, in the interim before we come back, and I think we're gonna have
another coastal committee meeting, talk about this too, if we can take a
look at some of those other avenues to lessen the impact. A five dollar,
a ten dollar, you know I think people might be able to swallow a whole
lot better, but this is a huge increase.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Sanderson, I understand exactly where you're going because I
looked at those revenue sources, and this committee would like to
support taking some of those dollars from transportation dollars, I'm
all for that. I'll go for that right now. I just feel like that's a
tough sale and, but I'm surely open to that and if somebody would like
to figure out those dollars and run an amendment to do that, I'm surely
open to that. Again</p>

and I just can't tell you the pressure I think they're on transportation
dollars.  I just I had a concern there before going that route. And so
you know I tried to make this as simple as I could. I tried to make it
pretty much a user fee to a point and that's kind of why I got where I'm
at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Brown. Senator Rucho you have a
comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown I know this is not an immediate solution
but if you remember our energy billl with we passed on. Unfortunately it
got vetoed. But there was money set aside for the counties on the coast
to utilize some of the royalty money that we had set aside specifically
for their use in dredging so. At some piont there will be some money if
we can ever convince them to let us get offshore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll just respond real quick. Senator Rucho I agree
with that. The issue we've got to handle today that I think is so
important is this is an immediate problem. It's not a problem that we
can wait two or three years to fix. I'm telling you this problem is a
serious serious problem on the coast today. And everyday goes by it gets
worse. And I don't know how to express that anymore than I'm trying to
do that now, but if we don't find a fix this session what I'm afraid
will happen and I feel pretty confident of this I'd love for Tom maybe
to stand up and talk about this if he would. I'm convinced if you put
this off another year or two you're gonna to have some inlets show up
and pretty much have the buoys pulled. And you're gonna have a serious
problem with that. Mr. Chairman I'd ask for Tom maybe to speak on that.
I think he's very familiar with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes indeed. If you would please have, Tom if you'll
identify yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir I'm Tom Reeder. I'm the Director of North
Carollina Juditional Water Resources and we're the state sponsor for
Shallow Draft Inlet Drenching. What Senator Brown says is pretty much
absolutely correct. We have about $2 million dollars left in carry
forward money right now that we can use to keep inlets open probably
through the end of this summer maybe the remainder of this calendar year
but after that we're completely out of money. The feds are not gonna
give us another cent for shallowdraft inlet dredging in North Carolina.
They've made that abundantly clear. So what's gonna happen is the next
time a storm comes through those inlets are gonna close. I mean they
really can close just based on one powerful storm. So those inlets close
a lot of charter fisherman lose their business because people don't want
to drive the 60 minutes, or go travel in a boat the extra 60 or 40
minutes to get out to the ocean. It's really a pretty big catastrophy
down there when this infrastructure we lose this infrastructure on the
coast that we're so happily dependent upon. If we don't have a funding
source by I would say certainly next spring we'd start losing this
infrastructure for sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Reeder. Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Senator Brown I know how
passionate you are about this. You've talked to me about it on many
occasions. I buy a hunting license every year but I don't hunt on
Senator Walter's land down east. I hunt in one area. He won't let me. He
won't let me. He says he doesn't allow republicans, he doesn't allow
republicans on his land. I too, I too am boat poor. I took a 22 year old
boat hunting a number of years ago and I still have that boat. I think
I've seen it.  I haven't seen it in two years but I still own a boat.
I'm gonna still have to pay its fee. Senator Allran is never gonna see
saltwater ever, but I tell you I spent enough time down on the coast
growing up and living in Eastern North Carolina that if these inlets
close we've got a real mess. And you know Harris come to the table and
said yeah state but you gotta put up some money, but local communities
you are too. So I know you've worked very hard trying to figure out a
way to not charge folks more but I mean it's just the sign of times.
We've gotta do something about this. Those people with the sailboats and
the marina and renting those boats they can't go up. Those inlets can't
run up and down the coast like they want to then they'e not gonna be
renting any boats ??. I understand where all of y'all come from. It's a
hard call and Harry struggled with this time and time again but you
know, I'm just, you know, the western end of the state I'm gonna have to
support you on this one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Senator Woodard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just want to followup to
Senator Daniels question. He was interested in canoeing some kayakes.
Did we get an answer about sailboats?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jeff I'm a ask you if you would on the sailboat side
to make sure I get it right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly and if you look at the PCS</p>

On page four it happens to have the exemptions from the numbering
requirements that statute we had to pull in, it was one of the things
that the bill does. Thereâ€™s currently an exemption if you document your
vessel under federal law, you donâ€™t have to pay the fee. We removed that
exemption to create and generate a little more money. If you look at the
last two subdivisions of that exemption section on lines 26 and 27. That
gets your sailboats that are below a certain number of feet in length
and it also gets your canoes and your kayaks. Basically, your paddle
vessels. Those exemptions still remain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Senator Sanderson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. On just a slightly different tangent, Senator
Brown. Itâ€™s my understanding that the Corps of Engineers who really
facilitate this shell draft inland dredging, only has one dredge that is
still able to do that. Itâ€™s my understanding that theyâ€™re thinking about
mothballing that one. That there is currently no, because of the
permitting required and because of the way they have to be dredged,
there is currently no private industry anywhere in the southeast that
even does this kind of dredging. How are we going to get this done if
the Corps of Engineers gets rid of the dredge and the state canâ€™t get
the permits to even run one like it? How are we going to dredge, get
this dredging done?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Sanderson, thatâ€™s a good question. There is a bill that is being
worked on to address that very issue. Weâ€™re trying to figure out a way
that  we can work through the Corps to get permitting done in a
different way where private entities can do some of this dredging. We
think it will save the state some dollars long term. Weâ€™re working on
that bill as we work on this one as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Senator Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, one of the questions I just had, and I donâ€™t really have the
information to ask it. Looking at these registrations, kind of across
the state. Would you be open to something that looks at designating more
of the percentage to those in coastal counties to this project? Versus
so that we have individuals who are like James or others who can know
that their funds are being designated towards activities they use which
are in the coastal areas. I would suspect that a vast majority of these
registrations are occurring in the coastal areas. For those, and it may
be an easier way to break that down and get around saying whose paying
for what. Itâ€™s just a thought I had. I guess my overall question is, can
we get a breakdown of these registration numbers by county and see how
that wouldâ€¦?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, my answer to that would be,.. I would argue at this point
that the rest of the state has probably been at an advantage on the way
these dollars have been allocated for a long time. Because of the lakes
and the rivers where boat access has been taking place, I would say the
coast has probably not gotten its fair share for a long time. Nobody
complained about that. The way the bill is drafted, theyâ€™ll continue to
get 50% of these dollars. Weâ€™ll continue to look at boat access all
across the state. I think if you start carving out who wins, who loses
on this a little bit, I think you muddy the bill up. Again, I think you
can argue that for all kinds of projects across the state. I just donâ€™t
think thatâ€™s aâ€¦I just donâ€™t think thatâ€™s they way we should go on this
particular bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Brown. Senator Blue?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question, Senator Brown, if I could. As I understand it, the 50% to the
wildlife resources commission is an increase over what they use
currently for these statewide projects. Access, safety, and all of those
other issues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Iâ€™m not sure of the exact percent. Jeff, you may help me on that. I
think thatâ€™s pretty close, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But, it is an increase on the funds available for that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me just say this, Mr. Chairman, because I think that Senator Brown
raises an issue that all of us need to think about. Sometimes a little
more seriously than we do. That is we are one state regardless of
whether we live in these three sections we learned when we were growing
up and going to school in this state. Whether youâ€™re in the pedmont, the
coastal plains, or the mountains. The thing that makes this state what
it is that we sort of throw away these regional labels when itâ€™s for the
good of the entire state. Thatâ€™s the way I see a lot of the issues
facing the coast. If this issue is as critical as Senator Brown
indicates, then we all ought to be willing to fix it.</p>

And do whatever is necessary to fix it, whether it's increasing these
fees or simply increasing the funds available from the general fund
assembly, but clearly we have a responsibility to the entire state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Blue. I think this committee has pulled along this
wagon of hay long enough, so we will, I'll accept, Senator Walters,
would this have any effect on how you register your boat? I haven't
heard from you. Oh. Thank you. Thank you for clearing that up, Senator
Jenkins. Now, having, having heard that we will ask of there are any
members of the public that would like to weigh in. And if you would
approach the podium please, turn the mic on, state your name, and if you
would please limit your comments to two minutes, and germane to the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Jim Horton. I work with Grady-White Boats in Greenville,
North Carolina. We understand and agree with the boaters and boat
manufacturers and builders that we need safe inlets. I do think there
are, it's a, it is a good large increase that boaters in general. And on
one side they want to support it, on the other side they just think it's
just a huge increase, and there may be some other avenues. I know
there's been discussion about road use taxes paid by boaters for
gasoline. There's also ?? taxes paid by diesel powered vessels. I think
that's an avenue that could be explored. Maybe there's a marine to
diesel fuel tax of a penny or two per gallon for diesel fuel pumped in
marinas. I think there's other ways to try to get a little, little piece
of money here and there and make this a little bit of a lower increase
on boater registration fees alone. And I've been talking to boats US,
which has 11,000 members in the state of North Carolina. They think the
fee increase is too large, and they'd like to see, I think I can speak
for them and say they'd like to see a little more creative looking
around for other opportunities, and I would like to see the road use tax
be dedicated that are paid by boaters in the gas stations, trailer-able
boats are generally filled up at gas stations, I'd like to see more of
that come back. The sportsmen, the anglers and the sportsmen of the
country are used to a user pay, user benefit, and I think boaters are
used to that too and are willing to do their share. But I think we need
to look carefully at long term solutions that don't just throw a huge
increase on boating registration fees and make our boats almost, or more
expensive than any of the surrounding states. I think maybe Florida may
be the only one that's not, that would still be more expensive than
North Carolina if this change occurs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Anyone else? Yes ma'am, who, please tell us all who you
are?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Connie. Hey there. My name is Connie Wilson. I'm the lobbyist
for the North Carolina, the Topsail Shoreline Protection Commission, and
I just want to thank the committee for this hearing today. This bill
that Senator Brown has brought forth is critical for our small island.
We're comprised of three little towns. You've got Topsail beach, and
some of you may have been there. We've got Surf City, and then we've got
North Topsail. They just have a few hundred citizens in each one of
these small towns, yet they have this inlets that require dredging,
sometimes every year. And that is extremely expensive. We've had help in
the past from federal monies, where we also got state matching at 75%.
What Senator Brown is doing here is much less then even we've gotten in
the past. We're just talking here about a 50/50 match. For us, these
inlets are like our roads. We appreciate the committee's kind
consideration for these small towns along the coast that, because of
where they're located, they have a very unusual asset that they have to
maintain to keep their economy going. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Ms. Wilson. Anyone else from the public. Okay, well then,
Senator Meredith.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, and Senator Brown, thank you for bringing
this forward and I might need to talk to you offline on this. I'm
curious, and like I said, we might be able to talk, how the funds would
be administered, who would decide what channel gets dredged, and then
for the small towns, just like she brought up, a few hundred residents,
I. If  it's matching dollars that might be something we need to talk
about. I'd be very interested in how this would be administered as this
bill moves forward. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Thank you. Members of the committee, staff, sergeant in arms, et
cetera. Pages, thank you all, this concludes our discussion today.
Tomorrow, we will be discussing Senate bill 394. It will be discussion
only. That is Senator Clodfelter's bill. Thank you all, meeting
adjourned.</p>
