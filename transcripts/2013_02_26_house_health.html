[Speaker changes.]...healthcare, Journalists' Association...Association
of Healthcare Journalists, showing that that 75% stat is a relative
number but it doesn't show you that the absolute risk...those studies
show that the melanoma risk amongst people who have ever used a sunbed
is three in one thousand...that amongst people who have never used a
sunbed was two in one thousand and that included the European model of
home unit usage and medical usage. The difference was only one in one
thousand. And, as Dr. Ivan ???????? points out, that is an issue.  I
sent you material from Dr. Arthur E. Rhodes???????, a melanoma
researcher from ????????? University Medical Center in Chicago who wrote
about melanoma's public message...some public education messages that
we've endorsed may actually be doing more harm than good. The three
messages most in need of re-thinking are: sun exposure is the major
cause of melanoma, you can recognize a worrisome mole with the ABCD and
that the incidence of melanoma is rising rapidly and that we have an
epidemic crisis on our hands. What Rhodes points out is that he has
colleagues who are doctors, whose wives were doctors, who never went
outdoors in the sun...had lesions on their backs, who died of melanoma
thinking that melanoma was only sun-related and, since they didn't tan,
that they couldn't possibly be at risk. He's saying that we need to
educate people on sunburn prevention, that the major risk factors
recognized for melanoma are number of moles on your body, red hair,
heredity are the biggest risk factors, independent of sun exposure and
that sunburn prevention ought to be taught. I sent you material showing
that the National Cancer Institute shows that in 1975, the incidence of
melanoma in older men and in women under the age of 50 was virtually
identical but it has increased five fold, according to the National
Cancer Institute's data since 1975 but it has not increased in that
commensurate fashion amongst women and that the mortality rates in
females have actually declined since the advent of tanning....I'm not
saying tanning caused the decline in melanoma rates but it has not
increased.  It is not a slam-dunk figure and that the melanoma rates
from the National Cancer Institute for young women are about .5 per
100,000 and haven't changed in the last decade.  I also sent you
material that the most recent study, done in England, peer reviewed
data...a relationship between sunbed use and melanoma risk in a large
case control study in the United Kingdom, says quote...&quot;In our case
control study, we found sun exposure measure most associated with risk
was a protective effect of regular weekend exposure.&quot;
[Speaker changes.] Mr. Levy???????
[Speaker changes.] Yes.
[Speaker changes.] I'll give you an additional thirty seconds to wrap
up.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you very much.  In...to wrap it up...we're here
to engage in a higher level of discussion in four minutes or less. My
industry admits that there is risk to overexposure and teaches a
balanced message of maximizing the benefits and minimizing the risks.
It's a slippery slope and when you start legislating behavior and
morality, believing that there is no debate in the science when clearly
there is. I am happy to answer any of your questions.  Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mr. Levy. Next, we'll have...we will have
questions later but I'm gonna proceed at this time with our speakers.
We'll have five minutes now on the &quot;for side&quot;.  The speaker
for this will be Dr. Kelly Nelson.  Dr. Nelson, the floor is yours.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you.  I appreciate the invitation to you again.
I'll speak for four minutes and then the remainder of our party will
speak for one minute.  As you recall, my name is Kelly Nelson. I'm a
dermatologist at Duke University where I direct a program that provides
care for patients who have personally had melanoma or who are at high
risk of getting melanoma.  Now you're aware the wide variety of health
organizations, both here in North Carolina and nationally...indeed
internationally ...support a prohibition on the use of tanning beds by
minors.  The American Academy of Dermatology and the American Cancer
Society wade into public policy debates like this only after an
exhaustive review of the literature and after there is consensus about
the meaning of that data.  You've received communication from the Child
Fatality Task Force about it's exhaustive review of the science
connecting indoor tanning to skin cancer.  You've also received a
detailed response letter from my physician colleagues and myself
responding to the unrepresentative scientific information that the
tanning industry has used to try to confuse the issues about this bill.
I won't review that letter in great detail during my limited time but I
want to highlight three key points.  First, we reached out to Dr.
Rhodes??????, the dermatologist at Chicago???????? University, whose
past statements Mr. Levy just reviewed with you.  He was very upset to
learn of how his views were being misrepresented and said that he, like
many other dermatologists, supports legislation to prohibit teens from
using tanning beds.  Second, it's important to understand the data is
overwhelming that even minimal use of tanning beds, particularly by
children, significantly increases the odds of getting skin canc.....</p>

the economy and due to the 10% tax that was put on tanning beds as part
as that healthcare bill there's plenty of beds on the market. This will
create an underground industry and, as I've demonstrated to you, the
major risk factor is un-monitored usage of sunbeds and medical usage of
sunbeds as the biggest contributing risk factors for melanoma. You're
going to drive this underground and create that unintended consequence.
We've done surveys, we did a survey through international communications
research that showed that 75% of teens would elect to tan more
aggressively outdoors or would use home units if this type of
legislation were passed. So you're creating another problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and a follow-up with Dr. Nelson. please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Dr. Nelson please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll just say that there's nothing to currently prohibit that from
happening now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, Dr. Nelson, I haven't asked my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's different.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila is recognized for the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you use photo therapy in any of your dermatological practice
treatments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My sole practice is to take care of patients with melanoma and skin
cancer, so not in my personal practice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you know dermatologists who do and could you, as a dermatologist I'm
sure you understand what that means when they do that, could you explain
a little bit about it and why they use it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's used for the treatment of severe inflammatory skin conditions, such
as generalized psoriasis. However, I will say that is certainly
first-line therapy for treatment of young patients, under the age of 18,
even with severe skin conditions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, if I could close with a comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We've come today with dueling research studies. One I have come across
recently is a Norwegian researcher by the name of Johan Moan. He's a
cancer researcher and back in 2008 he was surprised to find that cancer
patients diagnosed in summer live longer than those diagnosed in winter.
And this vital clue convinced him that vitamin D from summer sun was one
of the best treatments a cancer patient can get and it led him to
question the conventional wisdom on dangers of sunlight. In 2011 his
group released a meta-analysis of a myriad of studies on skin cancer and
suntanning and come to find out, and I quote directly from it, &quot;Sun
exposure is commonly supposed to be the main cause cutaneous malignant
melanoma in most populations. However, the matter is disputed.&quot;
Like a lot of other issues that are based on science, and someone quoted
me the other day that, as a scientist, I find it hard to come down on
one side or the other when there is still a question about the validity
of the absolute. Thousands of children are injured and killed every year
in automobile accidents, are we going to ban them from riding in
automobiles? Hundreds die every year from swimming pool accidents, are
we going to ban their participation in pool activities? The same thing
is true with sun tanning. We can ban, by law, their use of a suntan bed
but you and I both know that we're not going to ban, by practice, their
use of suntan beds. And it needs to be in a controlled environment with
supervision, which I feel belongs in the parents' hands. And it works.
Last week, interestingly enough, there was an article in the News &amp;
Observer and in the interviewers talked with a mother and her daughter,
who were in a suntanning bed, for her to get her mothers permission to
suntan. So the law, as we currently have it, works. For years
dermatologists who use photo therapy for medical treatment practice,
back in the early 90's it was something like 800,000 sessions a year.
Their Hippocratic Oath is do no harm, so I'm assuming that they
understood what they were doing and used it in a manner and in a way
that would not present harm and I think we can do that for our citizens
of the state with a law that we currently have, prohibiting, under the
age of 14, and with permission of parents under the age of 18 to 14. And
what I'll do is leave you</p>

…It was passed in 2004 when the State General Assembly recognized that
most tanning lines provide without significant amount of UVA, UVB
radiations both types which are found in the outdoors and ___[00:12]
various types of damages to the skin and merely the skin cancer and
whereas the tests studies suggested that the tanning device contribute
to the incidence of melanoma, recent studies at General National Cancer
Institute indicates the use of tanning devices may contribute to
incidence of melanoma and skin cancer. You got a situation where we just
acting on evidence that is occurred in the later time ___[00:34] and to

safety division in the state and inspects tanning beds because they
admit the type of, in this sense not nuclear radiation but the type of
exposure to a dangerous and recognize dangerous UVA and UVB spectrum
that causes disease of the skin and now we know more but do not act upon
recent evidence would be put in the head and saying literally. I would
reference the last Senates in the article that Senator ___[01:15] quoted
in these observations, they indicated that the student when ask, he or
she then ask about and she have been told the skin cancer was a risk of
doing this you said they had not informed her. So, we need to understand
this is for the positive in fact to the public health and I’m in favor

Thank you Representative Fulghum, Representative Jackson is recognized.

I have a question for the bill sponsor Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m in favor of the bill just like quick question about the change that
was made from the original bill about the under 18 with the
prescription. It seems like our existing law was written but the
impression that sometimes a child under 13 would need access to tanning
services by medical prescription and I’m just wondering why we are
taking out any inability for someone get tanning if they had a medical
prescription.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the question. I believe the reason it was because
treatment for Cirrhosis, ___[02:23] something like that is best done
under controlled situation in dermatologist office.

Thank you Mr. Chairman. This bill is an easy bill to talk about simply
because it does a very good thing to continue move on screening for
conditions that are common. I say common because the condition of
congenital heart defects is something that we have recognized more in
the last several years to extent that we can find them in ___[04:32] in
many cases and we have a story today that’s very telling. One of the
things that Candy done for a new born is to try to find if there is any
problem with that child’s ability to conduct circulation, the heart

manner and that means while the child is still in the hospital just well

Requires pulseox symmetry which is a measure of the amount of blood
that's carrying oxygen and a percentage of that pretty quickly, like the
first 24-36 hours. You don't want to do it too quickly because the child
is doing a transition from being a ?? animal to a land animal so the
circulation's changing in such a way, but this is easy, it's
inexpensive, many hospitals in the state are doing it at the present
time, we would like to push this over the hill. This bill does not carry
any significant state fiscal issues. There's not a fiscal note on this
and there's been widespread support from virtually every part of the
medical community that this is the right thing to do at the right time.
I would like to show you a short film clip that just demonstrates the
type of procedure that we're really talking about. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Pulseox Symmetry is a simple, painless,
inexpensive means to help us detect critical congenital heart disease.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Screening for congenital heart disease using pulseox
symmetry can improve outcomes and save lives. The goal would be for
every hospital and birthing center in the country to screen babies and
that is what the pulsar test will be for. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Pulseox
symmetry, called pulseox for short is a simple, painless and
non-invasive test that helps identify babies with heart defects known as
congenital heart disease or CHD, the number one birth defect in
children. Pulseox is just one of several tools medical professionals use
to help identify newborns with serious heart problems before they ever
leave the nursery. Many leading health organizations have endorsed
adding screening for critical congenital heart disease to the uniform
screening panel. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is going to be a game changer
for us and now we're just going to have a little bit more safety for
those babies when they're born so that we find them and get them to
early treatment and that will improve the lives of many babies. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I tell families that it's an easy, it's a painless and it's a
very quick way to check for the presence of CCHD in their newborn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My daughter, Veronica, died suddenly and unexpectedly
when she was 7 weeks old of an undiagnosed congenital heart defect that
could have been picked up had she received screening when she was born.
She appeared perfectly healthy. I had all of the prenatal tests
including the 20 week ultrasound. Everything was normal so we were under
the impression that she was a perfectly normal baby with a perfect
heart. She died suddenly. They found that she had this heart defect that
could've been fixed surgically had we known about it so when I learned
about pulseox symmetry screening, that this could have been done, it
really made me angry that she had not been screened. I hope that one day
all babies are tested before they leave the hospital so that no baby
dies from a treatable condition the way my daughter did. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] CCHD screening should be done at or as close to 24 hours of age
as possible. We screen the right hand and the right foot. It performs a
pulsox measurement on both those. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The pulseox
screening measures your baby's blood oxygen levels. If the levels are
normal, that's all there is to it. If the levels are below the normal
range, the test will be conducted more times to ensure accuracy and an
average reading. If the pulseox intervals recorded are lower than
normal, your baby will be rescreened because sometimes babies take time
to adjust to breathing outside the womb. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If the screen
does not give the results that we are looking for we do multiple
screens. If at the end of those multiple screens those levels are still
not what we want, we are in touch with the baby's pediatrician and they
determine what the next course of action is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The goal
is to be sure to catch any concerns for your baby's health before he or
she leaves the hospital. Of course, no screening can catch all heart
defects or other issues.</p>

If you notice that your baby has any of the following signs or symptoms
of CHD, be sure to consult your paediatrician immediately.
[music]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We think that it's so important to catch babies quick
that have any treatable condition early. So in addition to the heel
stick, in addition to the hearing screen, we think that CCHD screening
fits in so nicely because we can save babies lives. And that's huge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Approximately eight of every 1,000 infants born have a
form of CHD. While this screening can't detect all forms of CHD, it
helps with early identification of some at-risk babies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Our goal, ultimately, is that no baby with critical
congenital heart disease will leave the nursery and not be treated for a
condition in which we have excellent results.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We want all newborns that are leaving the hospital to
have access to this CCHD test. And we have tried to show that that's
possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We really want parents and providers to know that CCHD
screening using [pulsac symmetry] can improve outcomes and potentially
save lives.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is just another test in the panel that is for the
benefit of your baby, to give your baby a chance at living a long,
healthy life.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This CCHD, repeat: critical congenital heat defects.
We probably have about, as the bill says in the ??, 4800 of these babies
born nation-wide every year. But there're really five times that born
with heart defects, but these are critical. These are the ones they call
blue babies. These are the ones that can't live very long: weeks. So
this finding at this time is the best we can do. And I have to give my
kudos to the public health people in the state. When I started in 1967,
between schools I worked at state lab doing the PTU test. And this was
the first metabolic test the state sought to do for newborns - and the
blood blot test that people turn in. It's a marvellous opportunity. $19
now buys you over 35 metabolic screens, and they do hearing tests. So
this is just one of the things we know is the right thing to do. And I
ask the chairman to recognize Greg Olson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Olson if you would come forward at this time as
part of Representative [Fulghum's] presentation. He's invited Greg Olson
to come and speak. May of you may know Mr. Olson as ?? and Carolina
Panthers. Mr. Olson we're pleased to have you with us today, go
Panthers, and the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mister Chairman. Thank you all
for allowing me to come today and speak on such an important issue that
in the past year has changed my families lives and our songs life
forever. In October of 2012 we welcomed twins: a baby girl and a son.
And our son was diagnosed in-utero with a condition called hypoplastic
left heart syndrome, which in it's simplest forms means he's born with
half of a heart. His left side of his heart never develops in-utero and
early developments, and when he is born he just has a functioning right
side of his heart. So when they're welcomed into the world - we were in
the big room and they're delivered - and we have neo-natologists, we
have intensivists. We have the whole team ready to whisk him away into
the cardiac intensive care unit. Because we were one of the few
fortunate people who was able to be diagnosed in-utero prior to the
birth of our child. That's not the case - as the video demonstrated -
that is not the norm. The majority of these babies are born, and just
like he said, they are marine animals. Their ductos artereosis, which is
what a baby bypasses their lungs when they're deflated inside the
mother's womb-- they don't breathe like me and you do. So when they're
born they appear completely normal. They're breathing 100%. And then
over a 24 hour span those ducts close and now these babies need to start
breathing oxygen. And our son, if undiagnosed, if undetected, within a
week would have died. It's 100% fatal. There's no way the body can,
obviously, go on without oxygen. SO I can't imagine what that would be
like as a family to bring a child home and - thinking everything is
fine. We've welcomed two other babies home and I can't imagine that day
two or three at home all the sudden now you look down and your baby.</p>

sweating, blue, and possibly dead. Fortunately for us that was not our
condition. He's had, on day two of life he had his first of three
scheduled open heart surgeries so on day two he was completely opened up
for intense open heart surgery at Levine Children's Hospital and
fortunately he's doing well. He's getting ready for his next surgery but
I think the moral of the story is there doesn't have to be anyone who
has an experience unlike ours. They don't have to go home un-diagnosed.
They don't have to go home undetected. And I think House Bill 105, to a
father and to a family who has been through this and the countless
families in the audience, it almost seems too easy. It almost seems like
it makes too much sense to give these families, for a cost of a diaper
change, to throw it into a discharged screening to say, &quot;Okay,
you're child,&quot; this test is so simple that I do it every day to our
child. It's part of his daily routine, no different than weighing in
scale, writing it down. We do a pulse ox, we have one at our house, it's
about this big. It's a little bigger than a cell phone. We hook it up
with a little sticky pad, we hit the button, we wait a minute and it
spits out the numbers and we record it. We know where his numbers are
supposed to be, if they fall or raise we call the doctors. It's as
simple as that. And one of those screens could prevent all of these kids
from going home undetected. I would just encourage all of you to support
this bill just for the countless numbers of families to have the tragedy
that you saw on this video and it might not necessarily pass but being
rushed into that hospital and going through everything we had to do
knowing nine months in advance. I can only imagine what those families
have to be like, you bring home your baby in that moment of joy, two
days later is panic as you rush him into the emergency room to undergo
open heart surgery to save his life. I encourage all of you to really
consider and please pass this for the countless families, House Bill
105, and we really appreciate your time and thank you for allowing me to
come here and share my story with all of you and hopefully you guys can
see just how important this really is. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you, Mr. Olsen. The Chair has recognized, we've had at least
two members that have asked to speak at this time so we'll go to members
comments and questions beginning with Representative Murry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just had a conversation with a constituent of mine representing the
American Heart Association and she told me rhyme: 98 to 105 is a good
way to keep babies alive. And so with that, with that in mind, and I
don't want to be on the wrong side of Mr. Olsen here as well, I've seen
him on the field and I think we're better off being on the right side so
with that in mind I'd like to make a motion that we give this bill a
favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry, if you'd hold that motion, I've got one more to
speak so we'll come right back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I was going to make the same motion but, as Representative Murry
said, Mr. Olsen is brave going across the middle but there are other
forms of bravery in families having to deal with very serious issues so
I compliment the bill sponsors for bringing this measure for us and
certainly, I think, everybody's going to join in in supporting this
legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I have a question for the bill sponsor which may show how
long it's been since I delivered a baby. Do all babies actually now stay
in the hospital that 24 hours and how would this apply, because I know
at one point people were leaving earlier and then, of course, the whole
issue of the home birth. So I assume there's a way for this to apply but
I just thought I'd ask the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the summary is that almost all should stay 24 hours. The, that's
a good point, the birthing centers, the home deliveries, and hospital
deliveries are all affected by this bill. So we have to make, they have
to make arrangements for that and they also have to do the blood blot
test as well, only this is required. I had one correction I'd like to
make. I had a physical memorandum and not a physical note, I'm just
learning, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cotham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members. And having given birth two years
ago I can tell you that this test was done on my baby and it was just
one more test for peace of mind, which is what any new parents
absolutely want and this is important and we should offer this for all
children in our state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay members, seeing no other hands at this time, Representative Murry,
you are recognized for your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will bring one other thing up, in section B2, it's something for the
proponents of the bill to consider, when we're talking about
telemedicine potentially, this has been raised as a concern, potentially
that this section B2</p>

part one, section b2 might create some sort of  monopoly in that
situation so that we might need to tweak that language just a little
bit. I'm one of the primary sponsors of this was an issue that got
brought up to me just recently so there might be a modest change needed
when we take this to the floor or maybe in the Senate just wanted to
raise that issue for everyone's concern. I don't think it's a herculean
task to address that, but I wanted to bring that to the attention of the
committee that just came to my attention. But with that in mind, I'd
like to make a motion for a favorable report to House bill 105.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Murry moves for a favorable report for House bill 105, all members
in favor signify by saying &quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, &quot;no&quot;.
The &quot;aye&quot;s have it. This meeting is adjourned.</p>
