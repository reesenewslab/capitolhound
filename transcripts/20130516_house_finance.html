What I meant. I thought you were with the transport. Excuse me I'm
multitasking. Please speak, I'm sorry.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I am speaking
on behalf of the transport, speaking on behalf of my district. I serve
for the last 12, 15 years as vice chairman of the North Carolina eastern
Region. Which is where its at consideration here this evening, I mean
this morning. But what I wanted to say and I have Mr John Tafey here who
is executive director of the North Carolina eastern regency.  And he's
been serving in that capacity for about 5 or 6 years. There is a couple
of things we need to understand. I know that we think about the glocal
transport and that seems to come out but what we're dealing with is the
situation here. Its like a three legged stool I was trying to explain it
to you. There are three components that make up the global transpor.
That is the global transpor foundation, the economic development region
and the north Carolina eastern region. So there are three separate parts
and what I understand is being requested here by the gentlemen from
Cramer county. Is that Cramer county be allowed to withdraw its
membership from the North Carolina eastern region. And that is a piece
of the fund development piece. Its like one of the seven regions that we
have within the state of [SPEAKER CHANGES] Princeton Moffit. I apologize
to representative Brand for interrupting your talk but the PSC actually
keeps Cramen County in the region. And I wasn't sure if, ?? but its
keeps them in the region. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok let me pause here and let
Mr Dontavin make some contact as much as he is the executive director of
the North Carolina eastern region. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Allen did you have any direct questions at this time for mr Shayvil.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Basically I would like to know what impact this will
have if they remove their money from the trust. Does this bill allow,
first of all what impact this will have on the partnership. And I'll
start with that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly will have a financial
impact on us because if you look at our funding, mechanism,??
representative Hamilton, its a deal turn a lot of the regions from
historical charge their members a membership fee on a annual basis. Each
county elected to participate in our region in the very beginning and we
have essentially a 5 year funding model. A license plate tax was enacted
and those funds flew, flow through our nations. We helped 85% of those
monies in trusts for other counties to be able to borrow for economic
development programs at a relatively low rate of interest. So if you
remove, so essentially its like 13 silo's and each one of those are an
independent trust. An individual trust when its collective. Interested
off the trust and we earn interested off the loans. And the way it's
structured is that's what generates the revenue that we have to be able
to operate as a regional economical development agency. So the impacts
for us would be a financial one. In a sense, it would take away a
portion of our regional funding. So it would be, in terms if you run it
parallel to the urban partnerships it would be like allowing an
individual county to be a member but not contributing to that
organization or supporting that organizations regional mission. Does
that help?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes it does and follow up to the bill
sponsor. Or maybe the staff. This bill was allow counties in the reguon
to pull out their funding as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's
correct.[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Further questions and comments for the
committee? Representative Jones?[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, thank you mr
chairman I'd like to ask that the CO question if he's review. In our
deliberations yesterday I think this particular fund was described as
being approximately 14 million dollars I think. Could you just tell a
portion, about how this particular fund has been used. Lets just over
the last 2 to 3 year period. What has been the activity there as far as
the balance of this fund or does it stop there. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly. Mr Chairman. Essentially the way the fund operates is
basically on a county initiative. They wont undertake an economic
development project whether thats like developing a business ?? or
developing an industrial park. ?? Its about a capacity building. They'll
come and  endorse a county commissioner ..</p>

Funds from their trust fund from them and they undertake an economic

barred $1,000,000 from trooper structure to the waters sure why the long
view was 70 corridor until the stimulate economic development will never

it, and so that's the basic way to do with the trust fund operates from
against the silence of those funds are held to 10 trawlers from the Cali
to be able to use each family as an individual trust, that is reflective
of the amount that was collected from their license tag fee for the five
year period from vendors also state appropriation that actually equally
distributed among each county muscle against basically gave a very moral
small counties from an extra mile of cash to safely in the trust fund to
look at the white cells can only come if you talk to their former county
manager whose fate would be a good word for the eastern region and the
funds have been made available to us to simply wouldn't be competing for

and, with an idea that a couple of examples about creating county and I
guess when I was trying at its worldwide as a recent examples additional
funding package was established in mind is 50,013 to 500 is acting as if
ever was safari seven counties excessive fines or the scraping can

we're so the fund is still there are still active weekend counties to

<p id="10:00">
To do what they’re doing to request this here because Craven County does
not benefit from additional funds continuing to be allocated towards the
Global TransPark. The bottom line is they don’t feel the Global
TransPark is contributing anything to them. They’ve started their own
economic development team. The option here is if this doesn’t pass,
Craven County can still pull out of the region. They will lose the
allocated tax dollars. The only thing is they won’t get their money out
of the fund. This way, if this passes, they’ll get their money out of
the fund, they can use it for their own economic development, but the
region will still get whatever allocated tax dollars are for county
because they’ll still be able to count Craven County as a member.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, can I provide a bit of clarity on that response?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s part of the confusion that exists is because our organization,
the Global TransPark Authority and the Global TransPark Foundation, were
all created about the same time, so we are not the GTP. That’s the most
important thing to recognize is we are not the Global TransPark. That’s
a state owned entity with an authority that governs it and there was a
foundation created funded by private dollars to promote the development
of the TransPark. We were created to promote the development of the 13
county region and that’s what we’ve been about. None of our money has
ever gone to support the development of the Global TransPark. It all
goes to support capacity building within our 13 counties of which Craven
is one of them. They do benefit. If you went back and talked to some of
the folks from Craven, now that hopefully they’ve got a better
understanding of who we are and what we do. There might be a different
attitude about us today than it was at that point in time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, you heard from the gentlemen in his own words that they want to
hang on to this fund because if they don’t get the state tax dollars,
they would use this fund for operating expenses. The whole thing has
been a one-armed bandit since its exception. It’s been 20 years. Craven
County would like to get their money and that’s where we’re at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hamilton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. I’m glad you gave that clarity on the fact that
North Carolina’s eastern region is not the Global TransPark. The money
was collected for the license plates. Correct me if I’m wrong, anybody
jump in. The money was collected for the license plates in an effort to
market Global TransPark. The money collected then went to North
Carolina’s eastern region to be held in a fund to served for grants and
loans to the 13 county region surrounding the area of the Global
TransPark. That money, the $14.5 million, then the interest from that
money is then divvied out every year, if I understand correctly, to the
remaining partnerships in the state. If we start unraveling this fund
and all the counties in that 13 county region start taking the money out
of this fund, then the other partnerships lose that interest payment
every year, and it’s to the tune of about 20 to $30,000 per partnership.
It will affect every partnership in the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a clarification from staff regarding some of this, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This trust contains the 14.8 and DMV funds that also contains one time
appropriation from the General Assembly and $7.5 million. Those separate
portions of money both generate interest. The interest on the 14.8,
which Mr. Chaffey referred to goes back to the eastern region for
operating expenses. The interest on the 7.5 is taken into account when
all economic development regions receive their annual state
appropriation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct. Thank you. Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This question’s for the bill’s sponsor. The
original bill that was before us basically allowed Craven County to,
what exacts to, succeed from the Union, if you will. Get out of the
partnership, take their money with them. This one, before us now, just
says they’ll take the money, but they’ll still be in the partnership. My
question to you is what do the Craven County commissioners want to do?
What is their goal? What do they want?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I haven’t called them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Robert Brawley
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
About the changes to PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Robert Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I might comment on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
By all means.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was leaning towards actually voting against this bill because I do
tend to favor regionalism, but the comments I’m hearing is the Global
TransPark maybe.</p>

Speaker Changes: ?? because the regional people don't care much about
that's for that bill i gave favorite ?? appropriate time,
Speaker Changes: thank you Representative brolly Representative stones,
Speaker Changes: thank you ?? i think i can clear some of the senator
are here if one understand if you are keep the funds of the five dollars
?? but we are gonna state part f the bill were we can so they can still
gain your allocation of the funds that we got from the state so it's
kind of a happy medium play so if they gonna continue to get their funds
but you get your special portion of the funds ?? so at that time i thin
its a great bill in the appropriate time Mr.Chair i lived to ?? a motion
Speaker Changes:Representative ?? but thank you Representative stones
Representative ?? and representative ??
Speaker Changes:thank you Mr.Chair i know that we have Representative
George graham who is formally elected in that area i be interested to
know what interaction the county had approximately county commission
that he has with this benefits perceived from the debate thank you
Representative hall Representative graham
Speaker Changes:thank you Mr.Chair i would say to you and thank you for
recognizing me to make a few comments the project has been extremely
successful I'm not aware of any counties that's requesting funds out the
information i received recently on ?? county ?? we created probably
three or four hundred million dollars in terms of development there has
been 2000 jobs there is highway construction rear construction the
project is gone extremely well look at the secretary of comments
yesterday and she said we are developing a prosperity zone those
prosperity zones are when developed most similar to what we have what we
have now and what we need to do is to date ?? I'd like to call something
like that i don't know the property ?? that we are shit down June 30th i
simply seen an organization this large  needs more time to scale does a
because their projects on land their state transactions ?? discussions
all up with the other developers and come into area to shed down June
30th would be disastrous i would say at least would you extend the time
to give the organization an opportunity to clarify
Speaker Changes: follow up
Speaker Changes: ??
Speaker Changes: follow up Representative ??
Speaker Changes: actually Mr.Chair i would like to just a refuse to the
committee on the decision before us regarding the PCS there is no secret
that there has been some broad discussions regarding the economic
partnership and number of counties and certain partnership throughout
the state solutions and regards to  partnership actually work and these
partnerships benefits i think most folks are aware of senator bill 137
which is send to the house house bill 356 which was companion bill to
357 if the every beginning we we are looking at step ?? that economic
partnership just to make sure that the way that had constructed actually
made of the counties have something in common  from one end to other
that actually made that economic partnership a viable economic
partnership for that part of reason so whole is in flux i don't think we
have to debate in this committee this morning this moment what is front
of us we have Craven where apparently ?? dissolution's in the way of
their membership where their economic region operated they want them to
withdraw from that  this P C S keeps them in their which pretty much
maintains the appropriation whatever that's gonna be ?? and they would
like to receive their proportion of the money their citizens their money
page their special tax and have that ?? to them so they can use that for
their economic development ?? so their county commissioners can take
care of their folks ?? count with money that their folks paid</p>

And the future of the economic partnership is actually in other people’s
hands. And I think that that's kind of what we're faced with without
debating the future viability of these economic partnerships. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Mott. Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentleman of the committee when the
global trans-park was started it was with high hopes and great
expectations that it would be a real economic engine and drive the
economy in this area of the state. And it just hasn't happened, it
hasn't panned out. You know if you make a bad investment at some point
in time you have to realize it's a bad investment and you just cut your
losses and you get out. And that's what Craven County's decided they
wanna do. They just wanna take their money, cuz they feel that they can
better utilize it on the local level as opposed to allowing the region
to use the money. So there's nothing wrong with what he's wanting to do.
It doesn’t' destroy the partnership, it doesn't disrupt their
operations, it just gives Craven County the ability to manage their own
resources. It's their contribution let em get it back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Wells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the folks at the eastern region either is there some risk, is there
some threat to the eastern regions that if we pass the proposal before
us it will put at risk, actually threaten the coalition that has held
together the global trans-park all these years?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Great question. That's always possible, it's unknown. At this point in
time no other county has petitioned to withdraw from the regional
commission. It might set up a domino effect, we don't really know, based
on the current ??. It's kind of the way the trust is done is essentially
it's the glue that binds us together.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I'm not trying to cut you off but I've got to get to the
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We've Representative's Ross, Hall, and then we're voting on this. Carney
yes ma'am I'll add you to that list. Thank you. Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Yesterday we had heard that the Secretary of
Agriculture had some plans for this area and I just wanted to know
whether we ever got some feedback from the Department of Agriculture on
this bill. I may have missed it since I came in a couple minutes late.
Is there anybody here from Ag? Did the bill sponsor ever consult with
Ag?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a Representative from the Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Joy Hicks, legislative liaison for the Department of Agriculture.
Commissioner Troxler has expressed an interest in the GTP as it is in
the heart of agriculture country. And has expressed both to the commerce
subcommittee on agriculture and military affairs, and to the
transportation chairs in both the Senate and the House. That there is a
desire to see more agriculture exported and moved and that he does see
that GTP is a possibility for that. However there are a lot of
infrastructure needs in place, or that would need to be put in place in
order to make that happen. But he has expressed an interest this
session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ma'am. Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm sorry I didn't finish last time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess the question I have. I've heard that the bill sponsor now says
he hasn't talked to the folks in Craven County recently and I've heard a
lot of discussion about Craven County wanting to be out of, or to take
their funds out. And I haven't seen any information or hadn't heard
anything from Craven County. And I guess the question is did the Craven
County commissioners file a request for this? And if so is a copy of it
available to us? And when was it done as regards to this PCS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale has a resolution from Craven County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I've tried to think through this, listened to
all the discussion. I think the bill's sponsor and the chair is for
fixing this a little better today. My concern yesterday was the pulling
out of the partnership, and that would start an unraveling of
partnerships. I think we really need to pull the global trans-park out
of this discussion, because first though if you don't mind I'd like to
ask staff a question. I know the answer but I just want them to answer
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am.</p>

<p id="30:00">
Certainly have no objection to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it does mean you have to have the same number of lanes, the way
it’s written now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would suggest, what if you have an odd number of lanes. That might be
difficult to have two and a half lanes each way. Might be good to say at
least.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would be fine with that technical wording change. Could I suggest
that? Yes, I would suggest a floor amendment. If you look on line 13...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you’ll get with staff attorneys so they can draft it for a moment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it’s just two words.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think its the addition of two words. I think you can understand this.
You can object if you say no. If you look at line 13…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can understand it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
...the authority continuously maintains at all times, at least, in front
of the word the -- at least the same number of general purpose non-total
lanes. That simply we’re not mandating them to make the new lanes toll
lanes if they don’t want to. If they want to add two new free lanes they
can add two new free lanes. But if they want to make two new lanes and
make them hot lanes and toll them, they can do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move the amendment be adopted.

any further questions from the committee. If not, All in favor say aye.

Late last night...no, let me back up. Early this morning…

Representative Howard, please.

Early this morning, Dr. Luebke came to me on the floor and indicated
with the Representative that this bill did need to meet crossover and it
had...I don’t know all the details in the back, but I agreed that we
would go ahead put it on this morning. Early this morning I had a call
from the chairman of the board in Chatham County and also an email from
the vice chair and a third call which I wasn’t able to take. They do not
want the bill now. They indicated that the cost...they thought that
there would be another issue on the ballot with a special election and
that has not materialized so this would be a single issue on the ballot
at a cost of about $50,000. I spoke with Representative McManus when I
came in and asked her to do what she needed to, making calls or
whatever. The commissioners had a originally, I’m trying to remember all
of this so I can tell you correctly, had initially requested the
resolution, but they have now changed their mind. She’s not back so I’m
going to just say, let’s just drop it at this point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There being no further business to come before this committee, we’re
adjourned.</p>
