  Ladies and gentlemen, the meeting will come to order. Welcome to 544
again, and as we get started… thank you, Senator Rucho. As we get
started, we will recognize our Sergeant-at-Arms staff, ?? and Donald
Blake. Welcome and thank you for all you do. You may need to maintain
order today; we do have a spicy agenda. And our pages are Joshua Core
from Havelock – Joshua, welcome, with Senator Sanderson; Micaylah
Robinett from Pinetops, Senator Brent Jackson. Right? Good. How far is
Pinetops from Autryville? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is it?
Is it in hollering distance? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you holler real loud.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And Josh Rogers from Jamestown, Senator Wade. Josh,
welcome. This is another program on information. I hope that the
committee will be as engaged as you were in the last meeting; there’s a
lot of good information here. Staff will present, and as we finish each
section, we will entertain questions or accept questions, and please ask
them because we want everyone to know what’s going on so we can make
some good informed decisions moving forward in this session. So with
that, again, welcome, and welcome to Mr. Ettefagh. We will have you
start the presentation on economic development in North Carolina.
Aubrey, are you just… you’re going to maintain your seat and just answer
when time comes? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. That’s my plan, if that’s
alright with you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. Good to know. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Good afternoon. My name is Dan Ettefagh with the Bill Drafting
Division, and today we’re going to finish the discussion that we started
last week regarding the economic development incentive funds program of
the state. I want to quickly recap – very quickly recap – the first
program we covered, JDIG, and then we’ll move into the four other
programs. So as we discussed last week, the JDIG program is an incentive
for businesses to create new jobs in the state where the incentive
amount is equal to 10 to 75% of the withholdings of the created eligible
positions. JDIG liability has a calendar year cap of $15,000,000 per
year with an agreement term of no more than 12 years. For projects
located in tier 2 and tier 3 areas, 15% or 25% respectively is diverted
away from the incentive paid to the business and put into the utility
account, which is used for utility infrastructure improvement in tier 1
and tier 2 areas. Safeguards for the state’s JDIG investment in the
business take the form of active clawbacks, fund dispersal scheduling
that ties the incentive payments to being dispersed after certification
of performance, dispersal reductions that are commensurate with
underperformance or nonperformance by a participating business, and then
monitoring auditing and reporting. You’ll notice in your packets…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you waving? We were going to go get a little
further along, but you go ahead, Senator Cook. I don’t want you to… If
you’re like me, you forget your question before we’ve got to the answer.
Please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s exactly right. I’m an old person. I’m
kind of like Jerry there. Anyway, when last I left this stirring saga,
we had talked about the cost of JDIG – I think it was a billion and a
half, was it? – and how many jobs were created, or something like that.
Anyway, it worked out to the cost per capita, I think it was, of around
22 thousand if memory serves. First of all, would you check my memory?
Is that about right, and how have I got it screwed up if I have it
screwed up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Aubrey Incorvaia, Fiscal Research. So
last time we talked about the total amount of grants rewarded was $1.5
billion; that’s inception through calendar year 2014. We also talked
about the minimum number of jobs associated with those awards; that is
the minimum number of jobs

…That would have to be created for the company to avoid default and that
was 64,141 jobs. The cost per job associated with that was $23,000
approximately, commerce has generated some new information that I
believe you have in a packet in front of you which references a larger
number of jobs created associated with those total grants awarded that
is 73,313 and that is on the third page of commerce’s document where it
says, “JDIG, it’s a map company selected project sites.” At the bottom,
it list 201 projects and 73,313 jobs and that number is the target
number of jobs. When you make the cost per job, yes Dan is reminding me
to have you look in the commerce packet that has been passed out; it is
titled “Job Grow People”. The third page of that document is a map, the
map is titled, “JDIG Company Selected Project Sites.” At the bottom of
that map you see the number of 73,313 jobs. Again, that number is the
target number of jobs associated with all grants awarded and when you do
the cost per job calculation based on 73,313 jobs that comes out to
$20,203.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you that got you, Senator Cook you have a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What&#39;s the difference between the first set of numbers and the
second?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure. So when commerce makes an award they outline the minimum number of
jobs that must be created to avoid default and that’s the low threshold
that is the number that I provided in last meeting which is the 64,141.
When commerce makes an award they also have a target job creation number
that is the 73,313 tally that I just provided today based on commerce’s
new information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry one more follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I quit. What I’m trying to get out here is—how much is thing cost me
as per job? And so far I got up at bottom and I think I got at top
number job.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What&#39;s the real number? What&#39;s the number of jobs, do we know?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, for that response I will direct you to an item in your packet that
has taken from the economic development grant report that commerce
generates annually. The title of it is, “Job Development Investment
Program.” And the bottom it says, “Page six” and you will see that it
has the 2014 economic development grant report. Is everybody there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I’m not there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It looks like this document here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It says, “Job Development Investment Grant” it’s across the top. Now,
this is not for all of commerce’s awards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is for a specific subset of awards between 2007 and 2014 and you
can see in that table there, table 2 job development investment grants,
this calculation is based on 136 projects, the initially projected
minimum required new jobs that’s a couple rows or rather columns over is
40,291. Again, that is the minimum number to avoid default not the
target number. And then if you look further to the right under ‘Actual
Performance’ it has jobs created, these are the actual jobs created
associated with the JDIG grants. You will see that ‘Under Active’,
11,516 jobs have actually been created today. I would also note that
these active grants may still be in there job creation period or
creating jobs so they have not closed yet, they have not come to term.
For terminated jobs, they also know that 2135 jobs have been created.

  and then the withdrawn jobs are not applicable. If you tally all of that
up, that amounts to 13,651 jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Senator Ron Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I&#39;m still, I was on the same track that Bill was, trying
to get at what&#39;s the, just trying to get at what&#39;s the real
number of jobs created by the investment made by the tax payers in this
state is what Bill&#39;s trying to get at and what I&#39;m thinking
about also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you. Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate the questions but the one that
I have most pressing, dealing with the job number that I&#39;m looking
at here, Mr. Chairman, is 73,313, of that what is the income tax
collected for the 73,313 jobs that were created by these programs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you&#39;ll look at another document in your packet, which has been
provided by Commerce, it&#39;s called JDIG 2003-2012 awarded grants,
actual liability payments, and eligible withholdings. That looks like
this document here. You&#39;ll see, under 2003 for example, the total
actual liability for the 2003 awards was 404,000, but the total payment
was $160,000. The total eligible withholdings associated with jobs
created is $274,000 and this provides those metrics across all
performance years. I would turn it over to Commerce if they&#39;d like
to elaborate on this document, which they have created. This document
includes payments to the utility accounts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, I just want to make sure, this is representative then of the
73,000 jobs that they&#39;re talking about? Because I&#39;m looking at,
I guess this is being calculated from 2003-2008, is that accurate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, the 73,000 jobs are attributed to the $1.5 Billion that has been
awarded. Some of those jobs will not come online until twelve years from
2014. So no, I would say this does not encompass all 73,000 jobs because
some of those are yet to be achieved in the future.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But it&#39;s still not a complete representation because I&#39;m seeing
here this only goes up to 2008, there&#39;s some data that&#39;s, okay,
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You got it? Okay. Senator Alexander? I think this is may be your first
question in this committee, so make it a good one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll do my very best, sir. Senator Tillman told me to ask this
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, sir. Now, I understand this does not include taking the utility
fund out, is that correct, Ma&#39;am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This does include payments and liability to the utility account.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And so these are payments that go in to, say, tier one and two areas, to
help out those areas that are, where they don&#39;t get jobs but they
get some utility upgrades, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Money goes in to the utility account and the Rural Infrastructure
Authority, which oversees those funds, designates them to grants to
local governments in tier one and two, tier two counties for the
reasonable, anticipated reasonable creation of jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we&#39;ll be covering the utility account in just a minute, if
you&#39;d like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, let&#39;s move on and do that because we have session at 2:00.
I&#39;m not trying to rush this thing through, we&#39;ll take as many
days and as many hours as it takes and I appreciate your questions and
your desire to master this. But let&#39;s move ahead and then we&#39;ll
stop at another point, maybe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which is a great segue into the utility account, so thank you. As was
mentioned with JDIG, with projects located in tier two or tier three
area, a percentage of the businesses JDIG award is automatically
diverted into the utility account. The utility account provides awards
and funds to tier one and tier two areas for construction and
improvement of utility infrastructure. That the funds are going to one
of twenty-five most economically distressed counties, there is no local
match requirement.

  <p id="15:00">
  If it&#39;s going to any of the other eligible counties, there&#39;s a
25% match requirement.  Funds are only available for utility
infrastructure improvement projects that are reasonably anticipated to
create new jobs, and the program has both prioritized and ineligible
industry types.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Questions on the utility fund, a pretty important
piece, does everyone understand it, how it works?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Can I, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Question for clarification probably for myself as
much as anyone else.  A company has created 100 jobs, and they&#39;re
entitled to get so much withholding back based on what percentage
they&#39;re allocated.  Can you describe to me, let&#39;s say 75% of all
the money they collect is in the fund going as far as the grant money.
How much of that money goes into the utility fund and how much of the
money stays with the business that gets the grant?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Right there, and this is, we&#39;re referring to a
Tier 3 county receiving notes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Just to clarify.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I know that, it gets even more confusing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  So, let&#39;s assume that there&#39;s the generation
of, and I&#39;m very bad at doing numbers on the fly, so bear with me,
but I&#39;m going to try to make it easy.  Let&#39;s say that
there&#39;s a million dollars of withholdings associated with the
eligible created positions.  So those are admitted to the department,
the department certifies assuming the 75%, the award is based on a
percentage of the withholdings that are remitted, and let&#39;s say it
can be between, well it is somewhere between ten and 75%.  If the
company has 75%, that means that their incentive payment for that year,
for the $1 million withholding is going to be $750,000.  Out there on a
Tier 3 Project, that&#39;s $750,000, you take 25% of it, it goes to the
utility account, the rest goes to the business.  Out there on Tier 2,
15% of the $750,00 goes to the business and the 15% goes to the utility
account.  I would give you the numbers of 15 to 25%, but I&#39;m not
that, I&#39;m just not that good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chairman, follow up.  That&#39;s good, because
that means that the award doesn&#39;t even exist that consists of the
entire amount that should have been there because a portion of it, how
much percentage goes to the utility?
25% for Tier 3, 15% for Tier 2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Okay, so the grant would actually be less to the
business that created the jobs, and the utility fund money would go to
help out the Tier 1 and Tier 2 counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That&#39;s correct.  It&#39;s limited to Tier 1 and
Tier 2 eligibility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Do we have the estimate of, I&#39;m sorry Mr.
Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Go right ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Do we have an estimate of what amount of dollars that
utility fund actually has reached and has it been taken by other budget
times?  And thirdly,  what those projects were used for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Aubrey, would Aubrey answer that?  Did I see you over
there pen in hand.  Is that okay?  Please.
I&#39;m pulling up a document that will help me tally the total amount
to the utility account.  So, transfers to the utility account between
FY05 and FY15 total $48.1 million.  To your second question about budget
activities that have drawn upon those funds, in the 2014 Appropriations
Act, $5 million of utility account funds were directed to the general
fund, $5 million went to a new program for expanded gas to agribusiness
and commercial farmers, and another $1 million went to the Main Street
Solutions Fund, which is an existing fund and program in commerce that
helps revitalize downtowns for economic development purposes.  I should
say, rural downtowns.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Can you tell me, please, the second one again?  $5
million went to the general fund, $5 million went to what, I just
didn&#39;t hear you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  It&#39;s called, it&#39;s a new program called the
Expanded Agriculture Fund.  I might be botching the name, I&#39;m not
familiar with it as others.

  But it provides natural gas and propane gas to agribusiness and
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know that, thank you.  Thank you.  Dan, carry on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, so the next program we’re gonna talk about is the One North
Carolina Fund.  It is the oldest of our discretionary incentive
programs.  It was created back in 1993 and was codified in 2004.  Monies
from the One North Carolina Fund are allocated to local governments who
must then match the monies coming from the fund, and then use them to
recruit, retain or the expansion of new or existing businesses.
Permissible uses for the fund include purchasing and installing
equipment, structural repairs and improvements or renovations to
existing buildings, construction of utility infrastructure for existing
or proposed buildings as well.
One NC commitments may not exceed $28 million per fiscal biennium, and
the One NC award, unlike Jaded, you have two agreements -- you have the
agreement between the state and the unit of local government, and then
you have an agreement between the unit of local government and a
participating business.  The first is the local government grant
agreement.  The second is the company performance agreement.
With respect to the company performance agreement, the agreement must
require job creation or maintenance with agreement specific salary and
location requirements.  It must contain a scheduling for the
dispersement of the funds that is proportionate to complete performance
under the agreement.  And it must contain recapture provisions that
recapture funds to the extent that there’s under performance or non
performance.
The local government grant agreement must contain the local match
requirements, and the local match or an in kind contribution.  It has to
set forth the recapture provisions when the locality goes after the
business for under or non performance.  It must couple that with
reimbursement provisions to the extent the locality has to go after
funds from the business to the extent it recaptures funds that represent
funds from the One North Carolina Fund, those have to be diverted back
into the fund.
Finally, it must give the state access to records and it must set forth
the fund disbursement schedule.  One NC funds may only be disbursed
after the local government shows the business has complied with the
performance metrics under the agreement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are there members of committees questions on One North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Sen. Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not, not so much the--if the last part of my question was on the utility
fund, what were the grants used for, and I think
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the 2-1 counties?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the utility fund, can we, can we get that information, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So those are for utility infrastructure improvement projects.  Generally
speaking, what they can be used for is construction or improvements to
new or existing water, sewer, gas, telecommunications.  Am I answering
the wrong question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, no, you’re right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, telecommunications, high speed broadband, electrical utility
distribution lines or equipment, and transportation infrastructure for
existing or new or proposed
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good.  Mr. Chairman, I think we have a three-page list of the specific
grants.  May we share that at some point with the committee please so
that people can understand where that utility money went to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, I’d be happy to send that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr.  Edifal?, I have a question on the One NC Fund agreement before we
go forward.  How, I went through your slide and this and that, but is
this, are these handled by the Dept. of Commerce or are they tied,
handled by the executive branch per se?  How does,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, the criteria
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Who doles out the money, that’s my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It, ultimately the Dept. of Commerce administers the program.  They,
they give the money to the locals who match it and then--well, they call
for money based on performance under the agreement.  In fact, I think
the One NC Fund has been requiring that the participating business
notify them in advance when they are expecting a payment.  So there is,
there, the agreement, the company performance agreement must contain a
provision where a business that has completed performance and become
entitled to a final disbursement of the funds, must in writing timely
request from the Sec. of Commerce a disbursement of funds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It gives a scheduling of when that is, so it’s not that the department
completely does it because the, the locals are going to be involved, but
for the most part the funds are kept by Commerce, but the business
notifies Commerce when they’ve completed...

  performance ?? they want it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and oversight comes from whom?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Commerce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you. Move ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The next program is the Sight Infrastructure Development Fund. It was
created during an extra session in 2003 and was used as a part of the
incentives that were given to Merck Pharmaceuticals. The fund is used to
provide grants for forgivable loans to businesses, non-profits, state
agencies or units of local government to acquire or improve land for
industrial purposes if associated with a project in which a business
will invest at least $100M dollars in private funds and create at least
100 new positions. You&#39;ll see the recurring theme for this fund that
you&#39;ve seen for previous funds, the agreement must protect the
state&#39;s investment in the form of wage standards, job maintenance
requirements, and reimbursement provisions that are key to a businesses
failure to meet those performance metrics in the agreement. This fund
was originally set up for Merck, it was funded for Merck if it met its
performance agreements, Merck did and the fund was depleted. It has
since remained depleted and inactive.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What was the original amount set aside for that development fund?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll answer, it was $24M dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How much, follow-up. Who has the direct oversight of that, because we
bought the land at $47,000 at an acre.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Department of Commerce oversees the program. They develop the
criteria, yeah, the Department of Commerce shall administer the
selection of projects and they, I mean there are statutory program
checks, so you have Osher requirements, you have environmental impact
but generally speaking the safeguards and the agreement are within the
auspices of the Department of Commerce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a follow-up or just more of a comment, this land was shown by a
particular person in real estate who bought the land for $1,600 an acre
then turned around and sold it to the state a few weeks later at $47,000
an acre to a company who did not want any type of incentive package. So
literally we just paid someone $24M dollars to sell land to a company
who did not want this money in the first place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question concerns how competitive are these grants and do you have
more applicants for them then you have money to give out?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are we talking about site infrastructure developments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it&#39;s sort of in limbo right now because there&#39;s no funds
in that program. It&#39;s a fallow account, if you will, right now.
Since the amount was used for the incentives to Merck, it just
hasn&#39;t been active since.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. It appears that, this is a comment, basic set aside for those
who already have a good operations component set together and is it that
small businesses or start-ups could not be eligible for any of this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, there&#39;s nothing that prevents a small business from being
eligible but the job creation and investment requirements would probably
be very difficult for a small business to meet. So, the last program to
talk about is the Job Maintenance Capital Development Fund. This was
enacted in 2007 after the original legislation was vetoed. JMAC funds
are used to encourage businesses to maintain high paying jobs in the
state while making further capital investment in the state. Depending on
the type and the location of the business, the amount of the incentive
and the job requirements varies. JMAC is a little different from the
other four funds we&#39;ve talked about in that each time we&#39;ve set
the investment requirement and the job maintenance requirements,
it&#39;s been with an intended beneficiary in mind. JDIG agreements do
have performance metric-based recapture provisions and the incentive
paid to a JMAC recipient is based on the things listed on the slide,
taxes paid on machinery and equipment, sales taxes paid on building
materials, additional income and franchise taxes that are not otherwise
offset by tax credits, tax paid on electricity and fuel, working
training expenses, and state permitting fees. Commerce can enter into no
more than five JMAC agreements total. All JMAC agreements entered may
not have an aggregate cost of more than $79M and no single JMAC
agreement may have an annual cost of more than 6

  20 Dollars. [Speaker change] Thank you, any questions? ?? [Speaker
change] quick question for staff, whats the total number of incentive
programs that we have? [speaker change] Well, I mean it depends, are you
counting certain tax incentives as incentive programs? Or are you
talking about just discretionary fund programs? [speaker change] I&#39;m
talking about all incentive programs that deals with an investment that
the state can legally make a contribution to. [inaudible] [speaker
change] Is there any one that can answer that ?? [speaker change] I
think we would need to access the economic development inventory to get
a total count for you. [speaker change] Ok and you have a couple of
other things that you need to go over before we move on ?? [Speaker
Change} Yes one more item in your packet is an over view of the walden
model. There was interest in being, being educated about how commerce
goes about determining which projects will be awarded. So the Walden
model takes in to account revenues, spending costs, project impacts and
then provides an output that assures [speaker change] May I interrupt?
[speaker change] Yes Sir! [Speaker change} I believe that ?? maybe we
should start with that tomorrow ?? [speaker change] I feel confident I
can wrap this one up. [Speaker Change} ?? You so you just go right ahead
an wrap it up. [Speaker change] Okay. So basically this just tells you
how commerce runs the model there was interest in return on investment
metrics and how commerce decides if you have questions about it I would
be happy to get answers to you or commerce would be able to as well
that&#39;s it. [speaker change]  Any questions for Senator Jackson
[speaker change] Thank you Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to follow up on
Senator forbes comment about the number of incentive programs. ?? can
you get that to us, please as a committee. [Speaker change] Yes, Sir.
[Speaker Change] Thank you , Thank you Mr. Chairman. [Speaker Change]
Senator Bryant [Speaker Change] Thank you Mr. Chairman I&#39;m sort of
going back to the beginning of it because I was trying to follow Senator
Cooks questions and the answers and look at these maps [speaker change]
That&#39;s the problem. [Speaker Change} and dots and thing and stuff
and correct me if I&#39;m wrong. This 73,000 dollar picture I mean
number ?? I&#39;m sorry this 73,000 dollar ?? seventy three thousand
three hundred and thirteen number of jobs on this map are I&#39;m not
sure what. What is that? Thank you. [Speaker change] Those are the total
number of target jobs associated with the one point five billion in
grants awarded program inception through calendar year twenty fourteen.
[Speaker change] Ok. ?? Follow up this year. The thirteen thousand six
hundred and fifty one on this page are the actual jobs with people in
them for whom wages have been paid ?? as a result of ?? [Speaker change]
Yes Ma&#39;am and I would also say that this is a subset of years this
is not where the whole program. Its only for a snap shot of the
program.[Speaker change] Follow up, Do we have [Speaker change] Go
ahead. [Speaker change] Do we a number of actual jobs that matches with
this lifetime target number here of seventy three thirteen? ?? Im kind
of getting mixed up between these years and subsets. [Speaker change] We
don&#39;t have that, that is something that commerce would have to
provide us. [Speaker change] Would you like to make that request?
[Speaker change] I would like to make that request but I want to ask one
other question. [speaker change] You are full of questions today Senator
?? [Speaker change] Thank you, have we ever had that number? [Speaker
change] No. [Speaker change] Do you have one more follow up for that
last follow up? okay I wan to thank Brent Lane for coming out, we will
start and hopefully finish with him tomorrow. We do have a couple of
questions left about numbers today and we do have a couple of minutes
left. So senator Clark, I believe that I saw you. [Speaker Change] Yes
Mr Chairman with regards to the outstanding action item requested by
Senator Ford the list of all the investment type programs, when we get
that last I would appreciate it if we can also have some sort of
indication as to whether

  The investment grant is paid by reimbursement or up front.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Will staff please handle that. And Senator Ron Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had a similar question to Senator Davis. Can we get a sense somehow of
the overall cost-effectiveness of the umbrella of all of these and then
by subset, so we know which are really performing or which we think are
performing or which would just make us feel good? Just the overall
picture.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I bet we can. I&#39;ll bet that Brent Lane&#39;s evaluation will be very
revealing. Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I think next week we will have a presentation by Mike
Hannah that will show the -- I guess if you want to use a metric --
number of jobs created. The effectiveness of the overall-- I don&#39;t
know if we&#39;ve got it divided into specific areas because you have
the JDIG and all these others that are there. You also have a lot of
exemptions and deductions and a lot of other things that you may
consider economic development tools or not, but there is a number out
there in the vicinity of fifteen billion dollars of the amount of money
both in grants and in economic tools -- if you consider deductions and
exemptions -- and it shows the number of jobs that are created. And I
think Mike Hannah will present that next week as part of continued
education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Last question and there&#39;s a short one, I&#39;ve been
told, by Senator Wells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
More of a request while we&#39;re asking for additional information from
commerce. The JDIG company-selected project sites map would be a little
more informative if the dots represented the size of the grants instead
of having a million-dollar dot and a fifty-million dollar dot being the
same size.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that&#39;s it for today. Brent, thank
you. I apologize that we&#39;re behind and didn&#39;t get to you.
Joshua, Joshua, and Michaela, thank you. And the Sergeant at Arms
[INAUDIBLE]. Meeting adjourned.
