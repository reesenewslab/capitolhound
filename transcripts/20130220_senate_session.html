Senate will come to order. Sergeant at arms will close the doors,
members will go to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery,
please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is
the Rev. Peter Millner, Senate chaplain. All members and guests in the
gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lord it's an honor to be able to serve you. An awesome honor to serve
alongside these brave men and women that are public servants. It's easy
to lose ourselves in our work Lord, we are giving so much in service to
others, it becomes easy to baptize our motives and our overwork and we
say &quot;Look how important our work is,&quot; and we certainly are
helping, but it's good to remember we are not in the true position with
the true lawyer, we are helping vitally, but we are first your children.
We're not the ones that are ultimately needed here. We are imminently
replaceable, and we need you to guide us Heavenly Father. So as your
servants, call us back to our humble beginnings as servants. May we
remember where we have come from, and where we are going. In the name of
Christ we pray, amen.
