Ladies and gentlemen, one other matter. Last week, our Sergeant-at-Arms,
Clyde Cook, celebrated a special day. Some say it's 69 years, or some
say it's 70 years, but it's a heck of a lot of years and he's done a
heck of a lot of service to this chamber over the past few years. I
appreciate his friendship and his hard work, and the hard work of all
Sergeants-at-Arms, but Clyde, happy birthday. The House will be at ease.
We will probably call the chamber back to order in 10 or 12 minutes. The
House at ease until that time.</p>
