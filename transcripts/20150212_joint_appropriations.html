anybody get out of line because we have plenty of sergeants at arms to
take care of you. What we will do, we will have two presentations this
morning and I appreciate everyone being here at this joint meeting with
the House and the Senate. We&#39;ll have two presentations this morning,
the first presentation will be by Dr. Barry Boardman on the 2015/2017
consensus revenue forecast. We will follow that with a presentation by
Karen Hammonds-Blanks from Fiscal Research Division, Budget Development
Team on the budget outlook, some of the budget pressures. What we will
do is have both of these presentations, one after the other, and then we
will, in the time remaining, we will open it up to questions, not
statements, but questions at that time. So with that, if there&#39;s no
further business from anyone, we welcome Dr. Boardman for his
presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Chairman Dollar, Barry Boardman with Fiscal Research. I&#39;d
like to spend the next 20-25 minutes or so going over with you the
2015-2017 consensus revenue. Members should have all received the memo
providing a little more detail on that forecast. They should have
received that Tuesday morning and I&#39;d like to provide an overview
for you, give some of our thoughts of what inform that forecast. Before
I get into the actual 15/17 forecast I want to talk a little bit about
current revenues and then we&#39;ll talk about the economics,
conditions, we take in forming the consensus forecast and some of the
key assumptions. I first want to make sure that members are aware, when
we talk about the General Fund revenue, what exactly are we talking
about? What&#39;s the pie chart? What&#39;s those sources? We have over
22 sources of revenue that feed into the General Fund but we really have
three key revenue sources that make up about 91%, starting with personal
income tax which ranges around 50-51%, sales tax around 29-30% and then
business taxes, which include your corporate franchise and also includes
your insurance gross premiums tax, which takes you up to around 91% of
your total General Fund revenue. Some of the other revenue sources are
your excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco, and then we have a lot of
other small sources that feed into the General Fund. So far, through
14/15, and this is collections through January, we&#39;re $215M below
the $11.8B target. When I say target, what we do, we take the revenue
forecast for 14/15 and then begin to spread that out over all 12 months
of the fiscal year. Each month has different collection trend, and
we&#39;re not quite done yet. There are also some anomalies with

  <p id="05:00">
  and timing and those things that we also go in and try to tweak until we
get an accurate reflection, or relatively accurate reflection, of month
to month what are our expectations based on the revenue forecast for the
full fiscal year. That is, when we refer to a revenue target, what
we&#39;re referring to. With respect to that target, we&#39;re running a
little bit behind, $215M. The main reason is personal income. Personal
income tax is lagging behind. The fundamentals behind that are simply
the forecasts envision 4.5% growth in personal income, mostly driven by
wage growth, that hasn&#39;t materialized. Our sales taxes are doing
quite well, they&#39;re actually 2.3% above our expectations through
January, as well as corporate and franchise tax, which are both running
above expectations as well. So again, the real culprit when we think
about what the $250M shortfall or coming short of target, is it really
is just our personal income growth has kind of lagged behind our
expectations when we made this forecast back in May of last year.
That&#39;s kind of the backdrop, when we sat down as forecaster, what we
were looking at and dealing with. So now I want to move forward and talk
about the consensus forecast. Before I get into the meat of it, I want
to give you an idea of what this process is like. The consensus forecast
is a non-statutory informal process. It&#39;s actually been in place
since the 80&#39;s and has worked quite well for the state. The way it
works is OSBM and their forecasters get together to create their own
independent forecast while we at Fiscal Research do the same thing. Then
several weeks before, or even a month or so before the governor presents
his/her budget, we begin to meet and I try to iron out the differences
in our forecasts. That&#39;s what has led us to this point. We&#39;ve
been working on this for several weeks now, trying to work out some key
differences in our forecasts, and we finally reached that point earlier
this week. In May, part of the process is certainly in May after key
April collections, and I&#39;ll have more to say about that in a little
bit, but after key April collections that may come in there is almost
always a reason to revisit the forecast. So that, again, is at the call
of the legislature or the governor, obviously Fiscal Research and OSBM
would be advising the executive and legislative branch as to what&#39;s
happening in April and make that determination. In even numbered years
we come back in, this is the second year of the biennium, we&#39;ll come
back in and have the opportunity to revise the second year forecast.
That usually occurs in May, right after, again, April collections have
come in. So that&#39;s the process. So where did we land this time with
the consensus forecast? For 2014/2015, we&#39;re anticipating $20.7B in
revenue. That represents 2.9% growth over last year, or $586M over last
year&#39;s collections. Going forward into the biennium, we expect
2015/2016 to be $680M over our projections for 2014/2015, that&#39;s
3.3% growth. Then 2016/2017 is $890M, or approximately $890M additional
revenue for 2016/2017, representing 4.1% growth. I will say that what
you&#39;re looking at is a cautious forecast. The growth ranges, and I
think this picture kind of helps show you, can vary considerably. In
fact, if I were to chart the business cycle here, you would see how
revenues are dependent on the business cycle. In strong expansionary
periods, our revenues expand rapidly. In downturns, our revenues turn
down as well. When you focus on the forecast, these are the last three
bars at the end, you see that we&#39;ve taken a fairly cautious approach
with respect to where we are. There are two key reasons to that and I
want to spend a little bit of time talking about that. One is our
economic outlook for the biennium and what that says, and then some of
that has to do with what we&#39;re working with in terms of a new tax
code, a new tax regime, and the reasons for caution there.

  <h4><a href="https://requester.mturk.com/bulk/workers/A1BH2O1O2XSG2E">Worker</a> | <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/mturk/manageHIT?HITId=3KTZHH2ONHER7ZV1Y0J78A4ST2MM8H&amp;viewableEditPane=manageHIT_downloadResults">HIT</a></h4>
  
  <p id="10:00">
  So that&#39;s where I want to move next.  The economic outlook is
actually a positive one considering where I&#39;ve stood up here the
last couple of years and talked about our struggles in getting started
and gaining momentum and can the economy gain traction.  Well I can say
that it has and I can say that we are gaining momentum.  It&#39;s still
at a modest pace but it is a far steadier pace than we have seen and we
project that that continues throughout the biennium. We&#39;re not
expecting any robust take off in the economy.  There&#39;s no reason to
expect that but we do expect steady gains to continue.  So what does
that mean for employment.  That is one of the key drivers of revenues
quite obviously and we think that that means that employment growth is
going to hover around 2 percent and actually possibly above 2 percent
through out the next biennium.  That&#39;s strong employment growth that
will add 85 to 95 thousand jobs a year.  Possibly even up to 100
thousand jobs per year.  This in non farm total employment which is a
narrow measure of employment.  That is good strong growth for the state
to add that kind of growth.  That&#39;s what is part of the forecast.
We do think that eventually this growth in employment will offer up
pressure on wages.  We sent through a period, the Great Depression or
recession.  It felt like a depression. A great recession where we
actually saw our employment drop by more than 6 percent, almost 6 1/2
percent.  Well that&#39;s three times the employment drop on average
than we&#39;ve experienced since the depression.  So it was a big loss
in employment and with that slack in employment there hasn&#39;t been
much pressure on wages to rise.  We think now with the employment gains
that we are experiencing.  The forecast for those continued gains that
there eventually there will be some upper pressure on wages as we move
through the biennium and that again is again what&#39;s part of our
forecast.  And then finally on the sell side households took a real
beating during the recession.  The balance sheets were really thrown out
of whack as home equities for some were wiped out.  They found
themselves actually under water, loss of jobs and so forth.  So
household balance sheets were really out of whack.  Those are really
improving, in fact you can see that fact as consumers are willing to
take on debt again and you also see that in retail sales that are coming
out.  Then I&#39;d also think that you are going to see households feel
a little more confident about the economy as employment numbers pick up.
 So all of those things kind of feed into a better sales picture than
we&#39;ve really forecast over the last 4 or 5 years.  The only point of
caution right now is that as you are aware is there are still a lot of
global uncertainties.  There is weakness in the global economy.  There
is always instability in some of our middle eastern areas of the world.
Those are always worthy of tracking and keeping a close eye on but right
now from a national perspective the national economy seems to have
finally gotten itself on solid footing as has the states.  So, to the
consensus forecast I will say, we always take a cautious approach to the
forecast because it is for budgeting purposes.  So we want to be
cautious.  It&#39;s important to take that approach. We had to add extra
caution this year because enacted in 2013 were over 2 billion dollars in
revenue changes.  Now let me explain that it&#39;s a big number.  What
that is is it&#39;s a lot of small moving parts, some big.  It&#39;s not
the net impact of those changes but it&#39;s the fact that we&#39;ve
moved for example almost 300 million dollars out of franchise tax on
electricity and put that into the sales tax base.  Repealed the pipe
natural gas and put that into the sales tax base.  Repealed deductions,
exemptions we&#39;ve changed tax rates.  We changed tax bases and all of
that summed to over 2 billion in revenue changes and behind each of
those are fiscal estimates and some uncertainty obviously any time you
are talking an estimate.  Just knowing that that&#39;s part of the
landscape we decided we had to take an additional step back or be a
little more cautious because of that.  That&#39;s part of what&#39;s
embedded in this forecast.  So we looked at 14/15 and we had to decide
where are we going to land.  Where does 14/15 put us at the end of the
year.

  Confidence household balance sheets and so forth. Again, overall the
approach has been a cautious approach. I think it’s because of some of
the developing impacts and understanding those in respect to tax law
changes that were enacted in &#39;13. I am going to conclude at this
time and I am going to turn it over to Karen and let her talk the budget
outlook. I just want to say again, that for the first seven months
we&#39;re slightly below target. We&#39;re at forecasting a 1.3%
shortfall for 271 for this fiscal year. To put that in context, the
long-range forecast error, and this goes back into the 80s, has been
2.5%. Plus or minus 2.5%. Any time we as forecasters feel that we can
land within that pus or minus 2% range, we feel like we have done a
pretty good job forecasting.  A  21+ billion dollar revenue with over 22
sources of revenue. So 1.3% if that comes to fruition, we&#39;ll have
served us well. It&#39;s a pretty good forecast. Again, key assumption a
lot rides on April. It&#39;s always the case. Maybe a little bit more
so, this year. Again, I think that the stable conditions allowed us to
be a little bit more aggressive in our forecast but still the overall
theme of this forecast is one of cautiousness and being prudent in our
forecast. At this point, I am going to turn it over to Karen and let her
provide a...
[Speaker Changes] Good morning. I am Karen Hammonds-Blanks and I am
going to be providing a relatively brief overview of the budget and then
we will talk a little more about what the budget outlook is for &#39;15
for this particular session. But over the biennium.  If you would just
turn to your next page, actually you can skip the next page. The next
page is just really...let&#39;s see if I can figure out how to work
this. That may not be the way. Okay, there we go. It&#39;s just the
presentation overview and as I&#39;ve mentioned we are going to talk
about the current year budget and what happened in the last two
sessions. Then we are going to look at the outlook and we are going to
talk about the budget in terms of the base budget. Explain a little bit
about what that is. And what the budget pressures are that fiscal
research is aware of at this point. As many of you will be as well. As
many of you may recall, because you were here. In 2013 our session
started off with our fund balance relatively healthy and the collective
goal was to look at revenue and to look at your taxes and to do some
sort of reform. That really was the central focus of the 2013 session.
From the appropriations of the budget side of things, everything was
revolving around a target that those, the finance committees in both the
House and Senate was working towards. In the end as you can see from
your handout and from the overhead, major tax changes were implemented.
Tax Simplification and the Reduction Act, House Bill 998 passed. The
first year, &#39;13-&#39;14 the net projected reduction was only about
87 million but in the second year, the current year that we are in, it
was almost 438 million dollars. Barry&#39;s talked about that so I am
going to move on and focus on the budget side of it. The budget was
healthy at the time and still is of course. Even though we are
experiencing some of the revenue issues that Barry mentioned earlier.
But at that time you were able to make a sizable transfer into the
Savings Reserve, 232 million dollars. That brought the Savings Reserve
up to 651 million dollars. That is the current balance, today. By the
way that balance has increased significantly since 2009 and at the time
that balance was 150 million dollars. Several infusions have been made
into the Savings Reserve account. In addition to the Savings Reserve,
150 million dollars was appropriated for repairs and renovations. One of
the other big areas or big significant actions that was taken was to
address the Medicaid needs. As many of you know Medicaid has become a
perennial problem for this state. Although things have improved
significantly…

  <p id="25:00">
  Since 2013 and especially since the great recession, during the 2013
session, there was a projected medicaid shortfall of almost 500 million
dollars. The impact of that shortfall was to take from the fund balance
over three hundred million dollars. The other portion that covered that
shortfall of medicaid was take from within the Department of Health and
Human Services budget. In the second year, an additional 434 million
dollars was appropriated. That was for the 13/14 year. That was not an
unusual amount of money, but it was significant in that it was beginning
to approach identifying areas where there was difficulty in budgeting,
identifying how much money was needed for medicaid and then
appropriating a certain amount for that. As you will see in the next
slide, it did not quite cover it all but it made significant progress in
that direction. Fast forward to last session, things changed
substantially. Prior to the General Assembly coming into session, we
were made aware of under collections. Our collections were lagging. That
was to the tune of 453 million dollars. So in reality, the fiscal year
13/14 budget was running in the red on the revenue side. Fortunately,
the executive branch through Governor McCrory’s administration was able
to cut most of that by instituting significant budget and spending
constraints on agencies. As a result of that, what was going on in the
economy and the effect on our revenue (as well as some other changes
that had taken place), the consensus forecast had to be revised. It
always is, but it was significantly revised downward almost 200 million
dollars. That placed a bit of a pressure on the General Assembly on how
to balance the budget and meet the needs. Clearly one of the significant
issues that had arisen was pay for teachers. As you can see from this
slide, for the first time since 2012, a significant pay increase was
provided. Perhaps not as significant as previous years, but for teachers
in particular, the new pay schedule was implemented and the cost of that
was about 283 million dollars. The rest of that increase was for state
employees and to pay for some of the pay plans that are out there that
we will talk about in a minute (in particular, highway patrol
magistrates have a separate pay plan as well). The three key areas or
highlights for that particular session were addressing medicaid, even
though the amount of money was not as significant in terms of putting
more in the budget, there was a 186 million reserve set aside. That has
not been touched. As far as we can see right now, absent anything
happening on the spending side, that money should be available and
considered as part of the fund balance. I will say that there is some
risk of that 186 million dollars needing to be used for the current
fiscal year in case those budget measures that the McCrory
administration is considering do not totally cover the revenue
shortfall. Okay, so, now we get to the current budget. The current
budget that we are in right now is 21 billion dollars. It should come as
no surprise to members that the lion’s share of the budget is dedicated
to education. Primarily, that would be public schools. The second area
is Health and Human Services at about 24%. The interesting thing in
looking back at the last 10-15 years, these percentages have not changed
substantially over time from a sub committee perspective. As you can see
on the next slide, this is just another way to look at it as terms of
where the money goes and where the appropriations are. As you can see
from this slide, we have identified what the key budget drivers. While
the percentages on a subcommittee basis have not changed very much over
the last 10-15 years, that is not true when you look at the key budget
drivers.  Public Schools still get the lion’s share of the budget
appropriation at 38%. Community colleges and universities get 17%.
Medicaid is 17%.

  <p id="30:00">
  All the other areas have grown slowly over time, but not as
significantly as Medicaid. In looking back at Medicaid since 2001, that
percentage has grown pretty consistently; there have been some changes
in policies, some bailout by the Federal Government during the Great
Recession, but overall, when you adjust for those variables, the one
area of state government that continues to grow significantly is the
Medicaid budget.
So, that&#39;s sort of where we were in 2013 and 14, but how does North
Carolina&#39;s budget today compare to other states? For the first time
in a while, North Carolina is not included in any of those states that
are counted in the slides in front of you.
There are 12 states that currently predict budget shortfalls according
to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those states would
include Maryland, Virginia, although Virginia has closed their gap,
Massachusetts. Most of those shortfalls are the result of overspending
in areas, and revenue shortfalls.
In addition to those states, we have 23 states that predict some areas
of overspending; again, North Carolina, for the first time in a while,
is not included in any of those numbers. 14 states have indicated that
they are overspending in Medicaid, I believe Virginia and Maryland were
counted among those.
Corrections: nine states, K through 12, public schools, eight states,
and then social services, four states. These numbers are significantly
better than what we&#39;ve seen over the last 2 or 3 years, and these
updates provided by NCSL, but again, it&#39;s the first time North
Carolina isn&#39;t included.
At the time this survey was done last fall, it was too soon for North
Carolina to say that we had a revenue shortfall; the trends were just
not there at the time and so we&#39;re not counted in those numbers.
Again, what are the top issues that other states are facing? North
Carolina isn&#39;t really that different than most states. Most states
continue to struggle with Medicaid, and how to curtail spending.
Some are obviously grappling with how to provide coverage, but for the
most part, most of them are still seeing the trend that has been steady
for the last decade, and that is the growth in spending for Medicaid and
health care.
21 states are dealing with education funding, state tax policy and
transportation. Although we don&#39;t focus as heavily on
transportation, because it has its own funding source, of course you all
are currently involved in conversations about what to do about North
Carolina&#39;s transportation needs as well.
So, what do we see for the budget outlook for the 2015 session in
particular? What we do in fiscal research is throughout the year, when
you are not in session, is we monitor the implementation of the budget,
and we monitor what issues, what things are coming up, what&#39;s going
on, and we identify, we continuously identify what the pressures are in
anticipation of your coming into session and having to deal with them.
So this represents the collective wisdom of your fiscal research staff,
for the most part. What I&#39;m going to present to you will not be
exhaustive. It&#39;s really the high level and most significant areas
that we identify for your consideration. It is by no means an indication
of something you will have to do, but it&#39;s areas that we know that
you will be confronted with this session.
When we put together a budget outlook, the first thing we do is we look
at the base budget. In previous years, that was referred to as the
continuation budget, but in the 2014 session, the general assembly
changed that definition to clarify, specifically what was to be counted
as a base, a beginning point in building the budget.
What it does include, and what we have not yet received but we&#39;re
expecting any day now, the base budget from the McCrory administration,
is the number, the amount of money needed to continue funding programs
at the current level. Not to reflect any inflationary increases, or the
things that have traditionally been included in the budget, but just a
clean base budget.
It does, the law currently as written does allow the executive branch to
annualize partially funded programs, and to fund federal payroll tax
changes, but very little else, so we would expect the budget to be
pretty straightforward in terms of the base.

  <p id="40:00">
  is what we&#39;re using as of today as our best numbers in just looking
at what the budget outlook is like. We know by way of funding
commitments, again, teacher pay to $35,000, you can see how much that
would cost. Broughton Hospital is supposed to come online within the
next biennium, and while that money as originally appropriated in the
last biennium, that money was taken out last session and so that&#39;s
for equipment for that hospital in order to be open and operate over the
next biennium. Again, some of these things are must-do&#39;s, the Job
Maintenance and Capital Development Fund, many of you know that this
represents a commitment. No grants can be given without the
appropriation, but to the extent that the Department of Commerce is
already planning to make some commitments, we feel like this is another
budget pressure you&#39;ll have to deal with. It is a typical budget
pressure for the General Assembly. So, in addition to those budget
pressure, which we would ordinarily say these are sort of on a list
separate and apart from what we&#39;re going to talk about now. The next
set of pressures are those things that you dealt with over the last
biennium, they are issues that come up periodically for the General
Assembly and so we&#39;ve included them. Last session you funded
economic development in the Film Incentives Grants to the tune of $30M.
That was nonrecurring, it hasn&#39;t been used yet. Those are areas
where you probably are going to talk about it. Some folks are talking
about the film incentives in particular. So we include those as other
budget pressures. The historic tax credits have gotten a lot of interest
and so we included an estimate of $9.6M for those tax credits. The
Housing Loan Program, which is usually a pretty popular program for the
General Assembly, $10M was appropriated last session. There may be a
strong interest in keeping that amount of money in for the next
biennium. There are a couple items we call structural budget items,
where we have a recurring receipt problem in our state psychiatric
hospitals, $10M, those things we&#39;ve included as well. They&#39;ve
been carrying that deficit on for a while. It may have gotten smaller
but it&#39;s still sizable and we would add that to the budget
pressures. And then most of you are aware of a desire that&#39;s been
expressed as intent in legislative language to eliminate the transfer
from the Highway Fund over to the DPI for driver&#39;s education for
public schools. That&#39;s about $26M. In the current budget it&#39;s
nonrecurring so you&#39;ll either have to replace that money or phase it
out, create fees, increase fees, whatever is necessary to fund it but
whatever it is, whether it costs you or not, we put it on here as a
pressure. We know that will be something you&#39;ll talk about. The last
set of budget pressures are the ones that involve some of the things
that we always look at as a budget pressure and that has to do with
your, primarily with your state work force. The cost for 1% for state
employee salary increases is $134M, that includes teachers as well. If
you were to give a corresponding increase for retirees, that amount is
about $39M. Other state employee pay plans, as I mentioned earlier,
there&#39;s some talk about funding areas of the new teacher schedule,
it&#39;s called the teacher step increase, it&#39;s about $65M. Let me
say, because I know there&#39;s some folks who know that we typically do
are take adjustments in the education budget to true up the numbers so
that we balance out some, let me see if I can get this straight without
confusing you. We know that when we budget we don&#39;t have the best
information so we look at it and we assume all the teachers are being
hired at a certain level and then after some time we get better
information and so we&#39;re able to adjust the budget. At this point,
the $65M makes a certain set of assumptions but we know that there could
be a technical adjustment that would bring that number down and the
adjustment would just be to bring it to actuals. So more in line with
what we think the real experience levels are for teachers. We don&#39;t
have that factored in here as we would normally not have because we
don&#39;t know at this point, but we do know that that could be
adjusted. The other pay plans are the Highway Patrol, Magistrates and
Clerks of Court, those are all statutory pay plans and

  <p id="45:00">
  To fund those would be $7.2 million. We mentioned the court system
funding because we&#39;ve heard quite a bit from members about the need
there. There&#39;s an estimate of about $50 million if you were to fund
their formulas for how they should be staffed. Capitol, we know
there&#39;s just a backlog of capitol issues and again, savings reserve
and the RNR funds are areas that the general assembly typically tries to
make some appropriation into. Just to give you some magnitude of what
these numbers would look like if you put it all together, the budget
pressures that we mentioned before that are those things that we feel
like you&#39;re probably going to have to deal with, it&#39;s a little
over $500 million. So you had a $500 million balance when you looked at
the base budget, here&#39;s $500 million in budget pressures. Those
numbers could be adjusted, but that pretty much wipes out the balance.
The rest of this is about $400 million. So you&#39;re talking about $900
million right off the bat. Of course, some of that could be adjusted
downward for a variety of reasons. But this list is by no means, by no
means exhaustive. We have a long list of budget pressures that we&#39;ve
identified. These are the ones that we would bring to your attention
just based on the information we have and to give you some idea about
what your outlook is in going into the budget process. Mister chairman,
that concludes my remarks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Karen. Now if, Dr. Boardman, if you could come up as well and
Ms. Hammond, if you could stay right there. Appreciate your
presentation, and now we will take questions. Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. For Dr. Boardman, I read a lot about reduction in revenue.
I&#39;m over here if you need to see me. You don&#39;t. Is the 2.9%
growth in revenue over the prior year. If you adjust for inflation and
population, is that an increase, a decrease, or can you get that to a ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually that, it&#39;s something we, we look at. We kind of, it&#39;s
kind of a sanity check. What is inflation doing with respect to overall
prices, population growth. The 2.9% growth in, in 14-15 really fairly,
fairly well aligns with the estimates for population and inflation
growth, which is between 2.8 and 3.0, so it&#39;s, it&#39;s right in
there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. Just real quickly, looking back at last
year&#39;s budget and the way that it was balanced in the short session.
If I recall correctly, there was $152 million in one time money that was
used to balance that budget. Do you take into account in any of your
budget pressures the, the way that we balanced the budget last year and
what kind of impact that&#39;s gonna have going forward?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One of the things we do, Senator Ford. One of the things we do is we, we
along with the budget office, we, we create a base. We take out all
those kinds of things. We remove any nonrecurring spending. For example,
we usually have a sizable appropriation for nonrecurring items, so when
you match the recurring and nonrecurring spending and revenue, it
usually balanced out. Over the, over the years, the district, the split
between recurring and nonrecurring revenue has improved significantly
since the Great Recession and so we don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a
big problem. We do take it into consideration. We look more, we&#39;re
more in tune with it though as we move through the process to see where
the spending is coming from. So.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. One quick followup. When will you have the
Medicaid number? I know you had mentioned the governor coming over with
his budget, but to me that&#39;s the pink elephant in the room.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well,  I&#39;m gonan try to answer the question, but I certainly
don&#39;t have the answer about when we&#39;ll have it, because as you
know, the process is that we wait typically for the executive branch to
provide the budget to us. I will say that our staff has an ongoing, have
ongoing meetings with the executive branch, focusing the human health
and resources as well as state budget, monitoring and looking through
numbers, so that we&#39;re all on the same page. We may not agree with
the final number, but we know what the assumptions are and we have the
same numbers we&#39;re working from. As to when we&#39;ll have it, I
think that&#39;s probably not going to be for a while, but we do

  <p id="50:00">
  Expect at this point, we’ve been told that we can expect the Governor’s
budget by the end of the month, early March, so. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Micheaux. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Mr. Chairman. Dr.
Boardman first, and then I have a question for Miss Hammon White. Dr.
Boardman, I’m interested in the statement in your report concerning a
lower refunds and high final payments. And I’m trying to interpolate
that and move it over into what that means for the average taxpayer.
There’s some concern there as to actually what that means. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It’s a good question because it’s difficult to wrap one’s mind
around the fact that you have tax, your actual tax liability, and that’s
the actual tax that you owe, versus what the average taxpayer say, has
taken out of their paycheck. Those two never align perfectly, or rarely
align perfectly. So at the end of the, end of the tax year, the
taxpayer’s going to have to file and expect some refund if they’re used
to it. What’s, what is happening now with the new tax rate, it’s a flat
rate so it’s fairly easy to build a very tight withholding table. Here’s
your rate, here’s your income, here’s what we withhold. And because of
that, you don’t have as much variance. So that same taxpayer, without
getting into what their tax liability may be, that same taxpayer may
have been accustomed to getting 400 dollar refund. They may file their
taxes this year and find that it’s only a hundred dollar refund. Their
liability may have actually gone down, but they’re looking at that
refund and saying, “Oh, I’m not getting as big a refund as I used to.”
And it’s just because the withholding tables are much more tightly
aligned with, with actual liability. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, can I
follow up, Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] One follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] On this one. Then, going to the high final payment portion of
that, Mr. ?? could you go into a little bit more detail on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. The final payments for example, itemized
deductions. Itemized deductions were constrained. There’s a cap now of
20,000 dollars that can only be applied to your property tax, and your
real estate interest on that property, and unlimited charitable
contributions. Other types of deductions, if your mortgage interest is
higher than 20,000, you’re constrained to max by 20. Taxpayers
throughout the year are not going to make adjustments, either in their
withholding or their estimates, based on some of the subtleties of these
base-broadenings. We also eliminated for business income, the 50,000
exemption, and that too we didn’t observe when that was instituted,
taxpayers making lower estimated payments. They waited to make smaller
finals. This kind of flips that on its head. They didn’t start making
higher estimated payments, but they’ll make a higher final payment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for one more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, for this is for Miss Hammon ??. Karen, actually
on here on page 26, this dealing with the preliminary base budget and
the balance remaining. I guess what I’m getting at is the preliminary
base budget figure is the actual budget figure, actual budget figure we
have for this year on the projections, something like 5, we’re going to
have 540 million dollars more to make up in addition to these pressure
things, which if I’m not mistaken, you did say it could amount to about
900 million dollars. Is that what I’m hearing? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Micheaux, the number on page 26 of your handout refers to
the amount of funds available for appropriations. The 900 million
dollars was a total amount of the other pages that deal with budget
pressure. So yes, when you look at it, if you in fact did nothing but
tried to spend 900 million dollars more, you’d have a shortfall. But
this doesn’t, we don’t make any assumptions about adjustments. We know
there’ll be technical adjustments. We know there are areas in for
example, you may actually use lottery for, to fund some of the needs.
That’s not accounted for in the 900 million. There are a variety of ways
that you can address that and obviously the way it’s been done for as
long as I’ve been here, is a combination of

  Additional revenue and budget reductions. So we expect that may be a
combination.[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would just observe that contrary to the
situation 4 years ago when we had  a two and a half billion dollar hole
we now have revenue that is there and I think we&#39;ll be able to tie
those ends together rather well this year. Representative Iler.[SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr Chairman. Miss Hammond Blanks on several of your
charts right here on several of your charts you refer to public schools
and universities do those anywhere include community colleges or are
they just not significant enough to be on the chart? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Community colleges are definitely significant but since the first time
since the Great Recession we&#39;re actually not seeing a projected need
for additional enrollment growth for the community colleges as a matter
of fact the flat and there&#39;s a thought that there will be a decline
because people are working people are not there are not as many people
enrolling in Community Colleges [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. One quick
follow up. So when you address teacher pay for public schools and
universities does that include community colleges anywhere?[SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes when we say the 1 percent for state employees it includes
public school teachers universities etc. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Bryant. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr.Chair I have two questions one for
Miss Hammond Blanks and one for Dr.Boardman. Miss Hammonds Blanks you
mentioned that in responding to Senator Ford that you backed out of your
budget estimate the one time items funded with with one time monies. I
think that&#39;s correct. So I remember there was some ADHS items like
maybe child care subsidies that was funded with Tana funds so would my
understanding be your base budget would not include child care subsidies
or some of those other items, I don&#39;t remember what they all were.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The new definition for base budget what we&#39;re
expecting to get from the governor&#39;s office or administration is a
budget that would include the restoration of those non recurring cuts. I
believe those cuts were non recurring because they used federal money to
back fill we would expect to see that fully funded in the base budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you and is that in your figure on the follow up
Mr.Chair is that in your figure is that in the figures[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is. It&#39;s included in the 28 billion.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.
Dr.Boardman on the issue of personal income lagging and sales tax
corporate tax slide 3 I have a two-fold question 1 is the sales tax
figure I mean I&#39;m assuming that includes the changes in electricity
natural gas whatever changes we made and I&#39;m curious as to how the
corporate tax and franchise tax are ahead and yep personal income is
lagging any other reasons aside from the fact that you have more people
out of work that can be hired I guess or something.[SPEAKER CHANGES] The
sales tax numbers when we develop those numbers and the target we
incorporate all all those changes so the move for the pipe natural gas
and electricity and the sales tax we make those adjustments and then say
what are our expectations. So the 2.3% is over and above after we&#39;ve
made those adjustments. The difference right now in wage growth I think
you said it&#39;s just the labor market has had a lot slack in it and
we&#39;re seeing that finally go away. That doesn&#39;t say that the
overall hasn&#39;t been improving we still see that in corporate income
collection which are up slightly. I will note that the forecast actually
three or four years of good corporate income we actually see flattening
out during the again in the bianum it&#39;s a fairly volatile source
that we&#39;ve seen swings of 20 25 percent. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]representative Fisher[SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you Mr Chairman. Hi
I&#39;m over here. First of all I want to thank you for a really concise
presentation I appreciate that basic and my question first to
Dr.Boardman is you mention in one of the slides upward pressure on on
wages and I would like to hear how you see that manifesting itself.

  Situation where as I mentioned we, we had significant loss in
employment. With respect to total non farm employment, really it was
just this fall that our employment numbers actually recovered to where
they were in February 2008. Imagine if you can, a big trough. Well, we
finally got out of that, that trough. As we move out that, employers
looking for folks are gonna find fewer and fewer folks waiting on the
sidelines to find a job, and that will, we forecast, will put more
pressure on employers to not only keep employees, as they have
flexibility to move with more wages, but have to offer higher wages to
bring some of those folks off the sidelines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and a, a, a, an additional question to Ms. ?? please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we&#39;re gonna need to speed these up. Want to make sure I get to
at least everybody one time before we leave.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is quick, quick one. You talk about savings reserve when you go
over the budget, and I wondered, is there, and it&#39;s good to see that
that&#39;s increased over the different budget years, but wondering is
there an expected amount of money that should be put into savings
reserve from the legislature each biennium? Because I know that we
typically have raided that fund from time to time for weather disasters
and the like. Is there a recommended amount?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s a good question. Our current law says that there&#39;s an 8%
goal of the operating budget, but I recently read a report that was done
that there really is no good rule of thumb. Some states have gone with
5% and don&#39;t have any idea why it was 5%. We went with eight because
that&#39;s pretty much what in North Carolina is the standard, and, but
we&#39;ve not, we&#39;ve not come close to the 8% obviously. But 8% is
what current law says.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. Although not part of your presentation this
morning, it seems like to get a better post on the economic viability of
our state, it would be helpful to have a sense of what our unfunded
liability is for retiree healthcare, for the debt that our state has,
and how that&#39;s gonna be paid off. In addition to our pension
obligations, how fully funded that is. Would it be possible to get that
information to the members?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chair. My question is for Ms. Karen but ??. What impact
would it have had on the budget if we had accepted Medicaid expansion
for three consecutive years in total federal dollars? Is there any
information available on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don&#39;t have that information. I&#39;m looking to. Mister Chairman,
if there&#39;s answer to that question, that&#39;s gonna have to be
deferred to our Health and Human Services team.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, well, someone can get you the answer to that question. I
would reserve that in expansion states they are spending more money than
they had originally budgeted for that in state dollars, and that&#39;s
been a trend in most of those states.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko. Do, did you have another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I had one last question. On page 27, budget pressures, you had
other funding commitments. Does that include all except the above in
terms of the total budget, or are those some specific items that
you&#39;re referring to here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let&#39;s see. The other funding commitments actually is on the next
page where you see funding commitments, so those are very specific.
Again, I do want to clarify that we have a laundry list of these things
that I just selected the most significant ones to, to give you some
perspective.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. I wanna ask Barry a question. He and I have
talked about this briefly and just to comment before I do that, I

  Barry, Part of the Affordable Care Act determined what was part -time
help at 30 hours and you and I briefly talked about this, I think what
has happened, especially on wages, is because a lot of companies with
over 50 employees are trying to hire more part-time help to avoid the
insurance piece that the Affordable Care Act has implemented. Do you
agree with that, or how do you see that playing out, and I know
there&#39;s some legislation, possibly in Washington, to raise that to
40 hours and how that may play out as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s a good question. It&#39;s one that, unfortunately, the data I
work with doesn&#39;t allow me to put that fine a point on it and
measure it but certainly any time you&#39;re putting constraints in the
labor market it can have distortion, such that people that might be
willing to work for a 40 hour wage would not entertain the idea of say a
25-hour job for whatever reason. If those at the margin, those kind of
decisions are being made, then it could have some impact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My question is for Ms. Hammonds-Blanks and
relates to several items on pages 28 and 30. Just for clarification in
my mind, I&#39;m concerned about whether some of these budget pressure
numbers overlap. For example, on page 28 there&#39;s the teacher paid at
$35,000 at $41,850,000 but if you flip over to page 30, I understood you
to say that teachers were included in the state employee salary
increases that&#39;s $134M and then other state employee pay plans
there&#39;s teacher step increases, $65M, and I don&#39;t know whether
highway patrol, magistrates, and clerks at $7.2M is included in the
state employee salary of 1% and $134M above or if it&#39;s a separate
item. Can you maybe clarify that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Representative Blackwell. The $134M is just 1% for all employees,
including teachers. There was a time when teachers and the others with
separate pay plans would get their step, their plans paid for, so
they&#39;d be able to get their step increase and a 1% cost of living
adjustment. So we&#39;ve separated them out. Obviously the General
Assembly can deviate from that but if you were to just give 1% to all
employees and not fund the pay plans, that&#39;s the $134M. So
they&#39;re not doubled up, they&#39;re not the same numbers, and
that&#39;s why we present them as separately.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With respect to the teacher&#39;s step increase of $65M, how does that
relate to the $35,000 on page 28? Is that $41,850,000 just to raise
teachers who are below $35,000 to $35,000 and no one else?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And then the teacher&#39;s step increase on page 30, does that relate to
people who would be raised to the $35,000 or is it just with people who
would be over $35,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s the amount needed to give everybody on the pay plan their,
just to bring them to their next step if they&#39;re entitled to a step.
The other portion is to raise that step for the zero, I think it&#39;s
zero to four, up to $35,000. So it&#39;s not doubled up, in other words.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and my question has to do with Medicaid and it
follows-up, I think, on some of the other questions that have been
asked. Karen, you said that over the past ten years there&#39;s been a
significant increase in our Medicaid budget and in our enrollment and I
got some figures yesterday from Steven Owen about the growth and the
number of people who qualified for Medicaid. So in an economic downturn
you would expect the enrollment to go up and as, economic downturn you
expect enrollment to go up, people lose their jobs, they become
qualified for medicaid, and Mr. Boardman talked about how we we&#39;re
going to have a 3.5% increase projected in wages, you thought, over the
next biennium, and so as wages go up and as people return to jobs,
wouldn&#39;t you expect the growth in the Medicaid budget

  enrollment growth for the universities, for Medicaid, for public
schools. It would have included inflation but this base budget excludes
those items. So the numbers you&#39;re looking at there would be,
basically, the current budget adjusted by nonrecurring and fully funding
items and the only real increases would be for leases, if there are
contracts that have some sort of agreement already in place, those would
be included as increases, but other than that we pretty much are
expecting it to be relatively flat. So there is a significant
difference. In answer to your question about the revenue number, yes,
the 21.4B already takes in to account the shortfall for this current
fiscal year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The objective there is to make sure we have the greatest degree of
budget transparency in terms of what goes into the budget and what the
elements are so that&#39;s the reason for those changes that you see.
Any further questions? If not, thank you for coming this morning and the
committee stands adjourned.
