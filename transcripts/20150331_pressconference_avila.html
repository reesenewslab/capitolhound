  I think I&#39;ll go ahead. We&#39;ve got a little bit of ground to cover
today and I think two minutes will start a good reputation for us. My
name is Marilyn Avila, I represent House District 40 here in Wake County
and I&#39;m here today, along with my cosponsors and supporters, to
present House Bill 399, Young Offenders&#39; Rehabilitation Act. This is
actually our second presentation in the House. It was voted on
unanimously and in a bipartisan strong vote in the last session and went
to the Senate and sat. So we are taking it back through the House again
and hopefully this time we&#39;ll make more progress in the Senate
because it is a bill whose time has come. I think we&#39;ve seen through
the adult system with a lot of the reevaluation of our criminal justice
system with Justice Reinvestment Act and things of that nature that our
entire system needs to be looked at. And our juvenile justice system has
been overlooked and particularly for North Carolina and New York, the
only two states who still put 16 and 17-year-old defendants in the adult
system, we need to change that. We have recognized the fact that, for
misdemeanants, most of those charges come from a couple of different
things, primarily stupidity because of the teenage brain that&#39;s just
not ready for the thought process of cause and effect and rational
thinking and with spur of the moment, and be able to stand up to peer
pressure and unfortunately, being int he wrong place at the wrong time,
in a lot of cases. We end up with young people at the at the age of 16
and 1 with a criminal record that is scarring them for future
employment, education, military, anything that would reflect badly if
you&#39;re asked have you ever been charged? I feel like that, as we
have educated people more and more about the issues regarding this
group, that we found in today&#39;s day and age our young people
aren&#39;t held to a high level of responsibility early like we were in
the past. We had greater responsibilities at an earlier age and some of
that inability to think was more or less controlled by your environment,
by your role models, by your parents, by the society around you and
unfortunately too many of our children today don&#39;t have that
positive influence and are suffering because of it and because we have a
criminal justice system that has been set like this for decades. So we
are moving forward in a very measured way. We found that 48 states who
have changed their laws have done it in a number of cases the very same
way that North Carolina&#39;s proposing to do it and that is on a very
systematic, methodical way of introducing cohorts into the system slowly
in preparation financially to be able to handle it as well as from a
physical standpoint of having the right people int he right place.
Because the juvenile justice system is best because it does offer quite
a bit of intervention and help with youth in programs geared to what
their problems might be. So one of the issues, and I know we&#39;ve
heard from Chief Justice Martin recently how underfunded our entire
court system is and we recognize that fact, and for that reason
there&#39;s a four year implementation period to prepare the system for
this new influx of defendants. Surprisingly enough, however, in
discussing this issue with other states who have gone about this same
process, they have found that, contrary to what conventional wisdom is,
that there&#39;s going to be this huge tsunami of young people entering
the system and this great, huge, tremendous cost has not borne out to be
the case at all. So we feel like, with four years of preparation, of
studying what we have available, what we&#39;ll need, and begin to plan
for that we will be very prepared and have a system that can seamlessly
and easily and efficiently take these young people in, give them the
services that they need, and have them set on a path for productive life
as citizens of North Carolina.

  <p id="05:00">
  I am very fortunate to have had a lot of firm support and help from my
colleagues in the House and people from the community who know a lot
more on the ground issues than I do. They&#39;ve educated me and
influenced me a great deal for a system that I didn&#39;t have any
practical experience with, through my own children, of understanding
what the issues are out there. They&#39;ve made it very real for me and
it&#39;s become something that I am extremely passionate about. I&#39;d
like to recognize my cosponsors and give them an opportunity to explain
to you why they feel the way they do, and what has driven their concern
for this particular area. At this time I&#39;d like to ask
Representative Jean Farmer-Butterfield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative Avila. This is something that is near and dear to my
heart. It is near and dear to my constituents as well. Since I came to
the Legislature in 2003, I&#39;ve had many families talk to me about
family members who could not get admission to college, who could not get
jobs, and indeed could not get financial assistance because of previous
actions that they took or their family member took at an early age. We
know that, in looking at the research, 16- and 17-year-olds are still
children developmentally. In fact, their brains will not be fully formed
until age 25, and they lack the ability to control impulse. So indeed,
why do we treat them as if they are adults? The developmental period for
all of us is an important time for rehabilitation. It is important for
adolescents, in terms of being receptive to change. Unlike some of us
adults, they respond to proven interventions. And indeed, they can learn
to be more responsible to choices. So when we put 16- and 17-year-olds
in adult prisons, we are talking about them being sexually abused,
physically abused, and emotionally abused many times, if not most of the
time or all of the time. We are also talking them being molded and
shaped by adult prisoners who are many times life-long criminals. They
are hardened criminals. So why would we want to put them in this
particular situation? Studies have found that youths in the adult
criminal justice system are 36 times more likely to commit suicide. And
indeed they are arrested 34% more often for felony crimes than their
peers in the juvenile system. To me, this deal makes sense. It makes for
better outcomes for youth. It reduces recidivism. And it keeps
communities safer from violent crime. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I
have Representative Jonathan Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
I&#39;m glad to be here. I&#39;m Representative Jonathan jordan. I
represent District 93, which is Ashe and Watauga Counties up in the
northwest corner. Most of my background has been on the Child Protective
Services side, with the Department of Social Services. So I&#39;m more
familiar with nonsecure custody than secure custody. But as
Representative Farmer-Butterfield just said, a lot of the children who
do commit the crimes have some of these abuse, neglect, and dependency
in their backgrounds. The reason I&#39;m on this bill is for several
reasons. First of all to protect public safety. Despite the changes that
we are making, prosecutors and judges are still going to have the
ability to transfer to the adult system 13-year-old and up that are
charged with felonies. So they still have that discretion there, and I
think that&#39;s one reason we need to try to bring the prosecutors on
with us. The second is to reduce crime and the recidivism rates. One
state study that I looked at found an 85% increase in rearrest among
juveniles charged in the adult system versus those retained in the
juvenile system. Another found the rate of reoffense twice as high from
the adult system. And the review of several studies fond an average of
33.7% increase in rearrest rates among those juveniles in the adult
court system. I think this is probably the most fiscally responsible
response we can have as well. Maybe in the short term there are apparent
savings. But they are going to be overwhelmed in the long term by all
the costs associated with higher rates of recidivism.

  <p id="10:00">
  And finally I think it&#39;s best for our juveniles. There is a lack of
educational access in the adult system versus the juvenile system. And
the minors in the adult system are 50% more likely to be attacked by
fellow inmates with weapons. And as Representative Farmer-Butterfield
mentioned, greater risk of suicide is suggested by limited studies.
I&#39;m glad to be on this bill with my cosponsors. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] At this time I would like to recognize another sponsor,
Representative Duane Hall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Duane Hall, Wade County. As
Representative Avila mentioned, 48 other states already have some type
of juvenile system. This bill is a long time coming. It&#39;s something
that this Legislature has probably worked on different versions of for
almost 20 years now. This is the first one I think we have a very strong
possibility of passing, mainly because we have such strong bipartisan
support. Last session we passed almost this identical bill through the
House with a strong bipartisan vote of 77 to 33. And the limited
objections we got were mainly centered around costs. So one of the paths
we&#39;re going to take this time is to make it clear that this is going
to save taxpayer dollars. The Conservative North Carolina Bankers
Association is quoted as saying this is going to save North Carolina
taxpayers money. The John Locke Foundation put that estimation at about
$52 million a year. Lots of cost reasons. But beyond that, we&#39;re
doing this because it&#39;s just the right thing to do. I worked as a
trial attorney for a lot of years. And during that time I probably took
hundreds of juvenile cases. The overwhelming majority of those cases
were first-time misdemeanor offenses. Examples were the 16-year-old girl
who steals a bracelet at the mall. A 17-year-old boy who gets in a fight
at a high school football game. Or when either of those got caught
drinking beer at a high school party afterwards. And that&#39;s what
this bill is. It&#39;s just for first-time misdemeanor offenses. Even
the most simple felony is not included under this bill, something like
uttering a forged instrument. Writing a $20 bad check to Domino&#39;s
would not be included in the bill. It also does not protect repeat
offenders. If that same boy that got in a fight gets caught for drinking
later, it&#39;s not covered under this bill. The reason this bill was
needed in my opinion is to protect our youth against first-time youthful
indiscretions. The best way to lay out that example is, a 16-year-old
that is charged with something minor like that in the states of
Virginia, South Carolina, Tennessee. They may have committed the exact
same act. But because their state has a juvenile system, when they go to
apply to college or for a job, for the rest of their life there&#39;s
going to be a disadvantage here in North Carolina to the person who
doesn&#39;t have a permanent adult conviction. There are lots of other
practical reasons, cost saving reasons, Representative ?? behind me, my
seat mate, mentioned the recidivism rate. So we&#39;re excited to
introduce this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I have a couple of
people who have a lot of practical real-world experience I would love to
call on today. They have educated me mightily in what the effects of
what we&#39;re trying to do here could be in the positive realm of
helping young people in the state of North Carolina. I&#39;d like to ask
Judge Marcia Morey. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. I&#39;m Marcia
Morey, Chief District Court Judge in Durham. I&#39;m an ardent supporter
of this bill. It&#39;s the right thing to do. If any of you did my job,
and you would sit in the criminal court that I just left, and you see a
16-year-old in front of you. And as the Judge I would take about 60
seconds to address the plea, to tell them to go to Probation, to pay the
fine, pay the costs, and good luck. I know the consequences of that.
That 16-year-old does not. It is indelible on his life, his future,
getting into college, of getting that first job, on a misdemeanor
charge. If that same 16-year-old had been 15 years old three months
earlier, I would see him in the Juvenile Court. I would look into the
educational records. Hear from the parents. Do we have substance abuse
issues? What are the remedial education needs this child has? We would
address everything with the whole family. And we would be much more
successful with that first-time juvenile in our courts that we certainly
can absorb. It&#39;s a passionate issue. This is a bill about the future
of North Carolina

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] As children. I cannot stress how important it is.
We&#39;ve done it, we&#39;ve argued it before, it&#39;s been delayed.
This is the year, this is the time. It&#39;s for our youth. Thank you,
thank you. Colombo?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m a little on the ch-vertically challenged side.
Thank you ma&#39;am, I appreciate the opprtunity to come again here to
Raleigh to speak about this extremely important bill. I&#39;ve got 30
years in the law enforcement profession. The last 14 years here in New
Bern as the Police Chief. My experience in Florida, they have, they
treat 16 and 17 year olds as juveniles, and when I got here, I was
shocked to find out that we could just book them and be done with them.
Quaint thing from a law enforcement efficiency persective. It&#39;s very
easy to arrest a 16 year old, take him down to county jail, book him,
and be back on the road in like 20 minutes. Much more difficult with a
juvenile because you gotta worry about who they&#39;re getting turned
over to and all of the follow-up issues and everything, you know.
There&#39;s so many technical things that you have to worry about. so
from a chief&#39;s perspective and a law enforcement perspective, you
could understand the desire to keep things the way they are. So it&#39;s
easy, the only trouble is easy isn&#39;t right. And that&#39;s the big
problem. It&#39;s not right to take a 16 year old child-don&#39;t get me
wrong-I don&#39;t think the child ought to be let loose and
everything&#39;s okay, don&#39;t worry you&#39;ve committed a crime.
They need to pay if they committed a crime. They need to pay, but they
need to pay appropriately. You know, my colleagues have a problem, some
of my colleagues have a problem with this bill and the logic that I get
every time I talk about it is the same. Well when I&#39;m going to hire
a police officer or a deputy, I want to know what&#39;s in their
background, and if this juvenile thing goes through I&#39;m not going to
know that at 16 year old, 16 years old, they committed crimes. And my
argument to you is this, the only people that get punished because of
our law the way it is today are North Carolina kids that are applying
for police jobs and deputy&#39;s jobs. Because if a Virginia kid or a
Florida kid applies for the same job, the sheriff or the chief
doesn&#39;t know about their record. They only know about the North
Carolina kid&#39;s record. So the same kid juvenile background, the
North Carolina kid gets punished by not getting that job and the
Virginia kid doesn&#39;t get punished and gets the job. It&#39;s not, it
doesn&#39;t even make sense and you know, if you&#39;re, if you think
about it from a practical persepective, you would expect that with such
a harsh treatment of 16 and 17 year olds, that North Carolina would be
so much better in the area of those kids 16 and 17 year olds committing
crime, right? We should, it should be way lower than the surrounding
states. The problem is it&#39;s not. The surrounding states 16 and 17
year old crime rate is almost identical to the North Carolina 16 and 17
year old crime rate. So what are we accomplishing other than punishing
our kids not just for the crime that they committed as a stupid kid
because they&#39;re stupid. I mean most of them are stupid. But it&#39;s
not just that, it&#39;s making them pay for that crime for their entire
life. And I&#39;ll tell you what, when I started here in North Carolina
with the Structured Sentencing Commission-I was commissioner on that
commission-and we discussed this thing, that was 13 and a half years
ago. We&#39;re still taking about it. You know what? It&#39;s time to
stop talking and do this thing. it&#39;s the right thing to do. It&#39;s
right for the criminal justice system, it&#39;s right for the safety of
our citizens, and it&#39;s right for our kids. I saw them coming in,
there&#39;s busloads of them out there, you can&#39;t miss them, right?
If you don&#39;t change this law, those kids out there, bunches of them
are going to commit misdemeanors and they&#39;re going to be subject to
a lifelong payment of that stupid mistake that they make. Let&#39;s look
at those kids and let&#39;s make this thing happen, once and for all.
I&#39;ve got a grandkid now, he&#39;s five. I hope that before he gets
to be 16 we&#39;ve settled this issue. Thank you very much and thank you
ma&#39;am I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Chief Colombo. At this time, I would like to
open the floor for any questions from anyone. Yes Laura?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What reason has the Senate given, if any for its, its
reluctance to hear this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There really wasn&#39;t a reason the last time. This
has been a very strategic kind of, let&#39;s hear it in committee,
let&#39;s get it to the floor, let&#39;s get it out of the House,
let&#39;s get it to the Senate, because it has been a very long
educational process for a lot of people. We do have a lot of people who,
in my party, who are very much into the you&#39;ve done the crime

  <p id="20:00">
  we do the time mentality and it&#39;s just taken time to begin to
understand that, in this particular case, that we are actually doing
more damage based on what we&#39;d be able to do if we took a different
approach. Any others?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What are your plans on dealing with felonies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There will be no changes as far as felonies go. This is only
misdemeanors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that a long range goal there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m very short-term. I want to make the change for misdemeanors.
It&#39;s probably around 80% of the charges that we have in this age
group anyway so I feel like our time and energy and moneys is better
spent focusing on what the main issue is. Yes, ma&#39;am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will there be any plan for 16 and 17-year-olds that have already been
convicted of misdemeanors to go back and reverse that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not at this time. We&#39;re moving forward. If we see that the benefits
and the way you handle crimes, the way you work with people who&#39;ve
committed crimes in the past, we change the ways of dealing with them,
we&#39;ll look at that down the road but right now we&#39;re just taking
this first step in a very cautious way and a way that I think we can
work it out, improve it, and then have the success drive whatever comes
after that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How many 16 and 17-year-olds are affected each year by the current law
in this state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me check with, hold on just one second, Rob, do you have an idea? I
haven&#39;t seen the latest numbers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think there&#39;s about 30,000 in the system all-together, 16 and
17-year-olds, but we don&#39;t know each year how many enter or are
entering and being dealt with on an annual basis. I&#39;ll get back to
you on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can find a yearly type, but it is in the thousands. I&#39;ve heard
numbers bouncing around in my head of 6-8,000 but that&#39;s a couple
years back so I&#39;d have to get the latest data on that. Any other
questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any mechanism for, today how much option does a person have to expunge
something from 16-17-years-old?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I haven&#39;t looked at that recently but there is a process for that.
The trouble is it&#39;s a long period of time and they lose that time in
terms of being able to be in an active education system and be in an
active work situation while they sit and wait and time is something,
when you&#39;ve lost it you can&#39;t make it up, so I feel like we need
to be proactive and start at the beginning, not say, &quot;Oh,
you&#39;ve committed a crime, sit and wait a while and if you behave
yourself we&#39;ll wipe your record clean and let you start from
there.&quot; I think being proactive, or more cautious...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It takes money to get expunged.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh yeah, I think I&#39;ve heard like $4,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, yeah. That&#39;s another issue. It does take a legal process. Are
there any, no more questions or whatever, are there comments from the
audience of people? I want to take a minute and embarrass somebody. I
would like to recognize Brandy Bynum in the audience. She has been my
mentor I guess on this particular project and has spent an awful amount
of time educating me and standing with me when I got discouraged and
helping me get through the tough times with it. Thanks so much.
