services, independent living services and the provision of assisted
technologies are critical to their success. I want to also mention our
state operated health facilities. There are fourteen of them, with
eleven thousand five hundred employees that operate partially using the
two hundred and seventy five million dollars in state appropriations
that this body makes available. We offer reduced cost medications to
tens of thousands of North Carolinians. When needed medications are
available fewer emergency room visits are necessary. With the limited
time that we are offered we are only able to cover a fraction of what we
do, but let me leave you with a few of those things that we manage that
are less known to the average person. We regulate tattooing, tanning and
jails. We manage a number of registries to ensure that no one that
should not be working with our children or vulnerable adults has that
opportunity. We play a large role in the preparedness and recovery of
emergency medical situations and natural disasters and we operate a
state of the art health lab. And a last service to leave you with but
definitely not least of importance-- we manage a radiation protection
section and work with the radiation protection commission to promulgate
rules, ensuring again our safety. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you
committee members for your time and this opportunity to come before you
and share. Madam Chair, at this time I'd like to recognize our secretary
for additional comments if that's appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Thank you. Secretary Bosch.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Sharon. So as you see, in our department we really do owe
quite a large diversity of stuff and it effects a lot of people. We are
in a period of enormous change right now in our health care. What we do
at HHS effects not only the budget for this year or next year. It will
greatly effect the future of the children and the grandchildren of North
Carolina. Our actions at HHS will be consequential. Now let me tell you
how I found the department and how it was run on day one when I showed
up. When I first came to the department people, our staff, was bringing
papers to my office, dropping them off. The papers had no name, no
contact information and asking me for signatures for something that
needed to be done urgently. One day and one of my first days in the
office a high level staffer ran into my office, visibly flustered and
distressed, saying I absolutely needed to sign this contract at that
moment. I asked her first to calm down and to please explain to me what
the contact was for and what exactly she needed from me, but she was
unable to provide the information to me. But she said she thought it was
a couple of million dollars contract. And just last week legislative
reports that were due in November, December and January showed up on my
desk. Not only were these reports months late but they were simply
incomprehensible due to the thickness of the report. It was stuffed with
acronyms and lots of fluff. Some of them were so industry specific that
no person could possibly decipher what was trying to be relayed. So I
since issued directives to our senior staff and subsequently to the
entire HHS team that all signatures that are required by me must be on
my desk at least a week before. That they must come with a simple one
page cover sheet that includes the person who's responsible for this,
perhaps a grant name, perhaps a signature of the supervisor and a
request whether this is state or federal money and some bullet points, a
simple summery of what is being asked. So with all of this you can
imagine my displeasure when again I was asked to sign a legislative
report that was a week late. So, there are no longer points of contact
at HHS. There are simply people who are</p>

responsible and accountable for completing a given task. We actually
have begun to simply issue our first warning letters that are entered
into the employee personnel files. We are not going to change the system
overnight or this process, but we will change. It is absolutely
unacceptable for business as usual for reports to be months behind. Now
I have set this expectation for our department that we will adhere to
the deadlines and that we will provide you and the committee and staff
with information in a timely manner and in a usable format that is
useful. But to make this work I also am asking for help. We need to work
together to eliminate all consolidate certain reports. Too often the
reports that we are being asked to produce fall short really of
providing you with actionable data and do not help any of us in policy
making. We actually have daily information requests daily for
information and we are asked to provide 150 legislative reports per
year. That is equivalent to a report every Monday, Wednesday, and almost
every Friday. In my show and tell here is the result of a legislative
report printed on both sides. We received a request January 30 asking
for it to be returned in seven business days. Now this report is just
not computerized information. This report contains specific information
of over 1,000 contracts. This report is a lot of work on our budget team
which has to handle, which has actually their hands are very full right
now with multi-million dollar holes that we have to patch up that have
been left to us by the previous administration. I believe this is the
root cause of some of these issues is simply the lack of trust. It was
the lack of trust by you towards our Department of HHS. I firmly believe
that the legislature was not receiving the data when it needed it. So
you required frequent reports to ensure that you did have it on hand
whenever it was necessary for you. So we need to improve our
communication and find a better way to share information in order so
that we can restore our mutual trust. So let me continue to share with
you some challenges we have. Number one, one of the challenges we have
is to create an organization that promotes the efficiency of the entire
department. Let me read to you just a simple list of one division and
offices inside of HHS. Well in one division we have Human Resources,
Purchasing, Contracts, Property Construction, Privacy Security, Internal
Auditor, Facilities Controller, Equal Employment Opportunities,
Information Technology, MMIS, NCFAST. Now what could possibly tie these
seemingly unrelated divisions together. Well they all reported to one
person. By the way that one person actually just retired and there is no
succession plan for that position. We are also running extremely thin in
HHS. We have many key positions that are vacant. More than half of the
Deputy Secretary positions inside of the department  are vacant and have
not been filled yet. We have many vacancies that are waiting to be
filled, including critical ones such as 20 doctor positions that are
presently unfilled and waiting, waiting. We are facing numerous
retirements over the next few months. Well and of course there's the
money issue was face.</p>

<p id="15:00">
my first week on the job, I sat down with our budget team, and I was
handed a number of sheets of paper. One of those papers was over $4
million that actually was due due to an error in communication. Another
piece of paper was for $5 million, the $5 million that was a reduction,
that actually was mandated by law in 2 straight years and had not been
enacted. A third piece of paper was nearly $40 million of unpaid bills
that we walked into. And finally our legal troubles. I've inherited a
Dept. of Justice settlement that is back loaded with costs that need to
be in your budget for years to come. This amount is nonnegotiable due to
the settlement. You can find an update in your printout about these
costs. And it must be my short name because it seems I'm the most
popular person to be sued. I already have in this short time my first
supreme court case. And I also mentioned my legal team, and why do I
mention that? My legal team, she is very talented because I only have
one. So, why do I tell you all of this? I need you to understand what we
are facing at HHS. I need you to know that things are really broken, but
we are in the process on the path to fixing it. The solution is not
coming here and asking for  more money. There is no new money. There's
no one in North Carolina, certainly that I know that is raising their
hand and actively waving and saying &quot;Please, please, take more
taxes from me. I want to volunteer more money in taxes so you can give
it to HHS .&quot; So what exactly is the plan, and what exactly are we
going to be doing? First we will be driving efficiencies into the
organization and the department.  And those efficiencies will be through
technology, accountability, and structural reform. We will enhance
existing talent and new talent, we will make sure that we have the tools
that our staff needs. I would like to finish with the 2 top priorities
for our department: Our top priorities are IT and medicaid reform. Even
as we tighten our belts everywhere, we must continue to invest in
technology across state governments. With that said, at this time I
would like to introduce our most recent hire, our chief information
officer Joe Cooper. Joe started last Friday and we're thrilled to have
him here. Joe will be responsible for overseeing and ensuring the
success of all IT projects within HHS. This is actually the first time
that all IT projects are aligned under one individual. And this will
give HHS a more cohesive approach to the IT projects, operations and
budget, and allow us to better utilize resources across our entire
department. Joe has 35 years of experience as a technology executive in
the private sector. He has worked for 35 years in leadership positions,
in such organizations as RBC, First Citizens' and Bank of America. The
first priority of our new CIO is to evaluate the technology needs for
this very, very diverse operation while instituting a culture of
consumer service. Madam Chair, I would ask Joe Cooper be allowed to
address the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Cooper?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Secretary ??. Madam Secretary, many Chairs, committee members,
good morning.
My name is Joe Cooper, and I'm HHS's first Chief Information Officer and
perhaps just as important, to you as I will be your one throat to choke
when it comes to information technology for the agency. I</p>

Energized by the opportunity to partner with Secretary Was in the state
of North Carolina to tackle one of the state's biggest challenges:
healthcare information management. I've just completed my third day in
the job, and so far we've just consolidated three organizations into
one: the Department of Information Resource Management, Health
Information Technology, Privacy and Security, and will be looking at
other consolidation opportunities over the coming months. I've also
assumed leadership accountable for MMIS, NC-FAS, and all the other
technology-related initiatives in HHS. Most of my first three days have
been devoted on getting up to speed on the MMIS and MC-FAS initiatives.
I have additional meeting scheduled for this week, and through next week
as well. The remaining time has been spent with some division heads.
It's still very early, but one of my first observations is how dated the
technology some of our divisions are using, and the impact it's having
on them. One good example is our controller division. Today, the PCs and
software that they're running is so dated, that when they received
spreadsheets from the State Control Division, the State Control Division
actually has to split the spreadsheets into two, so that they can ship
it across the communication lines. And just compounding that further,
often times they have to downgrade the spreadsheets so that the
spreadsheets at the control division can actually bring them up and do
work on them. I will be spending more time with the individual divisions
in the coming months, trying to identify opportunities to enhance our
day to day operations. As I stated earlier, I'll spend the bulk of my
time over the next few months on MMIS and NC-FAS. I've told my
colleagues and peers at HHS that I have to focus on this. We will
certainly entertain new initiatives and new requests, but I also prepare
them for the answer of no. We have to focus on these initiatives. We
have very hard target dates that we have to achieve. I should have a
much better line of sight about these initiatives in the coming weeks,
and I look forward to coming back and reporting a complete assessment
back to the committee. Thank you, madam chair, committee co-chairs. I'd
like this opportunity to call Secretary Was back up.
Thank you, and welcome aboard. Secretary Was?
Thank you, madam chair, and thank you, Joe. Next, I'd like to ask Carol
Steckel to speak. I'm sure that you've already heard about our new
Medicare Director. Carol is one of the top three in her field in the
nation. Recruiting her away from Governor Bobby Jindal in Louisiana was
the first big victory in HHS. Carol is 100% focused on Medicaid reform.
Our state cannot sustain our present Medicaid program as it is currently
focusing. Carol has hit the ground running, and has invited all the
stakeholders to the table with, as you know, the request for information
that was published in our state last week. The excitement of hearing
from across the state is actually quite incredible. We've offered the
people to come to the table with great ideas, and people are actually
saying throughout the state, quote unquote what took you so long to ask
us? Madam chair, I would like to ask Carol Stucker to be allowed to
address the committee at this time.
Ms. Steckel?
Madam chair, members of the committee, I am thrilled to be here, and
thrilled to be in North Carolina. There is a great history here of
innovation in the Medicaid program that is focused on community-based
services, and I am excited to be part of moving this into the future,
and appreciate you all letting me address the committee. The RFI was
released on February 4th. We are asking people, whether they're
individuals, they're stakeholders that represent providers, whether they
represent advocacy groups, to submit bold proposals on how we can
improve the Medicaid program. We only outlined basic principles, because
we did not want to drive people into specific areas, we wanted to get
their ideas. Those basically</p>

…Principles are that the proposals to be market based and utilize North
Carolina community based providers, proposals that enhance the
beneficiaries personal responsibility not just for me to think about
financial responsibility but for their own health care responsibility,
we want proposals that provide optimal level of benefits to appropriate
recipients at the appropriate level and at the appropriate time. We want
proposals that provide both short term immediate savings to the medicate
program but then also build a sustainable predictable medicate program
for the long run. We have asked respondents to describe how their
proposals will create a system where there is more appropriate care at
lower cost with better outcomes with not just buying products and fee
for service systems but how are we showing that we are improving the
health status of the people we serve. We are looking for the proposals
so utilize and accepted and verifiable financial and quality measures to
evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the program, we are not
asking you all to take our work floor we are going to build systems that
allow us to quantify and measure the success of the program. We are
looking for proposals that address the need, the important need of the
linkage between physical health and mental health and behavioral health
that would be a major initiative and will be working with our department
of mental health to have their input on evaluating those proposals. We
also have asked people again under the category of thinking boldly to
not measure just this area or this area or this area but to look across
the continual care including long term care supports and services. Most
of all we are looking for proposals that focus on improving the health
of our citizens here in North Carolina. The schedule for the RFI
questions about the RFI formal questions are due tomorrow, we will then
answer those questions and post both the questions and answers on our
website. Proposals are due on March 15th we then will take with the
Department Of Leadership and with the DMA leadership, we will look at
those proposals and build a comprehensive proposal from all of the ideas
and then that will be the tool that we use for going back out and
getting suggestions for modifying it, tweaking it and that will be the
proposal that we submit to the Secretary and to the Governor and to this
body. I don’t need to tell you that medicate needs improvement I think
you all have heard loud and clear from several auditors and other
entities. This program is something I have spent my life working for and
it is a passion of mine, it’s a program that’s too important, the
services we finance are critical to the wellbeing of the state. However,
I recognize and my staff will recognize the obligation we have both to
the beneficiaries that we serve but also the tax payers who have
interested their hard earned money with us in the programs that we
operate. In addition to the group __[03:17] effort that we have
identified in the RFI of one to assure each and everyone of you that we
are reforming internally. The Secretary has outlined some of the issues
and we will not have another auditor report like I had two weeks ago, I
can promise you that. We are worked to restore trust of the agency, we
look to work with you and your staff to be transparent, to provide you
the information that you need and again we will not have an audit report
like we had two weeks ago. I’m excited about this initiative to look
forward to work with each and everyone of you and your staff because
this is as the Secretary stated a legacy that we can leave for our
children and our grand children and something that I think we all will
be very, very proud of and all of us have a part to play in making it
happen. Thank you very much and Madam Chair this time I would like to
ask the Secretary to come back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Chair and thank you welcome to Ms. ___[04:20]. We are glad to
have you in the North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and Madam Chair we have several senior staff here that could
possibly answer questions and not possibly but they can answer questions
and provide further information to the subcommittee on request. We have
senior staff here in reference to subject matter of Managed Care, HHS
budget, Department of Justice Settlement, our facilities and C-Fest,
MMIS, Adult Care Facilities among other topics.

Thank you very much and I’m sure there will be questions from the
committee, okay. What I would like to do and how we work the Secretary
of ___[00:10] Podium and when we direct the questions to Secretary and
then she can hold upon the appropriate staff person. Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairman and the Secretary, the first question that I
would like to address on has to do specifically with the budget and
where we stand for this. When the department reported in early January,
the General Assembly, the prospects their budget they said we were
looking at somewhere around the 20 million dollar surplus for this year,
if you look at, we took a look at check rights compared to the last year
I think I’m seeing the trajectory for a 300 million dollar deficit
coming in this current year and I was kind of wondering if you had
someone who can give us an update on where you expect your budget to be…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you if I could, please call on ___[01:06] budget to Mr. Jim.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that would be Steve related to medicate…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To medicate okay thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Steve from the Divisional Medical Assistance excuse me, based on that we
are in the process of doing January forecast and for the rest of year
but based on December, if you look at all medicate funds which include
claims as well as settlements, administration and contracts. Today we
are looking about 21 million dollar shortfall of total expenditures. As
you look at our check rights and we are spending the first half of the
year I think it’s important to add a couple of things. One, this year we
only have three settlements, payback excuse me to the Federal Government
of all that happened in 2009 so the first half of the year it was heavy
and we also don’t have the 40 million dollar PCS payback, the way the
savings particularly with the MCOs or ___[02:08] because as we implement
the MCO we have the first month payback and PMPM is still running
claims. So, those settlements were also and we are begun to see those
materials in the last four months of this year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That 21 million dollar, is that include making whole of the payments to
the Federal Government in June as required by law for the 125 million
dollars in rebate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, that assumes it will handle the Federal share of the rebates the
same way we had this past June so that’s an item will be added to that
number in terms of what we actually have to cover.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One other question, differ subject and I think this will probably for
Mr. Cooper in MMIS and I know the two are new to us but I think the
elephant in the room kind of question for MMIS is what at this point,
what kind of likelihood do you see that MMIS will go live on July 1st
and will be fully functional and implemented by the second iteration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the question, we will be ready July 1st to go live and as
you mentioned in January timeframe we are continue to make additional
enhancements stuff through the rest of the year but we will go live July
1st.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair and Madam Secretary I had a couple of questions so
I wanna thank you, I’m always hopeful to get insight full information
that can help us and making reasonable intelligent proceedings.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I’m gonna post three questions and you try to bring up the staff
that can help us to answer the more and having describe an agency that
apparently is a NETO significant reform it seems to be ___[04:09]
prospective somewhat dysfunctional. Are you planning to address that by
perhaps putting together a team that can do fact signing and determine
what the best organizational structure would be or bringing the
consultant that can help with that? Secondly, in terms of industry fest
and I have heard something about it for the last four or five years. I’m
trying to determine where we are with industry fest has today in terms
of getting it fully operational, how far that timeline it stands? What
kind of cost fully involved with our decision not to drawing the money
that was available to us to upgrade it for some of the medicate
enhancements that need to be done, how are we planning to fund it? And
lastly, the development disabled, I know we have some stuff got make in
place today, it will address that issue but what are we plan…

to request perhaps Anthony ????????, if you could be kind enough, in
detail, to answer the question about NC Fast?????????? Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Madam Secretary. To answer the question as
far as where we are with NC Fast???????? We've broken it up into
multiple projects, like we've reported on numerous times in the past.
The first project is the ????????? Services Project. We are in 76

The remaining counties are doing new applications only within NC

our larger counties like Wake and Durham so they'll be live, 100% in NC

on the final two counties, which is Mecklenberg and Forsyth county. Just
due to the large size of Mecklenberg and Forsyth, we want them by
themselves in March, which will complete our Project One roll-out of NC
Fast??????, from a system perspective.  We're also in the process of
going back out and starting to train all our Medicaid workers on how to
use NC Fast?????? from a universal place worker concept since NC Fast is
no longer in stove pipe systems but all into one consolidated system. So
we'll start training our Medicaid workers on using NC Fast??????, using
the food stamps applications and things like that. The Medicaid Project,
you refer to that as Project 26. Medicaid will start rolling out in June
of this year and we will pilot in June and July and then start rolling
out to all the rest of the counties.  And a phased approach, just like
the lessons that we've learned with Project One so we're not gonna do
this big bang...we're not gonna roll out in good massive data for every
county, we're gonna roll that out in phases. A soft launch and a hard
launch.  The soft launches are basically they can use NC Fast????? for
all new applications for Medicaid and all the other programs and by
October first, all 100 counties will be using NC Fast?????? for new
applications for Medicaid ?????????? healthcare reform. After that,
we'll do our conversions of our legacy system from the Medicaid system
into NC Fast????? over the next several months just like we did with
Project One. When it comes to the benefit exchange aspect of it based on
the legislation over the last coupla' days and weeks, we have now
created a new project called Project Seven. It was never really part of
NC Fast to do the benefit exchange piece. It was always a separate
effort. It would still integrate completely with NC Fast but keep it
separately from a cost allocation perspective. Under Project Seven, you
asked about the funding of it.  Currently we do have the grant utilized
from the federal partners to implement the exchange; however, based on
the legislation, if it ran...when it becomes law, we cannot use that
grant going forward. In the process of preparing for that, we've
created...updated our annual planning document which is our federal
approval document from our federal partners.  We'll be able to submit
that within...by the end of this week or early next week to obtain the
9010 funding for the exchange portion of NC Fast and to make NC Fast
perform all the Medicaid eligibility for anybody coming in through the
federal exchange or the FFE model, the Federal Facilitated Exchange
model. Did that answer your question, sir?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, it did in part.  I guess...follow up, Madam
Chair?
[Speaker changes.] Follow up...
[Speaker changes.] In terms of...first, I'm very pleased to hear the
food stamp certification part is finally where it needs to be cause we
been workin' on that for a long time.  So I commend you on that effort.
I guess the other thing is the cost.  Where do we stand in terms of
overall cost for NC Fast?  How much of this will perhaps be recoverable
from other agen...from other funding sources? Perhaps federal? And how
much is it that we're gonna be looking at moving into this budget
cycle...and I'm not sure if we have all aspects of NC Fast that will be
completely operational soon from your comments?  Sounds like there's
still a ways to go...
[Speaker changes.] That is correct, sir.  We have additional projects
after the Medicaid project starts rolling out this year.  We have
Project Three, which is childcare, crisis intervention and??????????.
Right now that's scheduled to start sometime this fall. We have Project
Four, which is child welfare, child services, protective services.  That
was originally scheduled to start actually this year.  We did submit out
paperwork to get that approved from our federal partners but we've had
some resistance when it comes to the cost allocation of Project Four so
we're still working with our federal partners on that. Project Five is
???????? protective services, which right now will start sometime in
2015. We're always trying to expedite projects to maximize...to go to
your other question...on the funding.  NC Fast right now, based on the
waiver that the CMS received from 87A is funded 9010.  In our cost
allocation, we put those 9010 figures in there and then run all the
different function....</p>

<p id="40:00">
within the system. Reality is it’s actually like 88.9% federally funded
and a little bit or more than that on the state side, primarily because
of the function points. Food stamps, for example, under emergency food
stamps is not benefitting of any other program so that has to be 100%
USDA. The 50-50 match what the USDA provides. Overall our funding is
90-10 in the short answer for that. When it comes to NC Fastfunding,
we’re funded for this fiscal year. We have applied for our next fiscal
year. The exchange site is slightly different, as I mentioned before, we
were fully funded under $45 million for the exchange piece with the
grant not being able utilize the grant we have to now come up with the
state dollars for that while we seek federal approval for the 90-10. We
do anticipate receiving a federal approval, which would be a 90-10
match, but in the short term we have to continually fund NC Fast for the
exchange project to keep moving to hit the October 1st date between now
and when we obtain that approval. That approval can be as long as 60
days from now, and there’s obviously, just like any other approval,
there’s not guarantee that we’ll get that approval.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I think that helps a lot. One thing that would help Madam
Secretary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Madam Chair, excuse me. If we could at some point get a
comprehensive document. I don’t want to burden your agency with any more
reports because you can obviously are overburdened already. But
something that’s short, sweet, and concise that can kind of give us the
long term costs for NC Fast in terms of what we’re looking at and what
our contribution as a state would be. Particularly going into this
budget cycle, but I think if we can get the more comprehensive view
looking out several years, the other components, that would be helpful
as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, we can get that over to you fairly quickly. Actually very
quickly we can get that to you. With the information that’s available
for us, we do not have a crystal ball, with the facts that are available
to us, we will get that information to you very quickly because we do
have that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excellent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And your other question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry, and then you had two other questions. The first one you had
mentioned was organizational. Senator, I suppose in a dream world we
love to have the time and the finance and the ability to hire outside
consultants to come spend a year with us, see where our weak links are,
see what the best corrective action is and then spend another year
asking you for more money and trying to figure out how to do that. I
don’t think we have that time. Where we are right now is we are
implementing changes, organizational, structural changes. They will have
a direct impact just by, as you see, by the caliber of the folks here
and also our new hires. You will see those changes very quickly. I
promise you that if I assess that we are not able internally to go
towards a path of sustainability, I will make sure that we ask for
outside help, outside consultation in order to accomplish that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, follow up. The last component was the developmentally disabled. I
commend you, if we had a dysfunctional organization and it can enhance
our delivery of services, this is in the state we need to be about
correcting that as expeditiously as possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. The reason that the two goals in the department are IT and
Medicaid reform is if we do not have the tools and the money to work
with, then all our efforts towards what we should be working on on
helping the citizens of the state, we can’t do it. Our focus is on IT
and Medicaid reform in order to make it have a path for them to be
functional, efficient, sustainable for the future so we can devote all
our efforts of the expertise our department to concentrating on things
as disabilities. Who would like to, of staff, perhaps answer, because
many of us are involved, I’m seeking who would like to be the first.
Kelly? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Kelly Crosby, Division of Medical Assistance. You had asked about
services for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities.
What I can tell you, I will start, I think someone else needs to finish.
I’ll tell you about the Medicaid services and where we are right now. At
the moment we have a 1915C waiver is our innovations waiver. You know
that you have us 250 more slots last year so we were able to give those
slots out.</p>

<p id="45:00">
in January of this year's so we have a virtual thousand people right now
on that C waiver and that does provide home and community based services
for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, so
they can live in homes in the community and not in institutional
settings. We do have wait lists for those services, and we do rely on
additional funding of slots in order to create new community based
services for more people. Because that C waiver is tied to our 1915b
waiver, which is our managed care waiver, we are able to use some of the
savings created under managed care to provide additional services for
medicaid ineligible individuals on the wait list for those C waiver
services. So they get some basic services like community guide and
respite. And they are, it is a specific amount of money, it's not a
entitlement. The individuals on those wait lists as well are obviously
entitled to the entire medicaid benefit, and that's something that's
been very important that that community is aware of. They do have access
to healthcare durable medical equipment,  mental health services,
whatever the medicaid benefit allows, and some of the  services are able
to support some of their other needs. We do also provide institutional
care, they're called intermediate care  facilities for individuals with
intellectual and developmental disabilities. That is a basic medicaid
benefit. And we had submitted to this committee- excuse me, to the blue
ribbon commission our recommendation for a 1915i option service, which
is called individual supports. It is a service that provides
habilitation and respite. Excuse me, habilitation and personal assitance
type service for individuals who do not have a slot, who are medicaid
eligible. This service  would help support them in their home or in
group home settings. This would perhaps help  individuals who may be
losing personal  care services. Now that is, we just submitted the
outline of  what the service would look like. We obviously need
permission and a budget to submit, but that option officially to CMS for
approval. Now those are the medicaid services, and you may also be
asking about some of the state funded services for people with IDD.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have an appropriate person for that, Sen. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can address that Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Jim Gerard with the division
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please identify yourself please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jim Gerard with the division of mental health, developmental
disabilities, and substance abuse services.  In addition to the medicaid
services, we distribute to all of our ?? MCOs,  the local management
entity, managed care organizations, service dollars which come from you
which we distribute then according to a formula for each of the LME
MCOs. The largest portion of those service dollars spent on mental
health, developmental disabilities and substance abuse services are
spent on persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities. So
through each of the local management entities, there are services which
are being funded by state dollars, some of which are payable for it by
medicaid dollars. And so together with medicaid, we feel like we have a
very broad range of services available for persons with intellectual and
developmental disabilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, quick follow up? Yes, ?? from the first person ?? in terms
of submittal to the Federal government, when will that likely take
place, and what's the time frame for perhaps getting a response?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On our reports to
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, if I could, if each of you, I know you speak 2 or 3 different
times, but could you identify yourself when you speak? You've got your
back to  a lot of people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh certainly, sorry. It's Kelly Crosby from the Division of Medical
Assistance. We did submit our report on the &quot;i&quot; option to the
blue ribbon commission Feb. 1st. It does only outline a projected
budget, the projected number of eligibles, what the service would look
like. But because we don't have a budget for it, or authority to
actually submit an application to CMS, we- it is very early projections.
There would be quite a few steps in terms of getting permission, a
budget, truly developing a fiscal note to look at the cost impact of the
services, and then it would take at least 90 days, perhaps more to get
federal approval for the service as well, so...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Identify yourself please.

Anything different.  It has to be built on the success of North
Carolina. I was the Medicaid director in Alabama for ten years and
they’re now going through the process.  They had two committees to look
at Medicaid reform, a legislative committee and a gubernatorial
committee.  Both committees said we need to look at the North Carolina
model and go forward with that. And there’s states all across the
country that are looking at that so our goal again is community-based
services. I don’t want to close off any potential opportunities
elsewhere, but that’s our goal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair. And thank you, Madame Secretary. It is
certainly a pleasure to have you here, not just because you’re from
Gilford County, but because of all the assets you bring to us here. We
want to welcome your new staff, especially your Medicaid direct.  I want
to have some time with her too. A couple of things I’m concerned about.
I’m so glad to hear about NC ?? and Joe, and connecting the information.
 I never could understand how we could put information into a state
system and couldn’t get anything out. I just could never understand what
was wrong with that whole thing so I look forward to that gap being
closed. I am concerned, however, our mental health services and our
developmental disabilities.  I think it’s a broken – I know it’s a
broken system and I work closely with those areas.  I know a lot about
them.  I just dealt last year with Bill House, whose people had to leave
there because they didn’t qualify any longer, older parents who had a
child with developmental disability who was an adult, who was going to
have to go to some individual home.  That was not the place for that
person to be and yet, they did not fall up into the group home
regulation.  They need to do that. I think we’re doing a lot of things
wrong to look after our citizens who have developmental disabilities and
who have mental health problems. So I certainly like when you get some
of this other stuff handled, that you take a look at that.  I’m glad to
hear about the 1915 ?? because I think that’s going to help some. I
really think that’s going to help. I think you need to look at the whole
system. I know that we have some federal regulations that tie in some,
but wherever we can close some of those things, to make sure that we
provide the same quality or good quality of life people with the ??
disabilities and mental health problems. I’d like to see us do that. I
had one other question.  When you talk about the 1915 ??, are you still
using the cap money and how is that going to… how much is that? And how
is that going to fit into the overall new plan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. First, I want to reassure you that we have mutual
goals and in reference to mental health.  Mental health is one of the…
really, part of the work that HHS does encompasses all of us across the
board, everything from a person’s own dignity, to their family, to
society, to school, to education, to public safety, to absolutely every
part of our lives in North Carolina.  I promise you that in reference to
our comprehensively looking at the issues of mental health outside of
HHS, we will get to it. We have things that we move forward on and
mental health in a broader vision is something that we have actually on
our calendar. And in reference to your second question, Carol.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In reference to the broader issues, we specifically put a principle in
there that we would suggest and encourage proposals that show programs
that link behavioral health and mental health.  It sounds like a basic
idea, but it’s a relatively new idea for the last four or five years in
the Medicaid world, that that linkage is so critically important that as
you know very clearly that the impact of the anti-psychotic drugs are
all physical side effects.  So we need proposals that as we move forward
with our process in that, the professionals at the Department of Mental
Health will be involved in helping us look at that. What we don’t want
to do is build a long-term strategy.  Medicaid is a financing agency so
we want to make sure that we…</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is Kelly Crosby from the Division of Medical Assistance again. I'm
not sure I, I want to be able to answer your question but do you mean
the cap IDD waiver funding? And were you asking would the cap IDD waiver
funding go to support the I option, is that what you were asking? I
think, probably, in order to tell you how much there is it would be best
just to go back and get you some actual real numbers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Senator, we can get that to you also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd just like to make a comment. I feel very
strongly, as they do, about mental health and also addiction that go
hand in hand. My husband and I were foster parents for ten years and the
numbers that you shared with us today about the 176,000 children abused,
we had children in our home that had been life flighted into Chapel
Hill. What I would like to highlight to you is that the results of the
mental health crisis we have today and the addiction, much of it starts
in those early years with children who cannot speak for themselves. So I
do commend you to be watchdogs and just be aggressive in looking after
those children who cannot speak for themselves because we are now paying
the price for all the things that have happened in the past to those
children and they're our responsibility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, thank you. As a mother, a physician, and the Secretary of
Health and Human Services I can assure you that these issues are near
and dear to our heart and this is what we do every single day and I
pledge to you, in the name of the staff, that we will continue to do
that to the best of our abilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Good job, Madam Secretary, thank you for the job you're
doing. I have a question on the 176,000 child abuse reports, I know you
have to investigate all of them. Is that a substantiated number? Are
those substantiated reports?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, do you know that number?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's see, Cheri, would you be kind enough to pull that through your
files. We may get that number to you right away if we look on the right
page, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Cheri will be able to get that answer? Yes? Sir, we will get that back
to you as soon as we get to the office.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, are there any other questions from Dr. Fulghum?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Secretary Wos. We have been in the midst of struggling with
this Medicaid expansion. You would be the recipient of that decision,
obviously, if we decided to do something of that type. You mentioned
earlier that we cannot sustain the current Medicaid program as currently
functioning and I assume that that would include adding 500,000 new
Medicaid eligibles onto an already dysfunctional program. That's our
struggle. And given the fact that we heard yesterday, and in other
hearings, that this is not a requirement that we do that this year or
next year or even the next year after that in regards to expanding this
eligible group. So would you agree that prudent behavior would be the
way for you to come and say, &quot;Now we're ready, now we're able, with
the staff, the programs, and the IT development to accept even more
responsibility of Medicaid eligibles.&quot; That seems to be the way
we're headed. Is that a reasonable assumption on our part?</p>

Well, sir, the decision with the legislature, the administration has
been made
in reference to priorities of Medicaid reform prior to any other
decisions. With the Affordable Care Act as it stands, we're not making
preparations to absorb into the Medicaid fold an addition of the folks
called the 'woodwork effect'. That is something that is mandated by the
Affordable Care Act, and is one of the reasons why we're in such a hurry
with Medicaid reform inside of our department in order to prepare us to
be able to accomodate that. The sums of money that will be necessary for
the state to absorb the folks which we'll refer to as this 'woodwork
effect' is something that we will be presenting to you in our budget as
we present it to the Governor within the next few days and it will be
presented to you, but please be aware of the fact that inside of the
Affordable Care Act, we will have, as is presently, mandates to absorb
more people inside of our Medicaid system. I hope that answers your
question, what we're facing now, and I think that we absolutely need to
get this reform right. If we get this reform, it may not be perfect,
probably won't be perfect, but if we can get it in a much better place
than we are right now, we will have far more flexibility, even
intellectually, to evaluate the additional needs in our society.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have a follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I assume that the answer is waiting for a load on your workload as far
as taking care of these additional eligibles may be the prudent thing to
do, until we see that the system is improved. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are there any other further questions from committee members? Comments?
Senator Pate has asked for some closing remarks. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
