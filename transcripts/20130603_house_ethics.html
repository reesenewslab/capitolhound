the plan objection we're going to declare that we have a quarum, welcome
to the first house ethics committee for the year 2013. my coach here
representative becky karney and i will do our best to run this committee
with grace and dignity. representative karney do you have comments you
would like to make name?
[speaker changes] not at the moment
[speaker changes] like to thank our trustee sergent varns, mr.cells, mr.
hunt, mr. brandon and mr. clampit. we apprieciate you being here today.
believe you will find your bills in your folders. we have two bills
before us. they are not exciting or sexy. and it's people who think the
word ethics means mad and agreijus, it doesn't in this committee. so our
first bill will be senate bill 156 and mr. hartsol....you have the floor
[speaker changes] thank you ms chairman and members of the committee.
156 in results is an unanomous vote of the prior joint ethics committee.
coacharb , stan, and myself and bypart in that sense that it really
cleans up a couple of things that we have been assuming where the case
we could do but we were'nt sure so we tried to straighten it out and
matter such as clarifying that the legislature acts committee may
recieve complaints directly. we sort of assumed that we could, but we
sort of taken that previously and sort of taken up on our own motion.
those kinds of things were in it. as well as for instance for LSC may
issue as private emonishment without a hearing. this atthority is
implied but is not pacifically stated elsewhere in the statue. there are
a number of things of that sort, if we are not in session we have twenty
days to notify folks and take certain actions. twenty business days we
got certian limitations built into the statue. just trying to straighten
up some things and also those are all in section one and would commend
that to you for those tech, their really very technical and subamuatory
i believe is the term, they would put you to sleep. the second session
clarifies that the advisory opinions issued by the legislature ethnics
committee on matters covered by the legislature of ethnics are binding
on all legislature. if you know anything about the process by which
those were adopted, there is a very extended process by which the
legislature committee issue these advisory opinions in very specific
circumstances narrowing those. and this has been the assumption that
this was the case but were are going to spell out today  that it was in
fact the case. ill lie to try and answer any questions.
[speaker changes] questions from the commitee. yes sir representative
michell
[speaker changes] I don't have a question yet, im trying to figure out
what im supposed to be doing, and i say that with a degree of ignorance,
i serve on another ethnics commission, which is comprised of senators
and house members
[speaker changes] yes sir i would be glad to try to clear that up a
little bit, in the statue of representative mitchell, there is what we
you and i now as the joint legislative ethics committee, yes sir that's
house and senate. the house also has the standing committee, the house
ethics committee. and yes sir and you are a member of both and we're
glad, but basically this committee currently is looking at legislature
however i was looking into this ares of questions myself, if there
happens to be issues with members of either chambers those conduct
issues might be heard in this committee if it's an issue dealing with
the house member and to the same extent senate is that liberty to
appoint or select committee. they do not</p>

have a Senate Ethics Committee currently, that would deal with any
issues in that chamber.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, so, what happens if the other joint ??? comes out of them and ???
joint administrative ???.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't believe you would ever have to deal with that type of a
relationship, because either we would, if it was legislation, it will be
run through this committee, if it is dealing with improper conduct,
perhaps and would be sent to the House Ethics Committee, then the House
would conduct business dealing with the House member, so I don't believe
you would ever have to deal with that Representative Michaux, there's
many years that many of us have set on by this. This committee is
dealing with legislation for the purpose of moving legislation today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, I still, I'm still in a quandary because I know that for
instance we are issuing a ruling today on some matters that involves
numbers, an overall ruling that involves what members can do and what
they cannot do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, and Representative Michaux, this is a Senate bill, Senate bill
156, and it's already cleared the Senate, and cleared I believe Commerce
Committee, then they forward the Senate, and was passed as any other
normal bill would over to the House, and it's being scrutinized here,
trust me, Representative Michaux, I know. Are there other, Senator Hart
so there was just one question in Section 3 pertaining to Section 2, I
am assuming you are making that date retroactive so you can, as you
said, things had been implied up to this day, but now you are saying
those are concrete.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct, as far as I know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
'kay, other questions from the Committee staff, do you have anything
that you can add to Senate Bill 156, staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Madame Chairman, the retroactive effective date with respect to
advisory opinions, that section of the Bill, section 2, it was always
believed that, advisory opinions issued by the Legislative Ethics
Committee would apply to all legislators, and so this is making a
technical change, and it's using the retroactive effective date, just to
make that effective, to make effective what was always believed to be
the case, that all the advisory opinions would be binding on all
legislators.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Other questions from the committee? None from staff, anybody in the
audience would like to make comments? Seeing no hands-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There was a parallel House Bill, and Ms. Churchill had a clarified
amendment that was passed when the House, is she still here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She's ???
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When the House is already passed it a couple months ago, and I don't
know if it's even necessary if you want to deal with it, but I just,
bringing that to your attention.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have it? Well let's just stand at ease and let it, let's handle it
here if we can. Representative Stam, since you aren't a member of the
Committee, do you have talking points that you would like to pass to a
member of the Committee offering the amendment, or would you like to
have the privilege of the Committee to speak on the Amendment that's
being prepared?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair, I never actually understood the Amendment but
Representative-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well that's-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But Ms. Churchill did- [LAUGHTER]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe she'll be right back, trust him, Representative Michaux.
[LAUGHTER]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, Representative Michaux, Representative Saine, I
trust too. I don't-

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You don't, trust me, trust me, you don't?</p>

That would be a joint committee. And then I would now appreciate you.
I'd take yours too.
[Speaker Change]
?? (Inaudible)
[Speaker Change]
And we really appreciate Monday. I confiscated the chair. I said to
Michelle would you all like to offer the amendment. That Erica
Churchill’s here to explain.
[Speaker Change]
Oh she's here.
[Speaker Change]
Yes sir. But you need to sign it.
[Speaker Change]
OK whatever then.
[Speaker Change]
At least we didn't ??. Did she leave again?
[Speaker Change]
Yeah I mean I completely ??
[Speaker Change]
I would. Somebody needed to ??
[Speaker Change]
Sure thank you Madam Chairmen. The amendment makes a change on page 2
lines 34 to 35. By rewriting those lines to read and this talks about
what the committee must do. Subdivision for says make recommendations to
the House in which the legislator who is a subject of the complaint is a
member without further investigation. If either of the following is true
one of them is that they're froze from the state ethics commission. And
what we're changing here is the referral alleges conduct that may be
unethical but the committee determines it does not have jurisdiction
under subsection A of the section. This is just a clarification of the
language.
[Speaker Change]
Say that again.
[Speaker Change
Yeah.
[Speaker Change
Currently the language says if you look at lines 34 and 35 the committee
determines it does not have jurisdiction over the alleges conduct, but
if true the alleges conduct may be unethical. And we are rewriting that
to say the referral alleges conduct that may be unethical but the
committee determines it does not have jurisdiction under subsection A of
this section. It's just a clarification of the jurisdictional limits.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Stam where did you find this language sir? Or
[Speaker Change]
This was requested by Ray Starling in the Speakers office.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Hartsell call falls on you sir.
[Speaker Change]
This is the first I've heard of it. I don't object to it. If Erica says
it's OK.
[Speaker Change]
Madam Chair.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Michaux.
[Speaker Change]
Actually ?? many determines that does not have ?? conduct ??. What
exactly do you mean? And in contrast to what you ??.
[Speaker Change]
Madam Chairman.
[Speaker Change]
Yes.
[Speaker Change]
I think the differences that the legislative ethics committee is limited
in jurisdiction. It only has jurisdiction over certain violations that
are chapter 30A of the general statutes, or chapter 120 of the general
statutes, or very, very limited criminal violations. And so there are
some instances where the committee may get a complaint that doesn't fall
directly within the jurisdiction of the legislative ethics committee.
But the entire House of Representatives would have jurisdiction over
that complaint. So there are some instances where the committee may
refer something directly to the House which would</p>

have broader jurisdiction than the committee which has limited
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Madame Chair.  I guess that was what I had seen, and I was
wondering, is there an example of something, some type of violation that
would fall outside of the purview of this committee?  I work better by
example.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well, I don't believe anybody on the committee can give you an example
because we don't understand it yet so maybe the staff would be able give
us an example.  Erica do you
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
There are certain matters in the past that the entire House of
Representatives ??, the Thomas Wright matter, for example.  There are
certain allegations that the Legislative Ethics Committee may have had
jurisdiction over. There are certain matters that they would not have
but the entire House would because under the constitution the entire
House of Representatives would have the ability to discipline its
members so that's why you would sometimes refer something to the House,
the full House and even the Speaker's office, would consider at the
time, they could set up a separate committee to do that if the
Legislative Ethics Committee was limited by its jurisdiction so the
House has broader jurisdiction to discipline its members than the
Legislative Ethics Committee which would just recommend.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Would that also be true also with the Senate?  You were saying
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay, you have the amendment before you.  Further discussion on the
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Let me just clarify the clarification ?? it's just more words.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Michaux has moved adoption of the amendment.  All in
favor will say aye
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
All opposed say no.  I believe that is unanimous.  We have a motion for
??.  Thank you, Representative Michaux.  All in favor of that motion
will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
All opposed say no.  I believe that is unanimous.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Madame Chair, members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I will, yes, yes, we will, me and Becky.  ??? Representative Holloway,
okay.  Senator Harrington on SB 411.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Madame Chair, members of the committee.  This bill, the NPO
Ethics bill is a recommendation of the Joint Transportation Legislative
Oversight Committee.  The original legislation that we ran last year
cast a slighter larger net than intended.  This is more narrowly
tailored and focuses the requirements on those with voting privileges
only which was the original intent.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Pardon me, Madame Chair, is this a committee substitute?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No sir, we are dealing with the original bill, Representative Michaux.
I believe there was a committee substitute in your packet. The bill
sponsor prefers that we deal with the original bill so we are on the
original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you again, Madame Chair.  We worked with those affected by the
legislation to improve it and there is no known opposition.  Also spoken
with members to address their concerns and believe this bill does that.
Under this bill all NPO and RPO voting members are required to do the
following:  not participate in any action if they know they may
financially benefit, promptly disclose in writing any conflict of
interest or potential conflict of interest, file a statement of economic
interest with State Ethics commission, file with the State Ethics
Commission, a list of all real estate owned wholely or in part by the
member or the member's extended family and any business in which the
member is associated located in the jurisdiction of the NPO or RPO on
which the member serves and also not user ??</p>

non-public information gained through service on the NPO or RPO that
would effect the personal financial interests of the member, member's
family, or business with which the member is associated. Just as a side
note, the original bill inadvertently included TCC or technical
coordinating committee members. That was not the intent. The intent is
to only address those serving on NPO's  and RPO's that have voting
privileges. They directly influence taxpayer dollars and Madame Chair,
if I may, we needed to have a date changed and Representative Brown has
an amendment to offer.
[speaker changes]
We'll get to that in a minute. Just a minute. Staff, do you have
anything else that you would like to add to the original bill?
[speaker changes]
No ma'am.
[speaker changes]
Committee members on the original bill. Representative Rayne Brown, you
are recognized to send forth an amendment please, ma'am.
[speaker changes]
Thank you, madame chair. If the members will please look at page four of
the bill, line four and I'm not gonna go at any length, the explanation.
I'd really like to ask Mrs. Churchill staff to explain the amendment.
Basically though, it's just a change in the date. What we got into a
little trouble, so if staff will please explain, I appreciate it.
[speaker changes]
Madame chair?
[speaker changes]
Yes ma'am. Sorry.
[speaker changes]
The current edition of the bill has a clause in it that when the bill
was originally filed, it was prior to April 15th, which April 15th is
the due date for statements of economic interest.  And it was basically
saying that if you hadn't filed yours by April 15th, it was fine. Not an
issue, but we have now passed April 15th. The other second requirement
comes with filing a statement of economic interest is attending ethics
education.  The amendment would simply say that the ethics education
requirement that these individuals had to meet by this month no longer
applies if the bill is enacted. So, it simply says that they don't have
to worry about complying with it in the State Ethics Commission. If they
haven't complied with it, they cannot use the enforcement tools against
them. And also, it states that if you're a member of that technical
coordinating committee, The TCC as Senator Harrington mentioned that
were not meant to be captured by this, if you filed your statement of
economic interest, it can be destroyed.  That's all. Thank you.
[speaker changes]
n the amendment, members do you have questions on the amendment?
Representative Rayne Brown moves for adoption of the amendment. All in
favor will say aye. All opposed, no.
[speaker changes]
Thank you.
[speaker changes]
The bill is before set amendment.
[speaker changes]
Madame Chair, just a question. This makes NPO's and the RPO's, it puts
them in the same bucket that everybody else is in. Is that correct?
[speaker changes]
Not exactly. I'm gonna read-
[speaker changes]
Just, if I may, thank you. The original -- that's why we redid the bill.
Originally, the net was cast a little bit larger than intended. It
included - they were also forced to comply with the gift band and
everything that we are. That wasn't the intent. The intent was  to just
be sure that they didn't have any personal interests in anything they
were voting on. And this tightens it down and does just that.
[speaker changes]
follow up.
[speaker changes]
This raises a question for me. Does this take them out of the gift band?
[speaker changes]
They are not under the gift band under this version of the NPO ethics
Bill. They have to file the statement of economic interest and a list of
their properties which is the place where they would - could potentially
gain something financially. If they owned property in the path or
proposed road and then voted on it.
[speaker changes]
Madame chair.
[speaker changes]
Yes sir?
[speaker changes]
I guess it's still not getting at my point. I'm not worried about - I
know if you got an interest in property, that's one thing, but if
somebody else has an interest in property,  and gives you a hundred or a
couple hundred dollars, or gives you whatever, are they covered anywhere
for that gift?
[speaker changes]
Mrs Churchill, would you just give this a --?
[speaker changes]
I'll make an attempt. The NPO's and the RPO's, The Technical
Coordinating Committees and or the Technical Advisory Committess and the
Technical Coordinating Committees both of those comprise local NPO or an
RPO. The individuals that serve on that TAC or TCC are all local
officials. They're either elected officials or individuals that work for
a locality, a county or city usually. As such, they have to comply with
some criminal provisions that say you can't take gifts and you can't
self deal. Right now, they are under the state  government ethics act
that say they can't take a gift just like legislators, legislative --</p>

for ease and public servants from folks who are registered to lobby at
the state level, even though they may not interact with lobbyists
registered at the state level in the same way that individuals at the
state level do.  The bill would simply put them back where they were
originally, which is under the local elected official’s version of the
gift ban, which is a criminal statute.  Every locality, every county and
city, also has to have their own code of ethics.  Some of those do
include provisions about accepting gifts while involved in their public
service.
