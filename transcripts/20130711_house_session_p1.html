Before we start our debate today, I know it's going to be spirited and

Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I wanted to share something that we all could be proud of. On Friday,
June 21st, three Department of Transportation employees, Jason Ray,
Ricky Bradley and Chris Painor were going about their normal day at work
in McDowell county when they sensed that something was just not right.
They smelled something burning and they saw fire and smoke coming out of
an air conditioner in a nearby house. Thinking not of themselves, the
three men immediately ran to try to extinguish the fire. When they
realized the fire had already spread and they were not going to be able
to put the fire out, they asked if anyone was still inside the home.
They were told that there were still 2 people that were actually still
inside the house. After being directed to the window closest to where

occupants were at. They broke the window out of the home and helped a
father and son escape from the burning house. The Marion Fire Chief
stated that alter that had the men not made the decision they made, two
people would have most likely lost their lives. Instead of bragging, the
three men only said that they are glad that they could help the family
but they do not consider themselves heroes by any means. Well, I would
have disagree with them on this point. These men are heroes and because
of their bravery and selfless acts two people are alive today. So as we
debate the issues that sometimes divide us I hope we can remember that
it's not the policies that we implement or the ideas that we put forth
that make us great but it's because of selfless individuals like Jason
Ray, Ricky Bradley, and Chris Painter that makes North Carolina what it
is. We in McDowell County are proud of these three employees of the
Department of Transportation and thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me
to recognize them for a minute today.

And, and to debate the motion. Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Speaker, members of this house. This bill had two changes, I think
they were listed probably as four changes in your conference report, but
one of them is simply a wording change. Instead of saying three to one,
they changed it to a ratio of 3 to one just for clarification purposes.
One of the two subjects that's changes is was we wanted to give a
maximum smoker premium, and that turned out to be 20% 1.2 times. We've
had everything from 1.15 to 1.5 in that bill, we settled on 1.2 as the
highest markup. The third change was the part about catastrophic
coverage. You know, the kind of semi-self-insuring with the stop loss
limit, is set at $20,000 we realized that $20,000 today won't be $20,000
15 years from now, so that's index for inflation based on the fairest
medical index we could find. Which is that one that's used for this part
of the country, so that, that figure will change through time. And then
that necessitated we thought the fourth change which is just that the
Department of Insurance will actually publish that figure each year so
that people can know what that $20,000 has turned into before they buy a
product that includes that. So basically the two changes are the smoker
rates is now, could be as high as 1.2 times the non-smoker rate, and the
provision to index the $20,000 stop loss limit. I would urge you to
concur on this report.
[Speaker Change]

[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Members of the House this really is a
non-controversial bill. The gist of it was we was we were trying to work
out a mini license between the plumbers and the irrigation contractors.
And when it came back it accidently picked up the well drillers. And the
well drillers did not wanna be included. So we sent it back took out the
portion that might have included the well drillers. And so it’s not just
something for the plumbing contractors, and the irrigation contractors.
And I urge your support.

Mr. Speaker I move we adopt the conference report. The local forensic

years they would wait to work on it until the 4th and 5th year. We
compromised on 3 years and ask you to vote for it.

Senate bill 81 the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Committee substitute number two for Senate bill 81, a bill to be
entitled &quot;An Act to Create the Charlotte Douglas International
Airport Authority&quot;, General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.

Representative Samuelson, before you're recognized, upon motion of the
member from Alamance county, Representative Dennis Riddell, the Chair's
happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to Sergeant Daniel

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time today, 'cause I know we
have another bill that I'm going to be presenting in a little bit,
another Senate bill, I get to present Senate bills today that will be
more controversial, I will cut some of the preamble. When we were in
Committee, I went into the background as to how we ended up here. The
very short version of the background is that the Senate filed a bill
that would take the Charlotte Douglas International Airport and move it
from a city-controlled asset to an authority. Their reasoning, which I
would concur with, is that there's a lot of change happening with the
airport, not the least of which is we're getting essentially a new
airline. At the start of that, the city was not happy with it, and so
when it got to the House, back several months ago, we held it up in time
for the city to do a study. So they hired a consultant, did a study,
came back and that consultant said at the beginning of May that the best
long-term option for the success of the airport was an authority. So we
thought the city would then work with us on constructing an authority.
However, that was not the city's reaction, the City Council is still
opposed to an authority. So over the intervening weeks, Representative
Brawley and I decided to create an opportunity for the city to join us
as equals in a study. So we crafted the language where they would be
able to participate in a study, share the chairmanship, chair the
agenda-setting, and share the vote, to consider all options for the
Charlotte airport. They turned us down. So we are kind of stuck with
this desire to work with the city to make sure we have the great
transition to whatever will be the best success for the airport, they
are not willing to participate. So we decided to go with the
consultant's recommendation and move on with an authority. So what you
have before you is an authority bill that, to the degree we were able,
incorporates as many of the city and the consultant's concerns as
possible. I would be happy to go over all of the pieces of it, and if
someone asks me to, I will, but in the interests of time, I will not and
simply say that we have done the best we can to make sure that the
Charlotte Douglas International Airport, which is a very important
economic asset for North Carolina as a whole, Charlotte and the
Charlotte region and a number of other aspects of North Carolina, that
it remains successful. And so I would urge your support, and I'm
available to answer questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Represenatative Alexander, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman's recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Like my colleague, Representative Samuelson, I'm not going to give a
long dissertation. I simply want to say that I stand on the other side
of the issue. I would urge you to not vote in favor of this bill and one
of the, I think, important reasons is the city of Charlotte has been a
perfect steward of this airport since 1936. The consultant's study that
you hear referenced did not conclude that there were any problems with
the city's stewardship. Quite frankly, if you read the report carefully,
you see that the consultant seems to have a preference for an authority,
and pretty much concludes that that's the direction that, at some point
in the future, you might want to go. Emphasize &quot;might&quot;. And
when you look at the ten airports, largest airports in the country right
now, I think it's seven of them that are organized as departments of
city or county government. Another</p>

<p id="025:00">
...important consideration is the fact that the city finance department
values the airport at somewhere between 3.5 billion dollars and 4
billion dollars and a way of getting your mind around that is to look at
what our state budget approximately is and the airport as an asset has a
value of approximately 20 percent of our state budget. So we aren't
talking about something small. We are talking about something that's
very, very large and we're talking about something that the bill itself
says that if the city is to be compensated, that compensation is to be
handled by the authority that is going to be handled from revenues
generated by that authority. Revenues get generated by landing fees, by
parking fees, by leases, all that. Again, to make a long story very
short, it is highly unlikely that an authority is going to be able to
generate the kind of money to continue to do everything that is done at
the airport now and pay some compensation that could be as high as a
multiple of 4 billion dollars.  Now, that means that ultimately, the
authority, if it were to be established, will come back to this body and
ask for some assistance at some point in the future.  Now, the bill, of
course, tries to make a distinction between the authorities that at an
obligation of the state but we all know that from all the many bills
that come through how entities that the state has created and sanctioned
come back and asked for support. I simply want to point out that at the
magnitude of the potential liability that what you will have is a
request that in at of itself could have an effect on the tax rate. So a
vote for this measure in affect is a vote ultimately to increase the
taxes of the citizens of North Carolina for a dubious change in
governance. Members, please consider what you're doing and please vote
no on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question and to comment on
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson, does the Lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Samuelson. I know that the
city of Asheville, has just recently been through the de-annexation of
the property that is within the corporate limits of the city Asheville,
which is the airport property. Is there anything like this anticipated
with the Charlotte Douglas International Airport?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Most definitely not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow up, Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If the authority is established, I know that the city
of Asheville remains a partner with the FAA in their dealings with the
Asheville airport. Is there...has there been any consulting with the FAA
about this change in status for the Charlotte Douglas International
Airport?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not directly with them in person to my knowledge
though we have looked in to how this has been handled in other areas and
tried to conform.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker, to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen and thank you Mister Speaker,
ladies and gentlemen of the House, I see this as somewhat of a slippery
slope for the folks living in the Charlotte regional
airport...international airport  area. Not unlike what has happened over
this legislative session with the city of Asheville and the Asheville
regional airport, I would...because of the questions that I have
surrounding what is in store for Charlotte based on what happened with
Asheville, I would urge the members to think this through and to vote no
on this bill. Thank you.</p>

Representative Carney, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I've spoken on this bill now twice in
committee, and transportation and finance. And I think by now everybody
knows that I have a, a, a long history of twenty some years married to
the former assistant aviation director at the Charlotte-Douglass
Airport, so I know a little bit about our airport. I rise today to say
that I'm, I'm sorry about how this bill got to where it did. For all of
you all that have been a part of it. I will say that when it hit in the
Senate, it was a lightning rod. And when it came to the House, I am
grateful to the Speaker, to the Governor, and to Representative
Samuelson and Representative Brawley for trying to say, look, let's,
let's take a step back and a breather. Ladies and gentlemen, we are
talking about a three point five plus billion dollar enterprise in the
city of Charlotte on our property. And now we're gonna say, as I said in
committee yesterday, take that one and go wham, you're a regional
authority in six months. I still maintain that we need that time. I was
on the committee that looked at our state owned assets. We were looking
at privatizing the zoo. If  you could have seen the language in that
bill, that proposed bill that crossed every t, dotted every I, gave
directive on how that would happen, who would be involved, the employees
were taken care of in that bill coming out of the state. We have not
quite done that with the Charlotte Airport. We defeated that bill, by
the way, for the zoo. I do maintain that it needs more time. We have
three, two hundred plus employees that are hanging in the rafters on
what's gonna happen to us. And I did a little check in, and these are
questions that I think need to be asked, and of course I'm asking you to
vote no today, to let's take a little more time, and we still have time
in the interim to do that. Those questions are, how many of you know
that our city of Charlotte is a self-insured program for liability? Do
we, do we think that this participation is going to extend to the new
authority? I don't know. It's a question that needs to be answered. And
how much does a third party liability insurance going to cost this
authority? Members, are we aware that airport employees are covered by
the city of Charlotte, self insurance program for healthcare, and is
that going to be able to carry over to a new authority? And, well, the
employees have to start picking up a change. And how much is health
insurance going to be, going to cost based upon, based upon an airport's
riskful standing alone? I could go on and on, but the big question is
how much is this authority going to cost? I do commend Representative
Samuelson and Representative Brawley for the changes they did make in
this bill, but I just really want you to, to just breathe a minute on
this issue. I know that I'm, I've said before, I wish we had a
professional mediator that could come in and take, take the time to
mediate between the state and our local city council. I do want to share
with you a poll that was taken on May twelfth by the Charlotte Observer.
It was commissioned by them and published. Our community is in turmoil.
Sixty five percent of those polled opposed an authority. Nineteen
percent support an authority. Sixteen percent not sure. That was in May.
We have candidates running for council and mayor and they're doing their
own polls and I've been getting feedback. Those numbers have gone up and
opposition to this, this authority if you will for our Charlotte
Airport. I ask you to vote no today. Let us</p>

...go back to the table. The city is continuing with our new manager and
committed to look at, what they believe, is, is a good, ongoing answer.
And, have they decided definitively as a council to not have an
authority? Well, there's never been a full, outright vote where there's
said, &quot;Do you want us to be an authority?&quot; There will be an,
an election of a new mayor and a new city council in November. We have
this interim period between now and May that we can continue. And I do
believe that there's good faith effort on our Bill sponsors part to make
that happen, to make it go forward in a more congenial, responsible way,
that the sate and the city are working together. Should it be an
authority? I think those questions need to be answered through
thoughtful, long-held processes and I know that's the last thing you
wanted to hear and hear today. But, I'm pleading with you. This is a
local issue, but it is a huge change for an investment in this state
that is an incredible asset. Three point five billion plus enterprise,
nationally recognized, internationally recognized, and we're just going
to say six months fruit basket turnover. Please let your calmer,
sensible side prevail and vote &quot;No&quot; today and give us time to
continue exploring this possibility. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Alexander, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill a second
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I, I just want to underline the fact that, that the
Charlotte Observer Poll on May the 12th found at least sixty five
percent of our citizens opposed to this measure. Sixty five percent of
our citizens think that the airport government structure ought to stay
the way it is. Only about nineteen percent in that poll thought that an
authority made any sense. I was reminded in this debate in, in
preparation of something that Abraham Lincoln jotted down in July of
1854. He was talking about justified use of governmental power. It's
very brief and I want to share it with you. &quot;The legitimate object
of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to
have done but can not do at all or can not so well do for themselves in
their separate and individual capacities. In all that the people can
individually do as well for themselves, government ought not to
interfere.&quot; The people of Charlotte in 1936 decided that they
wanted to be on the cutting-edge of the development of airport
facilities and aviation at a time when the state of North Carolina
really didn't care too much about that. The citizens of Charlotte, in
the intervening period, spent their own money to help start the
development of a terminal. When you think of the Charlotte airport right
now, most people don't think about the invisible economic flows, the
four billion dollars. They think about physical assets. And I want you
to understand that those physical assets that you see there now that are
supported by the landing fees, the parking fees, the money generated at
the airports, started out when the city council decided that it was
going to use it's bonded, indebtedness capacity, the general obligation
bonds, to start something that we've built up to where it is today. Do
not use the power of government in voting for this measure to undermine
the kind of initiative and positive stewardship that I have heard you,
all, all of you, on both sides of the aisle, talk about in the corridors
of this assembly. This is an opportunity for you to vote again for local
control, for local initiative, and to stand with the people.</p>

is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Uh, to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Today is the hardest day I've ever spent in this chamber for a lot of
reasons. I could sit back here and politically could keep my mouth shut
and that's probably the expediant thing to do. In fact, my campaign
staff's probably back at home wishing I'd sit down right now. But, I
read a Tweet a little bit ago that frustrated me because any decision I
make is my decision alone and this issue is personal to me because the
airport is in my district. I represent the Charlotte Airport in this
body, I represent the people of the 92nd District and I don't know the
right thing to do here. I struggle with this decision. I prayed last
night over this decision as I did on upcoming votes later on today.
There has been no decision that has weighed heavier on me than this one.
We have billion dollars of assets. We have hundreds of employees as
Representative Carney spoke about, uh, and the future of those
employees. And my job as I see it is to best represent the District of
92. I got up this morning planning on voting no. I got in the building
planning on voting no. I got in the room planning on voting no. Sat down
in this chair today planning on voting no. And I'm getting ready to vote
yes. And I'm going to explain to you all why. This is a terribly
difficult decision which probably crushes me politically, but at some
point we've got to come in this chamber and do what we think is right
regardless of the outcome. And, in my opinion, by adding the two members
of the committee that come from West Charlotte, which is my district,
for the first time ever, District 92 will have 2 of 11 members
represented on the authority. That does not currently exist. My job is
to represent those members of that district. And we also have to keep in
mind, once you get past all the hyperbole, once you get past all the
talking points, once you get past the political ramifications and the
policy of this, the politics of this decision and get down to the crux
of the matter, there's only one thing that matter here; that is keeping
that airport healthy. I don't care who runs it, but it is disingenuous
to say that this state is taking over this airport. Not one person in
this chamber will be on that airport authority, not one elected
official. They will all be local people, and they will be majoritally
appointed by local officials. I'm not on that authority. Bruce
Samuelson's not on that authority. Bob Rucho's not on that authority.
They're local, non-elected officials appointed by the majority of which
will be appointed by live in Mecklenburg County. At some point, we have
got to understand that we've got to ensure, we talk about jobs in this
state. And I apologize Representative Boles, I'm not going to ring the
bell, I know that's your thing. Um, we talk about jobs in this state.
There's no one single more, economic driver than Charlotte-Douglas
Airport. Messing with it concerns me. I agree with that. I struggle with
this. There's friends of mine that are looking at me from that side of
the aisle that are disappointed in me and I respect and understand that,
but I've got to protect the economic interests of that airport and it is
my belief and my research that we've got to ensure that the entities
involved in that airport are satisfied in how that airport operates and
the planing costs which is 93 cents...</p>

purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] And, let me just say to my good friend and colleague
and delegation member Mr. Jeter.  Representative Jeter, I sympathize
with your vexed thoughts here today but let me...I was gonna' sit down
and Representative Alexander, Representative Carney had eloquently
expressed what we needed to say but, as a member of this delegation...as
a member of the Mecklenburg delegation, and, as a Representative not
only of District 99 but of Mecklenburg County, which includes the
Charlotte/Douglas Airport, I had to speak today. Let me clear up a
couple of misconceptions.  Representative Jeter talked about
representative from the west side being from the first time...being in
the governance or the advisory part of this airport and actually the way
the structure is now, Representative Jeter, you have already...have a
resident of the west side who is designated as a member of the current
Airport Advisory Committee.  Also let me talk about the governance of
this airport.  In the bill, you have a few slots for Mecklenburg County
and ??????.  You have a few slots for the counties of Lincoln, Union,
and Cabbarrus.  I don't know if Franklin is in there as well.  No, not
Franklin...which one??  Gaston and Union, absolutely!  If this was a
true regional airport, folks...or a true regional airport authority,
then the assets in these particular counties that you wanna put as a
part of the governance, decision-making team on this proposed authority
would have some &quot;skin in the game&quot;.  From the beginning,
this...these entities have no &quot;skin in the game&quot; but yet you
want to give them some governance over the asset that the city of
Charlotte has built up?? For the last seventy years? That's insanity!
Let me tone myself down a little bit. Representative Jeter, when I woke
up this morning, I knew that I was gonna' say no...I didn't have a
problem...I didn't slumber or sleep...I slumbered and slept because I
knew I was gonna say no! I'm still gonna say no and I ask that any
forward thinking ?????? minded person in this chamber says no to this
atrocious bill. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Baumgardner, please state your
purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker.  I represent the other
side of the ?????? River from the airport and I feel the pain of
Representative Jeter over here, believe me.  This is an important issue
to me too.  I don't wanna go around stickin' my nose in other people's
business.  I don't represent Mecklenburg County.  I'm just a border
county but all my family and friends live in the area.  I live fifteen
minutes from the airport and I wanna' do what's best too...and the
clincher on this whole ordeal for me was the fact that the political
leaders of Mecklenburg County appointed a commission to study what they
should do, they came back, gave them a recommendation and they didn't
like the recommendation they got.  Well, they asked for it...and they
didn't get the answer they wanted...so I am....</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Robert Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Rep. Samuelson a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Samuelson, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Samuelson, in Iredell county we very much appreciate the impact the
airport has had on our economic development. One of my question is, it
appears, we've talked about the 93 cent per passenger rate, that's great
because it was operated by a city who had no profit motive. If we move
to the regional authority, what assurance do we have that the profit
motive won't  override the economic benefits to the community?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's an interesting  question, but it's a bodied politic much like a
city would be. It's not a for-profit entity, we're not turning it into a
private for-profit corporation. This is still an entity with the same
sort of political constraints that a city and county would have, so
there is no profit motive.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Samuelson, I respectfully have a different view, in that if it's a
regional authority responsible for operating that-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Brawley, if the gentleman wishes to answer a question, he must do
so, otherwise he must be recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Question.
Do you not think the regional authority running the airport will also
have a motive to make as much money as they can?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir I don't, because their goal is to keep the airport profitable-
er, productive, and the way they do that is keeping the costs down.
There is no incentive for a profit because no one gets paid, there are
no dividends to pay, there are no stockholders, shareholders, or
anything of that who would get a profit were there one. There's no way
for them to retain the funds if they were to have a profit of that sort,
they also will be making reports to all of the counties surrounding them
on a regular basis of what they're doing with their money, this is
transparent in the way any sort of city budget would be done. There's no
way to have a profit or do anything with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will be recognized, in turn, to debate the bill.
Rep. Bill Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House.
We get involved in structures of things all the time. For example, small
towns will have a commissioner form of government. The town of Matthews
had elected commissioners, one of them ran the street department, one of
them ran the police department. When you reach a 10,000 population,
North Carolina law requires that you abandon the commissioner form of
government and go to Mayor/Manager form of government. Although we kept
the name commissioners, we no longer acted as a town commission, we
acted as a town city council. We had a weak mayor and a strong manager,
the same way that the city of Charlotte does. The state is not just a
johnny-come-lately to the airport question. When the airport was first
established, it was actually the general assembly of North Carolina that
allowed the city of Charlotte and other cities to establish aeronautical
facilities. It was a new technology, and in the same way that we built
roads we encouraged that. There have been state grants to that airport
through its entire life including recently, the construction of an
inter-modal facility on that property. State money is involved, and if
you refer to House bill 817 in the state tier of funding, regional
airports, excuse me, airports with a certain number of flights and
international flights are included for funding at the statewide tier,
the district tier, and the divisional tier. That includes 4 airports,
Wilmington-Greensboro, the Triad airport, the Raleigh-Durham airport,
and Charlotte-Douglas international airport. The other three of which
are all managed by authorities. At Charlotte-Douglas, the hub is the
asset. The fact that US Air flies over 700 flights a day. Into an
airport where 80% of the passengers transfer within the airport and
never leave the grounds. Only 20% are are what are called origination
and termination passengers. That means most of the people that are
paying the fees from the airport aren't from anywhere</p>

close to Douglas, far from all of Central North Carolina. When my
daughter flies to Florida, she drives down from Hendersonville, parks at
the Douglas and catches a plane. When Representative Moffitt and I went
on a trip to Turkey last year, Representative Moffitt parked his car in
Charlotte and flew from there, because there was not sufficient service
in Asheville. It is a regional asset and a regional engine.
It is the 6th busiest airport in the world by planes. It is the 27th
busiest in the world by passengers. There is a difference of 30 percent
between the number of people per plane in Charlotte verses Atlanta. A
lower fee is necessary because the fixed cost of an airplane are the
highest, and the profit margins and the air traffic in the United States
today are razor thin. The US airline industry averages $0.37 in profit
per passenger, per flight. So a few cents, a few dollars and a landing
fee can make a huge difference. Especially if your planes are flying
with 30 percent fewer passengers than in a larger airport with a lot of
origination and termination. And the reason that number is particularly
important is that flights into and out of an airport that are
originating and terminating from the starting city, that’s going to be a
single flight that is a higher fare.
We often hear complaints that direct flight fares from Charlotte are
higher, and you would hear people go to Greensboro and fly from
Greensboro and change planes in Charlotte. That is because if you're
changing planes when you leave from Greensboro, you can change planes in
Charlotte, in Raleigh, in Greenville-Spartanburg, in Washington
National, in Atlanta, it doesn't matter to you. You've got two flights
regardless. And that also means that for 80 percent of the people that
fly through Charlotte Douglas, they don't care that it's Charlotte
Douglas. The airline cares, and only the airline cares. And it is the
nurturing of Charlotte Douglas' operation as a hub that is at stake
here.
The biggest, quiet player in this are the airlines. If the airlines were
afraid of a Regional Authority, and they came up here, would they have
said, would they have not said that this is terrible, we hate it; don't
do it? I've not heard anyone say that. The political leaders don't like
it, and I understand. We have to make the decision that is in the best
interest of the entire state of North Carolina. We need to preserve that
hub.
Granted, Matthews has no representation on the Charlotte Airport
Authority, although, when he was mayor, Pat McCrory wanted to expand
representation on the Airport Authority outside the city and outside the
county because he realized it had become a regional economic engine. As
the only International Airport of any size in this area, and a huge
number of companies are in the Greater Charlotte area for no other
reason than they can go out and catch one flight to Germany, to France,
to Brazil. There is no way we could justify that kind of international
air traffic just on the population of Charlotte.
Can New York operate an International Airport at a profit? Yes, but
they've got as many people in their city as we have in our entire state.
And that airport lives and dies as much on originating and terminating
flights as it does on transfers. Los Angeles is the same way. We're not
New York, we're not Los Angeles. We're Charlotte, in North Carolina.
We've been creative, but we're hitting way above our weight class, and
we need to make sure we ensure the long term health of that hub
operation. To preserve an economic engine that most of us have no idea
how much it has added to the economic growth of the state. Is this
difficult? Yes. Is this unpleasant? Yes. Most of the best decisions we
make are the hardest. This is one. I'm asking you to move to the future</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members we have heard a lot about this local issue so I make my comments
brief, first I will correct the couple of things one the authority will
have no ability to levy at tax so the comments made that by doing this
somehow another there will be taxes on people they don’t have the
authority to levy at tax, all of their expenses will be paid through
revenues at the airport. Second, there is been the question of why did
we include the other counties? We included the other counties because
while we talk about the regional input it really isn’t international
airport, the ones most directly impacted are regional neighbors. So, we
felt like it was appropriate and based on models from other authorities
we look at that and felt that it makes sense to add them in there. And
the front page of the ___[01:01] observe today there is this allegation
that I will address that we were did the way that we did the counties
are joining us so that our authority could go in and bother airports
that is not the intent, the intent was it’s a regional airport there
maybe times when we need cooperation of our adjoining counties and we
are enabling them to do that, we are looking at that language that it
needs to be changed and make sure it’s clear that’s not our intent to
use the money of the airport of Charlotte to buy other airports, we will
have that fix before the third reading on Thursday but we don’t think
that’s a problem but I wanna to address it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be Monday Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct Monday I’m sorry but the final thing I wanna to say was the bit
about how we got here and why we are doing at this way? Our
Representative Carney was kind enough to acknowledge that we have worked
hard to try to work with the City Council we actually did have a
mediator that’s kind of quite but that didn’t seem to work either. The
fact is that as I have gotten more and more into this bill the more I
have learned about the number of times that the idea of an airport
authority has been brought up and has been brought up and mentioned the
City Council members for years and no action was ever taken. So, people
who are interested in the authority that were getting no movement, no
interest from City Council some of them came to the state and said, “We
can’t seen to get anywhere, we have been trying for years in various
ways, will you all take a look at it?” I would still prefer to have the
city work with us on this but they have turned this down. So, at this
point we are listing to the people of Mecklenburg County that if come to
us and said, “We think this is a good idea, we have listened to the
consultant who thinks it’s a good idea.” So, right now we ask you to
support us and what we still believe is a good idea, thank you.

They opposed the creation of a commission, at least by us. Now, there's
no question the airport operates efficiently. It operates effectively.
We've had no one say that there's a problem with the operation of this
airport. Quite frankly, there hasn't been adequate accolades given to
the city of Charlotte for operating it so well at such a reduced cost
and providing such a great impact on the region that has helped the
region grow. As you look at the bill, and I hope you will take time to
read the bill before you vote, or before you vote on third at least. And
I know some people are confused. And a lot of times when we do analysis
of issues, when we don't have guiding principles when we go into the
analysis, we can get confused. We can be for it before we're against it.
We can be against it before we're for it. But if we don't have any
principles of analysis, we may have that problem, So, when we look at,
do we favor local control? Do we favor a taking? Well if you don't favor
a taking, then we are taking this airport from the city of Charlotte.
There's no dispute who initiated it. There's no dispute who has managed
it these 70 years. There's no dispute of this efficiency and
effectiveness. There's no dispute of this impact on the region. So why
did we decide to be Big Brother and say &quot;We're going to take your
airport, that you invested in, that you created, that you have run so
successfully all these years, and decide that we now know how to do it
better for you.&quot;? Where did that idea come from? Well when we asked
the people do they want it, they said, 65% said no. We don't need your
help, we got this. We've been handling it for 70 years. We think we can
carry it on. We understand what the people want. I heard someone make a
reference about &quot;Don't let great be the enemy of the good.&quot;
Well, don't let good be the enemy of the great. They're doing a good
job, maybe a great job. We don't know what would happen going in the
future regarding this airport authority that folks need to create. The
question of compensation, and I heard  a comment of it since we're
talking about a taking from a local entity, the question is &quot;What
is the value of this airport? And how does it get restored to the city
of Charlotte?&quot; Well I think if you read section seven on page
eight, you'll see some reference to how this compensation is supposedly
going to be created. But keep in mind that there's some foggy language
in there that indicates there's going to be compensation. There's going
to be compensation for acquisition of airport property. Doesn't really
describe what that would constitute, what that would mean, doesn't
prescribe any schedule upon which this compensation should be restored
to the city of Charlotte. So, they're not made whole on any schedule.
There's no formula to put in place to make ensure that they will be made
whole. And obviously, there is an existing dispute at this time. In the
history of this resolution to this matter, the city of Charlotte also
made an effort to reach out and have legislators involved. And now, what
we end up with is an &quot;us against them&quot; situation versus the
will of 65% of the people polled. If we, as the legislature, big brother
in this case, think we know what's best for Charlotte, the city council,
which was elected solely by the citizens of Charlotte, think  they know
what's best in administering their airport, that they've administered
for 70 years successfully. Who is to say who should convene these
negotiations? I think there's still an opportunity for us and the city
of Charlotte to go ahead, meet, and resolve this issue in the best
interests of the citizens of Charlotte. It does not have to be the state
legislature versus the citizens of Charlotte. We're the big bad brother,
and we're going to come in and tell you what you're going to do with
your asset, despite the 65% who say they don't need our help in this.
They can get it resolved. So, I hope you'll vote against this. Give this
parties an opportunity to get together and do what's in the best
interests of the citizens of Charlotte. Take some time to listen to the
citizens of Charlotte, the 65% who say they don't want this forced upon
them. So I hope you'll consider that. I hope you'll read the bill that
leads before we get on final reading. And one other item I do want to
make sure is clear. The great service this airport provides in giving
the citizens employment opportunities and contract opportunities...</p>

know exactly what's going to happen with the great initiative Charlotte
has to involve small businesses, women-owned businesses, minority
businesses, etc. in the operations in the operations of the airport and
the contracting. It's not provided for in this bill except for whatever
minimal the Federal government would require. Charlotte has been a
leader in this area, and I would hope you would also insure that those
issues are addressed going forward. So those folks who benefited can
continue to participate. They made this airport great. And I hope you'll
keep them in your consideration. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Speaker Changes: Representative Rodney Moore, please state your purpose.
Speaker Changes: To speak on the bill.
Speaker Changes: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a second
time.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to clear up some
misconceptions, some things that were left out in this conversation. We
talked about the economic impact on the region of the regional economic
impact of the Charlotte Douglas Airport, which is 12 billion dollars.
12 million dollar economic impact. This particular piece of paper is
something that the independent consultant Mr. Oliver Wineman found that
Charlotte had a spectacularly successful in most regards including its
low cost, high end service quality, and prudent financial management.
The consultant also found that the Charlotte Airport is the most
unlikely candidate for a change in governant than any of its peers. So
it's one of the best city-run airports in the nation. The consultant
found there was no need to change the governant structure. I ask you,
one again, to defeat this bill. Let's go back to the table with the city
council and if we decide, as the City Council and as the delegation and
others, that if the is the right structure, let's do that. But not at
this particular time and not in this particular manner. Thank you.
Speaker Changes: Representative Bill Brawley, please state your purpose.
Speaker Changes: To speak a second time, sir.
Speaker Changes: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a second

Speaker Changes: I've enjoyed listening to the debate on polls. Perhaps
the gentleman would look at the poll results for Voter ID and change
their position on that. Actually that's a broader based poll than just
Mecklenburg County. I'm poking a little fun because actually this
actually comes up to a question that I was asked when I ran for the seat
in 2010. I was asked how I was going to poll the members of my district
on different questions, and I said, &quot;I'm not. I'm going to run. I'm
going to tell you what my values are, I'm going to tell you what my
priorities are. I'm going to tell you how I make decisions, and then I'm
going to come to Raleigh and I'm going to do the scholarship that I need
to do to make decisions and I will tell you what my positions are and
why I think I'm right and give you the chance to argue with me. But I'm
not going to be able to call up everybody in District 103 and say,
&quot;What do you think I ought to do?&quot; The reason that you sent me
as your representative as to do the due diligence that you would do if
you had the time to come to Raleigh and sit down and do it.  And I'm
acting as your agent and I owe you the duty of my best diligence and my
best judgement, not follow polls, but follow the facts, follow my
intelligence. I would ask you to do what is right for North Carolina in
this case. Thank you.

[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this
is a study bill. This issue was discussed in the Elections Committee.
This would authorize a study of whether our state should require the use
of paper ballots. There are at least nineteen states in the country that
use only paper ballots. I will tell you that there are at least thirty
organizations, meaning from both the left and the right and all points
in between, nonpartisan, bipartisan, that believe that we should do
this. There are logistical concerns. There are some of our counties that
use different types of machines that do not require paper ballots and so
there would be some cost in the long run as far as replacing those
machines if and when we decide to do that. So we believe that it would
be best to be put into a study in the interim, and come back with the
idea of whether this is a good policy that we should pursue. I would ask
for your vote on this Bill.

Carteret County, where we had touchscreen voting machines and we lost
votes because of those machines. We went to paper ballots immediately
after that and have had successful elections. With that, people feel a
lot more comfortable, and I tell you that these machines can mess up.
The touchscreen machines can mess up, as we witnessed. It was a horrible
thing for us to go through. We had to go back and get affidavits from
people, some of the elections were on hold because of this, so this is a
wonderful idea to have paper ballots and I'm glad we're studying...</p>

Thank you Mr. Speaker.
This basically relates to antique automobiles sold at the collector
shows that are coming in from out of state. There has been some serious
delays with people being able to get North Carolina titles, and the
purpose of the bill is to move things forward in a more expeditious
manner. There are several hundred of these that are done, or several
thousand, a few thousand, that are done every year. But a comment made
by many of the collectors is they know more about the antique
automobiles than the inspectors from DMV so they would ask that we worry
less about them not knowing what they're buying and more about letting
them title it and be able to own it in North Carolina. I would
appreciate support for the bill.

shows, they can take place among individuals. I live in a border county,
we border with Virginia, and so we experience these out of state sales
with some frequency. A friend of mine who is quite a collector spent 18
months working on it before he could obtain title, so Senator</p>

Representative Dollar rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. This
bill is very similar to House Bill 320, which the House passed back in
May. I believe it was 114 to nothing. What this bill does is, as the
title indicates, it puts some additional clarification and regulation
and structure to the appeals that patients and residents have that are
dealing with the local LME/MCOs in the area of mental health,
developmental disabilities and substance abuse.
We think this is a consensus bill. It’s very similar to what we passed
in the House. I’ll be happy to answer any questions. I appreciate your
support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative John Bell, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman’s recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, members of the House, this bill
has three parts. I’ll cover the first part and the Representative
Faircloth and Representative McGrady will follow up with the rest of it.
On the first part of this bill is recommended by the law enforcement
division of the Wildlife Resources Commission. This bill moves 22 class
3 misdemeanors in Chapter 75A, the Boating Safety Act. It makes them
infractions. Instead of the $25 fine plus the $180 court cost, you would
only have to pay the $50 fine, no court costs, and have no criminal
record. You could contest the citation and go to court, where if you’re
found guilty you…</p>

who pay the fines plus the court costs. It also increases the fines and
the penalties on seven existing hunting violations and creates new
violations with regard to taking of deer from posted land and the taking
of elk illegally, which has just been introduced to our state. Lastly,
it increases the fine for operating while intoxicated for boating
violations to a minimum of $250. Currently there is no minimum fine
associated with this violation. And I ask for your support.

Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. Speaker, members of the House, the second reading went by
so fast I forgot my amendment there. But here it is. On the last part of
the bill, you voted, the last part of the bill you voted on three times
before has been sent to the Senate in 2009, 2011, and earlier in 2013,
and they apparently have not had the opportunity to look at it. And so
this is getting it back to them. And the amendment--I'm thinking that
probably the reason they haven't passed it yet is because we had not
perfected the definition of public utilities, and some of the utilities
came to me yesterday and asked for this amendment. It's just
modernizing--instead of telegraphs and telephones, which is so 20th
century, it's communications facilities. And adding in distribution of
natural gas, which is the big thing. So I ask for agreement on the
amendment. And if it passes, I would ask Representative McGrady perhaps
to explain that part, if he wants to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a good amendment. I will explain the part that Representative
Stam has suggested I explain after we adopt the amendment. But this is
in no way inconsistent with the legislation that we previously passed,
really is clarifying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wish to be recorded as voting aye on second reading on Senate Bill
636.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will be recorded as having voted aye. Further discussion,
further debate on the amendment. If not, the question before the House
is the passage of the amendment supported by Representative Stam for the
House Committee Substitute Number 2 of Senate Bill 636. All in favor
vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk
will let the machine record the vote. One hundred and thirteen having
voted in the affirmative and one in the negative, the amendment passes.
We're now back on the bill as amended. Further discussion, further
debate. Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As requested by Representative Stam, I just wanted to make it clear to
everyone that the eminent domain bill that has passed the House on
several different occasions is in this bill now that passed last time by
a vote of 110 to 8. It's Part 3, pages 6, line36, through part, page 7,
line 40. Nothing has changed other than the few words that were just the
subject of an amendment. There's nothing else there. This is another
case where we just haven't been able to get any bill moved more, and no
explanation as to why it's not moving. So we're trying to provide a
little bit of an oomph. And I appreciate the Speaker's--how quickly
you've moved through this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the passage of the House Committee Substitute Number 2 to
Senate Bill 636, as amended, on its third reading. All in favor vote
aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.</p>

from happening in the future and to strengthen that protection. This has
