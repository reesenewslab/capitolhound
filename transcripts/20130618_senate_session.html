[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. The journal of Monday, June 17, 2013 has been
examined and is found to be correct. I move that we dispense with the
reading of the journal and that it stand approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, the journal for June 17 stands approved as written.
Leave of absence has been granted for Senator Ford.
Ladies and gentlemen, the nurse of the day is Gale Lane from Roanoke
Rapids and Al Lane, EMT from Roanoke Rapids. Will you please give them a
round of applause.
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Ford has reappeared and we’re glad to have
him back. He is no longer absent. Maybe mentally, but not physically.
Senator Berger is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. A motion relating to the calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I move that House Bill 998 be taken off the calendar
today. We are presently talking with members of the House and with the
governor about some  modifications to that bill and we are hopeful that
we will be able to reach some accommodations so if we could move it to
tomorrow’s calendar we may have something to announce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Senator Nesbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will the gentleman yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger, if the bill is changed, will it go back to committee to
where we’ll have a chance to observe the changes and debate them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all, we don’t know that we’re going to have any changes. I
think that will likely depend on what changes, if any are proposed. I
would think that it’s entirely possible that whether we make changes
through a floor amendment or if we send it back to committee that
probably what you’re looking at is the bill, that those changes being
such that the bill will actually carry over an additional day. I think.
Now, again, we don’t know what those amendments, at this point, might
be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would he yield for one additional question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And this would be the form of a request. I would like to request on
behalf of the members and certainly the members in the minority party,
that we be given a chance to review them before we have to debate the
bill. I think it will speed the process up and we pretty well know who’s
going to win up here, but it doesn’t hurt that everybody at least be
knowledgeable about what’s in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, as soon as we know whether or not we have something
that we’ll be able to move forward with and if so, have it drafted. I
think we’ll move with as deliberate speed as possible to get that
information to the members and give everyone an opportunity to have a
chance to read over it, contemplate and figure out how they’re going to
vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Reports of standing committees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Allran, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To send forward a committee report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth your committee report.

Member of the Surry County Board of Commissioners from 1984 until 1992.
And whereas Don W. East served seven terms in the North Carolina General

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Randleman is recognized to explain the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mister President. Mister President, senators and special
guests, each of us are the authors of our life's book and at the end of
each day, we decide the content on each page. Senator East also wrote
his life's book, which began when a baby boy was born to Ralph and Viola
East. There would have been a chapter, probably a lengthy chapter,
describing the occasion when Senator East met and later married the love
of his life, Connie. No doubt, there would have been many entries about
his beloved little girl Gena, conversations and events with his
son-in-law Mickey, and how proud he was of his grandsons, Mathew and
Jacob.
Senator Don East was a proud public servant, serving with the
Winston-Salem Police Department, the Surry County Board of Commissioners
and the North Carolina General Assembly. He was devoted to his
constituents, his community and to the state of North Carolina. It has
been my honor to bring this resolution forward. I commend it to you and
ask for your support. Mister President, I move that the words of the
resolution be spread upon the pages of the journal.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Without objection. So ordered. Senator Brown, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mister President. I think all of us that served with Don
really saw Don as that unique individual whose personality was just
unique in so many ways. When you really got to know Don, you had to love
him. Because he was just maybe a little rough on the outside at times
but inside he was probably the most tenderhearted guy I think we all had
ever met. He didn't say much on the floor but he's one of those guys
when he stood up to speak on the floor, you normally had to pay
attention because he was very, very passionate about that thing that he
was going to talk about. There's several events we can think about. A
couple that just jump out at me was the barber bill where he was trying
to help this local barber and his local community. That bill kind of
worked it's way through the Senate and it went over to the House and it
got amended over in the</p>

<p id="20:00">
House and it came back here and somehow that bill got changed and his
little piece about the barber got taken out. I think he told Senator
Bass about it, how exactly he felt about that, and I think that was one
of those shining moments that I'll never forget, but it was just kind of
Don. Of course, Senator Bingham is tied to Don with his Charger that he
bought from me, and I'll let Senator Bingham maybe talk about that a
little more, but at the end, Don became my roommate, and that's where I
really got to know Don East. Don talked to me a whole lot about certain
things, and one of the things he talked to me about was how he helped
individuals back in his district. One of them was a young lady who had a
problem with her eye, and she was from a poor family, and that family
just never had the money to help that young lady and Don convinced the
family to have some surgery on that eye and Don payed for it, right out
of his pocket. I think it was about a $10,000 surgery, but I think I'm
one of the few that he ever told that to, because that's just the kind
of guy he was. He really talked to me about his family, he truly loved
his family, and every night when we'd be sitting after session, and we'd
always spend time talking about his grandkids, and his daughter, and
just how much he enjoyed being around them, and they were really really
special to him, I think, later in his life. And I think that the real
key thing for Don was that he had a couple loves, and one of them was
that he wanted to travel, and he bought a motor home I guess a couple of
years ago, and he finally got a chance to travel in that motor home, and
he did a lot of it, he covered most of the United States in that motor
home and I think Nashville might have been his best stop, because he
talked about going to Nashville and spending days going in and out of
the bars listening to different people play in those bars and how much
he enjoyed that. His other passion was old cars, and he had a couple of
old '40 Fords he was trying to restore, and he talked to me about that,
how he spent most of his weekends working on those old vehicles and
that's just kind of those passions he had. Don became a very good friend
of mine, and I'm going to sure miss him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator East sat right here, where you sit, ??? this incident about the
hair braiding deal that he was gonna have his local barbers be able to
go over to the rest homes, and cut their hair without getting all this
certification mess, and that got took out. That day we was sittin back
there on the back row, a lot of fun back there, we could do about
anything. But Harry, sittin beside of me, he was shakin like this while
this debate was going on with Senator Grue??? and others, and I said,
&quot;Are you going to say anything?&quot; He said, &quot;You wait just
a damn minute!&quot; Well his blood pressure had to be 200. When he did
speak, I won't even say what he said but he told them to take that bill
and to you know what with it, where the sun don't shine, that made
national news, but to Senator East, and I've never seen as fast a time
out when as Mark Baznih??? and I and Tony and them huddled around
Grue???, and that bill got fixed in two or three minutes right on the
floor. Now that was action. I accuse Don, some of you have known Don
longer than me but I doubt if you known him any better than me, I went
in that motor home two or three times with him. We went to the outer
banks for a week. His grandsons I know, I've seen one or two of them up
there, right in front of ??? knew them well, he loved their pickin' and
singin', and he had them down here one time, down here to do a little,
and he was talking about that a lot, you're right. I called him a man
with sawmill personality and a Philadelphia lawyer's mind. And if you
knew Don, he didn't miss out, unless we would tell him the joke or
something, he didn't miss out on anything. I'll tell you about one
incident that Senator Curtis??? stole from me at the funeral. It's a
true story, but I think I own this one, so I'm gonna tell it. He kept
bugging me to see Richard Petty. I said, &quot;Alright, you're gonna get
a sit down with Richard Petty and his wife too, so&quot;</p>

<p id="25:00">
We have a fish fry every year with the party but I planned a different
one over at this local restaurant that Richard eats most of the time on
Thursday nights. So we got him over there and we had 200 to 300 people
there and we saved this big table for Linda and Richard, Amanda and
myself and dawn, and his friend at that time. And we chatted about cars
and everything and Don had bought this charger that you all were riding
down the road in at a high rate of speed. he had that parked right in
the front door. Now it was 200 people trying to get in around that
thing, well Richard comes in, sees that super-bird there, it's like all
of the dodges he used to drive, he looked it over and he came in and got
him over there at the table, we got our food, and he said, Richard, come
outside, I want to show you something. He said, look here, how do you
like this light baby blue Dodge Charger?
Harry you sold it to him didn't you? And Richard said, man I like that.
He said, you got your grace pen? And Richard always has his grace pen.
He said how about signing right up over the door here, Richard [??]. He
did, Richard [??] Petty. Richards big black dodge was sitting over here,
he said let me see your grace pen. He walks over to Richard car and
writes Don East. true story. And Richard didn't know what to say. I said
what are you gonna do with  that? He said I'm gonna leave it. I've never
had a fool put his name on my car. And about a month later it was still
not here, I don't know if it's not here today or not but that is a true
story. I got many others that we can't tell, but I do know that when
Connie was sick and I would call and talk to Don this was a very low
point in his life and it took him a long time to get over that. He loved
over his family as we all said, he loved Connie. And I talked to Don
about every day and we do miss him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. president?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird what purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill, the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As many of you who were here know for a long, Don and
I used to have vigorous debates about guns but we were good friend. We
enjoyed each other's company, we liked the banter, and we respected each
other, worked on bills together, he was a great friend. I remember how
he suffered at the loss of his beloved wife, it was one of the very
difficult parts of his life. But he had another difficult part that he
didn't share with anybody and when he told the story it was such a
shock, and especially to me because we had talked about guns and debated
about guns. He never revealed to anybody at his own father had been
killed, had been murdered by a gun. And it was so moving and I felt so
strongly about it, but that was the type of person that Don was. He
would not bring anything because out of his private life that would
change any of the dynamics and the relationships, and I miss Don very
much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Reluctantly Senator Bingham what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the resolution Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ladies and gentleman of the Senate. The last
time I stood up I got in a lot of trouble talking about Don East. This
time I'm a little wiser but I did find out one valuable thing, I can't
be prosecuted for what I say whether it be the truth or not. So I'm
gonna try to continue to tell the truth. After the last time I spoke
concerning don, of course Don and I go back a long ways, I didn't
realize it when I came down here but there was a gentleman named Ralph
Johnson who I know the family knows well. he lived in the area I was
from and Ralph and I, he's a little older than I, but we got in as much
trouble as Don and I did but in a different area. But don was riding
motorcycles with Ralph years ago and was in an accident and Ralph was
one of the first ones there to aide Don, and of course you noticed he
had walked with a limp.</p>

...?? when we got to know each other, we had a lot of similar interests.
I had a '66 Ford pick-up that I'd restored. Driving in parades and he
also has one. He likes fast cars and motorcycles. And I know after the
last episode that I spoke of, I think Don was interviewed by New York
Times, or somebody, I don't know who. And I think he told them he said,
&quot;You know that Bingham exaggerates. He said we were going 145 miles
an hour. If you only knew him you would realize that he does exaggerate
quite a bit. We wasn't going one bit over 144.&quot;
[laughter]
But anyway, there's a lot of other things I could talk about Don, but he
was a dear friend, loved by everyone here and will forever be
remembered. And I certainly appreciate the family and sharing him with
him here. He's very special and I have many memories of Don East from
things we did here and things that I'm not going to say anything else
about. Especially on this floor. Because Senator Hartsell done told me
that felonies are, they don't go away or whatever that terminology is.
[laughter]
But anyway, thank you, very much and you're appreciate and love Don East
and thank you for your family being here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate.
When you listen to these speeches today you pick up a common theme. Don
East was a very good listener. If you'd just spend five minutes with him
he'd know what you cared about. And I felt like in our case, it's fairly
well-known that I participate in crew chief in my son's race car and so
I'm around cars all the time. My granddaughter races. And he latched
right on to that and I felt like I helped him build that '44 a fender at
a time. I mean, every time I'd see him I'd get an update on how we were
coming and how well everything was going.
And it's very seldom in here that you can remember a role model in a
current time. Usually we're talking about great people from the past and
how good they were. And if you knew Don East, he was a man of his word.
Period. You didn't have to ask him twice. And I will not forget when we
were in here arguing over some of our deregulation, and we did a bill
that was probably, in my opinion, the most important piece of
deregulation that we did was making final decision making of
administrative law judges final. Gives everybody a fair hearing. It will
force settlement of cases. We put that bill together and somehow it got
muddled up in conference or somewhere and half a bill came back. And Don
East stood up over there and said, &quot;Uh-uh. That wasn't the deal we
made and we're going to go back and put this all back together.&quot;
And we did. And for those of you that are new to the back row, we
unanimously overrode a Gubernatorial veto on that bill.
And Don East is the one that stood up and said no. We're going to do
what we said we were going to do. Just thought I'd bring that up. It's
something we can all learn from.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Allran, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Whenever Don was around, you always knew it. And when
he wasn't around, you also knew that he wasn't around. And that's
because he was straight forward and colorful and outspoken. And even
cantankerous. And he never hedged on what his views were, politically or
otherwise. And I think we all knew that, but one thing I wanted to
follow up on was one more little story about how he would, the other
aspect of Don was the way he would go out of his way to be helpful to
people. And this is right before he died, which of course was a shock to
all of us.</p>

In his travels he had gotten to know the Outer Banks, and he was out on
Manteo where he was hanging around with a lot of new friends. He became
close to Marc Basnight actually. But he was out there, and he ran into a
gentleman whose son was involved in a real estate transaction with me.
It had become a real sticky real estate transaction with a lot of
glitches, and the father of the son was concerned that it wasn't gonna
go through. Don took the time to call me and talk to me about it, and we
worked it out. The gentleman got assured that the real estate
transaction would work out. And as a matter of fact, it did. The point
being he didn't have to get involved in that private business, but he
did do that type of thing. He would go to the trouble just to help
people. That really impressed me, and Don is the person that is very
hard not to miss and of course we do miss him. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
??, what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, we do
a number of these resolutions, and over the years I've heard a number of
them. It's always, especially if you knew the person that was being
talked about, it brings back some memories. It puts a smile on your
face, but it also reminds you in many respects about how fragile life
is. In this sense, what we're doing and who we're talking about is
somebody that I think you get a feel for the fact that Don East was a
real person. He was somebody that you wanted to have on your side
because if he was on your side, you had somebody who no matter what was
going to look after you and was gonna look after what was important.
We've heard the stories. Really the night, I think it was in the evening
that his ?? bill got sideways, and he explained to the senate and to the
world what could happen to that bill was something. That was just
vintage Don East. It really was because that was the person that we all
knew, because he was straightforward. He didn't mince words. He didn't
try to shade things in any way. He was who he was, and who he was is
someone that a lot of people cared a lot about. Gina, I know that you
and your boys miss him. We all miss him, and the only thing I can say is
we appreciate the time that we were allowed to spend with him because it
was special to us. I urge you support for the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I'd just like to add a couple of quick comments before we vote.
There's been no one greater in this body that meant more to me than Don
East. The days Don East and John Garwood and Ed Jones and all of us
those who have gone before are said together were days we should never
forget, and we should try to imitate and emulate those folks because
they set an example. Don was a true advocate. If he got something that
he wanted to get done, you knew it, and he would get it done. So with
that being said, any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is the passage of the Senate Joint Resolution
7 on a second reading. All in favor will vote aye. All opposed will vote
no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting, and the court will
record the vote. 50 having voted in the affirmative, 0 in the negative,
Senate Joint Resolution 7 passes second reading and without objection
will be read for a third time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] North Carolina ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none, all in favor of the passage of Senate Joint Resolution 7 on its
third reading will stand. Senate Joint Resolution 7 passes on its third
reading.</p>

Will be sent to the House by special messenger. While we have everyone
standing I'd like to, uh extend courtesies of the gallery on
recommendation and motion of Senator Randleman for Senator [East's?]
daughter. [Gina Southern?] and her husband [Micky?] if you'll please
stand, Surry County Sheriff Graham Atkinson's wife [Mellissa?] and son
[Hugh?] Atkinson. Surry County Commissioners [Buck Gordon?] and [Larry

us.
[applause]
Thank you. Mr. President.
Senator Brunstetter for what purpose do you rise?
A series of motions.
Senator has the floor. State your motions.
Thank you Mr. President, first motion's related to today's calendar
House Bill 26, strengthen laws vehicle theft. Ask that it be removed
from today's calendar and refer to the Committee on Rules.
Without objection so ordered.
House Bill 107, Eastern Region Disbursement of Funds, would move that it
be recalled from the Committee on Rules and re-referred to the Committee
on Appropriations based budget.
Without objection so ordered.
And Senate Joint Resolution 15, honor Gene Preston, would ask that it be
removed from the Committee on Rules and re-referred to the Committee on
Education.
Without objection so ordered.
So I think that brings us to House Bill 122, is that correct?
[silence]
Is that right?
[silence]
Okay, House Bill 122, the Court will read.
House Bill 122 [ameaning to Lockebury appeal family law?]
Senator Goolsby to explain the Bill.
Thank you Mr. President, this allows appeals from divorce orders or
judgments that divorce child custody support court alimony and equitable
contribution. It allows you to appeal separate parts of those orders up
to the Court of Appeals. You don't have to wait for a final judgment in
all those matters. That was brought to us by the Law Association, is
considered very important by many, or, I guess most of our family
lawyers who are in the State, as I understand it from the phone calls
I've received. Additionally it also adjusts the requirements regarding
confidentiality in judicial standards commission.
I'd appreciate your support of the bill and be happy to try to answer
and questions you might have.
Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none. Question for the Senate
is the passage of House Bill 122 on its second reading. All those in
favor will vote aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed
for the voting and the Court will record the vote.
36 voting in the affirmative 14 in the negative. House Bill 122 passes

Further discussion or debate? Hearing none. All in favor of House Bill
122 on its third reading will say aye.
Aye.
Opposed no.
No.
The ayes have it, House Bill 122 passes its third reading and will be
sent to the House for concurrence. That brings House Bill 656.
House Bill 656, Forfeiture for Speeding to Elude Revisions.
Oh yeah.
Mr. President.
Senator Randleman to explain the Bill.
Thank you Mr. President. Members, in 2011 both chambers passed
legislation to make speeding to elude arrest crimes a felony and set up
a procedure for forfeiture and sale of those vehicles. That legislation
included language that was already in place for the forfeiture of
vehicles seized in prearranged racing. These procedures</p>

<p id="45:00">
…are complicated and seldom used and do not work well for this
situation. House Bill 656 removes the language from the pre-race, racing
forfeiture procedure and places it with the procedure for the forfeiture
of vehicles for impaired driving.
The impaired driving procedures have worked well for many years and will
be a better fit with the speeding-to-elude-arrest crimes. This Bill is
supported by the Sheriff’s Association and I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 727 on an, “Alt. Procedure for Obtaining Salvage Title.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin to explain the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members, House Bill 727 is a method whereby a
salvage company can obtain a title to a salvaged vehicle if the title is
not turned over to them by the owner in a timely fashion. Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to send forth an amendment for this, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth your amendment. Do we have it on a dashboard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is on a dashboard. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin moves to amend the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, you have the floor to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. This amendment has three parts. The first part
amends the Bill that I just was describing and mentions it only. The
second part of the Bill is about brownfields and this reduces the number
of acres required to have brownfield cleanup, which was arbitrarily set
at 25, to any acreage.
There are many, many brownfields in this state that are less than 25
acres in total and right now our law just has a 25-acre minimum. No one
can go back and that was why that was put there. But it does prohibit
developers and municipalities or counties from cleaning up say an old
filling station or something like that.
It’s just something that was in the law that we found in the City of
Wilmington that was contrary to what the City would like to do as they
go forward. I think in about 60-something sites, 53 of the sites that
they looked at in their plan were five acres or less. That simply allows
that acreage to be smaller if it needs to be cleaned up. That’s the
second part.
The final part amends the statute of limitations for counties or
municipalities to enforce zoning or unified development ordinances which
requires them to bring action within 10 years of an offense. Currently
there’s not a statute of limitations, so things can go on for years and
years and years. So, they must bring action against a break in an
ordinance within 10 years. I’ll be happy to answer a question, Senator
Nesbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Discussion or debate on amendment one to House Bill 727? Senator
Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and Members of the Senate.  My members are
wearing me out back here thinking he had the wrong Bill and then I said,
“No, unfortunately, I think he’s got the right Bill, just the wrong
subject.” If I’m hearing this…</p>

<p id="50:00">
We’re adding two totally unrelated items to this bill. That, I mean this
is a Salvage Title Bill. I didn’t see anything else in it. I don’t know
whether now’s the time to try to pull it so that everybody can read the
amendment or after the amendment passes. I don’t think anybody knows
what they’re doing on the amendment in here right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Object to third reading, perhaps?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I could object to third reading but that would be, let me try one other
motion, Mr. President and that would be that the bill and the pending
amendment be taken off the calendar and recalendared for tomorrow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President. I would suggest to the bill sponsor that he pull his
amendment right now, go through second reading, let you object the third
reading and you can look at the amendment tonight and do third reading
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly, no problem at all with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, so amendment 1 has been withdrawn.  That puts House Bill 727 for
second reading before us.  Further discussion or debate? Hearing none,
the question before the Senate is passage of House Bill 727 on its
second reading. All those in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote
no. Five minutes be recorded, allowed for voting and the clerk will
record the vote.  House Bill 727 passes its second reading and will be
held over for third reading tomorrow. That brings us to House Bill 784.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 784 Worthless Check Present Cash Check
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin has the floor to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, this bill really covers two quick business
arrangements.  It times the first one’s bill with the times when the
technology gets out ahead of the law.  Right now we have a new scam
going on whereby people who receive a check can take a picture of it on
their iPhone or any other intelligent phone, send it to the bank and get
credit for it in their bank account and then ?? to the small business
that doesn’t have a lot of electronic means and get the check cashed so
they get dual compensation.  The problem is the small business isn’t
protected by the current law regarding bounced checks.  This simply
fixes that issue. The second issue deals with when magistrates get
checks to deal with the legalities involved in a charge that deals with
bad checks, they can’t deal with this sort of an issue and it fixes that
also it gives,  this bill gives names and guidance to the magistrates
and how to deal with that problem. I commend you to pass the bill but I
do have an amendment technical to send forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator sent forth your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Its in, it’s on the dashboard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin from Harnett moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s a simple amendment that takes one of the words out of the litany of
bad check world.  It’s a, it says wrong bank, you can’t punish a person
for making a mistake and sending their check to the wrong bank so we
just took wrong bank out of the words that describe what bad checks are
all about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Discussion or debate on Amendment  1 on House Bill 784? Hearing none,
the question before the body is the adoption of Amendment 1, all in
favor will vote aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed
for the voting and the clerk will record the vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m voting aye, I just.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are you sure about that Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think so it’s just one of those days where I’ve already had enough ??
I don’t need more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin’s voted aye and that’s totally understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
50 have voted in the affirmative, none in the negative Amendment 1 is
adopted. That brings House Bill 784 as amended before us for it second
reading.  Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, House Bill 784
is before us on its second reading.  All those in favor.</p>
