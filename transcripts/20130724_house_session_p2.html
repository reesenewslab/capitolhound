Calendar
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the house, we are back on the conference report
for house bill 392.  The house will come to order.  Representative Arp,
please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  During the great break we had, I had
an opportunity to discuss the concerns with mycolleague, representative
Glazier, also check staff and may I defer to representative Glazier?.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  First, I have to say thank you to
representative Arp.  He spent, and representative Horn I think as well,
has spent a lot of time on this break, first talking through the issues
and then talking to staff, and I think we've worked out a resolution, an
I'll state whatI think it is, and representative Arp, if that's not
correct, please correct me.  My big concern, as everyone knows before,
and I think a lot of ours, and I think representative Arp shaped it is
how we balance the criminal justice issue of getting the bad guy here
without catching in the net everybody and fingerprinting everybody.  And
the answer, I think is that representative Arp is going to state what he
understands his intent of that provision is as well on the floor and to
the commission, that is that the only time that there'll be a
recommendation that we go to the fingerprinting which is required for
the Federal check is when there really is pretty good suspicion,
reasonable suspicion that the state check is insufficient.  That is,
there something in the Federal check it is not showing up on the state
check, and we have some grounds to believe that is the case.  And then,
it would be reasonable to ask for the fingerprints and go to the Federal
check.  I agree with that, if that's the intent, and that's was going to
be stated to the commission and that's what the commission rules would
be, seems to me that that meets every ones criteria and does a really
good job.  I would consent to that, and I would then vote for the bill
because the vast majority of people would not be fingerprinted.  That's
my understanding of what's going to happen, and I think for my
colleagues the other part is the bill provides that the rules the
commission comes out with will come out in February of 2014, but the
bill doesn't go into effect until months later, so that if there is a
problem and for some reason the commission is coming up with a different
set of rules than what's intended tonight, that we'll have an
opportunity in May to correct that, and I have word of representative
Arp and I think representative Horn as well, and I trust it completely,
that we will do that.  So with that, I return, Mr. Speaker, back to
representative Arp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Arp is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  That is our intent, is to ensure that again the
way the bill is worded, it requires the background check to the extent
of state resources.  And it does do that.  Beyond that standpoint, there
would be a reasonable reason to do that, and so if there's a suspicion
exists beyond the normal background which does not turn up that, which
is the state of an out of state person that has a warrant that does
notopener state data bases, then a background check of that nature would
be warranted.  So, with that, I think we're in agreement, and I would
submit, ask for your concurrence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Arp, just one other point of information.  The chair
understands that the senate has agreed to have the implementation date
moved back from August 1</p>

2014 to January 1, 2015?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That is correct Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That provision of the bill.  So it will be moved back
to January 1, 2015.  Representative Brandon please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  I wanted to just point out one part of
this provision and I know that a lot of people wonder why  I always have
to get up and talk about this but it's because I have to.  The drug
testing provision is I do have a little bit of a problem with because
I've just come from a place that there is never a reason ever one reason
that we take people's food away from them and that's in essence what
you're doing and I think that if you look at the way the ?? is set up
and the way this current workforce program is currently, the way it
currently works is that we won't work with folks who have drug problems
and I think that in this general assembly we need to understand that
drug addiction is not a normal crime and a lot of times drug addiction
is dealt with a lot of mental issues and is an addiction like any type
of other addiction and that we need to treat that in a different type of
manner.  Not in a manner that says okay we're going to take away your
benefits and really the only people that get hurt from that is their
children who depend on those benefits to eat and so what you absolutely
start doing is you perpetuate a problem that you're trying to fix
because I promise you that everybody's going to have food on their plate
at 5:00 regardless of what you do and they can do that the right way or
the way they have to.  And so if you take away the right way then what
you'll end up having to do is that they'll find another way to do it
like might be hopping through you house or selling more drugs or
perpetuating the problem instead of fixing the problem.  So I really,
really have a big problem with any time that we for any reason
whatsoever from you to be able to take somebody's benefits away that
need them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Arp please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To see if the gentleman will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Representative Brandon, does the gentleman yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Always.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Brandon do you understand that in this
bill we've excluded the children cases in here where they're were not
drug tested in those cases where we have children only cases.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I don't think the children apply for assistance.
It's their parents that do that and so I, I understand what you're
saying but if the,  I don't know of a case where there are children who
are applying for assistance that would be denied.  It's the parents that
actually have the drug addiction.  They're the ones that's actually
being denied and unless you're telling me that if you have a child that
you're exempt from this then there's no really way to say that the
children are not going to be effected. Children get food from their
parents.  The parents are the ones that are on the assistance.  They're
the ones that are being scrutinized to decide whether or not we're going
to give the assistance or not so it's hard to really get around that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Arp please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To ask the gentleman a question.  The gentleman
yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  There are two components to this.  One is the
children's benefit and one is the adult's benefit. Do you understand
that the children's benefit regardless of the drug testing in this deal
given to the children on that and that do you further understand that
the case where we have a guardianship of the child that the guardian is
not drug tested?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Can I ask him a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does the gentleman yield?  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  okay I am a parent, I am on drugs, so tell me how my
children are not going to be effected?  Cause I'm confused but tell me.
I know they're just two different benefits I get it but why am I in the
exception if I'm a drug addict I come in you say okay look this guy in
might have some drug issues, we're going to drug test him, I fail the
drug test but I have children so therefore I'm exempted?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The children's benefit is not effected by this.  The
children's component still goes to the child and we're talking about the
adult here. And really what we're talking about is we're not trying to
stigmatize anybody.  What we're doing is the hard working people that
work and pay taxes and possibly are drug tested in their job are willing
to help these people in need and are willing to have their taxes go to
that we live in a wonderful state where we have a lot of good people and
they're working hard at a job where they need may even be subject to
drug testing</p>

benefits we protected it from children and we done everything we can
done to make this rash-able ?? and reasonable and i for your support on
this
Speaker Changes:i appreciate your?? statement on that Representative ??
it does still goes to the point that lot of these folks that are in this
situation when ever you are i just want us to think about when we feel
drug addiction this is the reason why i admit drug ?? bill that's a
whole different manner whenever you are talking about addiction and we
are trying to move them one place to the next we were able to taken away
their benefits taken away their place for they that is really only safe
place they have some of these would be probably come in to some of these
neighborhoods they are not safe places these are not the places that you
left these places were whenever you put on a rapid and whenever you put
out on a system either that the fact that you could not work or either
the fact that you gotta hospital promo or either the fact that you have
a fell end ?? outside the system and you have zero percent to get into a
jib and we are just act like the people an walk down the street and go
get a job and everything is gonna be fine and is lot of issues that why
the poepl have to go and deal with the things which does
Speaker Changes: speaker
Speaker Changes: Representative ?? please state your purpose
Speaker Changes: with Representative Brandon to yell to a question
Speaker Changes: gentlemen you yell
Speaker Changes: Absolutely
Speaker Changes: gentlemen yell
Speaker Changes: Representative ?? were you and i using many side of
same issues involving social problems and behavior but i just ask you
isn't there a time were every person's life when they get involved in a
situation like drugs or whatever it can may be where some busy some one
along the way help them by saying no not this time  there is new rule i
would venture to say that ?? or you were trying to move that one place
to the next i mean this whole works for the program and maintain
benefits Representative ?? is a space we are actually captured them and
actually they went to a place seeking help and this is not simply like
general people running around the streets this is people who are
actually looking for applications and they may have a drug addiction so
what you do if you ask this think about it you case ?? you see this
person come in you know this person wont help but you know they might be
on drugs you suspend the hell and send them out of the streets
Speaker Changes: Mr.Speaker
Speaker Changes: Representative ?? please state your purpose
Speaker Changes: gentlemen to yell for a question
Speaker Changes: the gentlemen yells
Speaker Changes: always
Speaker Changes: Representative you understand currently one of them
were changing the referral we specifically modified the bill to heap the
referrals for help that that these people are qualified that ??
qualified drug professionals ?? and none of those mechanisms engaged
were help who are people talking about none of those process is gonna be
changed by this bill what is simply does is says that you continue as an
active drug user and you wont get your benefits
Speaker Changes:what i read is that if they fail the  drug tested use
the ?? for a year i think that's what i red in the bill tel me if I'm
wrong ??,
Speaker Changes: The gentlemen is supposed to like going to answer in
the form of a question this is ?? gentlemen directed question that has
the answer in it,
Speaker Changes: Absolutely,
Speaker Changes: He yells,
Speaker Changes: The process is amendment so what we do is denied the
one first for thirty days with which they can reapply and the subsequent
drug use is paid by them the person is paid by the state and so the way
that the wither get into the program assures that the help that they
need or no 2 they can reapply in thirty days do you understand
Speaker Changes: i did not understand because this is not i red in the
bill for what you say I'll take it into word however i still maintain
that' snot ?? i still vote for it but I'm trying to say is this body we
really need to look at the way,</p>

was please major purpose to explain the bill the gym and has surveyed
about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you all. Mister Speaker, members of the house. this is a simple
local bill which will allow municipalities in the County of Guilford
municipalities therein on weight to
do their official notices by electronic means and not have to go through
the newspaper of general circulation, as is the current law is
permissible only. it does not require them to do so. it gives
flexibility. the bill is designed to help our municipalities save some
money there. similar provisions are thanked in effect for some of the
municipalities of it, and in wake County on you might consider a pilot
to see how it works or not in a larger urban County. there is in
Guilford for the commissioners and the city Council a dedicated channel
televises all of their functions, and also puts these type notices on
the television on their several local papers. some, especially in the
district I represent District sixty two we have three small
municipalities and that there is probably of superior way of getting
actual notice to the to the people of those municipalities through a
small paper that's called the Northwest observer. this delivered to
every residence of him in the county in those cities on so that this
bill come from Senator Wade has the support of the Greensboro city
Council unanimous support. it's on their legislative agenda I'm told
that five at least five of the county commissioners.five. the nine
support the bill. I know this doesn't scale a small municipality
supports it. I have talked to some of the  at least one of the Council
and Oak Ridge, who supports it, and I think it's got support some of the
other municipalities. all this has to support of a move of majority of
the Guilford delegation. it's a local bill only and I ask for your
support

thanked the seeker, ladies and gentlemen, we are now entering the edge
of era, it's déjà vu all over again. this is an argument in an amendment
that I think all of you are very familiar with from a previous mail that
was dear oriented. my argument small principles. my beliefs are still
the same, and committing a Cardinals fan attacking a local bill and that
whereas via half under water. I think it's difficult for a lot of
members to hear the lady. the lady from why continues to have the
Florida tomato. thank you speaker the thing with local bill is a very,
very good if they don't change state policy and this is exactly what
this bill does and I'll admit right up front. if you want to check non
voting record, you will see were updated on one of these nails because I
was told early in my career here that he would you will know you don't
argue down when you don't object to him because you'll have the local
building evil people to support it. I learned a lot since I cast at
night and one of the things is that we establish policy and our
statements for the best higher good, and one of the things it's for the
best higher good is transparency, which is what a third-party
publication of our notices and announcements does the art has been made
in committee meetings that I've attended that is the cost issue, and
that no avail. they'll continue to do with it. if you read your bill. it
tells you that a little of or in addition to the published requirements
if if the money is an issue which one of those you think they're going
to choose. it is in several municipalities</p>

And we can't do anything about that probably but just because we have
made a mistake and which I consider this because of policy of open
transparent government doesn't mean we continue to do that. As I told
you earlier, we are doing what? I know at least 99 percent of you in
here has done and that is complain because Congress passes laws and then
exempts itself from those laws. And that's exactly what we are doing
with this local bill. It's not a strange bill or an unusual bill. In
2012 Florida passed same sort of transparency requirement for their
publications and just as here tenancy did the same thing. You have cast
the vote, you have to argue with yourselves about letting a department
in government exempt itself. The issue now is much greater. It's our
local municipalities, it's our local ?? and I'd ask that you follow the
principles that I hope you voted on in the previous bill.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover, representative
David rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the house, I have great
respect for Representative McGrady who is sponsoring this bill and
normally I would not stand up and speak on a local bill if I'd not think
it might have state wide implications and I am concerned that this bill
might just do that. I'd simply like to read from you as I did the last
time that this issue was before you, an the article that appeared in
Star news in New Hanover and county and I said the first time I'll
probably will never read anything from Star news again but I hope you
won't hold me to that and allow me do one more time. It represses house
bill 723 which is a bill that ?? ?? four coast ?? with representative
Avila ?? which is the language we are dealing with right now in this
amendment. As house bill 723 were the language in this amendment would
expand the reach of public notices by not only requiring publications of
notices in newspaper but also requiring that the newspapers publish the
same notices on their websites on the same day. As many people as the ??
website my reach, they leave out many others and the purpose of state
law requiring public notice in the first place is to ensure that the
public has easy, broad access to information pertaining to the conduct
of the people's business. Local governments may like to think that
notice on their website is the same as notice on a well read newspaper.
The result would be less access for the public. The general assembly
should leave the public notice requirement in place and consider house

rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative David said a lot that I was going to say and I urge your
support on this amendment. When this issue came up before, I did some
research and talked to lot of people in my county and there are a lot of
people in my county and there are number of senior citizens that do not
have the technology knowledge to do that or people that don't have the
money to purchase the technology and there are people that just don't
morally feel comfortable with the internet for a variety of reasons. So
I don't want to put those people in a situation where we ?? franchise
their rights to public notice. So I urge you to support the bill.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. I know I am an old newspaper guy and you know

have been floating around here this session. I'd say to you exactly what
representative Davis and representative Catlin have had to say because
it's true. All you gonna do is the deny access to information for
certain portion of you people and if you want that the bigger legacy, go
on...</p>

speaking for it, you're hearing from the odd couple. And I urge you, do
not let this type of thing be your legacy. Do not go away from this

For what purpose does the gentleman from Ashe, Representative Jordan,
rise?

Question for Representative Wilkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Does the gentleman from Person yield for the gentleman from Ashe?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Wilkins, do you realize that this is a local bill about
Wake County and will not affect my people in Ashe or Watauga?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
May I respond to that, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman from Person's recognized. I believe it's a local bill
affecting Guilford, but the gentleman from Person is recognized to...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, sir. And my response would be that I understand its Guilford
County and not Wake.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Does the gentleman from Ashe wish to ask a...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I guess I should restate, we've already had other local bills today
about Wake County. Do you understand that this is a local bill about
Guilford County and not my District, so none of my people will be
affected?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman from Person has the floor to answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Very quickly, Representative Jordan, my response will, is that your
folks will be next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam...?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
?? Speaker of the House. The amendment guts the bill. I was so
interested, the first four speakers in favor of it are experts on
Guilford County and the needs of the people there. But they forgot one
thing, the underlying bill which they are attacking, says that any
citizen in Guilford County who wants to get mail directly to his or her
house, all he has to do is just sign up and it comes postage prepaid.
Now, the courts have considered many times the adequacy of notice for
purposes of lawsuits. Personal delivery by the Sheriff is best.
Certified mail is second best. First class mail, other mail is third
best. And a distant fourth is notice by publication. A distant fourth.
Matter of fact, in some cases it violates due process, and yet, you're
saying that the worst kind of notice is better than mail notice, which
can come directly to the person's mailbox with no cost, no bother? I
just, it's incredible to me that you think the people in Guilford County
are that gullible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
For what purpose does the gentleman from Henderson, Representative
McGrady, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman from Henderson has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Stam made most of my points. I would point out that I'm
not running the bill this time, but this is the same provision as
Representative Avila's said that was run last time. And what I would
tell you about it is, one, it really does gut the bill. If you pass this
amendment I would urge you not to pass the bill. And the reason I say
that is because what the amendment really does is just as newspapers
sort of have the monopoly on printing notices, they then now are given
the monopoly in terms of electronic notices with very little price break
for what the citizens that ultimately are paying for that. If you'll
notice down in the bill it's something like 0.85 on the dollar the
second time it's published. What you're creating is a monopoly for the
press association. I will speak on the bill if and when we get back
there, but my view is, this is, this is an amendment, if passed should
not, the bill should not go forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative
Brandon, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To see if Mr. McGrady will yield for a quick question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Does the gentleman from Henderson yield to the gentleman from Guilford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
He yields.

are you someone else have how many people in the county, especially for

very important question. we were talking about how people information

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
you might have the statistics presented as more people to do that and go

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
to disappoint you but I don't have that information because I am not
sharing the bill, and it's a local bill, but let me add one other thing
I think it's then having asked that question. it's also fair to ask the
women notices themselves are being published at the current time,
probably not in the major newspaper and how many people are looking at
their
what purpose does the gentleman from that converts a fertility drugs to

salmon revs emigrated, is effectively guts the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will because of a ineffective against Bell, perhaps a little better
discussion about the bill itself as a town Commissioner and Cornelius in
a town about it in my convert County were frustrated because there were
so many other ways we can effectively to indicate that may or may not
include the Charlotte Observer. it's an option, but are several other
options, but here's the problem that I have whether the effect of this
amendment would take out the ability for me as a town commissioner and
mayors to decide what is the most effective way for us to communicate
with our citizens. it could be Charlotte Observer. but guess what. right
now I'm mandated to use a Charlotte Observer him elaborate on how to pay
topdollar and by doing this bell were not saying that they won't use the
media outlet. I trust the local elected officials to do their job, which
is to communicate to the local people and the most important why
possible and as it is an urban issue. this is an issue where the
majority of households have electronic connectivity. this is an area
where there are number of vehicles that are arguably in many cases more
effective we are talking about a media right now, but by mandate
taxpayer dollars have to be spent that make it more effective way to get
there. and this is the same industry that has declining and declining
and declining readership. I haven't not had print media, but for the
last two years delivered to my house and that's a trend that's that's
common across all these major urban areas. it's very different than the
role areas where I would argue the average town Councilman Eric County
Commissioner would say my local media of my local newspaper. it is the
most effective way to do it and they will have the flexibility to go to
those divide and affect about a builder. those who think it's camel 's
nose under the tent. I think it's irrelevant because I think they'll
continue to do that for the reasons of and stated around connectivity
and other options in the rural areas. this is about Guilford County. if
I had any regret about this bill. I regretted my comer counties not in
it because I know they thought how we communicate with the folks back in
Burke County, there are more effective ways to do it out of the human.
what purpose does the gentleman from Gilbert presented parts derives

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you, Mister Speaker, I want to echo what Speaker Till is just said
that it looked. this is a local bill that you don't want in your county,
then don't follow build of somebody else doesn't you can oppose it as
reservoir, said earlier this is supported by the city agrees Perl am not
mistaken is also supported by five. and John Commissioner supported
majority of our Muslim delegation Gilbert County supports it and another
thing I want to point out is that if you look at the build. this is not
automatic. this is an option, it's an option for local governments and
would not take place automatically about it. if a local government
chooses to go with this option, then for a twelve month period, the
governing board has to publish it in the local newspaper where the
public can access the information, so it never be a transition. and so
again I would ask you to defeat this amendment, and after sporting bill.

I got a email from the Guilford County Manager.  He informs me that the
unique visitors per month to the Guilford County website is 60,438.  I’m
assuming that’s average and the total page views per month is 254,019.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Members of the house the chair’s going to direct the
Sergeant at Arms to simply lock the side doors, there’s a disturbance
down the hall, just the side doors.  So members need to use the largent
door on the entrance of these two doors behind the dais to get in and
out of the chamber for the rest of the evening.  For what purpose does
the gentleman from Vance, Representative Baskerville, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  No purpose, no purpose Mr. speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For what purpose does the lady from Guilford,
Representative Adams, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To speak on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I was just trying to figure
out what in the world is really going on here.  To say that the majority
of the people have access and we’re going to forget about the minority
of the people, I just don’t think that’s fair.  That’s the problem.  We
always forget about the people who don’t have the access that other
people have.  This is a good amendment.  It levels the playing field.
There are lots of people who are not going to go to the internet.  They
won’t know to go there.  Many people don’t have access.  It may be 30%,
but we shouldn’t forget about that 30%.   I’ve had a conversation today
with county commissioners, with city managers, county managers as well.
Now this bill that we have, maybe I shouldn’t be talking about the bill,
but I need to say this.  First of all this is a good amendment.  I hope
you support it.  But if the county commissioners have said they support
this, this was not the bill they had initially.  Now if it’s such a
great thing, why are all of the other counties that were in this bill,
out?  They’re not in it.  This is a good amendment.  It will make me
support the bill if we pass it because it will level the playing field
and it will give people an opportunity who don’t have access and we need
to be concerned about transparency here.  I hope that you will support
this amendment so that we can give access to people who won’t have it.
The counties will then have to not only put it in the newspaper, but
they can have it on the internet.  You have somebody said 60,000 people
but that’s not even a 1/3 of the people in the county.  That’s really
not a lot in terms of who’s going  to the internet.  We should not
exclude people.  We should not exclude people, we need to vote for this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash,
Representative Collins, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I wonder if Representative Adams would yield for a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does the lady from Guilford yield to the gentleman
from Nash?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Adams do you know what the circulation
of the newspaper in Greensboro is by chance?  Is it greater than 60,000
less than 60,000?  Do we know?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I don’t have that information, but I can tell you
that our newspapers, the large ones and the smaller ones, want to have
an opportunity to put information in the newspapers because we know that
people do read them.  I don’t think we need to be talking about, so
regardless of what the circulation is you’re still leaving people out
and we should not leave people.  That’s the point I want to make.  We
shouldn’t leave people out.

don’t get to wear two hats out here.  I just get to be a plain old
representative, but I’m a representative who knows that if you start

will be honest with you, I have got the for so I will explain it, I am
uncomfortable when that happens because I believe all the arguments
should be heard, however, considering the fact that we are in déjà vu

Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a motion.
Speaker: For what purpose does the lady wish to be recognized? To call
the question?
Representative: A question. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call the
previous question.
Speaker: The lady moves to the previous question as to the amendment.
Pursuant to our process, we will take a vote. The question before the

Wake. We are going to give members a few minutes to get in. So many is
favored. The motion for the previous question will vote aye. Those
opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock

Representative: I yield my time to Representative Bluss.

Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the house. I
appreciate this since I did not get to address the amendment to the
bill, I was running on the floor. I like having the chance. I am glad
some of the other members spoke up because I truly did not understand
the amendment. I was a little disappointed because this is a Gilford
bill, only for Gilford County, and I just supported my Wake delegation
on a bill that I had questions on that affected only Wake county. As far
as exempting ourselves, I am not sure what that means. I am not sure how
we have exempted ourselves from things. As far as Representative Adams
comment about remembering the people who do not have the internet, well,
remember the people who do not take the paper. It has got a… the news

I mean, one-- each paper's read by two people that means one in five
aren't getting the paper. So how much effective notice is that? I think
the bill, sans the amendment, will give more actual notice and
transparency than current law. The other counties are out, not because
of anything except for the desire by the sponsor to try to run a clean
bill for Guilford only; the other counties-- it was a Guildford bill to
begin with-- the other counties wanted in, a lot of people liked this.
As far as website traffic: You can't go by the current count, because
once the word gets out in the community-- &quot;This is where you go for
notices&quot;-- the websites will get more traffic because people will
go to find out what's going on on the website when they have the
option-- that the governments have the option to use the website only
and don't use the newspapers.
This is true, I think, the speaker's comments were well-taken-- right
now, when you give a newspaper in an urban area a monopoly; they can
gouge you for prices, knowing you've gotta come to them by law. This
bill will also increase competition and lower costs, and that's what so
many of us claim we are for, so I-- since I'm told the amendment guts
the bill, I hope you'll vote down the amendment and vote for the bill.

The gentleman from Nash, Representative Collins, is recognized to
explain the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I felt like it's Groundhog Day almost.
Yesterday, I told you what the opponents of the bill would say, and then
lo and behold, the next two speakers argued exactly what I told you they
would argue; and they are two people who I admire and respect, just
voted for one of them's bill. The argument that somehow or other what
we're doing is making the portfolio for the state retirement plan more
risky-- I wanna remind you-- is based on a fundamental fallacy. This
bill does not make the state retirement plan riskier. It actually lowers
its risk. A portfolio's risk is not equal to the sum of the individual
parts-- I cannot say that often enough, because we're not understanding
it! Also: some of the things called alternative investments, in this
bill, in and of themselves are less risky than some of the things that
are not alternative investments. For instance: Real Estate is not nearly
as risky as small-cap stocks. Real Estate is an alternative investment;
small-cap stocks is not an alternative investment; but it's something we
regularly purchase in the state retirement plan. [?] Inflation-protected
bonds are NOT more risky than emerging-market stocks. But
emerging-market stocks are not alternatives, [?] ARE alternatives. So
you can't make a blanket statement that even the individual pieces of
this are more risky than the rest of the portfolio. That argument cannot
logically be made. You know, *gavel sound*, one statement was made
yesterday that there are lots of types of risk in investing, and we're
focusing on one. For instance, with bonds. You have an interest-rate
risk: Interest rates go up; bonds go down. That's why our bond portfolio
has gone down one and half billion dollars in the last two months.
There's also default risk, which Representative Blust brought up
yesterday, even if--</p>

<p id="060:00">
?? You don't know once those bonds, but you don't know what rate you're
gonna get when you replace them with something else. There's all kinds
of risks, folks. If you're investing in overseas stocks, there're
currency exchange risks. To focus on one risk is to be myopic.
Representative Blust gave a football example the other day, and they are
apparently effective, so let me give you a football example. Let's say I
own an NFL team-- and that's a real stretch, since I don't have Jerry
Richardson's money or any of the rest of those guys' money-- but let's
say I did. And I own an NFL team. And I've noticed that last year, my
skilled players got hurt a lot: My wide receiver got hurt, my running
back got hurt, my quarterback got hurt, and I'm paying all this money
for all these superstars that are making millions of dollars and they're
sitting on the bench because they're hurt. So I decide, &quot;You know
what? I'm gonna take care of that risk. I've noticed those guards and
tackles-- those 350-pound guys with no neck-- they never get hurt. So
this year, I'm gonna start on my offense and defense, 11 guards and
tackles.&quot;
Now, I will probably have fewer injuries this year, and will accomplish
that goal. But you know what? I'm gonna lose every game. Because my
6'4&quot;, 350-pound wide receivers can't get open, and my 6'5&quot;,
350-pound quarterbacks and safetys can't cover the other team's split
end; so they're gonna score a touchdown every time they draw it back and
pass.
Now, I have made my team less risky. If that's the one thing I wanna
focus on. But I'm gonna lose every single game. That's kinda the
attitude that we're taking, by looking at it this way. You know, a good
point was made by Representative Blust the other day, about risk-- about
volatility risk principle going up and down and that is that investors
have different tolerances for risk. I agree with that 100%. But anybody
who's been in my profession six months, or six weeks or six DAYS, if
they've had any good training, knows that there is one overriding
factor-- more than anything else-- that determines what your tolerance
for risk should be. And that is your investment time horizon: How long
are you gonna stay in this investment? If your investment time horizon
is very short, you should take almost no volatility risk. If you're
gonna need this money six months from now, you shouldn't put it in a
stock, a bond, or an alternative; you should put it in an
interest-bearing account that you know you can get it back.
But the longer your horizon is, the more volatility risk you can take.
Let me ask you something: How long do we want the North Carolina
Retirement Pension Plan to last? Six months? Five years? Twenty years? I
think until whatever the final apocalypse is, we want this retirement
plan to last! So a pension plan is an ideal place for long-term
investments that may have some volatility over the short run, but, are
good over the long run.
I also wanted to make a point that investing in other alternatives was
compared yesterday, in another football analogy, to throwing long. It's
third and twenty and we need to throw long. Well, that's a false
analogy. Alternative investments are often designed to mitigate loss
more than they are to make spectacular returns. I'll tell you what kind
of investment is a &quot;third-and-long&quot; investment is something
we've already mentioned today: Emerging market stocks. Small-cap stocks:
Those are things that tend to make huge returns some years and then
don't make anything for years and years and years. But if you made a 90%
return one year, you can coast along for a few years without doing much
else. Those are your &quot;third-and-longs.&quot;
Alternative investments are things like real estate. Real estate is not
a &quot;third-and-long&quot; hail Mary, it's a steady [eddy??]-- it
tends to out-pace inflation a little bit, each year, on average. That's
what it's designed to do. It's not designed to make huge gains. And let
me tell you why it's important to mitigate loss. Losses count more than
gains in the investment world. And I think I can illustrate this in a
way that everybody in here can understand. If you came to me, and you
said, &quot;Jeff, you've told me you want me to invest in 'ABC Fund'...
What's it been returning?&quot; And I tell you, &quot;Well, in 2011, it
made 50%; in 2012, it lost 50%&quot; And you say, &quot;Oh, OK, so your
average is 0%, so I'll be back where I started.&quot; But no, that's not
right. If you think about it, if you gave me $1000, and I lost 50%, what
have you got left? 500, right? Now, if I make 50% on money for you next
year, how much did I make? Half of five hundred-- two hundred fifty; now
you've got $750, you're still down 25%. And you can work it the opposite
way: If you make 50% and then lose it, you're still down 25%-- so
anything that can mitigate losses is good. And that's what alternatives
are designed to do; they're not necessarily designed to skyrocket
returns, they're designed to mitigate losses.
Now, there's so much false information that's gone on about this stuff,
you know-- it's like [if] you throw enough stuff against the wall,
something will stick. The Senate passed this bill 48:1, and they passed
it in a different form than what you're seeing now. When the Senate
passed this bill 48 to 1, the cap on alternatives has gone up to 40%,
and the individual sub-caps, were---</p>

15% each every single one of them we are only going up 1% than the
overall cap from 34 to 35 and none of the sub caps are going up more
than a point and an half or 2 points that was negotiated by senator ??
.He agreed that once it already passed the senate come over to the house
he continue to let standard negotiate get it where they want and so
forth and apparently that was gone appease them and get there
cooperation . I had the same thing happen to me in on state personal act
you know how that works, because I go the same thing ??  That you got
.somehow the fees are gone go up 42% if we allow treasury to go up 1% ??
that’s mathematically impossible ,  ?? you know what he said about
statistics don’t you . there is lies  , there is you know what kind of
lies , there is statistics and so that’s the  kind of statistics we are
getting final thing I want to say is this lot of emails have been sent
around one is from ?? , I am all ways one of the highest ranking persons
on ?? If you like them if you notice that things is dated in March and
it deals with bills in its original form before anything was changed.
now if you also read to the end of the article you will see their
solution, and I am all about willing to talk about if you want to .but
their solution is don’t let the state take any risk let the employee
take it all .because it say let’s go to a defined compensation plan,
that’s their solution to this bill. So read the whole article before you
make your decision based on that email. Last thing I like to say to some
of the people on my side .because I think this is a ?? Argument just
going to come out and say it because I don’t know any other way to say
it but just to brought it out on the table . If you are thinking
politically on this thing which I am not I be honest with you I want the
state ?? plan to do as well as it can and I think this bill will allow
Tricia  to do the best job she can do whatever political fall up out or
craze or any thing comes in there I am fine weather she get it , we get
it I don’t care that means nothing to me . but if you are thinking
politically think about this , if we don’t give the Tricia this piece of
what she asked for and the portfolio doesn't perform guess who’s she is
going to blame it on . and if we give it her and it dose perform then we
can share in the credit for that, if we give it to her and it doesn't
perform we can blame her for that we give her what she wanted she wasn't
able to perform I don’t see how we lose in that deal frankly if we are
worried about that so foe all these reasons, I would ask you to please
lets vote logically on this lets not take false assumptions or
misunderstanding about. I know there is lot of fear in the unknown. And
I have enough clients to know not many people understand investments.
But will just tell you this in closing if you want to go to attorney
don’t hire me hire a representative of ?? , representative of ?? .
representative ?? one of these guys but if you want to go to investment
advise don’t hire representative of ?? to do that hire representative of
?? and I will certainly ask once again to vote for this bill

Speaker changes: thank you very much the speaker. I don’t say this words
very often but I fully agree with everything representative  ?? just
said I also in seriousness if you were listening last night . I know
it’s been long day for us. What representative Ross said yesterday was
an eloquent and extremely articulate explanation of what why we need to
vote for this bill the risk , the enormous risk I think is in not voting
for this bill the conservative position and I use that small ‘c’ is
voting for this bill right now the one thing in the fact that we do know
is how heavily invested in the bonds we are and how poor rated return
they are and that’s going to be as representative Ross explained last
night not going anywhere but down</p>

in the near future or the foreseeable future there has got to and I just
had this exact discussion about my individual portfolio with my
financial guide exactly what we're talking about on this floor and
although I agree with representative Hurley to the extent that I might
not agree with everything the treasurer wants to look at I also know
that if I want some return particular as to return given where we are
right now it has got to be more diverse than what I have in my portfolio
diversity is a really really good thing given the uncertain economics of
the world and if we don't give her this option then the likelihood is we
will in fact find that she cannot meet the criteria meet the goal and we
will have to allocate potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to
fill the gap and you know what you'll be hearing if that gap even occurs
at all, is there a risk in granting her the flexibility well there is
some but there is very little in my opinion for three reasons one the
bill contains as representative Collins made clear very strong oversight
and limitations on how much she can invest in any particular type of
fund without coming to the general assembly second of course in May
whether there's anything in the bill or not if we don't like something
we can intervene this general assembly knows it has had the authority
and has done so to intervene number two there're strong limits even
within the bill on any particular fund or type of fund in which she can
invest so even if she made a bad choice and let's face it if we look at
the choices her investment team has made over the last several years
they have been pretty outstanding given the rest of the country we have
to have some degree of confidence in her investment team that they'll
continue the same trend because she certainly wants for the right
reasons and maybe even for political reasons but whatever you want to
associate with her she wants to make the right decisions and have the
best return secondly in that regard they got a track record and their
track record beats almost any other pension fund investors in the
country but everyone is reviewing their portfolio now because of the
economic conditions to me this is almost not even close if we don't give
her the flexibility the risk of what might happen in far outweighs any
risk in giving her the flexibility I can't encourage you more highly and
I don't think the senate could send a better signal because I think the
mixture of personalities and the vision over there is far greater than
over here and they passed a bill that didn't have the same protections
48 to 1 I really think that we ought to be giving the treasurer this
flexibility and I would encourage us to vote for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
for what purpose does the gentleman from Katava representative Wills
rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
the gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you Mr speaker members I don't give investment advice never have
and I don't know all of you real well but I probably bet anybody wants
to bet that there's not five members on this floor that have handled
solely responsibly an 80 million dollar portfolio of investment for
other folks but we're not talking about 80 million dollars we're talking
about 80 billion dollars that's one thousand times 80 million this bill
has come to us and I've heard a lot of debate and a long debate about
what it is and what it isn't this really has nothing to do with the
powers of the treasurer whether we like her politics whether Civitas
likes how she's operating or what she's doing the speaker's promised us
a study on how we're going about this business and that's something we
need to do I agree with that but that's not what this bill is about this
bill is about a portfolio allocation an investment allocation in a
portfolio that I'm guessing is a lot bigger than anything any of us have
handled and we're not even talking about an allocation of the entire
portfolio we're talking about a sub-allocation of a part of the
portfolio now this came to finance I asked the treasurer.

Speaker: What's happened in the two months this bill has set in the
house what happened to that portfolio because you don't have the
flexibility you ask for and she told us we have lost a billion and half
dollars in that time now the ?? next week and we can get another market
shock if,
Speaker Changes: Mr.Speaker,
Speaker Changes: For what purpose does the gentlemen from ??
Representative from Brolly raise,
Speaker Changes: Ask Representative ?? a question,
Speaker Changes: The gentlemen does not yell the gentlemen from ??
continues to have the floor to debate the bill,
Speaker Changes: There are ongoing market events and one i had like to
some of you is you want to act like informal investment committee for
the state treasure let's talk about risk there is ?? kind of risk when
you force some one stay into the you don't wanna with but Representative
Collins mentioned this political risk it will I'm a ?? conservative guy
in folks of no men many years all agree with that small C or big c to me
is nothing concerning about losing billion and half dollars i also
suggests that we all support this bill and minimize our risk,
Speaker Changes: For what purpose does the gentlemen from ?? ask
Representative ?? raise,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.Speaker to debate the bill,
Speaker Changes: The gentlemen has the floor to debate the bill,
Speaker Changes: Well so same bill we talked about yesterday and one day
closure to whats  where ultimately happen with in streets 	 and secondly
Representative Collin say that bill lot of incorrect figures and factors
floating around all over the place and then primarily meant to confuse
scare and work on your motions i mentioned yesterday with endowments and
endowments plan larges tut ions and universities and so far have been
shifting money and to alternatives the past five years there are some
endowments large endowments shifted far more 36 or 40 percent into
alternatives and they do this not to make extra money on alternatives
and they do this to protect because there is negative co relation to
what will happen on born prices for and that rights go up there is
negative co relation with alternative investments they do this to
protect the portfolio the whole premise of putting alternative in the
portfolio is not to make risk is not to make money and is to protect the
downside now on address two pints have came up yesterday  one was that
brought up well  you have treasure only using 2 percent now why does she
using well that argument is exactly why we need to do this the treasure
will probably go never i think there is probably good chance we never
use 36 percent because the different categories or alternative been
capped and i you gone category i think i had to say yesterday as an
example inflation protected inflation protected portfolio if that
portfolio is not performing at a specific point time or for ever reason
they don't thin that's an area they need to place money but they are nor
gonna put that particular money in the sub category so there may be 3 to
5 4 of the categories that they don't even have money in yet they capped
out in the fifth one so mathematical they could possibly really never
get to 36 percent the problem you had when you sties like credit
strategies like now performing extremely well this mentioned yesterday
that strategy is that one very mathematical you can you can always count
right to ?? whats gonna happen in credit strategies or they capped out
that's doing well now so there is an area where we could put more money
if we ?? so argument about that only using 20 percent out of the 35 now
that's the reason now another ?? that came up yesterday or question that
came up yesterday was ?? we got bonds and we do have lot of bonds we
probably have larger and average supply bonds in this portfolio  and you
may remember the yesterday,</p>

I mentioned what I gave some figures as to what will happen to these
bonds when interest rates go up again. this is a mathematical
calculation. this is not something that the just make up our a three
percent rise in the thirty year bond is not acquainted about fifty two
percent drop in the value that long. that's that's a substantial loss
and only number of bonds that are in the portfolio that could be
billions of dollars recording screen just in the last two months
civilian figures one. two billion that we lost in the last couple months
now. the argument yesterday was okay. what bonds are guaranteed. if you
hold the until maturity. and that's true. the old thirty-year bond for
thirty years. do you get your possible, but in your okay unless you pay
a premium for that month, but that's not how pension plans work pension
plans are valued once a year for reporting purposes and the actuaries go
to work and they come up with a number and they say when you know here's
the value of the pension plan at this point in time, I'll weigh right
now you're seriously underfunded because we've had a huge market for
they don't look at portfolio and say okay we got thirty year bonds, and
thirty years, as things will be back. the whole they value that pension
plan. I'll bet they and that's the number that used for reporting us.
that's the way it works. so let's say we don't have a three percent rise
in rates will say we have a two percent rise in rates in the plan only
goes down twenty percent twenty four twenty five percent and then you do
that valuation at the end of the year. actuaries go to work and come
back to us in the essay, you got a serious decline in the value of this
plan, you don't make up the difference. so that's an argument you need
to look very. core we should e-mail you in just a few minutes ago and
eighty billion. the math works the same, whether it's eighty million or
eighty billion ninety nine percent of the stuff is mathematical,
especially in the alternative scope. so I askyou to support the ticket

that Bill is a locality name on the tendency to search for information
and I honestly had long serious qualms about this bill when it first

and I believe virginity Blasier mentioned him as well and data, and the
think you might find interesting, because I think you know that our
universities aren't quite as hamstrung with how they can invest this
fall we ask our states treasure to be in the they had enough, and from
the national Association of College and University business officers.
there was a chart that showed all returns one five ten year returns for
our endowment for endowments of over a billion dollars. the ten year
total return seven. six percent in a relative indices list. it was the
sixty forty S&amp;P Barclays Molina, which is similar to what we are
saying controller are rather state treasurer, working under and their
return over ten years was five. four percent. that's a difference of

Representative: …handout from the Vanguard reducing bonds, proceed with
caution, study that came out in April of 2013. I don’t know if you will
take the time to look closely at facts and figures and the argument of
the study, but it shows why bonds have been and will always be and
important con in minimizing risk. I don’t know about handouts and who
have said what – if there is bad information. On either side, it should
be bad information: facts are facts. Not failing to concede that there
may have been some bad information from one side doesn’t mean that lose
the argument, necessarily. There has been bad information from the
proponents. There was a handout yesterday that sounded very impressive.
It said that the work of the money managers paid back 5 billion in 2012.
Now, first thing, I am not an investment expert. I took some courses in
college. I have followed the bond market, the stock market, for years,
on a daily basis….
Speaker: For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Floyd, rise?
Representative: Inquiry of the chair Mr. Speaker.
Speaker: The gentleman may state his inquiry.
Representative: Mr. Speaker, I believe a few minutes ago, you asked us
and there was no objection to us going past 9.
Speaker: That is correct.
Representative: Follow up Mr. Speaker?
Speaker: The gentleman may stat his follow up.
Representative: And that was so that we could take care of a lot of
additional deals that we have a [xx] decision.
Speaker: That is correct.
Representative :Mr. Speaker, may I ask Representative Collins a
question?
Speaker: Representative Collins? Representative Bliss has the floor at
this time. If the gentleman wishes to ask another Representative a
question, it would have to wait, unless the gentleman has a question for
Representative Bluss. Does the gentleman from Gilford yield to the
gentleman from Cumberland?
[laughter]
Representative: I yield.
Representative: Representative Bluss…the queue is down to four now so I
yield.
Representative: Representative, I think you would find things went
smoother if there were not a constant interruption from members rising.
I did not interrupt from some of the other speakers, and listened
intently. This is a hugely multi billion dollar issue we are dealing
with, not that some of the other bills we have dealt with were small.
This is a local bill, a huge issue and should be approached with great
care, and even trepidation. One of the things that worry me is that if
you know anything about markets, you approach them with fear and
trepidation, and with the knowledge that you don’t really know, no one
knows. If the financial crisis taught us anything it is whether we
really do have experts, because very few people saw that coming. A lot
of people lost a lot of money, and the markets are uncertain, and we do
not know what is going to happen. We have got a lot of precious money
that our employees and retirees are depending on and that should require
sound judgment and analysis, and some back and forth.
Speaker: For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash, Representative
Collins rise?
Representative: Wondering if Representative Bluss would yield for a
question?
Representative: I yield.
Speaker: The gentleman yields.
Representative: Representative Bluss, I noticed the handout that you
gave covers the years 1998-2012. I believe I remember you saying
yourself, correct me if I am wrong, in a finance meeting, that we have
been on an unnaturally long period of lowering interest rates that began
in 1983 and ended two months, is that not correct?
Representative: That is right Representative Collins, and I hope that
you will give me a chance to get to this other handout. I am on one that
was given yesterday.
Representative: Follow up? Does the gentleman yield for a follow up?
Speaker: He yields.
Representative: Is it surprising then that in the longest bull market in
U.S. history, which just ended two months ago, that bonds would come out
well? I mean, is that not true for anything? If you look at anything at
the tail end of the longest bull market in history would it not look
good in comparison to other markets?
Representative: You are right on that. That is not what this graph is
showing, and I will get to that in a moment. The handout yesterday was
making</p>

... future because it might not.  And that's why we need to be careful
now.  The final thing and then I'll sit down, is, I've gotten the
figures straight from the treasurer's report to the people.  I don't
know in the credit, what's called the category, the credit strategies,
and maybe this is wrong but according to the treasurer's report, we're
only in the second year of that.  To claim that that's doing so well and
we ought to put a whole lot more in, we don't know how that's going to
do over time.  Maybe it will, but I would be very careful, according to
the treasurer's report, the one year return on that was .37.
That's straight from the treasurer's report so I don't think it can be
positive that those investments have done well.  But again, maybe they
well.  The reason, the sum total of what I wanted to say is simply that
we have to proceed with caution.  There is a reason we had treasurers
like Harlen Boyles who did well year after year.  They took a long term
cautious approach.  And I've just known enough from watching investment
shows, reading, that that's what the experts, the true experts.  I
remember watching Wall Street Weeks or John Templeton on the Friday
after the mini crash of 1987 saying, 'don't panic, hold your horses.
Stay within reasonable bounds and use common sense and you'll turn out
well'.
And he was right and I don't want to cast aside those things chasing an
artificial figure that we just created out of mid air.  We created the
7.25%.  Hey, maybe we can legislate that the Panthers win fifteen games
this year.   You can't legislate that.  We can't legislate what the
return's going to be.  And I think this bill is a good faith attempt by
the treasurer to say, 'hey, I'm not going to make that 7.25 unless I go
out there on the limb a little bit more.'
And as I say, if it works, you guys.  My hat's off to ya. But you're
making a bet and there's risk that it won't.  To make a final point,
facetiously we could put 10% in horse racing.  Could win and triple your
money, but you'd say no we're not going to do that 'cause it's too
risky.  And I'm just saying at some point there's too much risk and it's
not prudent to take and I think we ought to take a breath and look at
this thing as Representative Jackson says before we take a further
leave.  Thank you.

Representative: …and as briefly as possible, I will remind everyone that
in May we passed what was the original verbatim content of house bill
522 under the house bill 695. it went to the senate and picked up
several sections, it was sent back here and got derailed. So, what bill
522 is, is a bill that was totally stripped clean and  put the content
verbatim of foreign laws protect constitution rights into the item,
house bill 522, which we are looking at now. The senate bill Friday
passed it with a bipartisan, a strong bipartisan, majority of 31-2, and
voted in support of it then and spoken in support of it was Senator
Blue, Bryant, Clark, Don Davis, Ford, McLauren and Warren. In a
nutshell, it follows legislation, that has been proven in five other
states, without challenge to date, it protects fundamental
constitutional rights, especially that of women and minorities. If you
look at the cases where foreign laws have entered our courts, and this
happens often, and in a proper manner, but there are times when the
judiciary is forced to legislate from the bench, and act on laws that
are not part of our laws 27 times – two case here in NC, one as recently
as August – we have had this occur here. Simply put, this honors the
order of law, the foundation of our free market economy, it protects
women and minorities, it ultimately protects our U.S. and state
constitutional rights. I ask you to vote green, please.
Speaker: Representative Glacier, please state your purpose.
Representative: To briefly debate the bill.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. I will be very brief because we
have had this argument before and there really is no reason to extend it
except to stay on the record. I opposed the bill the last time it was in
the house and Representative Carney and I had a long conversation about
this the other day, and I still do for three reasons: 1. I believe that
it is the ability of the house or any member of a general assembly to
limit the jurisdiction of a court, but it is not in our power to limit
what law a court considers. I believe this to be a classic separation of
powers problem, that will, if it ever comes up, may, not much, but will
raise that issue; 2. I honestly think that it is a ban in search of a
problem. It is rarely ever going to occur, if ever, and when it does, if
it comes up, because this is not a Sharia ban of law as such, although
the intent is what it is supposed to be – the senate sponsor made that
clear, but it is not, and to covers all foreign law, then it really does
have the potential to create some problems with divorces, marriages, and
premarital agreements, and not just as a matter of Sharia law, but as a
matter of Judaism, for example, where orthodox Judaism has arbitration
panels set up to handle, which would be outlawed under this. It also
creates a real problem in those areas where we have very diverse
populations from various cultures. So, we have gone over these
arguments. I am going to be voting no because I believe the bill to be
unconstitutional, because I believe it to be unnecessary and to send the
wrong message. Thank you.
Speaker: The question before the house is the motion to concur in the
senate committee substitute of house bill 522 on its second reading. All
in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no. The clerk will open
the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote:  75
having voted in the affirmative, 37 in the negative. The house has
concurred and the senate committee substitute for house bill 522. The
bill will be enrolled and sent to the governor. Ladies and gentleman,
without objection, the referral of senate bill 380 to finance is
stricken, and, without objection, senate bill 380 will be removed from
the committee on environment and re-referred to the committee on rules.</p>

Representative Faircloth, please state your purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized to
debate the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Speaker and members
of the House.  Every week, when I drive down here to the legislature, I
usually switch over off the interstate because I have so often been
caught with accidents there, and I drive down Highway 64.  If you
haven’t been done it, it’s a beautiful drive, and as you come down 64
you cross a beautiful lake, a beautiful body of water.   One of the
prettiest bodies of water in our state.  And every time I cross those
two bridges on 64, coming across that lake, I have memories of that old
song, “A Bridge Over Troubled Waters.”  This lake certainly has been
troubled for a good while now, and it is time for us to face up to the
problems and try to make this thing work so that that lake is as pretty
under the water as it is to the view from the highway.  There are some
policy changes necessary, and I want to talk about that a little bit.
The federal government built an impaired lake and now the state is left
to fix a federal problem.  Too often we have heard that happen in other
things, but I think if you look back at the history of this lake and
Representative Ross in a few moments will tell you quite a bit about the
history of it, we do have a problem there.  Eight years of DNR data,
that is from 2008 to 2012, show that the nutrient and resultant algeal
issues in the lake have not gotten better and in some cases have gotten
worse.  Now this is despite a lot of hard work trying to make them
better.  Hundreds of millions of dollars later, we have no improvement
in lake quality in DNR’s opinion.  The evidence suggests that deployment
of unlimited resources and technology upstream will never improve the
water quality at the lake itself.  Hundreds of thousands of people
depend on this lake for drinking water and recreation, and we owe them
clean, safe drinking water.  Nobody, nobody that I know of, wishes ill
on that lake.  Everybody wants it made better.  Cary is currently
pursuing a 2 million dollar investment in aeration mitigation technology
for water treatment because of poor water quality in what is one of the
least impaired locations for the lake.  The Jordan Lake Rules continue
to put a tremendous burden on municipal and county governments as well
as the private sector, and will continue to do so with no improvement in
the lake quality.  Development is being stopped and municipalities are
diverting money for ineffective water treatment solutions.  The net
effect of that is that jobs are being lost.  Technology exists today
that did not exist when these rules were first being developed.  New
technologies require a new regulatory approach that actually works.
There is no sense in throwing good money after bad.  This bill differs
from the senate version.  The senate version repealed all the rules, in
effect, and …</p>

to start over. This House PCS simply delays by three years, only the
rules not currently enforced. The House PCS also leaves in the buffer
rule changes in the original version of S515 and adds language to
address the unique buffer situations regarding airports, and you'll hear
more about that.
The bigger picture, S515 is part of a 3-pronged approach to improve
water quality at Jordan Lake. The bill itself only delays rules, by
three years, not currently enforced. The rules that are not currently
enforced. During this three year window, the state will fund an in lake
water quality demonstration project with 1.7 million dollars from the
Clean Water Fund, and 300,000 from DENR's operating budget. Both of
these are supported by DENR. DENR is fully on board with this project.

to specifically study the Jordan Lake policies during the interim.
That’s the general approach that this bill takes. And Mr. Speaker, I
would ask you to recognize Representative Ross to go into a little more
detail.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Ross, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman's recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
It's getting late, so my vision is getting a little off. I hope I can
see.
As Representative Faircloth said, the purpose of this bill is to, this
is a substitute for what the Senate had originally proposed, and that
was a total repeal of the regulations. There were some stakeholders
involved back upstream that said no, wait a minute, let's don't do that
because we've already invested some money into this process. So that's
how we were able to work out this solution.
I've been involved in the Jordan Lake regulations since back in the
beginning, as a councilman and as the Mayor in Burlington. I remember
very well negotiating, or trying to negotiate with DENR back when the
regulations were being formed. Now, there's several parts to the
process, we call them phases. The first phase really dealt with point
source nutrient management. Which, for those back upstream, which would
be like Burlington for example, Greensboro, and Reidsville, some of the
cities back up in the Haw River arm, this meant our waste water
treatment plants. It was at that point in time that I learned more about
waste water treatment plants than I ever really wanted to know. In
particular, as to what goes out the other side.
Burlington took the approach that we, as many of the stakeholders in the
Haw River arm, and I'm speaking here really specifically the Haw River
arm, because that’s the one I know most. As the other stakeholders, we
wanted clean water just as bad as anyone else did, but we had done a
great deal of research that showed that a lot of the overbearing
regulations really would have little to no impact on the lake. But we
made the decision in Burlington to go ahead and spend the money for the
upgrades, and started calculating what the other parts, or the other
phases of the regulations would do. At this point, I just conferred with
the City Manager in Burlington, the city there has spent 25 million
dollars as a result of the first phase of these rules to upgrade their
waste water treatment plant. Now, that’s one city. As I mentioned,
Greensboro, Reidsville, there are a number of cities involved in this.
It's hundreds of millions of dollars that has been placed on our
municipalities and our counties as a result of these regulations.
Now, as was stated earlier, this portion of the regulations is moving
forward. Those have already been approved. We accept that and we move
forward, as I said, we've already spent the money. It's the other phases
that come about, and I'm going to give you a couple of examples, as was
mentioned just a moment ago. There</p>

everybody wants clean water from the lake. But let's do it the right way

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I feel like my constant refrain this
session has been to thank the House for making a really bad Senate bill
a lot less bad. And that's certainly the case with the Jordan Lake
rules. Proposal to repeal it in the Senate was unacceptable. I
appreciate representative Faircloth and representative Ross' leadership
and trying to tone down the impact of the bill by turning it into a 3
year delay. But the practical impact is we have an impaired drinking
water source that's very import for 300,000 North Carolinians that will
continue to be impaired if we delay the implementation of the Jordan
Lake rules. We've been working on these since 1997; they've been through
multiple stakeholder processes. I've been involved with Representative
Allen and prior Gibson back in 2007 through 2009 with a stakeholder
process that signed off on the Jordan Lake rules bill and legislation
that was enacted in 2009. That has been delayed twice.
That's in part why we aren't seeing visible imporvement in the lake
right now because we continue to delay the rules. These aren't
requirements that we can avoid because they're federal requirements of
the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act anticipates upstream
participation and not just at the lake.
There's been mention of the technology that was tucked into the budget
bill we voted on this afternoon for the Solar V technology which is on
site at the lake. I've done a little research on that and I distributed
Monday a flier on this technology. It's designed to aerate the water. It
doesn't really clean out the nitrogen and the phosphorus which is the
source of the pollution in the lake. It's not really proven technology.
It's been tried in Lake Houston and it isn't really working there and
they've got the sixth worst drinking water in the nation - not something
I'd like to emulate.
We know from other experiences with other watersheds that storm water
management works. It's an important component of the water quality
protection of the state which we did sort of decimate with the budget
cuts. We spent so much time and effort on these Jordan Lake and I think
we ought to give them the chance to be implemented. The continued delay
is not going to serve the public well and certainly not Jordan Lake well
and the importance of the drinking water source. I think what this bill
does is continue to shift the burden of the cleaning up of the lake from
the developers who would develop in a way that would prevent the
pollution in the first place to taxpayers who are going to have to pay
to clean it up. I think that's unfair and unfortunate.
I think this is a terrible bill. I'm glad it's not a complete recall,
but we are not doing well by the folks who drink water from Lake Jordan.
Thank you.

I drink the water from Lake Jordan down in Wilmington so this is
important to me. I just want to say that because of what I do for a
living, very very little impact on improving Lake Jordan would be
accomplished by implementing tougher rules. The majority of nutrients
come from non source-point pollution that would not be regulated. You
put a very unfair and unnnecesary burden on citizens on the growth and
economic development and housing and everything else that really has a
very, very minor impact. I think this is a very thoughtful approach to
this and we did in our budget go ahead and approve...</p>

The pilot program to experiment to see if we can do some, some form of
mitigation. So all we're really doing here is, is giving us a 3 year
breathing space to take a close look at it. I could tell you that you go
back just a few decades and the, and the focus of storm water rules were
flooding protection. And now it’s kinda become a religious politically
correct battle to, to treat storm water as a, as the most serious
polluting activity, when it's not. It starts as clean rainfall and most
of the nutrients and most of the things that get into our water supplies
are naturally occurring. So I, I urge you support of this, I think it's

[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you members. Let me ?? the lady from
Guilford's genuine appreciation of the gentle ?? and the gentleman from
Guilford's working hard to mitigate what the Senate was trying to do. As
someone who's in the line of fire on this I'm deeply grateful for your
work on this. I do want to make it clear though to the members that this
has been a long, long process. I got here in 2005, and this process was
already in the works. I've been deeply involved in it throughout that
time. There’ve been numerous stakeholder meetings, consultations with
all folks involved in it geographically, economically, and so forth.
What they came up with wasn't pretty, didn't satisfy completely anyone,
including me. But it was a compromise. Since that was reached its been
delayed by this body several times. We've delayed it frequently over and
over again. And so yeah of course we have not seen the kind of changes
we'd like to see in Jordan Lake. But I just don't think it makes sense
to say, well we came up with a plan to fix it that we haven't fully
implemented, it hadn't gotten fixed so let's delay the plan further.
That, that's not the right approach to take. I, I do appreciate the
gentleman from Guilford's depiction of his drives by Lake Jordan. I
don't drive by it much, I'm sure it's a pretty lake, but in the end I, I
don't really don't care how the lake looks, for me it's about economic
development, it's about the growth in my area, it's about jobs in the
district I represent. And what we're looking at is a limited resources,
it is something that we've got to share. You pull on one end it does
have an effect on the other end. What you do up in Burlington does
affect Raleigh, and what we do in Raleigh will affect y'all upstream.
And so a compromise is necessary, and a compromise was reached. A
compromise that didn’t allow unfettered growth in ??, but it did not
give the folks downstream everything, by any means that we would want.
And I just think it's irresponsible for this body to abandon methods
that over time have been proven to make significant progress towards the
cleanup, to delay that further. Because folks this problem took decades
to create, and we can blame the federal government, we can blame the
state government, it's a state government problem, federal government
problem, whoever. In the end it's a problem for my constituents, it's a
problem for Representative Ross's constituents also. We had a way that
made everybody kind of unhappy but in the end everybody more or less was
on board with. We don't need to delay that further. Let's get started in
cleaning this up before someone makes us apply a fix that's gonna be
more in the end even more expensive to your constituents and mine.

[Speaker Change]
Members of the house while this is better than eliminating the rules, to
delay the rules is merely to let things get worse for 3 years. The fact
the matter is the referenced experimental program only deal very with a
tiny part of the lake and that cannot possibly clean up the lake to the
level that we need. What was negotiated for a long time did not make all
the stakeholders happy. We in Durham committed to do our part even
though it is expensive to Durham. We don’t like doing it particularly
any more then Burlington, or Greensboro High Point. But the fact the
matter is it's a technology that was agreed too, it's a technology that
has been working.</p>

And has only not worked as much as we would like to because of delays.
And so to delay for three more years is simply to ensure that there will
be more pollution because there will be more unprotected development
upstream, in thee upstream places and to do so is to make things worse
for Jordan Lake and the 300,000 people who live who live primarily in
Western Wake County who will have to deal with this issue of untreated
or unprotected waters to the degree that we wanted to protect them.
So, members for those reasons, I would urge you to reject this
compromise, this delay, because the delay is only happening because
there are the votes to make it happen. And that's not a good reason to
get rid of a plan that was working, so give it a chance to work.  Please
vote no on the bill.

Jordan Lake is in my district.  It's in Chatham County.  I cross Jordan
Lake most days twice a day.  I love the lake.  It's a beautiful place.
My children tease me because of the unexplainable joy I feel when the
lake is full and the sadness I feel when it's low.  Right now it's full,
we've been lucky.  But I still feel sadness when I think about how that
water is not as clean as it's supposed to be and how many people are
depending on that lake for their drinking water. Siler City does not
depend on that lake for their drinking water.  I honestly think Chatham
County should have gotten a little more use of that water when they
negotiated the deal but they didn't. But it's still very important to
very many people.  I hope we will continue to take care of that water
and not put off these regulations and delay keeping it clean.
I think it's just as important to continue, and this is going to sound a
trivial comparison, but if I'm away all week and I don't clean my house,
when I go back it's much worse than if I'm there and I'm working a
little bit each day.  If we put off for three years taking care of that
lake, it's only going to get worse and it's only going to be more
expensive when we come back to it.  Then there is still a chance that
the federal government is going to come down and say &quot;You don't
have that option of putting it off.  You have to do this. You have to
take care of this lake and keep that water clean.&quot;
Please don't put this off.  It's very important that we keep our
drinking water safe. I think our drinking water is going to become one
of our most valuable resources in the next 50 years and North Carolina
really doesn't have very good plans for our water usage for the future.
We've been lucky enough to have plenty of it.  We need to have a plan
and we need to be taking care of the water that we have.  Please vote
against this. Thank you.

Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Speaker.  I would have thought actually that since the
Jordan Lake rules survive negotiation with Representative Gibson all
these years, they could survive about anything. But apparently not.  And
there was a day and time when negotiated settlement that resulted in
legislation was honored, but we, I guess, are past that time. I claim
not to know very much about environmental issues but I can read a letter
from the EPA issued a week ago.  And so my three reasons for voting
against this bill are this letter and then the other two which I'll give
you very briefly.  This letter is issue July 10th, or received July
10th, so it was issued several days before of this year by the EPA with
regard to this bill.  And some of you have seen it and some of you
haven't, but I'm not going to read the whole letter but I am going to
read a couple of pertinent parts.  And this says &quot;The Jordan Lake
TMDL has been approved by USCPA and it establishes reduction targets of
total nitrogen and total and phosphorous from both non-point sources and
point sources permitted discharges. Implementation of the nutrient
reductions contemplated by the total maximum daily load will
address...&quot;</p>

<p id="160:00">
?? Impairment, in Jordan Lake. And as with most TMDLs, the Jordan Lake
TMDL involves an allocation of necessary reductions. Necessary
reductions between non-point source and point source dischargers. And
then it goes on to the key paragraph. We understand the proposed bill
would establish a study committee which among other tasks would be
charged with developing a technological solution based on mitigation of
pollution at the lake without the need for pollution reduction upstream.
And obviously under this bill with a three-year delay. Here is the
language. This approach is generally inconsistent with the Clean Water
Act which contemplates the implementation of pollution source reductions
to address water quality impairments. And it goes on and says, &quot;any
abandonment of efforts to achieve reductions from nonpoint source
dischargers could make it necessary to revisit the approved TMDL and
assign greater reductions to permit a point source dischargers.
From our perspective the TMDL will remain in place. The nonpoint source
pollution reductions would still have to be addressed. And the pollution
reductions assigned to point source dischargers will still have to be
reflected in permits. We will closely monitor the progress of this
proposed legislation. Now I don't again know the science that well, but
I can read that letter. And I'm very clear about what it's saying. And
we ought to be too. And so we either to continue to do what we're
supposed to do and control that process or we will very soon have
abandoned our commitment to a point that we will not be controlling that
process. The second thing, I understand the limited technology of the
solar mixer, and I agree with the idea generally of pilots. Particularly
on new technology. Except that we've already had several pilots with
this technology and they haven't worked.
The first pilot in a large lake, was Lake Houston in Texas, and that
didn't work at all. That was referred to earlier. But there's even been
an earlier pilot with a slightly older version of this which was at
greenfield lake in Wilmington in 2005, and that didn't work. And I know
that didn't work because I read the article about it a few months ago by
Dr. Mailin from UNCW and Dr. Rick Owl from Duke, who said it didn't
work. And so the third thing I thought, &quot;well, if this is still
going to be a possibility, I ought to at least ask some people I
know.&quot; And aside from asking Rep. McGrady, I went to a different
source. And I went to the former president of the national Sierra Club
who helped write the environmental protection laws of the country with
the Nixon administration in his role. And spoke to him and had dinner
with him the other night, and I showed him this picture and the pamphlet
and technology, and I asked him what he thought.
And when he stopped laughing, is when I kind of figured out what he
thought. And he said very clearly, &quot;this isn't going to work, it
never has worked, it's not going to work. And even if it does to some
degree, it doesn't remove the pollution from the lake.&quot; Well I
don't know as I said a lot, but I know that I'm going to rely on the
former president of the Sierra Club who helped write the PA Regs. I'm
going to rely on the professor from Duke and the professor from UNCW who
said the pilots haven't worked. And I'm going to rely on the letter from
a week and a half ago from EPA that said we better not do this because
if we do there is at least some likelihood that the EPA would get far
more involved in our business. And for all those reasons, and many more
I suspect for others, I'm not going to vote for this delay.

Whether the other measures in technologies are the technologies that are
set forth in the budget bill.
[Speaker Change]
My understanding Representative McGrady is that the probably the LRC
will help take part in a study of this issue and that, and I've talked
with ?? officials and there intention is to look at the technology that
is being mentioned here, that you and I have talked about before, as
well as whatever is available. And basically we've asked them does that
mean that you look at the best practices even worldwide if you have to.
And they've guaranteed us that they would.

The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Speaker, colleagues I didn't actually come fully prepared to respond
to this because both leadership and my seat mate understood that this
was not gonna come up 'til tomorrow. So I took all my materials back and
I'm having to wing it a little bit, which is probably good. We've heard
from one of our colleagues an engineer who opines that the technologies
that may be used here, I don't wanna put words in his mouth but are, are
workable. And I, I find it always curious a little bit in the, the
chamber that we're, we're relatively quickly to, to accept the opinions
of engineers, and real estate people, and a range of other things. But
we don't very much care for the opinion of lawyers, and we certainly
don't care for the opinions of scientists. And the science here even
though we never like to listen to that doesn't appear to be real
positive. And I don't even have to go check with a former CR President
to find this out. A Duke professor and a UNCW professor both written at
some length on this, and the Duke professor has said that there is no
chance the device or other techniques would effectively replace the
storm water controls of the current approach. He also said that the
situation could grow worse as more land is paved, and more water flows
into the lake. His concern as a scientist is that Jordan Lake, if the
Jordan Lake rules are deferred for 3 years, there are 3 lost years of
opportunity to get the phosphorous and nitrogen sources in the waste
water shed reduced. And that's, that's really the issue. And what I'm
gonna enjoy and, and actually Representative Hastings brought, made me
realize this. Is when the vote occurs here I have a suspicion that all
of the legislatures who drink water from this lake, and on a regular
basis with the potential exception of the speaker protem. Are gonna be
on the other side of this bill. And I'm gonna be looking forward to
seeing how those that drink the water are voting on the bill that
effects them and their constituents.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members I'm stunned that we're still talking

issues in the late 70's before impoundment actually took place. And
we've been talking about it ever since. And still nothing has, much has
been done. Someone said that these rules wouldn't have any effect on
cleaning up the pollution. I'm sure that's a misunderstanding, it's a
serious misunderstanding because the rules actually do address a
non-point source. They address the development run off, the storm water
runoff, and the agriculture community is participating. I have received
emails from the agricultural community asking us to</p>

…this bill because they want the rules to go into effect. And we all
should want the rules to go into effect, because if they don’t the waste
water treatment permits are going to have to be improved, and that means
money for all of us who have waste water going into Jordan Lake, who
haven’t cleaned up our waste water. And that may be many of the upstream
communities.
So here’s just a sentence form a letter to the governor: The Jordan Lake
rules are the means by which North Carolina, under the Clean Water Act,
will achieve the federally mandated target reductions. So we need to
vote no on this bill and let these rules go into place.
This won’t be the last… Let’s assume this bill passes and the Jordan
Lake rules are postponed three years. In three years, there’ll be
another bill to postpone them some more because this is the way it
always happens.
We have the stakeholders get together, all the parties are there, they
work through the rules, they get peeled back gradually so that they’re
not as good as they need to be, but they’re better than nothing. And
then there’s a consensus reached, and then the bill is presented. And
then the people who stand, who don’t want the rules at all, start to
undermine the process. They don’t stick to the consensus game.
So when these three years expire, we’ll have another bill. This can’t go
on. This water is getting worse every year. More and more people are
drinking out of it. This bill doesn’t require the delay of any
development. So development in the watershed’s going to continue to go
on, and there’s going to be more and more runoff, and more and more
pollution.
I guess the fights about water must be as old as communities. They go on
and on. But you don’t pollute the downstream drinking water. You don’t
pollute from the upstream. Water is our most important natural resource.
It’s our most important resource. We have to have clean… The water
belongs to everybody. We don’t have the right to pollute somebody else’s
drinking water.
We’re going to have to clean the lake up, and this is the time to start
doing it. We need to vote no on this bill and let the rules go into
effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Holley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know you’ve heard the story that I’ve worked in
purchasing contract for 25 years. And one of the contracts I did on a
regular basis was cleaning up our rivers and streams. Not just one, but
numerous ones. They started out as a few and they became numerous. And
they became numerous because we were cleaning up the rivers and streams
and not solving some of the problems.
Now I have seen some that have been cleaned up. And those that were
cleaned up were cleaned because along with cleaning up the river and the
stream, they also cleaned up the problem that was causing the river and
the stream to be pollutes in the first place.
And we can sit here all day and talk about Jordan Lake and it’s not
going to get any better until we do a duel thing. And that’s clean the
lake up at the same time we’re cleaning up the problems that add to the
problems of the lake.
You know, it’s only going to get more and more expensive. Another thing
is, this does not get better with inactivity. So not working on it and
looking at theories, we need to continue with the programs that we have,
that we are trying to implement now. You can add some new industrial
things along the way, and try some new technology.
But let’s deal with what we know works. And that’s cleaning up the lake,
as well as cutting back and cutting out the problems that pollute it. I
say let’s not support this bill. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, member of the House. I wasn’t

not just this technology. But when I talked to Tom Reeder about this, I
don’t know if you all know Tom Reeder, but he’s our Director of Water
Resources.
He is touted by environmentalists, and also others, that he knows more
about water quality than anyone probably in this state. Tom Reeder met

Negotiations, and he said, &quot;What's happening is not cleaning up
Jordan Lake.&quot; And let me tell you another thing that's happening
with some of these buffer rules. They're enticing animals, critters,
birds, to them. Some of the pollution's caused because of these critters
and because you're enticing them because of some of the buffer rules.
It's happening on the coast.They increase the buffer, and the birds, the
raccoons, the opossums all come, and that's where your pollution is. In
fact, North Carolina State did PCR testing to find out if it's-- what
breed of animal is it, and it's almost all avian, it's almost all birds.
The buffers are enticing the birds. Retention ponds that were touted in
these Jordan Lake rules to solve the problem, even by the Coastal
Federation and the most dedicated, I would say, environmentalists (I
won't say the word I'd like to use, extreme, but anyway... I guess I
just said it), those folks are saying that these retention ponds are not
working. Why don't we give that chance to study what is going to work?
What's happening now is not cleaning up Jordan Lake. We need to look at
other resources, other studies, other technology, before any more county
money, taxpayer money, is thrown into the river, into the lake, with no
good. Please give this a chance. It's just a pause. It's not a total
restriction of the rules. Give this a chance. Please vote yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, please state your purpose.

To speak on the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman has the floor to debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to point out that the Phase 2 regulations that went into
effect back in 2007 that affect development and sewer plants are staying
in effect. There's nothing changing there. Those regulations that effect
our sewer plants, the ones where we spent all that money on in
Burlington, they stay in effect. Other municipalities within the region
are going to have to conform to those regulations. We're not throwing
out all the regulations, we're not even postponing all the regulations.
The only thing we're doing here is taking a step back to study some of
the further development rules down the road that we know-- and no one
has been able to show us yet --that they work at all, and they're going
to cost our taxpayers upstream hundreds of millions of dollars. I can
tell you the taxpayers of Burlington that paid, or are paying, that $25
million to upgrade that sewer plant. Now, that was a responsibility that
we felt like we had to have clean water downstream, and we did that.
Those rules stay in effect. We're not changing those. And with some of
these more burdensome regulations that come down the road that we know
don't work, I ask you to support the bill. Thank you.

Representative Blust, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I'm not going to add to
what's been said. It's been explained very well from my colleague from
Burlington and from Representative Faircloth. I just want to add one
note concerning Guilford and, to an extent, Alamance. I think Senator
Gunn would agree. I've got the map here of this area, and one reason I
support this bill wholeheartedly is just based on the geography. It
makes very little sense to greatly impede development and commerce in
Guilford and Alamance when they are connected to this lake only by the
very narrow Haw River, which, most of the year, is just a big creek. Of
course, that's not true when you get a big rainstorm, but it flows
through miles and miles of countryside and links up with the lake at the
very bottom of the lake just above the dam. The studies have shown, and
I think this is right, that the water from the Haw arm stays in the lake
only for eight days, on average. Most of the</p>

Representative: lake is in the new hope arm. That is the big part of the
lake. It is connected to the hop arm by a 5 or 6 mile narrow strait. You
can look very clearly, if you want to, at the map. The big part of the
lake is polluted from runoff from Chapel Hill, Durham, and those areas.
It just does not make economic sense, to loose jobs and prosperity in
Gilford and Alamance, to maybe spread the misery, but have very little
real impact on that lake. So we in Gilford and the chamber of commerce,
the city council, has asked for relief from these rules. It is very big
majorities up there that need this bill, and humbly ask you to support
this bill, so that we can have some job creation and economic growth and
not… that won’t harm the lake at all in reality. So I ask for your
support.
Speaker: Representative Harvester, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill.
Speaker: Representative has the floor to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members, I will be very brief,
but because I am from Gilford County, I want to chime in. I think this
is a very reasonable approach: press the pause button, step back and
look at it. I will simply echo what was said earlier by Representatives
Bluss and Bearclaw, and I would appreciate your support on this bill.
Speaker: Further discussion or debate? If not, the question before the
house is the passage of the house committee substitute to senate bill
515 on its second reading. Those in favor will vote aye, those opposed
will vote no. The clerk will open the vote.  The clerk will close the
machine and record the vote: 66 having voted in the affirmative, 44 in
the negative. House committee substitute for senate bill 515 has passed
its second reading and will remain on the calendar. Representative
Floyd, the chair was wondering whether or not the gentleman would
support a motion to carry over the last bill on the calendar until
tomorrow?
Representative: Mr. Speaker, how controversy is that bill?
[laughter]
Speaker: Ladies and gentleman, without objection, the chair moves that
senate bill 725 be removed from today’s calendar and recalendared for
tomorrow. We do have one more conference report for concurrence. The
chair assumes that we can dispose of that quickly, and that will end the
calendar for this evening. So, without objection, we would ... the house
bill 417 will be added to today’s calendar for immediate consideration
and the motion will be for nonconcurrence. Is there objection? So
ordered. House bill 417, the clerk will read.
Clerk: Committee substitute for House bill 417, the bill is [xx] an act
monitoring auditing statutes in large state departments and universities
systems.
Speaker: The clerk will read the amendments.
Clerk: Senator Brown moves to amend the bill on page 2, line 35, by

Representative: Mr. Speaker, I did not object to your motion, but the
rules chairman advises me that I need make a motion not to concur on
HB17.
Speaker: Further discussion on the amendment? I think the gentleman to
properly stat the amendment. Amendment 1, there are two amendments that
we have to vote not to concur on. So the motion will be not to concur in
the senate amendment 1 to house committee substitute 2 for house bill
417. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. Ladies and gentleman, again, the motion is not to concur, that

morning at 10:15 am.
Speaker: Representative Burr, please state your purpose.
Representative: For a point of personal privilege.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. You know you learn a lot when you
sit with someone, and certainly, we get to know our seat mates better
throughout our time in session, and you get to know them a little better
when they are also your roommate. Today is an important day for my seat
mate. Today is his birthday and he got to spend his day in the
legislature, almost all of it entire. You know his age is really
starting to show this morning. He left the apartment about five minutes
before me and by the time I left, I probably went half a mile and caught
up with him. He was driving in the left hand lane about 15 miles slower
than the rest of traffic and it also appeared that he was talking to
himself. So it certainly appears that not only is his age wearing him
down, but so too is this building and what we are doing, but it is his
birthday. I do want to wish Representative Hollow a happy birthday. He
is certainly a respected member of this body and a well respected member
among his community. He works very hard in the legislature but also, the
moment we get out of session, is headed back home to take care of folks
in his community – something that he does every week. He is really a
hard worker. I just hope that you all will join me in wishing him a
happy birthday today.

The gentleman may state his inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker,
we’re, we’re windin’ down the session. And rule nine and rule ten is
very important. We be windin’ down the session and I prefer not to be,
prefer not, prefer you not apply rule nine to me. But if we can be a
little bit obedient towards rule ten I think that we can expedite a lot
of time tomorrow. So I, I just ask the Speaker if he’ll just be kind to
us and look at rule ten. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the, on rule nine it is
the gentleman, gentleman’s suggestion to suspend points of order. And on
rule ten the gentleman’s point is well taken in terms of limitations on
debate. As a serious point Representative Floyd, tomorrow could be a
very long day. That’s why we are starting at 11. The chair anticipates
as least one bill tomorrow that could consume a significant amount of
time. And in every instance the, I think that you know that the chair
has in instances where we want to limit debate. The practice is to
allocate two thirds of the time to the minority and one third of the
time to the majority. As we look at the calendar for tomorrow it would
be the intention of the chair to be open to that should the minority be
willing to, to negotiate. But that would be the only way with consensus
that any debate would be limited. And hopefully we will. By the way
we’re going to second you on the adjournment motion tonight. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McManus please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just gonna ask if tomorrow
was the day to wear purple? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, technically what you
wear tomorrow is most likely gonna be what you’re wearing on Friday.
[LAUGH] And. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And so you may
want to bring a spritzer or something. But the, the, if we will consult
and this, this again is a very serious subject. We, we don’t always know
what’s coming from the Senate. And so there may be a matter that comes
over that in the opinion of the chair would be more appropriate for us
to take up session some time around nine or so on Friday. Everything
that we know at this point though that I believe that it is, it is
likely that with the full concurrence of the minority the chair will
entertain the, the idea of coming back and taking a third reading on at
least one bill which requires third reading just after midnight. But
that will only occur with the full concurrence of the minority caucus.
In that case I think purple may be a safe bet for tomorrow. Further
notices and announcements? Representative Moore is  recognized. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr.Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn to reconvene
on Thursday, July 25th, 2013 at 11 A. M. subject to ratification of
