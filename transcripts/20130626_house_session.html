<p id="015:00">
Additionally, we are requiring this non-profit organization to help the
state develop this comprehensive strategic economic development plan,
that will help us have public and private input on how we do business
and interact with the private sector. Alongside this private
sector/public sector involvement, we've got University – members of the
Board of Governors for the University helping out, to help this economic
development plan, to make sure we have appropriate strengths and
weaknesses in our state identified. Additionally, the legislation
modifies the North Carolina Board of Science and Technology, and I
wanted to thank Representative Floyd for adding an amendment. I believe
Representative Graham will offer a similar amendment to make sure we
have an appropriate diversity on this Board of Science and Technology,
and we're adding the word “Innovation” to help make sure that we are
staying on the cutting edge of innovation, science and technology.
Additionally, we are creating new prosperity zones, and there's been a
fair amount of discussion on  how the maps look, and we're trying to
make sure that we have appropriate flexibility, to make sure that we are
partnering more with each other in an appropriate way from a regional
perspective, with the perspective of the industries in these clusters as
well. And this is – there's plenty of discussion about the maps, and I
think we could draw maps all day.  We could engage in a map-drawing
effort, and on what counties should be partnered with which counties,
and the focus of these prosperity zones is to focus on customer service
across departmental lines. And to make sure we have our Department of
Transportation, Department of Commerce and DENR all working together
under one roof to make sure we're delivering the best customer service
for economic development and job creation. We have proper oversight and
ethics provisions contained in this legislation as well, and I think
this is an effort that would help streamline and deliver services from
an economic development perspective, bettering each one of our
communities, both rural and urban, and make sure that we have a direct
line from the Department of Commerce in your community instead of this
kind of a patchwork and myriad of efforts. We want to make sure that
we're all signing out of the same songbook, and I think this is a way to
streamline this and achieve savings in our Department of Commerce, and
deliver better customer service to each one of our communities for
economic development. I'd be glad to be available to answer any
questions, but I do have a couple of amendments that I would like to
send forth at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry, I know that there are four
pending amendments you have to, I believe, Representative McElraft and
Representative Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The first amendment I'd like to send forth is
S127-AMC-37.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth the
amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is amendment AMC-37 (v1). Representative Murry
moves to amend the bill on Page 16, lines 7 through 11 by rewriting
those lines to read:
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr Speaker. Section 6.8 of the current
version of the bill addresses how the regional economic development
commissions and how the Department of Commerce can retain 50 percent of
that funding. This broadens that language to enable the public/private
partnership for state marketing and re-branding functions that are
currently being performed by the regional economic and development
commissions. That on January 1 of 2014, anything that has been
appropriated for that will be available for the Department to allocate
to this public/private partnership for those similar functions. So we
took the 50 percent language out, and made it a little broader and more
flexible to meet the needs of the public/private partnership while we
work in concert with these  regional economic development commissions
over this transition period. So I would ask that members would vote yes
on the amendment, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Further discussion or further debate on the
amendment? If not, the question before the House is the passage of the
amendment sent forth by Representative Murry for the House Committee
Substitute of Senate Bill 127. All in favor vote Aye. All opposed vote
No. The clerk will open the vote. [RECORDING ENDS]</p>

Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House. This amendment just
clarifies that the funds appropriated for tourism development will be
used for such and not co-mingled with the money for ancillary activity,
such as statewide branding and business development marketing. And then
in the second area, page 3, line 1 and 2, it adds the North Carolina

Coalition, and that position will be recommended jointly by those two
boards. Thank you so much. I appreciate your support.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Murry, please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGE
I would ask members to support the amendment. Several folks in the

[Speaker Changes] The machine will record the vote, 107 having voted in
the affirmative, 4 in the negative, the amendment passes, we’re now back
on the bill. Further discussion, further debate? Representative Catlin,
please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended.
[Speaker Changes] I have a tremendous amount of respect for the bill
sponsor and the secretary of commerce and Governor but I will be voting
no on this and so I thought I would explain why. One issue that concerns
me is this sets the path forward to redistricting the deemer regions,
which I thinks something that needs to be vetted separately. Secondly,
I’m afraid these nonprofits will be judged by how much incentives they
recommend, and I think that moves us in the wrong direction. These non
profits will be allowed to pay theirself 120 thousand dollars with your
tax dollars for their salaries. And there is no clear plan to offset
that cost by staff reduction and commerce, so I respect whatever you
guys decide to vote, but I just wanted to let you know where I was.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Bumgardner, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I have had every intention of
voting against this until today, and I’m gonna tell you why. I don’t
like incentives. I think its a mistake to take money from people that
are here, tax payers, and use that money to entice, or whatever other
word you want to use, other people to come here, and I disagree with the
whole premise and principle…..
[Recording went blank]
[Speaker Changes] Is a very diverse state with regions, and our regional
partnerships certainly up in the Western part of the state have been
very effective. They are mature organizations, they have worked very
hard for well over a decade. I’ve been involved with them for at least a
decade. They are doing a great job identifying the opportunities of the
Western region. Regional partnerships were developed because all of the
power was central to Raleigh in previous efforts for economic
development across our state. The Regional partnerships help bring some
real local leadership, some real local input and development, and they
work very well in my area. What this bill seems to do, this direction, I
hope it doesn’t work this way, but I’m quite skeptical of it because
what we have had, our biggest trouble in Western North Carolina, is
getting any attention out of Raleigh to the special needs of our region.
And our regional partnerships have done a very good job in developing
our assets for opportunities and innovation and everything. So for that
reason, just for regionalism in this state, I think the regions need to
be well represented. And the authority and power, needs to not reside in
Raleigh exclusively in the department of commerce, so for that reason
I’ll be voting against the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Millis, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman. As you
know, I usually sit back here very quiet, and whenever there are times
for me to speak, I am very reluctant. But today I wanted to stand up and
give you some justification of why you will see a red dot next to my
name on this bill. As I say that, I really want to qualify some things
that are very positive about this bio, for the efforts of the bill
sponsors, as well as the efforts of the administration. That is for the
first time in a very, very, long time, or maybe forever, we’re actually
gonna have a comprehensive economic development plan. It’s a very
positive thing for this state. In addition, we’re going to have some
collaboration between economic developing zones...</p>

<p id="030:00">
Which is a great measure. We're also going to have the, we're actually
going to look at the examination of the collaboration between these
agencies. And for anybody who is trying to expand an existing business
here in this state or who is actually trying to come in this state to do
business, as you know, you get the run-around in regard to the
regulatory measures that you have to meet. Whether it be with DOT or ??
or anything of the like. So the idea of we're making efforts on a
regional aspect, to allow an individual not to have the run-around, just
because he or she decides to expand their existing business or to come
to North Carolina to do business. So I applaud all those efforts.
But the reason why that I will be voting against this bill is a
continuation of something that I feel that is truly negative for this
state. And that measure is the role of economic incentives, by way of
direct cash incentives to private businesses, or even by way of shifting
the tax burden from one business to another by way of a credit.
Now, the term economic development is a broad term. And that includes
some very positive things. Infrastructure, the idea for our roads, our
water and sewer, which is a direct public expenditure of tax payer
dollars, that has a direct public impact. They could have indirect,
private impact, but that is justifiable within the role of government
and state. But to take taxpayer dollars, that are being taken from their
pockets for the role of government, and to directly invest those dollars
into a private business, to me is extremely harmful. And I can't find
anything on the Constitution here in this state that I actually took the
oath to uphold that actually gives me the ability, as a legislator, to
do that.
And this bill here, on page one, in terms of the contracting functions
of the Department of Commerce, lines 14 to 15, basically says this
non-profit will render advisory, research, and recruiting
recommendations regarding incentiven and grants awards. So not only are
we taking something that currently exists within the Department of
Commerce, but we're contracting out with a non-profit corporation, that
may not necessarily directly make the expenditures of these incentive
grants, but will actually make the recommendations to the Department of
Commerce to these incentive grants to be issued.
So, to me, I have some reservations about that. And as the committees
that I was on actually articulated those reservations. And that is, that
a non-profit corporation that is going to use public dollars to leverage
more private dollars, then how does that work in regard to if you're not
a member of that non-profit organization, or a paying member for private
funds? And even under the terms economic development of infrastructure,
then what's the odds of you actually having those public dollars of
infrastructure come near your place of living or your place of business,
if you're not a paying member of that non-profit corporation?
Those things concern me a little bit. Also, in regards to the formation
of the non-profit, on page two, it talks about the appointments and the
expertise that are needed on this board. Which I think is a great thing
for anybody who is actually talking about economic development to
actually be informed about it. And I think this is a positive thing, but
as we talked about, economic development also includes incentives. With
that, it's kind of hard for me to flip on the next page and see that it
says here on page 3, line 12, that no member of the board shall take any
official action or use of the member's official position to profit in
any manner. It appears that is a Catch 22, that how can you be an expert
on this board, in regards to all the aspects of economic development,
but then to make decisions in regard to page one of the bill, like I
expressed in the recruitment of businesses by economic incentives, and
actually not have an economic gain behind it?
These things concern me, and I just wanted to provide you, the members,
with some justification of why that there will be a red light next to my
name on this bill. And I hope that as we are doing these wonderful
things to reform our commerce and how we actually approach economic
development in our state, that we can do so within the role of
government. That we can do so that takes these taxpayer dollars and
invest it into items of infrastructure that affect all, versus the
taking of taxpayer dollars for the role of government and directly
giving it to a private business. It seems fine, but there are
constituents in your district, and in my district as well, that are
actually working, earning income, and also paying taxes. And for their
monies to directly go to a business that could locate in the district,
by way of economic incentives, that they are actually funding their
competitor. And indirectly, it could be viewed that they are funding the
own knife that cuts their throat. I think we need to head in a different
direction in this state. And while I commend the positive things this

a different vision here in north carolina to actually fund the dollars
of our tax payers in a way that is in with the proper rule of

(SPEAKER CHANGES)Mr speaker
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Representative Murry please state your purpose
(SPEAKER CHANGES)I would like to ask representative mills a quick
question
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Representative Mills does the gentleman yield?
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Absolutely
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Are you familiar with the existing oversight on how
economic development incentives as are issued in this state currently
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Representative Murry i am currently aware that whether
it be jdig or one fund or jmac, i understand that this direction taken
is actually a positive aspect in that step, my oposition to the bill was
in reguard to were continuing something in my view that is wrong period,
even though wee are making it, we are polishing it, we are polishing
something that is not positive for the citizens of the state.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Thank you
(SPEAKER CHANGES)representative Susan Martin please state your purpose.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)To speak on the bill
(SPEAKER CHANGES)The lady is recognized to debate the bill
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Thank you mr speaker. Members of the house,  i rise in
support of this bill and i want to commend the spon sors and the
secretary and her staff for all of the hard work that has gone into this
comprehensive legislation. Change is disconcerning for many of us and it
is a great vision but it is difficult to see from where we are today for
how we are going to get top all these great things, and its not
finished, there is still work to be done in the planning process. I want
top share with you that i had the directors of economic development in
the 2 counties i support, to meet with secretary Decker individually and
express all of there concerns, whats working well whats not working
well, and i found her to be exceptionally interested and really
listening to the input and addressing there concerns and they are both
on board with this direction= and really support these changes, so i
will be voting for this bill, and i also want to share that i will be
objecting the third reading, because in working with the sponsor and the
secretary, some information  ahas been communicated that is not exactly
outlined in the bilkl, as stated and, with this bill sponsors agreement
i will be working up a small technical amendment, so i appreciate the
support of the bill
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Representative Martin the chair anticipates a bit more
time than the session today based on a couple of the other bills we have
i wondered if its possible if we could have the amendment drawn up, we
may still be able to take it up before the session is over today if you
confer with the staff and the bills sponsor. Representative McElraft
please state your purpose
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Speak on the bill
(SPEAKER CHANGES)The lady is recognized to debate the bill
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Thank you mr speaker, members of the house my partner
and i over there in crime, in the NER commitee have gone over and over
this many hours because nwe had real concerns about the rule center and
weve had many many meeetings weith commerce and secretary decker and i
can assure you that this bill and the intentions of this bill are good
for rural North carolina. We were worried that the Rural center would go
away and that the good things about the rural center would not be like
representative said in the various rural areas, everything would be back
in Rally. I can assure you that the mission of the prosperity zones is
to actually take commerce out of Raliegh and take commerce to work with
our individual rural areas and our urban areas also, and to make surtwe
that they are listening and that they are devoting the time they need to
to those areas and working on jobs specific to the areas. I herard the
commerce secretary talk many times and she is a brillkiant woman if you
just listen to her and her background, you will understand her compasion
for making sure that this does work. These prosperity zones are going to
working with our regional, our regional groups, those who want to stay
intact. Those who dont want to stay intact maybe some of there good
members would also like to participate in those prosperity zones, but i
do know that this should be a very very good thing for north carolina
and i hope you will support this. Things that needed to change in
commerce, commerce has not been reaching out to our rural areas and the
variety of jobs that are needed in a specific way in our areas. All of
us have different needs, its not a one size fits all state and secretary
decker and her team understand that and we are going to work hard with
her to make sure that these prosperity zones work, and the Rural areas
will be taken care of if thats been your concern.</p>

Representative Carney, please state your purpose.

To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the House.  I, too,
have great regard and praise for Secretary Decker. I've worked with her
in Charlotte on numerous projects. I'm having a little hesitation about
jumping into this new plan, which, although it has been vetted in
committee, the development of it has been, over the last few months, we
had competing bills in the Senate and the House, we had differences,
people didn't think we were ready for it, both sides of the aisle. I
just have concerns about the prematurity of this. I wish that we could
have had this bill and taken it a step further during the interim, and
come back with all the questions that are still out there. I have a
great concern, and I've raised this question in both committees that I'm
on where the bill came through.  And that is, in the dissolving of our
regional partnerships, we now are going to come back and say two or more
counties can join together and form their own Regional Economic
Development Commission, and they have to adhere to the same guidelines
in this bill.  But what I asked in both committees, and the Secretary
did say in the first committee, her response was -- and I'll tell you my
question is, when we move to a public-private partnership -- and by the
way, I support those for North Carolina; I've been on those study
committees, too, and in that effort -- but when we move in this
direction, and we're creating this non-profit oversight committee, my
concern is that competition down at the local level with two or more
counties forming their new Economic Development Commissions, the
competition for those private dollars, with those smaller groups, and
then the state going after those same private dollars.  I have a concern
there, and she said that was a good question, and that was a concern,
and that's something we have to work through.  I just wish that we could
wait... I know this is moving... I'm not sure where the votes are in
this chamber, but I do ask you to think about those things.  I have a
concern about changing the ?? zones, just... all-encompassing in this
one bill, how's that going to work.  I know we've had various answers
from... it depends on who you ask if that's going to be impacted. If you
have a project in one ?? office, is it going to be impacted?  The speed
of it, or... is that going to be impacted when those ?? zones are
changed?  And I know there are different answers for these, and that's
my point.  I just think there are too many unanswered questions. I think
Secretary Crisco did a great job in North Carolina when he was here and
I am convinced that Secretary Decker is going to do equally as great a
job, and hopefully a little better because we need to grow a little
better, but I think this plan needs to slow down just a little bit and
let's study it just a little further or develop it a little further
before we jump out there and move with it. And I really, regrettably,
and going to have to vote no today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wasn't going to speak, but I did have a few
comments on one of the committees, but... Last year, my county lost a
major project, and that project could have been in North Carolina, in my
county.  And I'm not just pushing my county, I'm pushing the whole
state.  We lost that project to Florence, South Carolina.  One of the
major reasons that is being credited that we lost that project is South
Carolina had a board in Columbia of department heads that could react
very quickly to put offers on the table to this corporation.  And this
corporation already had outlets and manufacturing facilities in North
Carolina and we had an empty industrial park where they were going to
go, and they went to Florence, South Carolina.  And I want to tell you,
we need more clout in Raleigh, not to compete from county to county, but
to compete for all the counties.  That Raleigh works for all the
counties, not one county competing against another one. So, again, we
need not just one or the other, we need all of the above.  We need to
give the...</p>

Speaker changes: Representative Wilkins please take your papers.
Speaker changes: To speak on the bill Mr. Speaker?
Speaker changes: To speak on the bill till it is amended?
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker: Our discussion so far has been
all over the map. Very good, very good [xx] .And I am going to try to
localize my comments. A concern that I have with the bill, I have been
through it several  times, I cannot find anywhere in the bill who does
marketing . Oh I can find is tourism marketing, I can find growth areas
and growth centers but I can’t find anything about who markets [noise](
Thank you Mr. Baker.), about who markets my little County? Your County
represented upon I can’t find it. The partnership approach has the key
and that key is marketing. The current partnerships do that function
that probably 90 of our one hundred counties couldn’t do if they had to;
I mean you could tell the folks in my county that they had to market
themselves to the industrial and business worlds next year, we couldn’t
do it. So I am concerned that I don’t see them marketing peace in that,
I don’t see responsibility for it. I am also concerned about that other
wording, growth centers, growth areas to me that smacks of the big
series and once again, [we have to sell our souls out?]
The way this bill is right now, I can’t support it and appreciate it or
recommend it to you .
Speaker changes: Representative  Davis please take your papers.
Speaker changes: To comment on the bill.
Speaker changes: xxx till the bill is amended.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
house, I had an opportunity this week to talk to the Governor and he
asked us, this House to support his reorganization of the commerce
department as well as his efforts to promote economic development in the
state by supporting this bill. I agree with what’s in the bill like
representative Arnold said no bill is perfect, we have to work on it, we
can make it better in the future. But I can’t support our Governor and
support his request that we do support him, and hope that he would do
the same and xx thank you.
Speaker changes: Representative Stone please take your papers.
Speaker changes:  To xx the bill.
Speaker changes:
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen I would
urge you to support this bill; and I’ll give you many reasons why. The
current policy or program we have is about a 5.0, this xxx about 10.2.So
we are headed in the right direction. Our men have concerns on some of
the incidents but at the same time can talk about a bill, this is for
North Carolina, and we have got to move forward and we have got
different avenues to try that out. The business community throughout the
states, the United States said they wanted something different. They
want a quicker answer, they want quicker turn around, they want direct
co-ops come in and do business quicker than we currently are,
If you live in a rural community like I do, you got a great reason to
vote for this bill because  you probably have property taxes or  on
unemployment. So  xxx are promising that they are doing  probably
everything  they could do. And talking to Secretary Baker she might want
to commitment. She said she would come to every community and talk to us
about how to better market, how to  better serve our communities with
commerce. So I think it’s very important to have that, that discussion
back home what we can do to better our communities. So I am looking
forward for her come talk to me in community directly. We have got to
find..</p>

new ways and to do things different in the state of North Carolina. No
one likes change, and it's very evident from the discussion in this room
today. But one other thing happened in discussion. She also assured us
that she'd come back to the Commerce committee here, and we'd talk about
the results. So it's great that we have people in the past that's
committed to doing things, but she's actually willing to come back and
talk about the results. And if we need to change it, we change it. But
doing things the same way expecting a different result is just not gonna
get us where we need to go in North Carolina. So I'd ask you to vote for
this bill, and let's move North Carolina in the twenty-second century.

House committee substitute to Senate Bill 127 on its second reading. All
in favor vote Aye. All opposed vote No. The Clerk will open the vote.

reading without objection --

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection having been raised, the bill remains on the
calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Re-referral of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, Senate Bill 337: NC Charter School
Advisory Board, may that bill be removed from the committee on Finance
and referred to the committee on Rules?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection having been raised.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I ask to be heard on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that the sponsors of the
bill have asked that this bill be moved. This is a bill that creates an
advisory board for the North Carolina Charter Schools in the state, and
I would ask the Members support it. And if I may be heard for an
additional motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move the previous question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have two motions before us, ladies and gentlemen.
The first motion is to effectively end debate on the motion to re-refer.
The question before the House is the motion to move the previous
question. All in favor vote Aye. All opposed vote No. The Clerk will
open the vote.
[PAUSE]
The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. Sixty-one having
voted in the affirmative, 49 in the negative, we now grant by rule three
minutes for the Minority Leader to speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I designate those three
minutes to Rep. Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Rep. Luebke is recognized for a period not to exceed
three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm going to refer simply here
to the process. I objected and simply wished to be able to raise my
objections. As you recall, Rep. Moore was able to make his speech about
the bill, wanting to move it to Finance. He said what he wanted to say.
My button was on, and I wanted to ask why the bill was being moved
there, why the bill would not be sent to Finance. I don't think that's
such a difficult question, but more importantly, without knowing what my
question is, why was there an attempt to call the question on the
debate? I simply do not understand why the process is so hurried, why
the process is not going through the normal processes. I simply wanted
to ask why was the bill no longer in Finance. Why was it being moved
from Finance? I think it's wrong when the power is used in such a way as
to prevent Members from even expressing or asking questions. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Stam is recognized for a period not to exceed
three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I hope this explanation
will satisfy Rep. Luebke, and I'll be short, so you can even ask me a
question. The intention when it goes to Rules is to remove a tiny, minor
provision that is the reason it went to Finance, about the tax exemption
allowing a tax exemption for the ownership of charter schools that are
maybe privately owned but [CUTS OFF]</p>

which would mean that it would not then have to go to finance again.

Representative Luebke, please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, the – just by explanation the chair has used
discretion actually by a rule on a motion, three minutes is not granted,
the chair did that, so that we could clear up the intent. This is also
being lax on the rules, but the chair will allow you to ask the
question, Representative Sam, if that’s your intention.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, that is my…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

finance committee, why we did not let the normal process go forward?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just that it’s June the 26th.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the house is the motion by Representative Moore for
the re-referral. All in favor of vote aye. All oppose vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 80
having voted affirmative, 35 in the negative, the motion passes. House
Bill 490, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Committee Substitute presented Bill 490, a bill to be entitled and
act to exclude custom software from property tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman Wayne, Representative Bell, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill of North Carolina ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We had a good debate on this, I believe it was
on, I'm trying to get my days together, I think it was Monday. It passed
this chamber in the second reading 95 to 8. I know many of the
stakeholders have been involved, have number of questions answered and
we ask for your support again today on the third reading. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Randolph, Representative
McNeill, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I ask the bill sponsor a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wayne yield to the gentleman from Randolph?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Having heard from a county in the interim, that they are opposed to
this, have you vetted this with the Association of County Commissioners
or the League of Municipalities and they have any objection to the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As far as we have and as far as I know, they were neutral to last I
heard, but I would ask you to just take a question to the senior finance
chair for clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Luebke,
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I want to just follow up with Representative
McNeill. My county is opposed to this also because of the revenue loss.
First calculations when I was able to ask them on Monday about this was
$1.7 million to $2 million. The County Commissioners are indeed neutral
on this, not because they don’t think it’s a bad idea, the County
Commissioners realized this is going to hurt many, many counties. At
last count, I spoke to County Commissioners today, at last count, 39
counties will lose revenue, that’s at a minimum. And my county as I said
was told that it would lose two, when I was told by a staff that
Forsyth, they'll lose 2.5. So there's lots of money involved here. And
remember when we vote for what seems like a little change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentleman from Rutherford, Representative Hager,
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to have Representative Luebke yield for question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll yield…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Durham yields to the gentleman from…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll yield when I'm finished, Mr. Speaker, thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He doesn’t yield at this time. The gentleman from Durham continues to
have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. As I said, a little thing like this seems like not much, but
if you check with your County Commissioners it has some impact on the
county budget. The consequence of this will be perhaps just a little
bit, but it will lead to an increase in the property tax. When you take
away revenue from one source, it’s got to be found in another place. And
overall, if you are not getting it here, you are going to have to raise
the property tax in order to provide the same level of services to your
constituents. So for those reasons I will urge you to vote against this
bill, it hurts your counties. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose…</p>

the bill is move forward without a thorough examination of all counties
that are affected because the County commissioners refining simply to
get the bill delayed by one year because otherwise would have a negative
impact right now on budgets that are being voted on this week so the
county commissioners do not support this bill. the only went neutral
because they were able to get the concession of not hurting the budgets
that are being voted on in our home counties right now. they got back in

County commissioners those are opposed to this in our education use the
word of the supper is also two million dollars. there's no provision on
how to make it up or provide us an opportunity also the way we just got
to debating and having a rewrite door a proposal on taxes and how they
would be collected in North Carolina and I don't know that this was
figured in what we thought about the impact on counties, but what I'm
really concerned about is that you and I do want to address that it was
stated that once the software is purchased by business and modified it
has no bag to anyone else other than the business will anything a
business buys and uses to improve his performance make it more efficient
and what it does increase of profit margins, etc. increases the value of
the business overall is certainly worth something to the business of the

whether it’s modify an equipment that you buy or other things I think to

look at one stake allows this practice to go forward and if they just
started this last year I would say that’s probably be some huge exciting
future they have but we don’t see that, they have been doing this for a
long time, we have been doing it a good while or both doing it wrong
because no one else is taking on the practice if this is something great
46, 47 states would do it. We have made huge changes to bring business
here to said an example that we want large manufactures, we want sulfur
producers, we want to come to North Carolina, we are open for business.
This is a modern change and I see we vote for this and move forward and
we are open for the business and we are supporting moving forward for
business, thank you again and support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentleman from Wayne from Representative Bell
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and Gentlemen this is pro-business bill this bill will actually
had one bill was fall into the house with a companion bill in the
Senate, this bill has been out here for three months been oppose fallen
two days between the second and third reading to get out a question
answered and our County Commissioners are neutral, this is a
pro-business bill and I urge you to vote green, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentleman from Randolph Representative Neil arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, the Representative bill tells me to redirect my question to Ms.
Howard. So, I redirect it to Ms. Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady from Davy Representative Howard yell to the gentleman form
Randolph?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, one of my questions Representative Bell was and I didn’t mean to
start all this debate but maybe I did but I haven’t heard from my county
and be an oppose to it, my question was what is the position of the
municipality or the County Commissioners or what this their position on
this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have consistently met with the County Commissioner Association and
they are not opposing the bill and as they said this morning about 11:30
I got that information reconfirmed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentleman from Iredell Representative Brawley
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize for taking up additional time but I would offer the
prospective based on comments made. This is not taking away at tax it is
in effect interpreting the way we think that tax should be applied. This
is the only property that I know of that is being taxed that has no
market value. Everything else we pay property tax is own it can has some
type of market value but this has no market value because the companies
cannot saw it and if we are gonna let the counties start taxing things
that have no market value some of you understand what I’m saying when I
say, “Relationships have some value but I don’t wanna be taxed on it as
being property.” That’s what customize sulfur same today, I urge you to
vote for this bill, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate? If not the question before the house
is the passage of Senate Bill 490 on its third reading. So, many as
favor the passage of the bill vote aye, those oppose will vote no, the
clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the
vote. 95 having voted in the affirmative and 21 in the negative, Senate
Bill 490 passes its third reading and will be sent to the Senate.

Senate Bill 132. The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 132, a bill to be entitled ‘An Act to Include
Instruction in the School Health Education Program on the Preventable
Causes of Preterm Birth Including Induced Abortion as a Cause of Preterm
Birth in Subsequent Pregnancies’. General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Stam, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, this is an
important bill with big consequences. It’s a unanimous recommendation
from the Child Fatality Task Force with an exception that was added by a
helpful amendment by I believe at the suggestion of Senator Josh Stein
in the Senate, and I’ll explain that in a little bit, and I would invite
the members of the house to look at the Senate vote and see how
bipartisan it was as it left the Senate. The section of the bill that
this amends is our sex education bill, where in line 98 we’re talking
about reproductive health and safety education programs in 7th grade.
Well one of the things we teach in line 28H is factually accurate
biological or pathological information related to the human reproductive
system. Well this bill proposes to amplify that in subsection I because
we have an epidemic of preterm birth in North Carolina. Now child
fatalities, infant mortality the way that’s measured has gone down
drastically in the last 15, 20 years since the Child Fatality Task Force
has been recommending one thing after another to reduce the death rate
if infants, but we still have a huge problem with preterm birth and we
need to do something about it. In the last session we passed the Women’s
Right to Know Bill, which requires at the point of an abortion that the
abortionists have to inform the patient of the problem of preterm birth
and the effect on subsequent pregnancy, but it occurred to many of us,
including the members of the task force, that it would also be
appropriate, maybe even more appropriate, to prevent this information
when it is most useful – that is before either a woman gets pregnant or
a man tries to get a woman pregnant, realizing that this may affect the
future health of their family, because preterm birth does more than just
have a small baby; it results in a lot of complications. You may be
familiar with some of them, but one of those is cerebral palsy and a lot
of others. Now there are other causes of preterm birth, and that us
smoking, alcohol consumption, use of illicit drugs and inadequate
prenatal care, and this was added in the Senate and I think is a very
helpful addition by the Senate because there’s more than one cause and
by listing all of these major causes, the teacher won’t forget to
mention one. You could potentially have a teacher who just believes that
smoking’s the greatest thing, so if you just said “We’re going to talk
about the causes of preterm birth,” that teacher might say “well I’m not
going to talk about smoking because they didn’t list it,” but by listing
the major causes, that will be in the curriculum. If you look at section
2 of the bill on page 2 – it’s not underlined – where will they get this
information? Are they going to get it from Representative Stam or are
they going to get it from Representative Blackwell? No. Actually, the
Division of Public Health of the Department of Health and Human Services
will provide this to DPI annually so that they have education materials
related to it. Now let me mention a couple things. The information about
this has been slowly gathering over the last 50 years, but it’s been in
the last 3 years that overwhelming statistical evidence has been
provided by statisticians through what’s called meta analysis – that is
where you collect a lot of studies and then analyze the studies of the
studies – and the conclusion is this: That one induced abortion raises
your risk of having a preterm birth by somewhere between 25 and 60
percent. That’s huge. A second one raises it around 93 percent. That’s
huge, and people considering this decision need to know that, and it
also has financial implications for the</p>

<p id="075:00">
back in 2008, and then they updated it to 2012, we had fiscal research
look at what the cost- if this research was accurate, and looking at
North Carolina statistics, looking at North Carolina population data,
what is the attributable risk to not doing this, and the conclusion was
about 120 additional infant deaths. I'm not talking about the unborn
child in the abortion, I'm talking about the infant death in the
subsequent pregnancy. About 120 additional and about 32 additional cases
of cerebral palsy per year costing us about $50 million a year. That's
what's at stake. Supporting the bill, coming to every meeting were three
experts with wonderful credentials from UNC school of medicine. I put on
your desks a letter from Dr. John Thorpe, the Hugh McAllister
distinguished professor of OBGYN, who's a division director of womens'
primary healthcare, and he explains the consistant relationship, that
it's still there after controlling for confounding factors, that there's
a dose response effect that is- and plus there's a plausible etiology.
So therefore he says it is scientifically accurate and appropriate to
educate young men and women about this modifiable consequence of the
termination of pregnancy.  We also had presented to us from Dr. Watson
Bowes, who is a professor of fetal and maternal medicine for decades at
Chapel Hill, and he got all the studies together comparing it to
smoking. We debated smoking in prior sessions many times when we were
talking about restaurants and whatnot, and it turns out that the
attributable risk differential between smoking and pre-term birth is
almost identical to the attributable risk between a prior induced
abortion and pre-term birth.
In other words, if you're concerned about women smoking  during
pregnancy and the effect that's going to have on their child, then you
need to be concerned about this because the risk differential, which he
says is the adjusted odds ratio, is virtually the same: 1.28 for induced
abortion and 1.25 for smoking. So the point is obvious. I'll conclude my
 remarks there, and - oh, one other thing and then I'll conclude. I
looked at all these amendments, and I think Rep. Jackson has a great
amendment that adds to the bill, and that's all I'll say about it if he
chooses to offer it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Rep. Jackson rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To offer an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The member may send forth his amendment, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is amendment AMK-40 v6. Rep. Jackson moves to amend the bill on
page 1, line 5 by rewriting the line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Jackson has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentleman this is a rather simple amendment, passage of this
amendment would require the same information, risk, and causes listed in
the bill, to be taught not only to public school children, but also in
charter schools, private schools, and home schools. You can follow along
with the amendment, but as you can see it's drafted under- each part is
underlined you'll see above it, it's drafted to be just like the
information's already being required for the same schools on cervical
cancer, HPV and vaccines. And we just copied the language exactly like
that. Last night I got an email from someone at North Carolina right to
life, and in it was two quotes that I wanted to read to the body. It
said, &quot;If young women do not get this information in the health
curriculum in our schools, they might not otherwise learn about the ways
to prevent pre-term birth until it's too late.&quot; And then she
concluded her email with, &quot;This education information has the
potential of sparing many mothers and their children from the
devastating experiences of pre-term birth.
And if you believe that to be true, I would ask why you would only
require it in the public schools, why not require it of all
schoolchildren, whether they got to public school, private school,
charter school. And I think that if this bill is really about education
then we can all support this amendment. I'd ask your support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I agree with the spirit of the amendment but I have a problem with the
idea of the state requiring something in home schools. We did not
control our home schools, home schools exist in large measure to avoid
state control and so I’m just little uncomfortable with requiring
something in the home school and that’s the only point I have with the
amendment, thank you.

Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentleman from Wake Representative Stam arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, I redirect my support for the amendment I think Representative
Jackson has amendment rights but I think if he explains more accurately
even Representative Larry Pittman will vote for. The amendment doesn’t
require anything to be taught in the home schools, it requires the
information to be available at the division in non-public education on
their website. So, home schools can dial and get it if they want it.

Is there further discussion or further debate on the amendment?

Mr. Speaker…

What purpose does the lady from Guilford Representative Adams arise?

Thank you Mr. Speaker, a question for Representative Jackson.

Does the gentleman from Wake yell to the lady from Gilford?

I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.

Thank you, I think Representative Stam probably just talk and to support
it but I wanna clarify, I want you to clarify for me you remember there
was another part of the curriculum for health education, sex education
the matter of fact comprehensive support that’s not what this is but if
that’s not going to be provided for home schools and other schools I
mean I might support it if everything else in terms of the other
comprehensive aspect was included but your amendment doesn’t do that,
does it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to respond to the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill, my amendment would require that Charter Schools provide this
information to students. Public schools and home schools would be
provided the information this is the same setup as we setup years ago
for cervical___[02:21] camps or HPD vaccine information, it’s identical
language what we are requiring for home schools now to provide that
information then we would provide in with this new information, it would
not require that the parent teach child in the home school if that’s
what your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do any members desire for other debate on the amendment if you would
please ask? Seeing none, the question before the house is the adoption
of amendment 1 to Senate Bill 132 on its second reading. I give members
a few moments to get back to their seats. The question before the house
again is the passage of amendment 1 to Senate Bill 132. So, many as
favor the passage of the amendment will vote aye, those oppose will vote

<p id="085:00">
&lt;h3&gt;I looked at it, and I have a number of issues with it. First
of all, you need to know, that the taskforce was not unanimous in this
vote. I've had a chance to look at the minutes of November 14th, when
the taskforce met, and the recommendation that they made is more about
providing information about risks and this Bill actually uses the term
causes there, so that creates somewhat of a problem for me. We want to
make sure that we give accurate information to use. This information in
this curriculum, is provided to youngsters who are in middle school.
That means they're 7th, 8th, 6th, 7th, and 8th graders, that's 11 years
old 12 years old 13 years old. And I don't think we want to be teaching
them, I don't think you want to be trying to teach them about abortion.
But I will say that this Bill is really designed to stigmatize that to
stigmatize abortion. That is listed in this Bill and as a result Mr.
Speaker and the concerns I have, I do want to send forth an amendment
like it read at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will read the Adams amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is the amendment ATA-93. Representative Adams moves to amend the
Bill on page 1 lines 3-5 by rewriting the lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, basically, as I've said, this last part of the
Bill gives a list of causes. And one of those causes listed is abortion,
and in my opinion, we're trying to stigmatize abortion. It has already
been said that there are many other things that may concern births that
are not even listed here. So it just seems to me that what this
amendment would do would remove the listing of those causes as have been
identified here, and it would simply end, it would just say that it
would teach about preventable causes of pre-term birth and not list or
identify those that we have no scientific evidence to prove that. So,
that's what the amendment will do. And I would ask for your support and
I move adoption of it, Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from ?? Representative Schaffer rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen I rise to oppose this
amendment. What we have before this in the larger Bill is an attempt to
educate our students on what they can do to be healthy. I mean this is
part of the health curriculum education. What Representative Adams has
suggested is that there is no indication, that there is no indication
that there is scientific evidence to suggest this. That is quite not the
case. We have already seen information from Dr. Thorpe indicating that
there is a causal connection between termination of pregnancy and
pre-term birth. What I have placed a handout at each of your desks that
contains basic informed consent language from different women's clinics
and I'll draw your attention to the section risk of abortion for family
reproductive health risk of abortion. One of the things that people
going into abortion clinic must sign off on , one of the things that a
doctor must inform a patient of, is this issue here of cervical
incompetence. I understand that abortion procedure or related abortion
procedures may result in cervical incompetency, which means that I may
have problems maintaining a pregnancy in the future, possible
miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, premature delivery, or other
complications in the pregnancy. Again, this is about educating our
students, this is information that patients coming into an abortion
clinic must receive, I see no reason why we should not be informing our
students of this information. There is scientific to this, doctors
inform their patients of this, so I would urge members to oppose the
amendment and support the Bill. Thank you.

But one of the things that struggles me, and we've done it on the
Republican side of the aisle, we've formed a regulatory reform committee
to do away with bills that were so specific they became outdated.  My
concern here is not whether or not any of these items does or does not
cause these problems.  that's not my issue, that's not what I'm
debating.  What I'm saying is we shouldn't make an amendment so specific
that every 2 years we come back and fix it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Union,
Representative Arp rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To see if the gentleman would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentleman from Mecklenburg yield for a
question from the gentleman from Union?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'd be happy to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Jeter, the way I read the item in
question, it says teaches about preventable causes of pre-teen birth and
subsequent presses, including abortion, smoking, alcohol consumption,
the use of illicit.  In your reading, is that an exhaustive list, or
more of an open list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]In my 5 months in this chamber, if we don't list it
then they don't teach it.  If we don't say it, it doesn't happen.  So in
my opinion, it may be contrary to you Representative Arp, that is an
exhaustive list.  That's exactly what DPI will do, and that's the only
thing on the list.  Maybe I'm wrong, probably am wrong, wrong a lot, but
I ask the body to look at the next paragraph.  The next paragraph says
'materials used in this instruction shall be age appropriate for use
with students, information conveyed during the instruction shall be
objective and based upon scientific research that is peer reviewed and
accepted by professionals and credentialed experts in the field of
sexual health education.'  If everything that is said here is true,
everything that we talked about here will be taught.  Everything.
There's not one thing that this motion eliminates being taught in our
schools.  Not one thing.  All it does is allow a bill to live with
medicine.  I'll give you a prime example.  When I was growing up, or
when I was born, if you took powerful cold medicine, it could cause
problems.  That's not in this.  We know for sure that's a preventable
cause, it's not listed.  It says illicit drugs, it doesn't say powerful
prescription drugs.  We know that's a cause, why didn't we list that?
If we're trying to make sure people make safe decisions, and we're
trying to attack and eliminate these problems, then let's do it.   And
let's teach anything that's scientific, regardless of what it is.  Let's
not make this singularly about abortion.  Let's make this about what the
issue is, which is trying to make sure that our children are born
healthy and safe.  If there's scientific evidence that says one thing
over another, fine.  I'm not smart enough to know what that is, but
let's not write a bill so specific that we've got to come back every 2
years and find out what the new definition is.  Because we created a
brand new committee to eliminate just that.

vote no if you believe there is not scientific evidence for this, if you
think the Child Fatality Task Force just makes things up, if you think
these professors just make things up, vote no, but vote yes on the
amendment.  As far as my friend Representative Jeter's argument, he
wants you to vote yes, but his words tell you to vote no, and here are
his words, 'If we don't list it, they won't teach it.'</p>

If we don't list it, they won't teach it. Please vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the lady from Chattam representative McManis rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If that's the case do we need to list prescription drugs, diabetes,
obesity, previous preterm births, poor nutrition, in vitro of
fertilization, multiple infections, previous miscarriages, physical
injury, high blood pressure, all these other things because those are
all factors that we know contribute to the likelihood of preterm birth.
I think the amendment makes perfect sense because we are not listing
every single factor. If we want them to teach every single factor and
the only way they're going to teach it is to list it, then we need to
list all of these things. I think Representative Juder is exactly right.
As we get new knowledge...even the study that's been cited most
frequently in support of adding this is a relatively new study. I think
it came out in 2012. As we get new information, this is going to change.
It's going to change maybe every year as to what we know contributes to
preterm birth. And I think causes is a bad word. I know as a physician
my husband would never tell a patient cigarettes will cause you to have
cancer. He will say cigarettes will increase your risk of cancer. But
he's not going to tell you it will cause it. Because we don't have
absolute causal relationships there. Nor do we with the abortions. We
have relationships, but not causal. So I think we have to be very
careful how we phrase that. But if we're going to say the things that
contribute we need to list every single one of them. I support the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Speaker. With what purpose does the gentlemen from Wake
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the lady yield for a very quick question
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady from Chattam yield to a question from the gentleman from
Wake
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes I do
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you realize that the surgeon general's warning on every fourth pack
of cigarettes says smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I realize it does. But I also know that physicians are very careful
about telling you what will be caused. And it's like there is the
occasional physician that will say this gives you six months to live.
But most physicians very much avoid doing that. They don't go out on
that limb. And the surgeon general may say that but most physicians will
not. And even with this data is does not show causal relationship. It
shows a relationship of increased frequency but not cause.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentlemen from Randalf representative McNeil rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to point out that some of these diseases that
representative mentioned doesn't have a thing to do with these because
the things that this bill talks are things of personal choice such as
alcohol, illegal drugs, and abortions. I know nobody's going to choose
to have high blood pressure or diabetes or stuff like that. People can't
help health conditions. But they can help making bad personal choices.
And thats what this bill deals with. It deals with the bad personal
choices that a person makes and it lists five of them that will cause
this problem. Not...we shouldn't list high blood pressure and things
that people do not choose to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the lady from Chattam representative McManis rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment for a second time. Many of these things...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Things like obesity is preventable. Diabetes is treatable. High blood
pressure is treatable. Poor nutrition except in extreme poverty is
usually something that's preventable. These are things that can be
preventable. They're not things that you choose to have but they are
definitely something that you can treat and not have to suffer the
impact on a pregnancy from those things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the lady from, excuse me the gentleman from Cumberland
representative Glazier rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. To debate the amendment briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

amendment. I have comments for the bill. But with all due respect my
friend and colleague representative McNeil I really couldn't let...</p>

That go on challenge them and there are and I agree choices for a lot of
those things that are listed as opposed other things that may not be but
to say that abortion would include that in your list of bad choices
suggest that in so many cases there are a real choice and in many
they're not and I just rise to not want to paint that across the broad
brush and I say that as a result of lots of things but if you haven't
read it every one of this chamber ought to read an editorial that was a
New York Times last week my woman from Seattle who was a professional
from both she and her husband Catholic she was 38 years old and she rose
to talk about exactly the issue you raise represent and that issue
related to the fact that she had struggled to get pregnant she her
husband may have a child they decided they wanted to have a second and
so they continued fertility drugs and she got pregnant with twins they
were related one of the twins at the 20 weeks determined based on
testing and in a follow-up MRI that all of their her his organs were
pushed up against his chest in the long was not developing and they
struggled as Catholics trying to figure out what to do in the end it up
after the MRI confirmed that she talked the doctors that if that it was
her son is the daughter the other fetus was fine if that son was to be
born it would be gasping for breath probably not live more than 24 hours
maybe a little more on a ventilator suffering the entire time she said
the day before the 23 week limit when it in I think it was at that time
either New York or another state that they since moved to Seattle that
they struggled and cried and cried and she chose to abort the male
because she said I did not viewed it as them as killing or making a bad
choice for that fetus I viewed it as saving my son from hours of nothing
but pain and so he died in my womb knowing that he was loved in the
places he was conceived by his parents she said if you call that a
choice that was the choice we had to make so I don't want us casting
this debate is I don't think it's the issue over whether that's good
choices or bad choices people make there are abortions made for
thousands of choices in the most impersonal and intense ways and and I
just hope that we don't go that route so thank you[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you very much. the speaker list them. this is what I learned in my
first term is a nothing but a feel-good bill et al., but doesn't
actually do anything. the lady from Chatham zoning talk about a lot of
causes or correlations for pre term birth are not mentioned in this bill
and I'll mention some of those also talk about some that are
specifically enumerated in the bill in its current form. one risk
associated with pre term birth. one risk factor an interval of less than
six months between pregnancies. another thing, poor nutrition,diabetes,
obesity, if this body were seriously committed to not just talking about
the problem, and one particular aspect that may or may not be part of
the problem together, Democrat and Republican, and I am certain we could
find a way to seriously reduce the number of pre term birth, the North
Carolina boy that look like well with regard to an interval of six
months or less between pregnancies, contraception, including, of course,
within a committed relationship, made relationship with the debate and
in any sort of pre term births associated with that respect smoking.
well, we could make some serious progress in smoking cessation and if
you look at the literature, and this is come up in the body of these
folks have been here for a few terms are familiar with this. there are
studies that show a risk between pre term birth and exposure to second
hand smoke. what might this body due to reduce exposure to second hand
smoke, poor nutrition. this body has the power to address poor nutrition
amongst mothers of childbearing age in the state and I'd say that both
parties under both parties control. we are not yet met the standard. we
need to in that area and and let me I think are correct. my friend for
Randolph County in talking about diabetes at least type two diabetes can
be the risk can be reduced obesity is a risk factor. if you can reduce
obesity. you can make a dent in type two diabetes, and then let's talk
about obesity. as you draw our state obesity in and of itself, separate
from diabetes. that does seem to be a recurring theme here to recurring
theme in the state. yet when this body over the years is attempted to do
something about childhood obesity, which I think it's safe to say could
lead to adulthood obesity and obesity in expectant mothers when we
thought it is up and walked out that we get accused of trying to run a
nanny state, so we could get together and do something about pre term
births if we really wanted to him us. it just talks and it doesn't just
talk and talk to scare women, both young and old in the decisions they
make about their body cannot urge you to vote against it. what purpose

Cervical pretreatment as a method to avoid complications associated with
preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies following abortion. Women who
have had an abortion are no longer at an increased risk for preterm
birth in subsequent pregnancies, and it may be time to adjust counseling
guidelines accordingly, a studies has shown. I'm quoting from the
Internal Medicine News, a digital magazine. The report came out on March
7, 2013. The report states that, &quot;We think the reason why there has
been a loss of association between previous abortion and preterm birth
is because of the changes in the abortion practice. There are no longer
surgical abortions without cervical preparation, and that was the
driving association all along.&quot; So what my amendment does is
further educates children-- women, specifically-- who are giving
consideration to an abortion to prompt them to ask questions of their
physician as to whether or not they are being pretreated in such a way
that will prevent future preterm deliveries. I'll be happy to answer any
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment? For what purpose
does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES}
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would ask you to oppose the amendment. As recently as about three
years ago when the Shaw medicine analysis came out in the British
Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the editor of that journal said,
after explaining the increased risk of preterm birth with induced
abortion, &quot;However, the finding that even one termination can
increase the risk of preterm birth means that we should continue to
search for ways of making termination less traumatic, such as cervical
preparation with agents such as prostaglandins or laminaria tents.
&quot; So, you have a possible way of doing this that may, in the
future, reduce it, but what she is asking is that we teach seventh
graders that it's actually done. And that's just not the case. And that
has not been shown, like in the studies I've mentioned, through 122
studies and lots of meta-analysis. And I will remind you that Section 2
of the bill does say that the Division of Public Health will provide
these materials annually, so that, if sometime in the future this
becomes real, then they can amend their materials.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I ask you to oppose the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question from the lady from
Guilford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, you don't know if they even have it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, they're not required to have until 60 days after the bill passes,
so I doubt if they do. I would be surprised if they did. But, 60 days,
they have 60 days.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to speak a second time, maybe not now.

...journal, articles by a PhD student, not a researcher in the field of
OB/GYN and it certainly is not recognized as a settled science at this
point, I think there may be validity to this as a way of reducing the
instances of preterm birth in multiple abortion patients. However, again
as I said, it's not settled science, and also the amendment says,
“...shall include information as a method to avoid complications
associated with preterm health – birth,” rather. “A method to avoid
complications,” implies it's settled, and there's really no question
about the situation. I just don't think that's true. Therefore, I oppose
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from... for what
purpose does the lady from New Hanover, Representative Hamilton, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it's notable that this was, these findings
were given at a medical conference as recently as 2013. and I appreciate
Dr Fulghum's acknowledgment that there is validity to the use of preterm
cervix treatment that would reduce the potential for preterm birth or
preterm delivery later on in life. I think it's notable that there were
over 400,000 women studied between 1992 and 2008, and those who had
previous induced abortion had a significant increase in spontaneous
preterm birth. However, more detailed analysis over a stratified period
of time showed that the association weakened and disappeared altogether
by the year 2000. The trend coincided with a shift toward the use of
abortion practices less likely to injure the cervix, a sharp decrease to
almost zero in surgical abortions performed without cervical
pretreatment. So, there seems to be obvious correlation between the
pretreatment of the cervix prior to induced abortion, and I think that's
something our children would benefit from knowing, if they so choose to
follow through with this kind of procedure. I urge your adoption of the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lucas, does the gentleman wish to
debate the amendment or the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And Representative Glazier, the amendment or the bill?
Further discussion or further debate on the amendment? Seeing none, the
question before the House is the adoption of amendment A3, sent forth by
Representative Hamilton to the Senate Committee Substitute for Senate
Bill 132. So as many as favor the adoption of the amendment will vote
aye. Those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk
will lock the machine, and record the vote. 39 having voted in the
affirmative and 76 having voted in the negative, the amendment fails.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Floyd, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr Speaker, inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman mentioned that he knows about trucking,
and I'm trying to get some thoughts about this bill. Is there any way
that we can have the amendments come, and then those who want to debate
the bill? Because we get into the debate of the bill, then we get into
the amend of the bill, and I have to go and sort of dissect all of this.
So is it in any way possible that the Chair can allow the amendments to
come forward and then the debate to occur?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that's what we're doing, but some of the
debate's going so long on the amendments, it might seem that we're
debating the bill. But with that being said, I believe there's an
amendment being offered by Representative Farmer-Butterfield. For what
purpose does the lady from Wilson, Representative Farmer-Butterfield,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have apparently two amendments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Which amendment does the member wish to send forth?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] S132ATK-94 v1
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That amendment was withdrawn. We'll move on to
another. If you'll come forward and see the clerk, we'll determine which
amendment and we'll come back to it. For what purpose does the gentleman
from Cumberland, Representative Lucas, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I have
sat here for quite some time now, I guess better than an hour, as we've

and it seems like we as legislators, or at least some of us, seem to
have an insatiable appetite to delve into the reproductive and the
family circumstances that ought to be a private matter. Coming from my
religious background i was instructed that a family, the family, should
be the first social institution, and here we are discussing things that
ought to be discussed in private family circumstances. All of this
chronological exercise, I don't need an expert delving into not just
sexual activity but were delving into not first term abortions. Were
delving into second and subsequent term abortions, and were saying that
this is appropriate for seventh grade students. Sixth and seventh grade
students, i don't want my sixth and seventh grade students learn about
second and subsequent term abortions. Maybe high school or college ought
to be learning about that, but i think our sixth grade students would do
well to stick with the first segment of this instruction. We talk about
abstinence, im fine with that, but evidently you don't believe that
abstinence is sufficient,. because your now going beyond abstinence,
your saying you don't believe in your curriculum, your saying that it
doesn't work, your saying that students need to know about abortions,
not the first time, but second and third times, and what the
consequences of this would be. This is for adults as far as i can see,
again i don't want this talked to sixth and seventh grade students, your
WAY out of line here. And i don't know if your going to vote that way i
guess you will, but i hope you will examine your conscious if your doing
that, because this has no business in middle school grade curricular. I

(SPEAKER CHANGES)Ladies and gentleman , with all do respect for my
colleague who just stood eloquently as he always does, spoke about he
does not want the, doesn't think we should be informing kids that are
middle school children to, get the facts so do speak, as it relates to
abortion and re productivity, and so on and so forth. I would like to
share with you a story that was shared with me, which would refute
respectfully what my colleague just said on the floor. I talked recently
with a anesthesiologist who was called into our local hospital to
deliver a baby, he was going to administer the anesthesia, i guess it
was need to deliver this child. When he arrive laying on the table was a
13 year old African american girl who was pregnant. It didn't have to be
an African america girl, it could have been a white girl, but in this
particular case the girl was African american, And he was very very
disturbed, he said to the mother and the grandmother who were there,
&quot;How does this happen?&quot;. And the reply was &quot;well how does
this happen, you know how it happens.&quot; And he said &quot;well
yeh...&quot;</p>

<p id="130:00">
Yes, I know how it happens, but how does this happen? How does this girl
who was 13 years old, why did she become pregnant? And the reply almost
in unison, from the mother and grandmother was &quot;that's her
job.&quot; She is not only going to have this baby, but she's going to
continue having babies. Now, there are many, many victims in this
scenerio and often lost in the argument is the fact that the biggest
victim is the 13 year old girl. What kind of a life is she in store for?
What kind of freedoms is she going to have? Perhaps, had she been
exposed to, what we're trying to do here in this legislation, perhaps
she might have been able to resist because she had knowledge. But then
again, perhaps she may not have been able to resist. The fact of the
matter is, and I share these comments with you today, not to point
fingers at anybody. I know I had a lot of instances in my high school
career where girls went away for a year or so to visit with their aunt
in some distant location, only to reappear again the next year. And
knowing now that obviously what happened then was, they went away and
they had a child very often. But my point is this, that the more
knowledge these young people have, the better. None of us in this
chamber, I can't believe there's any of us in this chamber that want to
see what that anesthesiologist had to witness on that day. So, it
happens, girls are getting pregnant at younger and younger ages. A lot
of times they don't even have an opinion, they might in fact think this
is their job. Well, it's not their job. This is a life, this is someone
who deserves an opportunity and a chance and I would like to think that
a lot of the things we've done in this legislation this session, are
going to be able to provide these youngsters with opportunies and a
chance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do not.

gentleman does not yield at this time. The gentleman from Chowan
continues to have the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So,
again, our job is to see to it that the children, to see to it that all
of our citizens are armed with the information that they need and
certainly the young and the most vulnerable among us should be provided
with that. So I think this is an attempt on this particular bill to do
that. And with that I will conclude my remarks and I will respectively
take the question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman
from Scotland rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask the gentleman a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Chowan yield to the gentleman
from Scotland? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
representative. You made a couple statements that I understand, you
explained your way through them. But I'm interested in this issue when
you talk about &quot;it's her job&quot;, I hear some code in there that
I really don't like, what do you mean when you say, they said it's her
job? I can't get my hand wrapped around &quot;it's her job.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I will try to let you get your hands wrapped it
sir, as best I can. And that is, that is the response that was given by
the mother and the grandmother to the doctor. Why they gave that that
response, I have no idea. You'd have to ask them. But there's no code
here, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, another question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to a second question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a
friendly question, not trying to upset you with it. But I mean, it's
just strange to me that you made the point that it was a afican american
female, you could have just said. What does color have to do with
anything? You could have just said that it was a young teenager or young
lady, why was that so important for you to make that statement? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I was trying to describe the situation as it occured and when
I, as a salesperson, when I get up</p>

for what purpose does the gentleman from ardell representative broly
rise
speaker changes
point of order
speaker changes
the gentleman may state his point of order
speaker changes
does the question have any relevance to the issue before us?
speaker changes
the chair would take the gentlemans point under advisement and would
encourage the members to try and limit the debate to the relevant issues
of the bill, the chairs tried to give some wide latitude, but does see
the possiblility of these questions going a little far from the debate
on the actual bill, the gentleman (inaudible) does have the floor to
respond to questions, if he desires to do so
speaker changes
I believe that I have responeded to the questions at hand, I believe the
next question that could be addressed is one in which, will be a similar
vain, so Ive answered the question and will be entertaining no further,
representative with all due respect.
speaker changes
for what purpose does the lady from wilson, representative farmer
butterfield rise
speaker changes
to send forth an ammendment
speaker changes
which we're in possestion of the ammendment, the court will read the
ammendment
speaker changes
this is ammendment atk-95b1 representative farmer-butterfield moves to
ammend the bill on page 1 lines 3-5 by rewriting the lines to read.
speaker changes
the lady from wilson is recognized to debate the ammendment
speaker changes
thankyou mr speaker, on lines 3 through 5 page 1, we would rewrite it
by, reading program on the potential risk factors contributing to
preterm birth and we would further ammend the bill on page 1 lines 30
through 32, by rewriting it to read, teacher about the potential risk
factors contributing to preterm birth, page 2 line 6-8 by rewriting the
lines to read, educational materials with the most current informatiuon
available about the potential risk factors contributing to preterm birth
and finally it would ammend ammendment 1 introduced and passed for
representative jackson, by deleting the phrase preventable cause of
preterm birth and subsequant pregnancies including induced abortions,
smoking, alchohol consumtion, the use of ilicit drugs and inadequate
prenatal care, every time it occurs and substituting the phrase
potential risk factors contributing to preterm birth, Id like to speak
on the ammendment
speaker changes
the lady continues to have the floor to debate her ammendment
speaker changes
thankyou mr speaker, as representative adams said earlier today, not a
single respected health organization nor professional medical
association, recognizes a causal link between legal abortion and preterm
births, none of these organizations recognize this, the position of the
group, by these groups is in direct contradiction of existing statutory
language in the bill on page 1 line 33 as follows, materials used in
this instruction shall be age appropriate for use with students,
information conveyed during the instruction shall be objective and based
on scientific research that is peer reviewed and accepted by
professionals and credintialed experts in the field of sex health
education</p>

Health information provided to students must be true, the language in my
amendment ensures that this is the case as well as it puts teachers and
the Department of Public Instructions in an acceptable position of not
violating the law that requires information to be accepted by
professionals and experts. Where it mean something there is a big
difference between cause and risk, by the definition of cause an effect,
the cause must always be present if the effect is to occur, the cause of
something leave something leave something little uncertainty of the
connection I repeat the cause of something leave little uncertainty of
the connection, a definition a risk factor on the other hand is a
condition, substance or behavior that has not been proven to cause an
event or disease. So, a cause is a definitive reason for something and a
risk is a possible reason for something to occur or happen. Every time
we walk into an intersection to cross the street, we take on risk if a
car hits us we know that injury suffered or cause by the car. So, I ask
that you give this amendment a favorable vote of yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake Representative Stam arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment and then to make motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, the gentleman is Representative to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker and members of the house I know that that very first
amendment changes the type so we will be back on the floor tomorrow.
Representative Farmer Butterfield has given a lengthy explanation I will
give a short explanation of why I oppose to the amendment and then after
that if allowed I move the previous question and move the table and then
move to previous question on the debate, I’m very judicious on that I
don’t think I have done it more than once in my career but we do have
another day tomorrow and we are ploughing the same ground over and over.
For an amendment first of all the second part of it is essentially the
Representative Adam’s amendment which is already been defeat, secondly
the potential she says the potential that’s what she adds in her
potential risk factors and I can just imagine if the sergeant general
instead of saying, “Smoking causes lung cancer”, if he was to say,
“Smoking potentially might cause lung cancer.” And if you will remember
the studies on smoking and pre-term birth and prior reduced abortion are
virtually identical. In other words, it is a risk factor, it’s a cause
factor, it’s not a potential risk factor it is a potential risk or cause
factor. As Dr. ___[03:14] explained the difference between risk and
cause is immaterial but teenagers understand cause much more they
understand risk. And Mr. Speaker at that point I would like to make
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may stay his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To table the amendment, on the table for second…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion has been made by the gentleman from Wake that the amendment
does lie upon the table and will seconded by the gentleman from Stanley.
The motion is non-debatable. The question before the house is the motion
to that the amendment number 4 sent forward by Representative Farmer
Butterfield do lie upon the table. So, many as favor the motion to table
will vote aye, those oppose will vote no, the clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote, 72 having voted in
the affirmative and 43 in the negative the motion is adopted and the
amendment does lie upon the table.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake Representative Stam arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To state motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move the previous question on the adoption of Senate Bill 132 on its
second reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Wake has moved the previous question as to Senate
Bill 132. So, many as favor, the call for the previous question will
vote aye, those oppose will vote no, the clerk will open the vote.

The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 75 having voted in
the affirmative and 42 in the negative, the motion for the previous
question has been adopted and we will now move to a vote on the bill.
However, prior to taking the vote, three minutes will be allowed for the
minority leader and the majority leader or their respective designees to
offer a closing statement. Representative Paul, does the gentleman wish
to speak on behalf of the minority caucus? [speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I designate Representative Glazier to speak on
behalf of the Minority Caucus. [Speaker changes]
The gentleman from Cumberland is recognized to offer the three minute
statement on behalf of the minority party [speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Paul. For a variety of
reasons that my colleagues have eloquently articulated, we ought to not
be doing this. But let me add several closing ones.
First, wherever you are on the medical science here, the one thing this
debate has assuredly made clear is that it is completely at odds with
each other. There is no definitive medical science here, particularly on
cause, let alone on risk. And the medical science, if you read all the
journals, also divides out on whether it is a surgical abortion or
whether it is a medical, medicinal abortion induced and the result. So
in the end, we've got to remember the bill that we are amending, or the
statute.  It is the comprehensive sexuality education statute that for
the first five paragraphs talks about information that should be given
to seventh graders. And so at a minimum, we ought to have a standard
that the stuff we are going to teach in the public schools have some
consensus in medical science. Again, one thing that is clear, wherever
you fall on  this, is that there is no consensus in the medical science.
And we ought not be putting in statute this requirement that suggests to
our children there is.
Secondly, words do matter. Representative Alma Adams said this the other
day, and she was right. And Representative Jean Farmer-Butterfield did,
there is a big difference between risk and cause. I know, because they
teach it all the time. And there are hundreds of lawsuits tossed a year,
because they don't meet cause, even though there is evidence of risk. So
at least if we're going to do this, we ought to get the word right.
And finally, the third reason -- my wife. Well, elementary kids are
God's face of knowledge, I mean, love. And high school kids are God's
face of knowledge. Middle school kids represent God's sense of humor.
And they ask lots of questions. And if we're going to now teach them
about abortion, I guarantee you that every seventh grader is going to
come home, and mom's going to say, &quot;Craig, what'd you learn in
school today?&quot; &quot;All about abortion, Mom&quot;  And I find it,
and I think our Caucus finds it that Alanis Morissette may have had it
right.  Isn't it ironic, don't you think?  So, incredibly ironic that
the group in our Chamber who's so fervently opposes the discussion or
wanting to deal with the issue of abortion, and I understand that, is
now putting in the statute that every seventh grader as part of their
curriculum, will be taught everything they need to know and a lot a more
that they don't about the issue of abortion.  And all the rest of sex
education will go by the boards, because I guarantee you this is the
question they're going to come home to mom and dad with. And when they
say why, we're going to point across the aisle and say, &quot;You're the
reason that every child now knows about all of the issues regarding
abortion&quot;
[Speaker changes]
The gentleman's three minutes have been exhausted. Representative
Starnes, does the gentleman wish to offer the closing statement on
behalf of the majority party? [Speaker changes]
I do. [Speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to offer that. [Speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Health. What we're
dealing with is giving young people information they need to make an
intelligence decision. That's what sex education is all about. Our
teenagers need to understand that when they make a decision, there is a
consequence. If they choose to have an abortion, that there may be an
additional consequence that will plague them or haunt them somewhere
further down the road in their life. I think this is a good bill. It
just informs the children or the teenagers or the public  of what their
actions will happen.  Thank you. [Speaker changes]

second reading. As many as favor the passage of the bill will vote 'Aye'
