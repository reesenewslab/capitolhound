<p id="00:00">
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning everybody, thank you for coming. We’re
here to announce after a, what I consider to be a transparent
deliberative process that’s involved a number of meetings and hearings,
I'll talk about it in a minute, that we are prepared to file the bill
for voter ID. It will be filed today. The process that we’ve gone
through, we’ve had three public hearings, we've had hours of testimony,
we have had over 100 citizens speak at at least one event, there have
been several expert witnesses, a number of people have come together to
try and give us insights into what this bill should look like. And I
think you will see that it's very different from the bill that was
passed last year. Its tried to take into account a number of concerns
that were raised, and I think its technically a better bill, and a bill
that we are very confident will withstand any challenge that may come to
us in the way of the courts. The main reason were are doing this bill,
well first off, the citizens of North Carolina want some form of voter
ID legislation. Three out of four people in the state of North Carolina
consistently say that this is something that they believe is
appropriate, and something that they would like to have, that I believe
really does restore a lot of the confidence in voting outcomes. One of
the key reasons we are doing in. We’ll take questions after the primary
bill sponsors come before you and make comments on certain aspects of
the bill, the process and the bill itself. We’re going to begin with
Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and good morning to all of you
and thank you for your time today. What our intent is to today is to ask
the primary bill sponsors of the bill to go through the various parts of
the bill and to explain that to you, and then we will also address the
process that we intend to follow from this point forward to make sure
the bill is heard and viewed and folks have a chance to offer their
continued input on the bill, and then I’ll come back up and we’ll
address whatever inquiries you have. So, with that, Representative
Murray.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Chairmen Lewis, My name is Tom Murray,
Representative here in Wake County. I’m going to talk about the strict
photo ID portion of the legislation as well as improvements to the
provisional ballot process and the absentee voting process. Those are
three pieces of the bill to help improve integrity. We are going to
allow for multiple forms of state issued IDs, including g drivers
licenses, non operators license, student IDs from state institutions,
employee IDs for state employees, travel cards. We’re also going to be
developing a statewide database, so if an individual shows up without
one of those photo IDs, but their photo is in a statewide database, then
the elections official can look that individual up. We have special
considerations for voters over the age of 70, as well as persons with
disabilities. We have special considerations for those individuals as
well. If you don’t have a photo ID, you’ll be allowed to vote a
provisional ballot, and come back to the board of elections with a photo
ID to get that vote counted. We are also going to allow for free photo
IDs for folks that have financial hardships, as well as if you need a
free birth certificate in order to prove who you are to get that photo
ID, we are going to allow for that as well. We are trying to take in
consideration people with financial hardships as well. From an absentee
ballot perspective, we are going to develop an official form for
absentee ballot requests. The voter themselves can ask for that can fill
out that form, a guardian can fill out that form, or a near relative can
help them fill out that form. You have to put your drivers license or
last four digits of your social on that form to be able to request an
absentee ballot, or you can include any, what a lot of folks call a ??
document, that includes your name and address that includes a utility
bill, a bank statement, a paycheck, or any other official government
document to request an absentee ballot to improve the integrity for that
request. And so we are trying to improve the integrity of the absentee
voting process as well as requiring a stitch photo ID in the voting
process. And I’ll be available to answer any questions, but I think that
Representative Warren is gonna discuss a piece of the legislation that I
think you’re all gonna find very exciting to help improve voter
information and how we’re going to ensure that everyone has the
opportunity to vote and prove who they are. Representative Warren. I’m
sorry, Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But just not quite as exciting, so we will skip over
it. I’m Representative Samuelson from Charlotte, I’m going to be
covering the...</p>

<p id="05:00">
About the state issued ID cards. If a voter does not have photo
identification, they can get a non-operator card from DMV. We will cover
the cost if they have a financial hardship. So the fee for the card will
be waived if they are willing to sign that they have a financial
hardship and cannot afford them, as well as any fees for the documents
required in order to get the non-operator ID. So we really want to make
this possible for people who are having the hardship and cannot get the
ID card to be able to get it. The nice plus on this is those same ID
cards can then be used for other things, and we all know how often you
need an ID when you go places. So if someone has not been able to get a
photo ID because of financial hardship we will be able to remove that
barrier for them. They would though, have to sign a document saying that
they have financial hardship and are unable to pay for those documents
themselves. We will also, as part of the exciting program that
Representative Warren will go over, make it easier for them to know that
we have that service and make it easier for them to get to it. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. This bill was crafted with a lot of concern for the
expressions of concern for voter suppression and voter
disenfranchisement, so this bill creates a, a board called the voter
information verification agency, and it will be comprised of fourteen
employees who will work hand in hand with the counties to assist in
providing information, education to voters about the transition to a
photo ID, and also, and promoting registration of new voters and helping
voters who need assistance get an ID. It will coordinate the phase in
with other agencies that also do voter outreach, and it will coordinate
to outreach at voting sites or polling sites so voters are asked between
now and 2016 if they need assistance in getting a photo ID. The act also
directs the state board of elections to study the idea of a digital,
going digital, that is to create a statewide digital database of
photographs and that would include perhaps facial software, recognition
software. This also directs the SBOE to report back to the joint
legislative elections committee, oversight committee, by April 1st of
2014. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I'm Tim Moore. I'm the short guy that gets to speak. Good morning.
We have a process laid out for the, for the bill to proceed with. It
will be filed today. The bill is, there's gonna be a public hearing next
Wednesday in the House elections committee. It's expected that the bill
will most likely be voted on in committee on April the 17th, and then
will either, if it's determined that another referral to another
committee is necessary, it would go there or possibly before. We don't
have a fiscal note yet and so we'll have to make those determinations
once we obtain that. But the, I think most folks would agree this bill
has had more discussion before it was an actual bill probably than
anything in recent history. And that's been part of the very transparent
process and the process seeking public input. And the thought is is that
we would be voting on this bill sometime in the April 22nd, 23rd time
frame on the House floor. That's our procedure, and we continue to plan
to go through the process as we are, transparent and open and seeking
public input.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd be happy to take any of your questions at this time. Yes ma'am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yesterday the Secretary of State of ?? was talking about his older
father. He said Georgia accepted his expired drivers license. Would this
bill also accept expired ID, or only current?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is a provision in the bill, Laura, that would accept expired IDs.
I do not believe it is an unlimited expiration like they do there, but
if somebody else wants to speak to that exact point?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's right, so in order for the ID to be a valid ID under this law, it
has to have a date of issuance or a date of expiration. Either or. And
the ID would need to be valid from ten years of whatever is later, of
the date of issuance or the date of expiration. That's what the
legislation's gonna say. No, no, the way that we're treating the
elderly, people over 70, I know, you gotta know your audience. Yes,
exactly. Who's behind me again? The way we're going to treat folks that
are over 70 is if on the date they turn 70</p>

<p id="10:00">
The ID was valid. It will always be valid. So if they are 90 and the ID
that they have when they were 70 was valid when they were 70, it's
valid, and that's a special provision that we wanted to include for
folks over the age of 70. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry, are you also making special considerations for
disabled residents in that plan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If an individual
meets a federal definition for a person with disabilities, and there's a
statute in the United States code that helps define that, if they meet
that definition, we won't require photo ID. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You talked about student ID. ?? Does that mean that it
will not be accepted or is this saying ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] At this time
as the bill is drafted, that is correct, however I'm sure that's one of
the things that will be discussed when the bill is heard in the
committee. Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can we talk more about the
statewide photo ?? and we have some sort of equipment in every precinct
?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much for that question. The answer
is we really don't know. We know that the technology is out there to do
this. We think that the best way to proceed is to ask the state board of
elections to study this and to help design and develop the guidelines
for a program like this and then probably put out a request for a
proposal and roll this thing out, but at this time we don't think we've
got everything in place to flip the switch and make that occur. Yes,
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any ?? election district that's ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, there are states that use all different levels
of that. We've worked very closely with the DMV on this and there is now
a limited ability to be able to interface and to share all kinds of
information including the picture or the birth date or the last 4 of the
social, all that stuff is there now, we just need some time to bring it
all together. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think actually to the hearing process,
you heard several people come before the committee and talk about what
they're doing in Florida, what they're doing in Georgia and a number of
other states and I think that what the bill sponsors have done here is
identified a lot of individual good practices. What I believe we've got
here could be a best practice. It's really pulling together all of the
information from DMV, from various government agencies. I think it'll
lay the groundwork for better and more accurate voter rolls. So I think
what we have here really could be the first comprehensive approach of
any state. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And the other thing, and I'll add to this
as well. I think it is a great, this photo, the statewide photo database
could very well be a great tool to prevent anyone from not being able to
access their franchise, and I think this is another key point that we
want to make. This is a long process. This January 21, 2016 is when we
start requiring a strict photo ID. We've got a long lead time to develop
some of the technology for when this bill goes into effect that we've
got the proper technology in place and make sure that everybody's
franchise is protected. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What did you say were the
dates? [SPEAKER CHANGES] January 21, 2016 will be when the strict photo
ID, the entire process leading up to that will be when photo IDs are
issued. We will do soft launches in the 2014 elections to see who does
not have a photo ID and get those folks engaged, enrolled in a program
so we can get their photo IDs to them, so there's a long lead in time
and that's we're trying to follow the correct process through the
Department of Justice and all the different voting rights provisions
that we want to make sure we're checking all the boxes throughout the
process to get it right so no one loses that franchise. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absentee provisions start earlier than the photo ID, strict photo ID
provisions so I believe that, yes, that is correct. That's</p>

That's what that referred to. So the form, the enhanced procedures for
improving integrity in absentee ballot will start in 2014 straight photo
ID January 1, 2016. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It will be a
bill that's filed today. We'll make it easy, Bills For Dummies. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We're putting that on the burden of the
individual to identify themselves as financial hardship and so they're
going to have to sign a document saying they have financial hardship and
so there's some associated, if they say they have financial hardship the
same penalties of perjury apply if they misrepresent that. Kelly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm shocked and somewhat appalled
that you would imply that this legislature would ever roll out a bill
and not have a completely open and democratic process for which a ??
could be thoroughly heard and voted down. No, actually let me speak to
that. Representative Moore eluded earlier today we have did exactly what
we committed to do. We've listened this entire way through. What we've
heard is if you're concerned about the integrity of the election process
don't leave absentee out. We didn't. It's in this bill. We've addressed
that concern. We've heard don't leave folks behind that don't have an
ID. Not only like other states are we going to provide them with the ID
at no direct cost to themselves, we're going to have a proactive
outreach to reach these folks and to help them get the ID in their hand.
So we have in fact had an ongoing dialogue and that will continue I'm
sure once the bill is dropped. Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We've not discussed that. My gut reaction would be that just as
the governor said in the state of the union if those situations exist
now and obviously they do then that is a DMV issue that is perhaps
systemic across the entire agency and I am convinced that they are
committed to improving upon that. Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do not yet have an estimate of what we project it will cost.
Obviously there will be some expenditures that go forth in advertising
and informing the people that their going to need these ID's. There will
be some expense involved with the outreach program that helps these
folks get the ID's. We just don't yet have a hard number and may never
in fact have an actual hard number of how many folks we're going to need
to help get ID's. Just like in Georgia, they started their program in
2006 and to date they have issued about 29,000 free ID's. Well there is
no end date to that. Nor would there be under this bill. And as far as
folks that may need to pay for their own I think the cost is about ten
bucks. But again if you say you can't pay for it</p>

<p id="20:00">
There's no direct charge to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis,
congratulations on your bill. So we're very happy to see ?? We have
concern on vulnerability, expired license. I wanted you to clarify.
Somebody, a lot of people, as you know, tens of thousands of people got
driver's licenses in 2005 and the ?? who had no proven citizenship.
Those licenses are expired. How will this bill prevent them from walking
?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] They would be expired more than five years, so they
wouldn't. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? licenses. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have to
provide proof when you register to vote. The ID is just to say that you
are who you are. But when you go in to register to vote is when you've
got to provide the proof that you are eligible to register to vote. So,
they walk in with an expired license and they're already registered to
vote, would they be able to vote? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
If it fits the parameters of the bill as it's proposed. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We have a concern with that area. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well that,
Kelley, just to go back to something that you said. We need to make it
clear that there are people on the opposite ends of the spectrum on this
bill, who have concerns with this bill. And we fully expect when we hear
the fifty or so that have signed up to speak up at the next hearing,
that we're gonna hear a concern. One made the bill go away, the other
one, it doesn't go far enough. And somewhere in between, will be some
things that we're willing to address. But make no mistake about it. The
core principles that went in to filing this bill are ones that we're
staying close to. We will respectfully address the concerns of groups on
either end of the spectrum. But we're going to keep this tight and we're
going to live up to what we said around the things that I open the
conversation with in terms of making sure it passes judicial muster and
ensuring that it's a law that it's in effect that respects all of the
legitimate concerns that those may have who do not currently have an ID.
And then overtime it would be like any other bill.
It's never once and done. I'm sure there will be revisions along the
way. Just like when we get report back from committees and others on how
to better use technology, make the IDs better available, better
authentication methods, all this will be incorporated over time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The other side is saying that it's going to be ?? a
lot harder. When I moved into this neighborhood, I had a very tough time
getting a license and I had a valid driver's license. I actually ended
up going three times because there was ?? that Ohio has ?? licenses than
you all have here. I alone had that made, I had to go back certain
times. You expect people to keep going and going and going till they get
this and get ?? notarized. Sounds like you're just making it harder for
people who may not have ?? chance to go get these IDs. To get them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, and again I would never presume to try to comment on your exact
situation. It's my understanding that if you have a valid driver's
license issued from another state and then one of a long list of other
things, for instance official school records or a social security card.
That all that stuff that you, that that meets the DMV threshold to get
your ID. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Maybe. There's something else where I keep in
mind, is that we're not eliminating. In fact, we're facilitating voting
by mail. So let's say you moved here, you're a registered voter, for
whatever reason, you're having difficulty getting your driver's license.
Whatever information you use, to register to vote for the first time
will be sufficient for you to request a mail in ballad and vote by mail.
So you don't have to wait in line at the DMV if you're not able to get
through when you want to. And you don't have to wait to work out issues
or quirks that you may have with the state that you're moving from. So,
and in fact I believe they're proposed changes in the bill that even
make voting by mail easier by pre-printing a lot of the information you
would otherwise have to fill out. And then simply sign and attest to the
fact you are who you say you are when you cast your ballad.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Under this legislation, we would accept your Ohio
driver's license, if it's valid. And that, and let, for an ID purposes.
If it's valid within 10 years. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If this bill, there's a
lot of ?? out there making a lot of ?? when voter ID and all the other
bills are filed, they haven't been approved yet, how is the average Joe
supposed to attach the proposals to all the voter ID legislation or
should they not? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, thank you for asking that. The
house has been very clear all along, that we wanted to focus on a good
voter ID bill. And that's what we've done. That's what we've done
through our committee process, through our continued</p>

Seeking of input from the general public, and also from experts from
inside and outside our state. And so what I would encourage the public
to do is to follow the bills that are actually being heard. Not per
chance ones that may be filed and, or the point of being filed. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? Clarify something. ?? early on that the cost of the ?? would
be free but it would be the subsequent document that you might need to
get that ?? cost money but now the actual ID might not ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You need an ?? to get the ID or ?? documentation to get the ID.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Both. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? you are paying ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If you don’t have a financial hardship, you should be able to
pay for your ID and pay for your documents. The complaints we had heard
is what do you do about the poor or people who can’t do that and so what
we’re doing is removing that obstacle, that barrier. So if you have a
financial hardship and cannot afford to get your birth certificate in
order to get your ID, then this would cover both the cost of the birth
certificate and the cost of the ID. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One more question
?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You had said, ?? about ?? how do you police that?
How do you make that ?? what is the cutoff ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will
leave that to the attorneys but my understanding is there isn’t a
definitive, I’ll let the attorney answer that. Is there a definitive
definition of what constitutes that or is it just that they are
attesting that that’s their understanding, that they feel that they have
a financial hardship? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? language ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we need to clarify it, we can. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ve had so many numbers, they
were all like in the $10-25 range for depending on, drivers license,
there’s the photo ID and then there’s the cost depending on where your
birth certificate is, it can cost different amounts to get those other
documents but they were all under, as I recall all under $30. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? photo ID ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct. And we would pick
those up if you have a financial hardship. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The one
point I want to make here is that really it is in every citizen’s best
interest to have some way to prove their identification, whether they
choose to vote or not. It’s in everybody’s best interest to have access
to their birth certificate. There’s no more worse crisis when you know
you’re about to do something and you can’t do it without a birth
certificate, for example. There’s nothing worse than maybe being pulled
over and trying to attest to who you say you are and not having any
government issued ID to back you up. There are a variety of benefits and
I think they’re enabling to the population that currently does not have
a valid ID. And we should not lose sight of that. And Laura, to your
point, we need to be very crisp on what it means to not be able to pay
for it, so that it’s very clear, the rules are very clear. What we’re
simply saying is someone who comes in who is clearly able to pay for it,
then they like the people who come in and get a driver’s license, should
pay the cost. But we do not want to put anyone in a position to where
the only reason they can’t get an ID, they can’t get a birth
certificate, they can’t get some way to formally identify they are who
they say they are, we want to help them do that. And I think that’s a
very important benefit to this bill that has nothing to do with voter
ID. [BACKGROUND NOISE]</p>
