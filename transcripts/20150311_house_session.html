you for this day. It&#39;s a day that we are grateful to have, one that
we have never seen before.  We thank you for life, health, and strength,
for family and friends, the opportunity to serve and to do your will in
service of your people. We remain grateful to you and acknowledge that
you have provided the opportunity to serve in leadership positions for

because of your goodness and mercy. We thank you for your mercy.
Lord, your words are true and you credit righteousness to all those who
trust in you.  Guide us back, too, when we fall down into disobedience
and teach us how to examine our ways. You have said that, in your words,
that obedience is better than sacrifice.  Help us always to know the
difference. Help us to always know the difference. Lord we are meeting
today to conduct the business of your people. Guide our hearts and our
minds and our spirits of fairness, right thought and speech. Impart your
supreme wisdom upon our activities so our affairs may reach a successful
conclusion. Help us to remember Galatians 6:10, which says: As we have
opportunity, we should do good to all people. All people, especially to
those who belong to the family of faith.  Thank you for being our source
of guidance today and the days to come. We ask all these things in your
precious name of your son. Amen.

…To finance, regional bills placed on the unfavorable calendar,
Committee Substitutes refer to the Committee on Finance. Representative
Louis, the Chairman of Committee on rules got an operation recognized to
send forward the committee report, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Louis, Rules Calendar an operation of the House Committee
report, House Bill 157: Amend Environmental Laws, Favorable Committee
Substitute #2 and Unfavorable Committee Substitute #1.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Original Bill in favorable calendar, the Committee Substitute without
objection today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection heard, the gentleman from Harnett is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I would move that the House Committee Substitute for House
Bill 157 be added to today’s calendar not with standing the objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Guildford, Representative Harrison
raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and Gentlemen and House is full like ground hot day, last week we
considered a provision in this bill that dealt with Fracking that way
their requirement the Environmental Management Commission would have to
adopt rules relating to emissions, I’m not gonna get into the subsets of
that but I do wanna go into the recedes and this is a very controversial
issue, Fracking has got significant air quality issues associated with
it and there is just been a lack of public notice about this
consideration of this bill that’s gonna remove their requirement that
this EMC adopt these rules. So I just as a service to my constituents
and the constituents out there who are going to be affected by natural
gas exploration I think they need to have a little bit notice so they
can get and touch with us about how they feel about their requirement
the way air quality rules and I feel very strongly about that and I
encourage you to vote no on this motion, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Glazier raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I want to follow Representative Harrison’s
comment and I think it’s helpful just to put it in a little bit
respective and I know we are trying to clear things for the next two
days and I understand that completely but when the bill as it emerged
initially in committee did not appear to have much of controversy and it
seemed to have been work through and did it well and it sounds to me at
least from reports that a provision was added in committee which was
controversial and which was controversial the other evening, and which
to some degree was defeated the other evening on the floor so there
maybe very substantive and procedural debates on that issue which will
come up. And it strikes me that given the nature of the matter and how
controversial it was that it’s the wrong thing to do to put something on
the floor without any notice here even though there was a committee
hearing and I fully understand that but we are adding something on a
major substantive topic Fracking of which the population in this body
have disagreed, we are adding it without real notice to the public and
what we have noticed here they don’t and I think that given the history
of this provision and that’s unfair, there are other portions of the
bill that maybe very time sensitive and I understand that but it was a
decision to add that in the committee and so we are stuck with it in the
bill. And people will make up their minds but I don’t think this early
in the session it’s appropriate for us to be doing this and probably we
doesn’t set the precedent that up to now had been one and complete, and
open transparency in my view and very good collegiality between the
majority and the minority on what goes on the calendar and what doesn’t,
it strikes me that this breaks that protocol and that’s a little
disappointing, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Rutherford, Representative
Hager raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, we talked last week it’s been eight days now
since we have first brought the subject forward and the public has time
to way in I have got folks waiting sending me emails, I think some of
you others have also, again it’s been a week and a day we were asked if
that just through a committee what we agreed upon last week, we evaded
through Environment Committee with I think two or three an opposition I
don’t remember 25 members overwhelmingly voted yes, four has evaded
through the committee and it was put on the correct bill and
Environmental Mains Bill, it’s in the ??, it’s remained to the bill,
it’s been evaded through committee, it’s laid around for eight days, I
think it’s time to hear this and let the folks hear this bill, hear this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Carteret, Representative McElraft
raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the motion to add the bill to today’s
calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to let you know that we did thoroughly that this an
environment and even though it was add as amendment in environment to
the environmental amends bill, Representative Harrison who, definitely
been against this…

  <p id="010:00">
  Asked me the day before, if Representative Hager was going to be added
to the bill, and I told her yes. So there was ample opportunity for the
public to get in touch with each of the environment committee meetings,
because I know Representative Harrison let them know that was going to
be added. There is nothing trying to be hidden here. This bill could’ve
come from the Senate and we would have had to concur on it. So we’re not
trying to hide anything. We’re trying to take this through the process.
And we have debated on it today. We had debated on the environment, and
I would hope you will vote yes on this motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
Representative Luebke rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Hager would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Rutherford yield to the
gentleman from Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Always.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Hager. My question has to do
with process and the public’s knowledge that this bill would be on the
calendar today. And so my question is: to what committee was the bill
referred as we heard it as members of the Finance Committee and as
members of the public. To what committee was it referred yesterday? From
environment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, repeat the question, Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My question, Representative Hager, is to which
committee was the bill referred at the end of the Environment Committee
that the motion having been made by the committee? The question is
simply to which committee was it referred?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, point of order?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis is
recognized as to a point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Durham is asking a procedural
question. I would respectfully ask that the gentleman direct his inquiry
to the chairman of the rules calendar and operation of the House
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point is taken. Does the gentleman from Durham wish to
direct his question to the Rules chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, thank you for the inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re asking me if I could—I’ll ask you a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In the interests of time, I assume you’d want the
answer to the question that you’ve asked the gentleman from Rutherford,
is that not the question you’d like to have answered?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I thought I had the floor, Mr. Speaker and Mr.
Chairman, and I just wanted to ask you a question. I’m happy to ask you
the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Harnett yield to an inquiry
from the gentleman from Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Speaker, and Representative Lewis. To which
committee was this bill referred in the environment committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion that prevailed in the committee on the
environment was that the proposed committee substitute for House Bill
157 be given a favorable report and re-referred to the committee on
finance. Yesterday, the referral to finance was stricken and the
committee was re-referred, I mean the proposed committee substitute was
re-referred to the committee on rules, because the provisions that
involved the Committee on Finance were removed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Hart yield to an additional
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So it is accurate to say that the members of the
committee, and more importantly, the public, presumed from the motion in
the House Environment Committee was going to the House Finance
Committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, thank you for the question. I think it
would be fair to assume that the members of the public and members of
the Chamber were expecting the bill that contained finance provisions to
go to the Finance Committee. I would respectfully point out in response
to your question, that the provisions that were relating to finance were
removed in the House Committee substitute that was adopted in the Rules
Committee this morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, my question is simply Representative Lewis—
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to state an additional
inquiry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Hart yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis, do you think it’s good procedure
from the standpoint and good policy because of what’s in the bill, to
make a re-referral from Finance to Rules? At some point when the public
is really not paying attention, it’s simply being done as routine
business up here, and we the members of the Chamber, and the public,
can’t possibly know that a referral like that happened in the detail of
messages and re-referrals, etc. that it’s really impossible to follow
every one of these. Would you not acknowledge that’s true?

  <p id="015:00">
  Rep. Luebke, thank you for the question.  I want to reflect a moment on
the gentleman from Cumberland earlier.  We have made a valiant effort I
think in this chamber this session to have as much transparency in the
transaction of the business that we possibly can.  Do I think that
adding this bill to today’s calendar is the ideal solution?  I don’t, I
wish that we did not have to do that.
However, there is a part of this bill and you have served with
distinction much longer than I have, and you understand that there are
time sensitive provisions that require the general assembly to act from
time to time.  And this bill contains a time sensitive provision and we
felt the most efficient way to have this issue dealt with was to remove
the questions that the finance committee would have had to resolve,
place those in another bill, and to the point that Rep. Hager made, and
Rep. McElraft have made, the issues that have largely been aired to go
ahead and bring those forward today...again, because I would reiterate
that this is a time-sensitive matter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair is gonna intervene in this matter and would consider part of
the questions proposed by the gentleman from Durham to be a
parliamentary inquiry.  Pursuant such, the chair has made inquiry with
the court; a notice did go out at 6:01 yesterday.  The notice was fully
compliant with our rules, and the bill would be fully appropriate before
this body pursuant to our rules.  Does the gentleman wish to ask an
additional question or debate the motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wish to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, we heard that the bill went out, the notice went out at 6:01,
that the bill was being referred from finance to rules and therefore,
would be in the rules committee calendar.  I respect very much the
comments of the rules chair, but I think all of us know referring a bill
at 6:01PM from finance to rules is not an action that the membership and
especially the public can know anything about.
And I very much would request that people vote yes on the objection
because of the process.  This can wait, the senate can rush anything
through that it wants.  We know about the senate, they can do it in 30
minutes and we should not debate this today; we should wait until Monday
so that there is an opportunity for the public to weigh in.  So I urge
the support of the objection.  I’m sorry, I urge support, I urge support
of the motion of Rep. Lewis, apologies, so that bill is not on the
calendar today.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For explanation purposes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Vote no on the motion, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So Rep. Luebke was before it before he was against it, is that how this
is?  For what, I’m just giving you a hard time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Rutherford?, Rep. Hager rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if I can help with the parliamentary inquiry to the rules chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Harnett yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Rep. Lewis.  If, let’s assume, the bill went to finance.
This may be a question for Rep. Saine, Chairman Saine at this point, if
it had gone to finance, would this particular amendment piece of the
bill be heard since it had no finance piece to it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s actually a very good question.  Since this provision that was
removed--that dealt with finance--was removed from the bill, the finance
committee really wouldn’t have had any jurisdiction, if you will, on
this particular bill, which is why the decision was made to re-refer the
bill to rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A little more detail, Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to state the additional question and the
gentleman from Harnett yields to the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me refine that a little bit more.  Let’s assume the piece would have
stayed in that had finance, which was not in the provision we’re talking
about right now.  And Rep. Saine may want to weigh in on this, Mr.
Speaker.  If this particular piece that I put in yesterday in finance
had no finance provision in it at all, would it have allowed to be
discussed in finance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker and Rep., thank you for the inquiry.  I would need to
respond to that just by saying that the rules would not have required it
have been referred to finance, and finance would have had no reason to
have reviewed the bill.  Of course, they may have asked for it to have
been referred.  They may have, but it would not have had a finance
component.

  <p id="020:00">
  So it would not have been a part of the normal course of business that
it would’ve gone to finance without a finance component. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative
Pendleton rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to speak on this bill if I
could. [SPEAKER CHANGES] On the, it’s a motion to add the bill to
today’s calendar. Does the gentleman wish to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Not on that. I wanted to talk about the subject. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Carterette, Representative
McElraft rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak second time on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The part that would’ve gone to finance was one little
paragraph in 16 pages. Had that not been in the bill it would’ve come
straight from environment, straight to this floor, so taking that out,
that one little paragraph that had to do with flight goods and taxes. We
took that out. It would’ve followed the same path as it would had it not
been in there. It came straight to the floor from environment and that’s
the way it should have come. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Lincoln, Representative Saine rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Since the conversation’s been had all around,
yesterday I talked with the bill sponsor and knowing that this piece
would not be in there I decided that it did not indeed need to come to
finance and therefore that’s why we’re at today. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Harnett,
Representative Lewis rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the
House. I wanna start by saying that I greatly appreciate and respect all
of the concerns that have been raised today. I think that all the
members of the chamber would acknowledge that our chamber has taken
great strides forward in trying to be as transparent as we can to seek
input as we can. I would not normally ask or have any problem with the
bill rolling over for a few days, but the facts are this, they’re all,
there is a provision in this bill that is time sensitive. We need to
address the bill and once the bill’s added to the calendar all the
members are certainly free and able to speak against the bill, to debate
the bill, to vote no against the bill. All I’m asking is that this
chamber have the opportunity to address this time sensitive issue,
therefore I would respectfully ask that on the question to add it to the
calendar that the members vote aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion, further debate? If not the question before the House is the
motion of Representative Lewis that the House Committee Substitute for
House Bill 157 be added to today’s calendar for consideration. So many
favoring the motion will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.
75 having voted in the affirmative and 40 in the negative, the House
Committee Substitute for House Bill 157 will be added to today’s
calendar. Members we’re now gonna go to introductions of bills and
resolutions. That will take a few minutes. There are a number of those
and then once we come back we will move into the calendar. The, on
today’s calendar you’ll see the bills that were on the printed calendar
plus the three bills that were just added today and it would appear if
we dispose of these bills that we may not require a voting session
tomorrow. Introductions of bills and resolutions, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 182, Representatives [??], Lewis and Hager,
Property insurance fairness. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Insurance. The clerk will
suspend just a moment. On motion of Representative Dave Lewis from
Harnett County the chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the
gallery to Tracy Sternberg and the Girl Scouts who are here from all
across North Carolina. If you all will please stand so that we can
welcome you today. [applause] And also on behalf of Representative
Stineburg the chair, I believe these folks are in the same group, but I
believe Troop 4305 and Troop 25 from Pasquotank County and Troop 2504
from Currituck County is here. Again we’re glad to have you here. The
gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis is recognized to rise to a
point of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

  <p id="025:00">
  Ladies and gentlemen of the House today is a very special day. We have
quite a few very special guests in our gallery and I wanted to pause at
the start of this session and acknowledge that on March 12, 1912 in
Savannah, GA Juliette Gordon Lowe organized what would become the Girl
Scouts of the USA. I have some prepared remarks, but in the interest of
time I just want to let you all know what a tremendous organization this
is. How it builds and empowers our young people. I’m very proud of the
fact that my daughter is an active member of her, of our girl scout
group and the things that they teach, the things that we strive for
every day up here, inclusion, the ability for all to participate, the
ability for all to excel and when you excel to be acknowledged, to be
rewarded, these are the things that the girl scouts are taught every day
by their adult volunteers and also by the girls themselves as a team.
They are a tremendous asset in building our society and in building our
community and in setting a positive example for all to follow. I will
just go back again, you don’t have to go any farther than the girl
scouts to see an example of a group that truly is focused on its mission
of educating and improving all people, regardless of where you came
from, where you started, there’s a home for you if you have the interest
and the willingness to invest your time. I’m very, very proud of the
many contributions that the girl scouts continue to make every day.
Obviously I was not qualified to be a member of the girl scouts, but I’m
not sure that I would’ve been smart enough or would’ve been able to
excel to the point that many of these girls and young ladies have done.
I just think it is important that we pause from time to time and they’ve
got the chance today to see sort of what we do up here, but I think it
is important that we pause from time to time to acknowledge the good
works that go on in our community and in our state and later on today I
will ask that the clerk include a statement that Representative Carney
and Representative Gill and I are going to ask to be spread upon the
journal. There will be a copy distributed to all of your desks as well
and of course one sent to the girl scouts, to their main office, but
again I know that with the Speaker’s indulgence there are another member
or two probably more qualified than I am to pay tribute to this great
group, but I did just want to voice my support and more importantly my
appreciation for all the good works that you do. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair would also inquire, is Lindsey Denning in
the chamber. If you are, would you please stand. Lindsey, your aunt,
Denise Weeks wanted me to make sure I specifically recognized you, so
we’re glad to have you here also today. [applause] On motion of the
members of Guilford County, Representatives Blust, Hardister, Harrison,
Faircloth, Brockman and Johnson, the chair is happy to extend the
courtesies of the gallery to Hank Henning, Chairman of the Guilford
County Board of Commissioners and Nancy Vaughn, Mayor of Greensboro.
We’re glad to have you here also today. [applause] Mayor, we’re glad you
didn’t bring Don with you today. For what purpose does the lady from
Mecklenberg, Representative Carney rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak for
a moment on the issue before us, it’s not a resolution but the Girl
Scout Day. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized for a moment of
personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and

  formed around a meeting room with 18 girls and an idea. We opened our
session this year, if you recall, with an incredible tribute to the Boy
Scouts of America. So I&#39;m asking my colleagues today in the Chamber
to please give that same due diligence of respect and listening to what
we&#39;re talking about today. We have young ladies in our gallery that
may some day be on this floor, or the Senate floor, or indeed Congress.
Because throughout the years, from those 18 girls sitting with Miss
Lowe, it has grown to 59 million plus within the world. I&#39;m wearing
today my pins, with honor. A world pin that I earned as a Brownie. And
moving on to Girl Scouts, my Girl Scout pin. And then a Service Bar pin
from being a Scout leader. I wear them proudly today, standing in this
Chamber as a member of the House of Representatives. Building on those
foundations that Juliette Lowe gave to those 18 young women that day 103
years ago. Many of you, the men in this Chamber in particular, have
wives, or grandmothers, or aunts, or grandchildren, nieces, neighbors,
that have paved the way for other young ladies in this incredible
service organization. So I ask you today to join with us in North
Carolina in honoring 103 years of this organization for our young women.
I have a granddaughter, a second grader, in Middle Tennessee. She&#39;s
in Brownie Troop 200705 in Middle Tennessee, Service Unit 172. She sent
me that text to remind me of her numbers. And she wears them proudly.
But today, on a lighter note, what many of you equate Girl Scouts with
is those wonderful cookies. They&#39;ve grown over the years from the
Tagalongs, the Thin Mints, and the Samoas. This year they added a new
one. As you can imagine, having received one in your office compliments
of myself and my granddaughter, they have a new one called Rah Rah
Raisins. Many of you know that my grandchildren call me Rah Rah. Well,
when that came out, I immediately got the phone call, and the email, and
a text from my granddaughter. They named a cookie after you. Obviously
they did not, it&#39;s Rah Rah for raisins and healthy cookies. So that
is probably a good tribute, too. i also want to point out that we have
another Rah Rah in this chamber, and that is Representative Sarah
Stevens. Again, this is an important day. It has made an impact on so
many lives. I thank you for your attention through these comments. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from
Wake, Representative Gill, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] A moment of special
privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Lady is recognized to speak to a moment of
personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I never
was a Girl Scout per se, because I grew up on the farm in Apex, North
Carolina. But when my daughters started school they saw the little girls
in green and brown uniforms, and they wanted to be a member of that
group. So that enticed me to become a Girl Scout leader. I went through
the process of the training to be a Girl Scout leader. And I think my
first troop was 60 members. I had a total of 60 girls who joined my
first troop. The Pines of Carolina was so intrigued by what we were
doing as the 60 members in the group, they asked me to become a trainer
of Girl Scout leaders for Southeast Raleigh. I did train quite a few
leaders. But one of the things that I did as a part of my job as a
leader was to make sure that I empowered the girls by teaching values
such as honesty,

  Fairness, courage, compassion, character, sisterhood, confidence, and
citizenship through activities which include camping, community service,
learning first aid, and earning badges by acquiring practical skills.
Girl scouts have the same ranking somewhat as boy scouts, but our
rankings were a little bit different, and they were based on special
awards. We had girl scouts bronze, silver, and gold awards. It&#39;s
amazing to think that girl scouts became an organization long before
women were able to vote, and that is unique because I think back and
wonder what the leaders were telling the girls about the fact, why they
couldn&#39;t vote. But starting from 18 members as the previous speakers
have spoken, today we have 2.3 million girl scouts in the United States
alone, and of that, 890,000 adults are working with them. Most girl
scout units in the early years were segregated based on race according
to the statutes, and locals, laws, and customs. The first African
American troop was founded in 1917. That&#39;s pretty good. And then the
first Southern African American troop was founded in 1932. Now, the girl
scouts have unusual programs, and I&#39;m gonna tell you about two. One
is called the girl scouts beyond bars. How many of you have heard of
that? Well what the girl scouts beyond bars do is they help daughters of
incarcerated mothers to connect with their children and have the mothers
participate in girl scouts, so the mothers are taught those same traits,
characteristics. The other one is called girl scouting in detention
centers, and what this will do is allow young girls who are incarcerated
to become, to participate in girl scouts, and they are taught just like
the regular girl scouts. I think Representative Carney and I know well
the motto. Would you like to stand up and together we will say the
motto, the promise, and the slogan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, the chair will recognize Representative Carney and Representative
Gill to recite the motto.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, are there other, mister speaker, of inquiry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And if there are other, any other girl scouts or former girl scouts who
would like to recite, in fact, the girl scouts in the gallery are
invited to join in with the recitation of the motto. Representative
Jeter, if you&#39;d like to recite the motto, you can too. The ladies
and any gentlemen who would like to recite the motto are recognized for
said purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let&#39;s start with the motto. The motto is be prepared. Our slogan is
do a good turn daily. And the girl scout promise, and we all can say
that together, girl scouts, on my honor, I will try to serve God and my
country, to help people all times, and to live by the girl scout law.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative
Jeter rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to this lack of resolution resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to speak to a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I did not know the girl scout code, I apologize. As a father of
daughters, you never know what to expect in life. I don&#39;t know what
goes through your head. I don&#39;t know why you have emotional swings.
I don&#39;t know why the way I just looked at you made you mad. I know
when I do it to Josh, why he gets mad. Different discussion. I have two
daughters, I have a 14 year old and an 11 year old. And my 14 year old

  Vehicle to be included under the definition of all terrain vehicle, so
it could be subject to this statute. The problem that they have in
Wilmington and other areas is the fact that since these vehicles cannot
be used on the public highway at this point, they have to be loaded on a
trailer and taken there, and there&#39;s a practical problem of what you
do with the trailer once you get it there. And if they have to take the
trailer back to the police or fire department, then they have to come
back and get it when they&#39;re through using it. So this would be
something that would help that situation. The, and this would apply
statewide. Mister speaker and members of the House, as to section two,
the original bill was to add the city of Wilmington and the city of
Enfield to allow the all, the utility vehicles which would now be under
the definition of all terrain vehicles to be used by municipalities in
the counties that were listed in the statute, but I had had requests
from other representatives to include their counties and towns that they
represent, so I thought it would just be a whole lot easier and they
agreed, if I could make this statewide, and I do have an amendment that
has been prepared.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis, if you would sign the amendment and while it&#39;s
getting up here and being posted on the dashboard, you can explain it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. What the amendment would do would be to remove on line
three from the title of the bill to eliminate the word certain. It would
also amend the bill on line 35, which is in the title section two, to
remove the word listed. And then on page two of the bill, lines 18
through 24 it would remove those, so it would apply statewide. Mister
speaker, I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions that anybody may have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let&#39;s, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis moves to amend the bill on page one, line three by
deleting the word certain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Stay right there. Do you have further explanation of the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir, I&#39;ll just ask for the House to please vote in favor of it at
the request of other representatives so that this could be statewide.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, do you want to speak on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, thank you mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to thank the gentleman for bringing forth this amendment.
Representative Boles and I had discussed with him doing this and he had
agreed to allow Representative Boles and in Representative Boles&#39;
absence, Representative Davis saw the need and went ahead and handled
the amendment, and I want to thank the gentleman for it in his inclusion
here. This does not mean these things will happen everywhere, but it
will allow the towns to do it, and interestingly enough, it turns out
there&#39;s several towns that are doing it not realizing that it&#39;s
illegal for town employees to drive these vehicles. Police, fire, and
rescue have always been allowed. There is a limitation to roads with a
maximum speed limit of 35 miles an hour. DOT has been consulted on this,
they are completely in agreement and see no problems with this change to
the law. I ask for your support of the amendment and the bill.

Further question, further debate on the amendment? If not, the question
before the, Representative Davis, do you wanna speak?

If I may just add, mister speaker, thank you. The North Carolina
Association of Chiefs of Police endorse this as do the State Farmers
Association and as Representative Brawley stated, the Department of
Transportation has no objection. Thank you, mister speaker.

Okay. Further discussion or debate on the amendment? If not, the
question is the adoption of the amendment by Representative Davis. All

Representatives Glazier, Stevens, Zachary and Davis, House Bill 79, a
bill to be entitled an act amending the law pertaining to civil no
contact order to clarify that a knowing violation of a civil no contact
order is punishable by civil or criminal contempt and clarify the scope,
stay and the proceeding when the case is on appeal. The General Assembly
of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier is
recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much,
Mr. Speaker, members. This is a bill that passed unanimously through
Judiciary 2 yesterday. I’ll explaining the first provision and
Representative Jordan will be explaining the second provision. The first
provision deals with an attempt to clean up the issue of contempt in
civil no contact orders. Very briefly under chapter 50c there is a
provision for which the court an issue civil no contact orders for
people who are stalking or otherwise engaging in non-consensual conduct
with a person. The judge in those cases can order a bunch of relief
including no contact. Orders can be temporary or they can be permanent
and if a person violates that order it’s punishable by contempt. Up
until very recently all the courts thought they had both criminal and
civil contempt power. Civil contempt power is an attempt to get someone,
to coerce them into comply with a court’s judgment, usually by
imprisoning them until such time as they do. Criminal contempt is where
they are disobeying a court order and often a fine can be assessed for
the punishment for that disobedience. When someone violates a no contact
order it can be either criminal or civil, judges just have to choose.
The court of appeals in a very recent opinion said well, our statute’s
just not clear. It’s clear that civil contempt is available but it’s not
real clear that criminal contempt is available which judges had
traditionally for decades been using. This simply clears it up and says
judges in these cases can use both civil or criminal contempt in their
discretion as the circumstances warrant. It’s been approved by the bar.
There’s no opposition to this provision in the bill, and with that Mr.
Speaker I would turn section 2 of the bill over to Representative
Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan is recognized to debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the
primary sponsors on this bill allowing us to add section 2 which is also
brought to us by the Bar Association and supported by the Bar and add it
as a legal procedure to their current bill. Basically what you can
imagine in a lawsuit things can be appealed and you don’t have to appeal
the entire lawsuit. You can appeal part of a suit and part of it can go
up and be appealed and the court can deal with the rest of it at the
same time down at the lower court, but it can get very, very convoluted
and inefficient and pieces of it can be on appeal and other pieces not.
All this does is if you look at the language, our Supreme Court writes
the rules of appellate procedure, this gives them the authority to write
it so that these appeals can be handled more efficiently and that’s all
it does. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? If
not the question before the House is the passage of House Bill 79 on its
second reading. All those in favor will vote aye, all those opposed will
vote no, the clerk will open the vote. Representative Haines, do you
care to vote. The clerk will open the machine and record the vote. The
ayes are 114, the nos are 0. The bill has passed its second reading and
will without objection be read a third time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members, this is a bill that
passed with one descending vote yesterday from the Judiciary 2
Committee. Ill briefly explain the background. Rep Davis, Rep Hamilton,
and Rep McGrady are other on the bill, and may if there’s any question,
have comments. But you all who were here will remember that we passed
the most comprehensive human trafficking bill in the country last
session. That took a tremendous rewrite. It was a bill by Representative
Davis, Representative Hamilton, and Senator Goulsby. There were a number
of rewrites, including a very large conference committee report. The
provision you’re looking at was in the bill, it’s been passed and passed
into law, so we already put this substantively into law. But we put it
effectively in the wrong place. There are four grades of sort of
offenses: solicitation for prostitution, the lowest, then prostitution,
then essentially, for lack of a better way, we have a provision that
deals with the pimps, and then we have a provision that deals with human
traffickers, each having higher grades of punishment. One of the policy
decision we made in the House by a vote of 110-0 at the time as part of
the bill was that for kids who are young boys and girls ages up to the
end of their time as 16 and 17 year olds, are often in this as a matter
of life-and-death, or security reasons, or safety reasons. And we,
instead of charging them, want to treat them as victims when they are
being soliciting, and get them into DSS for referral for neglect and
abuse, and follow the New York model, and the model that New Hanover
county has put in play, that was recommended by the bar association and
judges across the country. We did that, but we put this immunity
provision in with the prostitution section that is the higher offense,
we didn’t put it in a immunity provision in the lowest offense, the
solicitation charge, so that kind of made no sense, and that was just a
drafting error and I take full responsibility because I was involved in
the conference report. This fixes that at the request of the district
judges, and puts the same immunity provision into law for the higher
charge, for the lower charge for these kids. I’ll be glad to answer any
questions but I think that’s all this does and I know other than
Representative Stam, and I need to say this other than his concern over
the policy which we debated last year, I know of no opposition to this
provision. Thank you.

bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. House Bill 157 is our amended
environmental laws. It’s our amends bill that we do every year, and part
one is the interstate mining compact clarification and it allows the
Governor to send an official from ?? to act on the Governor’s behalf on
that interstate compact commission.

  Was part two is recycled and recovered materials. It would exclude steel
slag and that is a product of the electric arc furnace steel making
process and it excludes it from the definition of solid waste.
Representative Hunter has new coarse steel in his area, and I think he
has a bill that actually is requesting that same legislation. Section 2B
would clarify the requirements for recovered materials under the
statutes governing the management of solid waste. And under current law,
if a material qualifies as recovered material, it is not subject to
regulation as solid waste. Section three is technical corrections for
coal ash management. It clarifies the implementing agencies. The coal
ash management act of 2014 is implemented by several different state
agencies, including the coal ash management commission, the
environmental management commission, and the utilities commission. So
that just clarifies what each of their duties are, what they&#39;re
responsible for implementing. And the technical corrections, 3.2 would
correct an incorrect statutory cross reference, 3.3 would repeal
unnecessary reporting deadlines. There is a structural fill moratorium
in the coal ash management act and it was placed on there in section 3.4
would make a correction to the exceptions in the structural fill
moratorium to clarify all of the listed requirements. Section 3.4 would
make a technical correction of the effective date of the moratorium on
the use of coal combustion products and structural fill. Section 3.4 A
and B would be retroactively effective to September 20, 2014 and apply
to the use of coal combustion products as structural fill contracted on
or after that date. Then we have section 3.5 would clarify certain
responsibilities related to corrective action under the authority of the
secretary of environment and natural resources. And then we have part 4,
which, all it does is change the name of the echo enhancement program to
the division of mitigation services. Part 5, the energy policy council
amendments. It would provide that the secretary of DENR and natural
resources, and secretary of commerce and the lieutenant governor may
appoint designees to represent them on the energy policy council. And
section 5 would also provide that a member of the energy policy council
will be automatically removed if he or she fails to attend three
successive meetings without just cause and would allow the Governor to
remove any member of the council for misfeasance, malfeasance, or
nonfeasance. And then part 6 is, this would clarify the EMC, this is the
part we discussed earlier. Would clarified the EMC, that they would only
be required to adopt additional rules to our air toxics from drilling
operations if it was determined that by the EMC and DENR that the
state&#39;s current air toxics program and applicable federal
regulations adopted by the state were inadequate. And that&#39;s,
that&#39;s it, and I&#39;ll be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Rutherford, Representative Hager is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill, mister speaker. Much has been made of this amendment
that we put on the bill in environment. We&#39;ve had a couple votes on
it. We had the amendment last week, so everybody&#39;s full well I think
of what the amendment does, but I want to point out something to you
guys. The other side will say well, this does away with the mandate that
we told them we were gonna do for the energy exploration rules. But look
at the last page guys, section six, I think it&#39;s line one. Let me
read it to you in case you don&#39;t have it in front of you. The
environmental management commission, the EMC, then it words, uses the
word shall. Now to me, that sounds like the mandate&#39;s still there.
It says it shall do these things. It says it shall look at the state and
federal guidelines, and if they aren&#39;t stringent enough, they will
adopt their own. It says shall. It doesn&#39;t say may, it doesn&#39;t
say if it&#39;s raining on Tuesday, it doesn&#39;t say if the sun
shines. It says it shall do that. Now this is a time sensitive piece. We
have to have this adopted by the seventeenth. That&#39;s why the other
side&#39;s trying to stop this. There&#39;s some issues going on there,
some behind the scenes issues. But let me point out, you have not said
that the mandate will not exist. It says shall, guys, remember that

this to you then may say shout so please push me for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Reives is recognized to send forward an amendment. If
that’s what you care to be recognized for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is Mr. Speaker and thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Reives moves to amend the bill on page 15, line 49
through page 16, line 18 by deleting those lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Reives is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the house I would just
say that I would have to respectfully disagree as to whether or not one
this is a clarification and then two as to what mandate this now puts on
the Environmental Measuring Commission, if you will remember back from
SPA20 when this is originally brought up there was a determination made
by the General Assembly at that time that there need to be a special
attention made to air pollution that may come from oil and gas industry
that was passed, that was part of the mandate and that’s proceeded on up
until this time, what it appears to me that this section we are asking
to delete and we do with at that this point in time will tell the
Environmental Measuring Commission I agree with Representative Hager
that the word shell is in there but then if you proceed on it gives them
the option to say, “If you feel the State and Federal regulations are
fine then you don’t have to do anything.” Therefore, there is no mandate
for them to do anything, there was a mandate for them to look and see if
the state regulations are fine. What we would ask you to do at this
point in time is to strike that language in the bill because again what
we are saying is—we believe that the original intent of SPA20 and I
don’t know of anything about any ulterior motives or anything about the
17, I live in a district where if there is Fracking I have been told
they are going to frack and so I would like for them to have a mandate
to pay attention to our air pollution rules, to pay attention to the air
quality and then make a determination on their own since the General
Assembly said in 2012 that there did seem to be a reason we had to treat
oil and gas differently for them to make that determination and for them
not to be given it out to say that, “It’s okay, what we have already got
with the State and Federal regulations.” So I would ask you to support
this amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Millis for what purpose you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if the amendment sponsor would yell to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Reives, do you yell to a question? Representative Reives,
do you yell to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you Representative Reives, I definitely
hear your intent with this amendment, I just wanna ask you a question,
in your dialogue I see you are explaining it, it was actually stated
that the EMC wouldn’t have the mandate in order to make sure that we
have adequate regulations to protect public health in our environment,
would you please answer the question reading the bill it says that the
commission that’s charged the EMC shall deem if X, Y, and Z are
inadequate. Therefore, they have a legislative mandate to make the
determination of whether there needs to be our own written air toxic
quality rules or whether they deem that what is actually out there now
is inadequate. So I’m confused about the term or the statement that you
made is that—the very commission that we have charged to make sure that
we have public health protection as well as our environmental
protection, if this is not a mandate to make sure that they do their job
and to make sure that our public in our environment is protected.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will try to be more clear and I apologize I’m an Attorney and
sometimes we are not clear and I apologize for that. What this seems to
read to me is saying what the original language was is that the EMC
shall adopt rules which means they are mandate at that time is to make
rules, what this section now says is that they shall make sure that the
rules are adequate which gives them the right to say, “Well, if the
State and Federal rules are inadequate then they have to do something
but if the State and Federal rules are adequate then the EMC has no
mandate whatsoever to create any new rules.” And what I’m saying is, it
seems to me that the original Senate Bill, the General Assembly at some
point in time must have fell that special rules need to made for oil and
gas because they put that in there I mean they had that option at the
time they have made the original bill, they had the option at that time
to say, “Hey, if you guys have got State and Federal regulations and
think they are okay that’s fine but what they seem to imply with the
legislative…”

  To speak energy in the bigger companies we’re probably gonna have those
wild counters and we need to make sure that we have the strongest state
rules possible because we just don’t have the federal protections we
need. So I don’t wanna go into the procedure of this. I appreciate
Representative Lewis and the Speaker giving us a heads up on this and I
don’t wanna get into all that but I do think there’s a procedural issue
here as well, but I do think on the substance, I think it’s really
important that we not remove the mandate that North Carolina, that the
body is charged with protecting the quality of assistance to the state.
That we do not remove the mandate that they adopt rules to protect the
citizens of this state, so I strongly urge support of this amendment.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Rutherford,
Representative Hager is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to ask Representative Reives a
question and then debate the bill after that if you don’t mind. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Reives do you yield for a question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative, for yielding
to a question. Are you aware, you talked about the intent of Senate Bill
820 . You’re aware that I was one of the original developers of that
bill working with the Senate and as such you’re aware that I would be
able to decide the intent of the bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would say
that I expected that there were several people here that worked on that
bill and I have not gone through to see who all those people are. No
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you
yield, Representative Reives, to the follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I
do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you realize that
yesterday in Environment that the DNR representative stood up and said
that we agree with this process? Were you aware of that Representative
Reives? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, sir, I was not. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Last one, I promise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you yield
for a follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does, he yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And as such with the DNR standing
up and saying this, EMC saying the same thing, would you point to
another body in this state or in this legislature, in the governors or
in wherever that would be more adequate to decide the rules rather than
DNR or EMC in this state? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not aware of one but at
the appropriate time I would like to ask a question of Mr. Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Reives. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll come
back to you, Representative Reives. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill,
Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you can, guys, just go back
to the amendment. It’s a simple amendment. It says shall, and read this,
it says the Environmental Management Commission shall adopt rules.
Representative Harrison indicated that they weren’t gonna adopt any
rules. It said they shall adopt rules if they find the state and
federals are inadequate. So it gives them the choice, look at the state
and federal, if they’re not adequate then don’t adopt them, adopt your
own, so it gives you the choice to look at them first. That’s all this
does. It doesn’t say not to adopt rules. It doesn’t say that you’re not
gonna fulfill the mandate of 820, the intent of which I’m, most of you
that served in that time know I was intimately involved with, so don’t
think that the EMC is not going to adopt rules, it just allows them to
first look at the federal and state guidelines. Very simple. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Gentleman from Cumberland, Representative Glazier is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] First to see if Representative Reives
would yield for a question and then for a comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Reives, will you yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d be happy to yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative.
Your argument earlier on this, I wanna see if I can summarize so I’m
clear about it, is your argument at what this, the effect of this
amendment does is to in fact restrict EMC’s capacity to develop rules
based on best practices because of the term adequacy which suggests that
if they determine that the current existing federal/state combination
regime is simply adequate they’re without authority to go beyond that.
Would that be a summary of your view? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s one good
part of it. Thank you, now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier’s
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And it seems to me
that’s the problem here. I agree with Representative Hager actually that
on its face there’s not, if it were read exactly as Representative Hager
reads it to be I see less of a problem than others might. the problem I
have is not what, how it reads currently but how it’s gonna be
interpreted in the future and how I see this playing out is even if EMC
determines in their scientific capacity as the best, and I agree here,
is the best source of where we’re gonna be going that the regime between
the feds when they put something substantive truly in place and the
state program, when they determine that that is adequate, yes, but that
there are better practices out there that they wanna incorporate the
term adequacy will be used by folks arguing who oppose any increased
burden or rule that EMC is without jurisdiction and authority to create
rules above the minimum, and that’s where I think is the problem

  <p id="085:00">
  I don’t think that there’s a problem, that there’s going to have to be a
minimum. I think the amendment does take care of that. The problem is, I
think it sets the minimum as both the floor and the ceiling at the same
time. And that’s the problem, and I think that’s exactly where we’re
headed here, and that’s why I opposed the amendment, not because it
doesn’t set a floor, I think it does, but because it now sets the floor
as the ceiling as well. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, the Chair intends to recognize
Representative Reives in support of the amendment, and then
Representative McElraft , the bills sponsor and opposition. Rep Reeves,
you’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I did just have one question
of Representative Hager to follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does Representative Hager yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. Yes sir, I yield to all questions Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And again, reading this, Representative Hager, if the
amendment were to pass, is there anything with the way 820 was written,
that would keep the EMC from looking at the state and federal
regulations, and then writing their own rules, but basically cut and
pasting and adopting all those rules?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Reives, I can just answer this way. I
can only answer what’s in the amendment and knowing what the intent of
what, me as a sponsor carry the Senate Bill 820 through this Chamber. It
says if they find them inadequate, then they can write their rules.
That’s what the amendment says. That’s what the amendment that I put in
says. If they look at state and federal guidelines and they say, “these
are not good enough to cover” as Representative Harrison says, methane.
So we’re not going to adopt those, or we’re going to adopt those and
write our own, on the methane issue.” That’s what this amendment says.
That’s what you’re amendment would take out, their ability to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I now intend to recognize first Representative
Harrison in support of the amendment, and then Representative McElraft,
the bill’s sponsor and opposition. Representative Harrison, you’re
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Actually, Mr. Speaker, I have a very quick
question of Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does Representative Hager yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Hager, I’m trying to figure
out how this will play out. So the deadline here says permits can start
to be issued and applications can be effective March 17. If we have the
permit applicant files and we don’t have any error rules in place, and
maybe a year hence, the EMC does adopt strong error rules, are those
permit applications going to be grandfathered into the earlier, weaker,
rules?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harris, I think that’s a question for
the experts in the EMC, but if you asked me personally, I think we have
a set of guidelines that if we find out the federal and state are good
enough, then I think that solves the issue. This gives them the ability
to do that with the EMC and Mine Energy Commission involved and also I
think that’s a question more situated to ?? folks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, and to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady from Guilford is recognized to debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, I just don’t want to beat this up too much,
but I do want to remind folks that all the promises we made to the
citizens of North Carolina back when we initially adopted Senate Bill
820 with all those requirements, we adopt these rules. We told the state
we were not going to move until we had the strongest regulations in
place, and I believe this goes back on that additional promise. We did
it last summer, on a quick vote, and now we’re doing it today on another
quick vote. In the Mining and Energy Committee has a sub-committee
looking at these air quality rules, and I think they are unlikely to
move. I think what this does is it sends a signal from the legislature
to the EMC that they can just ignore the EMC’s requests. I just think it
sends the wrong signal. I think we had a strong mandate. Adopt these
rules, protect the public health, and now we’re saying, okay, it’s
optional. I strongly urge you to vote yes on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Carteret,
Representative McElraft rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the motion on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Folks, I have a statement from the Deputy Director of
the Department of Air Quality. He’s been attending our meetings, and he
said, “at this time a regulatory framework is in place and sufficient
for covering air emission sources at Shell gas development and
production facilities.” Okay, they continue to look at what other states
are doing, and at this point they have found no other states that are
doing anything really more than what we are, but if they do find that,
they can go ahead and make a rule. This does not keep them from making
rules. These are the people we have put in these positions. These
environmental positions, scientists, our Department of Environment and
Natural Resources. These are the folks that we trust.  The people that
have the knowledge. That is exactly the people we need to be making this
decision. They are putting a baseline monitoring station up in Lee
County, the anticipated next--
