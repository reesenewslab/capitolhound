committee on elections will please come to order. Members, our first
bill today that we're going to take up is Senate bill 258, which is the
Asheboro charter amendments. This is Sen. Tillman's bill. Is he going to
present it, or Rep. McNeill, are you going to be speaking- There's Sen.
Tillman over there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tillman, we are glad to welcome you to committee of the upper
chamber over here, and glad to have you here, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As my elder statesman who used to be Randolph ?? down here for about 40
years, Rep. Brubecker was welcoming me to the lower chamber, so I'm now
in the upper chamber's committee and I'm glad to be here. In fact at my
age, Rep. Michaux, we're glad to be anywhere.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a very simple bill dealing with the Asheboro charter and it
codifies into law the- Mr. Chairman, you are ready for me to go, aren't
you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm ready for you to go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're too tall of a guy to want to stand in the way anyway so you just
do what you- You or John Torbett start speaking, nobody's gonna stop
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ready to go means out the door.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Last time I spoke five minutes and talked myself out of a bill. I'm
going to say you've got the bill in front of you, if you've got any
questions I'm going to answer them. I'm not going to talk anymore, this-
basically what the city of Asheboro wanted to do, and I'm glad to carry
their water. They're good folks. A little charter change, saying the
police chief and the fire chief don't have to live in the city anymore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any discussion or debate on the bill?
Seeing not, Rep. McNeill's recognized for a motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir Mr. Chair, I'd like to recommend the committee give favorable
report to Senate bill 258.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You've heard the motion. Further discussion, further debate?
Seeing none, so many as favor adoption of the motion please signify by
saying &quot;Aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those opposed, no.
The &quot;aye&quot;s have it, and the bill is given a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Come back and just report those good kind of comments on
behalf of the House.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The next bill we have is Senate bill 325, members we-
Chairman Lews has a sign up sheet, Rep.  Lewis if you'll hold that up so
the members of the public can see it, any members who want to sign- any
members of the public who want to sign up to speak would be asked to
sign that. We're going to give members of the public 3 minutes to speak
on this bill for those who want to. That being said, if I were called-
this is a PCS,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman? Question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman may state his question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is this bill for vote today?
I will defer to the bill sponsors, my understanding is that it is for a
vote today, yes sir.
The question was raised and I believe Chairman Lewis talked to Rep. Stam
and the thought of the proponents of the delegation was to have a vote
today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a PCS, there's a PCS-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was getting ready to make that- accept that motion.
Rep. Avila? Is she in this committee?

Wake County school board districts, I believe Rep. Stam is going to be
presenting the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I could present.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What we're speaking about, because there are changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, the gentleman has the floor to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
This is a redistricting bill for the Wake county school boarding
district. What it does, first of all, is to change the elections from
odd numbered years in November, when we have 5 or 10% turnout, to
November of even numbered years, where we have 60-70+% turnout. That's
the number one thing it does. The second thing it does is provide that
every citizen of Wake county, or every voter will get to vote for 2
members of the school board because there's 2 sets of districts. There
was a feeling for a long time that if you couldn't</p>

Speedier representative mark Udall with the one district in the mood
than other district to Judith were being represented the one really
feasible to allow the county this large to have countywide elections for
everybody to be too expensive so what this does is give too sensitive
for two regional sap and then the individual said the original criticism
of the bill (SPEAKER CHANGES) was the cause we're changing compliant
even got we were shortening terms for democrats and waiting terms
republicans will this be changed because the 82013 elections will
forward on those members shore up and 13 will still run in the old
district's ability of three year terms instead of four year terms in the
new districts go into place in 2016 and for the seven members in the
individual districts still go for four year terms in the two region as a
staggering of the two of regional districts would be in the late 18 and
22 seven index of indicate some of the changes from the spole to bill
the senate plan if you recognize survivor of the minute the region

undisciplined on its own their own members speak on the issue and Jerry

issue that if you use a modem can get a simple answer all this is a
nonpartisan election is nonpartisan election and it would be like
morality in November of the even numbered years to write a set of the

get to the public works and Ross which the church, V, Mr. Chairman I had
some comments about the delegate L7 amendment to ensure that your Serb
automated mailing set forth in their data that would be good, thank you
Mr. Chairman(SPEAKER CHANGES)  I also wanted noted for the record attack
on even though the public has been invited to speak not a single member
of the weekend school board is available to speak to the A because their
interviewing candidates for new superintendent AM to come I think it is
particularly inappropriate to take up appeal to the facts terrible word
win a majority of that award a publicist of L A not a single one of them
is available to be here and speak under the committee can hear from them
and I think that in the light of day when we try to do things stand
above port manner and there's plenty of time before the end of this
session to not only have a committee meeting, when you came here from
that IE E's Salaam at the very least on a new preschool just to let you
know for the record our school board is supposed to dispel NMS sites
devoted they can hear CMFNPR greater wily chamber of commerce is
supposed to dispel the nine shared with you in e-mail that we received
from on their education committee chair you can go into their website
the reason why they are opposed to the bell is because we have had some
instability in the lake county school board NBC stability in the school
board has not only good for education that good for commerce and
attracting people to do business in lee county and more instability
creates more on basically incisiveness among corporate citizens to mind
when it comes to North Carolina said this isn't just the kind of liberal
democratic issue of our chamber of commerce would not receive a display
of the audit thing that I think it's important for the committee to L
E's N2 with the public and majority of our school board in lake county
redistricted D scary CC 2 years ago so we had a republican school board
meeting cells contract with outside counsel who is now employed by the
state of North Carolina P, $40,000 I could maybe a little bit last four

Step over the district's even though it's a nonpartisan election said
this will now be the second coming in a four year period of five that
the districts are redrawn god's creating confusion among a RC descends
AM, it's simply not necessary to delegation of republicans and democrats
could have come together in just added two at large seats to the school
board there was consensus about that or handed T C's one representing
half that anyone representing the other half of turning left the issue
of having two people to vote for or is one that we wanted to solve and
we will all willing to solve and what is completely unnecessary in the
spill is redrawing the lines for the seven current school board members
to get medical awards that certain people don't like and can be here to
speak for themselves so si told two the school board is against it are
chamber of commerce is against it and I think we need to find out
whether the CSX lovely county are four events and with that(SPEAKER

…if they could just help clarify the purpose, part of that purpose. It
seems to me that the two at-large districts that we’ve drawn you could
still be voting for a school board member that is not in your district
if your child went to a magnet school or somewhere else.
My question is, like when you serve on the city council as an at-large
member all the members can vote for you, I guess if you could, just tell
us why you decided to have two at-large districts where you could still
be voting and not be a member versus just two overall at-large which
would ensure that parents are voting for the person that represents
them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, thank you for the question. Actually they’re not really two
at-large districts. We call them two “regional districts.” At-large
meaning the whole county and each regional district represents about
half the county.
Originally what we planned on doing, we wanted to have four at-large
districts. But the rationale opposed against that is it’s very expensive
to run a countywide race. So we really wanted to narrow it down so that
you only had two people running in larger than an individual school
district. So that’s the idea behind it is to keep the cost of running at
a reasonable number so we did two regional districts as opposed to two
at-large districts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions or comments from the members of the committee? I think
we’ll open it up to public comment at this point.
I’d ask the Sergeant at Arms, if you want to check, if you’ll call out
the names as they are listed. Did anyone sign up? OK. Is there anyone
who wishes to speak on this matter? I see someone coming forward. If you
would come forward and introduce yourself and we’ll hear from you. If
you’ll press the button there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m Caroline Sullivan and I’m on the Wake County Board of Commissioners.
I urge you all to put this to study committee please. When our Board
looked at our legislative goals for this year, this goal was a
four-three vote and what the majority wanted was five at-large
countywide seats and four district seats.
The explanation was that they wanted all voters to be able to vote for
the majority of the school board. Just so you all know, in Wake County
every member of the Board of Commissioners runs countywide. So there are
seven of us that do run countywide. I just finished running countywide.
The Senate passed a school board election bill that looks nothing like
what our Board majority wanted. Instead of five countywide at-large
seats we have these two super-seats which will end up segregating urban
and suburban voters and urban and rural voters which was not the intent
of the Board of Commissioners’ legislative goal.
Additionally it redraws the lines in a way that splits even more
precincts than were split in 2010. This is going to cost Wake County
taxpayers $240,000 to reprint and re-mail new voter cards for all of our
county’s voters. Not to mention the extra expense that will be incurred
extra ballots for all of the new split precincts.
We can add two at-large seats so that we’ll have two countywide school
board seats, you can do them staggered so that every year you get to
vote for somebody in your district and somebody at-large. We can do that
at no cost to the taxpayer, we can simply add them on.
If we can leave the lines the way they are, add two at-large seats, it
will accomplish some of the goals that the majority had. So, I urge you
to not vote for this expensive and divisive bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further comments from the public?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have planned to speak. My name is Joe Bryan, I’m Chairman of Wake
County Board of Commissioners and a past President of the North Carolina
Association of County Commissioners.
The majority of the Wake County Board of Commissioners is in favor of
this bill, Senator Hunt, and now with the changes being made as stated
will allow the people the potential to vote for two people on the school
board as well as for the public to participate and have greater turnout
and greater representation from the public actually at the voting booth
in the fall.
This is a great improvement about what exists today. We’ve had so many
people come to us and say, “I don’t have the chance to vote for one of
my school board members, they’re not responsive.” This improves on the
system that exists today and we would urge you to vote favorably on this
bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

<p id="20:00">
Good afternoon. My name is Claire Barnett. I’m an attorney with the
Southern Coalition for Social Justice. My organization represents
several Wake County voters who are dedicated to making sure that
redistricting plans are fair and legal. Anita Earls, our Executive
Director, submitted a letter to the Senate Redistricting Committee on
March 25th as part of the public comment process opposing this dramatic
restructuring of the board. I have copies of that letter if it would
please the committee. The current Wake County School Board, currently
unaltered, complied with federal law and has been used successfully in
the past election cycle. There’s no clear justification or rationale for
this action beyond the obvious partisan advantages that come with the
new plan. Equally important is the fact that the second redistricting
flies on the face of our state policy, which is to redistrict every ten
years. By redistricting twice in four years, we add to voter confusion
and increase the de-stability in the process. Finally, our organization
has reviewed this legislation and we find that it violates the equal
protection clause in the United States Constitution and the one person,
one vote principle. The two super-districts have an overall population
?? of 9.8% without any legitimate government rationale. The
seven-district plan similarly has an unacceptably high population ?? of
7.82%. This is in contrast to the current districts that have an overall
population ?? of only 1.66%. Also, the current districts are more
compact than the proposed districts and better accommodate the school
attendance zones for existing communities. For example, Lacey and Martin
Middle Schools, which are in the neighborhood where I grew up, are in
two different districts even though they feed into the same school
district. Same with Daniels and Broughton being in two different school
districts. Finally, we know that Wake County taxpayers’ school funds, or
tax funds, were expended just in 2010 to redraw these districts, and
it’s an unnecessary redrawing of districts that will add for more
confusing to all voters in Wake County, and we urge the board to
reconsider its proposal. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Is
there further comment from members of the public? Seeing not, we’re
going to now come back to Representative Ross, who has sent forth an
amendment. Do all members of the committee have a copy of that
amendment? We recognize Representative Ross to explain her amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. As the committee
has heard, there is a lot of division within our community about whether
or not this is a good idea, and we have had some school board
redistricting bills come through this committee this session where that
kind of divisiveness occurred, and what the members have done is have a
referendum on the new redistricting before it would go into effect, so
basically set up the redistricting but have a referendum before it would
go into effect, and if the people want it then they can vote yes, and if
they don’t want it they can vote no, but then at last you find out from
the people how they feel about this type of redistricting. The county
commissioners may have heard that they want this redistricting. I
haven’t heard from a single person that they want the redistricting, and
as a matter of fact I’ve heard again from many members of the business
community that they don’t want this redistricting because of the
uncertainty it creates in our county at a time when we’re just starting
to heal from some of the past problems with the school board, both
sides. So for that reason I think it would only be fair to our citizens
to allow them to weigh into this before it went into effect, and I
recommend the adoption of the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I would ask the committee to reject the amendment. You’ll
notice that it’s in November of 2014, which means that the folks whose
terms according to this bill would be three years instead of four years
would not even really know what they’re running for, and one of the
problems if their terms are cut short is what happened in Guilford
County – ya’ll remember that from two years ago – and then you get
lawsuits about that. I’ve found out around here that if you oppose a
bill, you stick a referendum section on it, but we do have</p>

Mr. Chairman may I ask a question, please.
Would it be in order to move to postpone this to the sixth, to the sixth
at four PM?
The gentleman may make such a motion. and the motion is debatable. Does
the gentleman make such a motion, that the bill be postponed to a later
date?
To June the sixth at four PM.
The gentleman has moved that the vote on this bill be delayed to June
the sixth at four PM. The gentleman from Representative is recognized to
debate the motion.
We oppose the motion.
OK. Further discussion and debate on the motion. Represetative Ross is
recognized to debate the motion.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just think that it would be considerate of
the body that this affects to allow them to be here.And I call for the
ayes and nos.
Is the call sustained? Seeing not. The call is not sustained.
Representative Hall,for what purpose did the gentleman seek recognition?
To debate the motion.
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion to postpone.
I would say specifically to the members, that none of the school board
members are here today, the very people that this bill affects. The
reason that they are not here today is because, I am sure you are aware
that we have to replace our superintendent today, since Taddaleth..
there is three people up for that and they are in hearings and meetings
today When this bill directly affects those school board members,I hope
you at least give them a chance to come and have a say on their
elections.
Further
Mr. Chairman, I would like to raise a question for the chair. You asked
for those to stand, and it only takes one-fifth.
That's correct sir.
I thought I saw one-fifths standing.
I saw four folks standing, I just looked and that's what I saw. so...
My seatmate says that some of them don't move that fast, Mr. Chairman.
[Laugher]
Well, I will be glad to entertain the request once again, and I'll...
Wait, Mr. Chairman, I would be glad to sustain it on the bill itself. I
just don't think it was sustained on the motion to postpone.
I only saw four on that. Does the lady truly desire a roll call vote on
the motion to postpone or only on the bill itself?
I'll grant you a roll call on the bill itself.
I'd like it on both please.
OK. Is the call sustained for the division? This time it was sustained.
Alright. So. The question before the committee is the motion by
Representative Flloyd, to delay consideration to June, what was the date
again?
