<p id="00:00">
Let's get this party started. I'd like to welcome you all to the House
finance committee and I would like to thank our pages today. Nathan
Riddle, Daniel Tally and Hannah....please pronounce your last name for
me, dear.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, I wouldn't have gotten there and I
appreciate you being here. And I'd like to thank our Sargent at Arms,
Mr. Hines. Mr. Sills. Mr. Brandon and Mr. Clampet we appreciate your
continued support in this endeavor  and thank you for being here.
Members of the committee, your here because your obligation is to being
here but we're glad to have you here as well. At this time, we will hear
Representative Brody's bill, House bill 421. Marchville de-annexation.
Representative Brody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,  Mister Chairman.  Pretty basic bill.
Marchville is very excited about this because they need to de-annex a
property in order to annex...voluntarily annex another of a business
that's coming into Marchville and they're seeking de-annexation that's
supported  by the resolution from the town of Marchville and I can go
into the details if you wish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At the appropriate time, I believe that Representative
Brody has all the proper documentation. I move for a favorable report to
House bill 421.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, you heard the motion on the
floor. Any further discussion? If not all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All oppose? Motion carried. Thank you Representative
Brody. We're glad you’re here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  You're welcome to stay if you like. And we can all
understand why you wouldn't want to. We'll now have House bill 857.
Public contracts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, we do. Senator Moffitt moves to have the
PCS before us for discussion purposes. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All oppose. Motion carried. Thank you Representative
Arp, please present your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you members of the committee. This is a bill
that is a consensus bill. We worked on it with the North Carolina League
of Municipalities, the North Carolina Association of County
Commissioners, the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce, the Carolina's
AGC, the subcontractors, the electrical, mechanical and plumbing
association, the American Chapter of Fire Sprinklers  Association, the
North Carolina Institute of Minority for Economical Development, the
architects, the engineers, the UNC General Administration, the
governor’s office and the Department Of Administration, the state
construction office, the state treasurer and the minority of interests.
These are the folks that we've pulled together to have a consensus bill.
What this bill does it allow three additional contracting methods
available.  We've had many, many bills come through here that are one
off designed billed bills and even a public private partnership that’s
been approved, this time. What this does is take those concepts...those
contracting methods and utilize them on a state wide basis. It allows
this to be used state wide. What we've done is for the infrastructural
delivery options. It's for all non DOT work. So, this deals with things
like procurement of facilities as well as waste water treatment plants
and things of that nature. It ensures fair equitable open ethical
transparent and quality based contracting procedures. It allows design
build, what we call design build bridging, which is a hybrid in public
and private partnerships. If there's any questions...I'd be glad to take
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Churchill, do you have anything to add to this
explanation? Alright, question is on the committee, Representative
Stone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, good morning Mister Chair, I just want to let
everyone know on the committee that this bill was in government and I
have to really commend Representative Arp on his hard work. It came back
twice. He pulled because he wanted to make it better. He went out...the
governor did came out in support of it. It's a great bill and at the
proper time I'd like to ? the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Stone. Representative
Alexander.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to join the stand to move this one forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Representative Hager. Representative
Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. The question I just have,
I guess, for staff. Ms. Churchill, will this bill mean that we will no
longer have to have the jurisdiction by jurisdiction bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Churchill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No,  that takes care of it, I think. Saves a lot of
time. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative ...</p>

<p id="05:00">
question to the sponsor[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Arp, yes please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Assuming I'm the small contractor normally small
contractors are left out of design bill projects, tell me why I should
like this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well because we actually went back
there and put in small business contracting incentives and
recommendations for them to seek out small business entities we went
back and did that. I'm a small business myself and that's specifically
the point that we went back in and encouraged the local government
entities to address that issue in their contracting methods and make
sure that's a part of the team and actually the qualifications of the
team to be selected. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
you're saying not just the members of AGC which are generally larger
contractors but also smaller contractors will like this also. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We've got the buy in from both the AGC and the subcontractors
as well as the architects and engineers which are even smaller groups
than that as well as myself. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative Holley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman I just
wanted to commend the committee on a lot of hard work because I know
this was hard work and it is going to be a real good basis now for the
departments to be able to make purchases without having to come over
like you said one at a time and piecemeal to do some work and thank you
very much Representative Arp for your work on this. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Ms. Holley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Ma'am. Representative
Hamilton. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I agree with Representative Holley's
comments, I'm just sort of curious can you tell me in a nutshell just
how it's different from what we currently do because I know that
currently we allow design bill in the state. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No we
don't and that's the point. Design bill is what we call a single
contract, before if a government entity let's say wanted to build a
building they would contract with the architect or engineers and that
group they would design the plans and give that to the entity and then
the entity would then bid that out to the contractors. There's two
contracts with that, this is what we call a single contract that allows
the government entity to go to one other entity and contract together
but what we do is put in there all the prevent all the what we call
sting factor the brother in law deals, the arms length open transparent
way to do that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok thank you so much for that explanation so this
would allow an architect, engineer and a builder essentially to bid on a
project together. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Using quality based selection and a procedure that
addresses all of those concerns. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative Ross. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, first
question do we have a bill summary. Is there  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
It's on the back of the second piece yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't , we
don't have it and it may be because we don't have the PCS and it may be
because we were late so I appreciate that. The next question is how does
this bill treat historically under utilized businesses. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Let me go back and what this bill does is doesn't change any
existing law. What we did was craft these new contracting methods and
part of our line is to stay within so the governmental entity has
established those goals this refers to those same goals and says that
you have to state that as part of your request for proposals. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Ma'am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
wanted to know there are some people in the audience who have
traditionally had some thoughts about design build and P3 projects and I
see Mr. Simpson and I see a few other folks and I'd just like to know
what their view is or their views are on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Ma'am. Please approach the mic and state your name for the record
and answer Representative Ross's questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm Dave
Simpson I'm with Carolina's AGC association of general contractors.
Thank you mr. chairman, thank you Representative Arp.  Representative
Arp has done a magnificent job of bringing together so many people in
fact he said during some of the negotiations I don't know how I can talk
to anybody else. One of the things Representative Ross to answer your
questions specifically that we're seeing is a spate of local bills that
come out each year and there's hardly any kind of language there they
can just do it local governments can this would allow for a competitive
bid process a lot of sunshine and we think it's probably the best deal
that you can get. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Good Morning my name is Henry Jones I represent the mechanical
plumbing and mechanical contractors</p>

_____ in your districts, and, as you know, we've been before you many
times, not supporting Design Bill, but this Bill, we think, is a much
fairer approach than that death by a thousand cuts that Representative
Luebke was talking about, each jurisdiction doing it separately, and we
commend Representative Arp for doing this in such a fair, open fashion.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I'm going to circle back
to the question of the involvement of small businesses and how any
evaluation is done to ensure that small businesses at least get what
they're getting now, as far as consideration in the contracting process.
 Is there anything in here that improves that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, Representative Hall.  What we've done is--in
fact, current law doesn't have small business in there.  What we've done
is actually put that in there, and if you look on the last page, where
it relates to the minority contracting procedures and so forth,
specifically on Page 13, you see some language, the public ownership
will make a good faith effort to comply with GS 143 and to recruit and
select small business entity when selecting a construction manager at
risk.  That same language is in the Design Bill and so forth, and so it
touches on both the minority contract and the small business.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up.  Is there anywhere in this Bill where you
define what the elements of good faith are for the compliance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That's already determined in terms of the minority
business contracting, and so we didn't change any of that language.  The
same contracting language that exists in current law, which deals with
good faith effort by governmental entities as it relates to the minority
contracting, those same things still apply.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Final follow-up.  Thank you Mr. Chairman and
Representative Arp.  I appreciate you entertaining these questions.
Final question.  Has your research, or did any of the small business
organizations come to you and indicate that they thought this improved
or increased the participation of small business as opposed to our
conventional way of contracting?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Early on, that was a consideration and point of
contention, and we agreed that this language addressed those concerns,
so much so that we went back and put it in the CM at-risk statutes, and
so, being a small business owner myself, I am acutely aware of that, as
well as various contractors as well.  That's where the language came
from.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  Any further questions from the Committee?
 We have a motion from Representative Stone for a favorable report for
House Bill 857.  _____ PCS, unfavorable  _____ original Bill.  Yes, sir.
 You've all heard the motion on the Floor.  Any further questions?  If
not, all in favor say aye.  All opposed?  Motion carried.  Thank you
Representative Arp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.
{SPEAKER CHANGES]  At this time we will have the PCS for House Bill 936.
 Representative Reives.  Oh, Representative Faircloth.  And
Representative Davis moves to have the PCS for House Bill 936 before us
for discussion purposes.  All in favor say aye.  All opposed?  Motion
carried.  Thank you Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.
This is a Bill that arose out of request from hunting organizations,
particularly the Bowhunters organization in North Carolina, and it also
was done in coordination with Wildlife Resources Commission, and it
speaks to the concept of poaching wildlife, and basically that is the
taking of wildlife or the destructing of wildlife, or in some way doing
illegal actions that endangers the wildlife population in our state.
The legitimate hunters are very much concerned about this, as are a lot
of other people, and it is a relatively simple Bill.  What it does is
establish in the State Treasurer a wildlife poacher reward fund, and the
monies coming into the fund come from the violations paid into the court
by people who violate the wildlife laws.  A percentage of the
compensation paid annually...</p>

Through a charter, and it requires these expenses to be paid in a period
not to exceed three years. Be glad to take questions. Representative
Starnes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, now I'd like to offer an amendment that's being
passed out at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee will be at ease until the amendments are out to the members.
Do all members have a copy of the amendment? Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. There was a law suit several years ago in which the charter
schools spent years, and hundreds of thousands of dollars. They took it
all the way to the Supreme Court, and they won, and this just codifies
the language, putting into the law what they fought for in the courts ??
read your adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions, comments? Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could staff explain that in particular just to how this would impact the
public school units?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Kara?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe fiscal staff may be better able to explain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Doubtful, but I'll try it, Mr. Chair. Brian Madison with fiscal. In
response to your question, Representative Luebke, what the amendment
appears to do would be to place some tighter restrictions on the funds
that LEAs, or local school districts may budget for the purposes of
transfer to charter schools. So you see the items that are removed here,
such as the indirect costs, fees for actual costs, et cetera. Those
would then be subject to the subsection 2, the local current expense
fund and be required for pro rata transfer to a charter school within
that district.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. Thank you, and do we have a fiscal note in terms of what the
impact would be on LEAs to shift dollars under this amendment from the
traditional public schools to the charter schools?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, no we don't. We had looked at this issue quite extensively
back in 2011 when similar language was being considered, and we were not
able to estimate a specific local transfer. If we were to do a fiscal
note for this again, I don't think we'd have information available to be
able to speculate as to for all of the existing charter schools, and all
of those charter schools that may be coming down the road, what might be
in some of these other funds. They range from anything like bake sales,
newspaper sales, or student newspapers to federal appropriations that
may or may not appear, and it's totally a local impact within the local
public school system, it's just the share of the pie that is transferred
from the traditional public school district to the public charter
schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, I know I'm not able to ask for
fiscal note any more but it seems to me, particularly if there already
was one in 2011, that a fiscal note ought to be updated given that there
is a fiscal impact on, say, the Durham Public Schools that our DPS -
Durham Public Schools - will have to allocate additional monies to the
charter schools within Durham county. That is a fiscal impact, and as
you know Mr. Chairman, for that a fiscal note is needed. So, I don't
understand how we can move forward with this bill today without a fiscal
note.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Well, when they won the court case, the school systems were
supposed to go ahead and start doing this, and so really your school
system should already be following the law after the court case. So,
going forward, I'm not aware that there's going to be any additional
fiscal impact, is the way I understand it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, just for the memory of the members, this provision was in the
Senate-passed &quot;Senate bill 8&quot; two years ago, and it was in the
House-passed &quot;Senate bill 8&quot; two years ago, and all the
information then - it didn't get into the conference report, just
because of... Maybe the word isn't &quot;threats,&quot; but emanations
from the government. So, it's not like we haven't seen this and didn't
understand the fiscal impacts, and of course Representative Lubke, any
money that goes, goes to other public schools. It doesn't go to private
schools, or anybody else, other than public schools.</p>

...businesses the same principles that apply to other business. Let the
donor decide and at the end of the day, as Skip says, school systems
will still have most of the dollars and the children in charter schools
will get about 70 cents on the dollar, as opposed to about 60 cents on
the dollar. It is eminently fair and it's consistent with what all
businesses throughout this country and this State must do under general
accounting principles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Robert Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question of either Representative Starnes or staff.
Does anything in this amendment affect State funds? The way I read it
it's local funds and federal funds. Is there anything in it that affects
State funds themselves?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll have to defer to staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, this is just a, or the impact here is, as
the member said, local and federal, other sources. No State funds are
involved in this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? I'm sorry. You said no State funds are
involved?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes? Representative Samuelson?
Representative Hanes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. I'm a co-sponsor of this bill and I'd have to
stand with Representative Collins right now and his last statement. I'm
a little confused now at what's going on here. But I would like to have
Ms. Winter to respond to Representative Stam's question with regard to
funding. I don't remember exactly what the question was at this point,
but there was a statement made with regard to funding sources and you
didn't get a chance to respond to that and I'd like to hear your
response to Representative Stam's question, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, LeeAnn Winter with the North Carolina School
Board Association. When charter schools were developed by the State, it
was with the understanding that the charter schools would go raise the
money themselves for their capital and thus, there is the restriction in
the statutes that capital funds are not shared with the charter schools.
Either at the State level or the local level. But that we would share
our local current expense appropriation. There was no definition of what
the local current expense appropriation was. The understanding coming
out of the General Assembly at that time was that that meant the money
your county commissioners appropriated to you. The first case got filed
which was the Delaney case out of Asheville and the North Carolina Court
of Appeals, and none of these cases have gone to the Supreme Court. The
North Carolina Court of Appeals at that time said that the local current
expense appropriation equals the local current expense fund, which is a
term of art used in the chart of accounts for schools. That triggered
all the other litigation as to what is that fund to and thus, the final
determination coming out of Sugar Creek too, was that any money that
touched that fund we had to share. Even things like State funds coming
from NC pre-K. And so that's when the General Assembly said no, that's
not what we meant. They're our special funds and we need to create a
place to put those special pots of money. For example, the NC pre-K
money, we do get some federal appropriations, ROTC that go directly to
school districts. People who give grants or give money to schools
typically do not put designated restrictions on those. So for example,
when you do fundraisers through your PTA and your PTA then gives the
money to your schools, they don't say it has to, a letter doesn't come
with it that says it has to be spent this exact way. There's just
already an understanding. And a lot of those State and federal programs
or grants from other outside entities do not have those legal documents
that would have to be created to go along with all of these things that
are stipulated in the new underlying language in the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Stone?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I'd like make a motion for a favorable report for
the Starnes amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Stone. And I believe there's

Thank you. I just want to be very brief. I just heard the word share

Oh, I'm sorry. I'm from High Point, North Carolina. I'm a co-founder of
a charter school in High Point. I heard the word share used several
times. The only thing I can say is that it's very difficult to share
something that doesn't belong to you. That's taxpayer money that's meant
to follow their children in the public school system it's traditional or
charter.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All members have a copy of the amendment? If you don't, please raise
your hand. [pause]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I worked on this Representative Starnes. He had
another amendment and Representative Blackwell had a concern and
basically we merged our amendments here. Representative Blackwell had a
concern that if on a ballot initiative money was raised for a particular
students to be used in a particular school district that the voters
might have been misinformed as to the use of that money. So, rather than
striking the language on lines 11 through 13, which is in the underlying
bill, we don't strike it; but then we limit it to the cases where the
language on the ballot approved by the voters specifies. So, I move the
adoption of these amendment. Maybe it's just clarifying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hardister.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just for clarification, I've spoken with
Representative Stam and I do support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions from the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, this question is for the amendment and the bill and pardon my
ignorance.  I don't quite understand this bit about the funds going
outside the tax district. Can you take 30 seconds and explain that?
Somebody?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. The original—this reversal is what we call the Nesbitt amendment
where – well, let's not go into history, but if that's what it does –
[Crosstalk]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Too late, too late. Please proceed. [Background laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A child lives in Ashville, but goes to a charter school outside
Ashville, but in Buckham County or Transylvania County. The whole
concept of the charter school idea was that money would follow the child
and whether is 70% or 80% or 90%, whatever it is should follow the
child. So, this is saying that if you have a supplemental school tax, it
will follow the child to the school where that child is being educated,
but not if the language on the ballot approved by the voters to raise
money for it if there was such a ballot specifies something different.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions or comments from the committee? [Brief pause]
You've heard the motion from Representative Stam to adopt the
Stam-Starne's amendment; a match made in heaven. All in favor
say---Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just have a question. So, I can send my child to a charter school in
another part of the state and have that money come from my local
jurisdiction?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, because you paid the taxes to contribute that to the fund.

But if the taxes may have been different from the jurisdiction that I
was in to the jurisdiction that I'm going. So, there may be some varying

this bill of this bill, the Eastern region was developed at his funeral
the history before go for the visa regime was developed to push the
concept of the global transport the global transport was it an idea that
came up twenty years ago. they said within ten years. this global
transport area in Eastern region. there went up foregoing and fifty
three thousand jobs was twenty years later, and there unbelievers about
two hundred jobs. there which were taking taken from some other areas of
the state, so there's no no net gain in report hundreds of millions of
dollars into this thing bottom line is the counties have the right to
withdraw from the region, but the monies that they have in the in the
long fund I take out until the whole thing falls apart and what this
bill is asking is that if a county decides to withdraw from these the
region that they get their portion of the money the thirteen counties
are several counties that are considering withdrawal are several of the
counties have started their own economic development teams and they want
to use this money to out to further their economic development because
they don't feel I could get anything from the global transport site
object via that want one gallon and the global test market in any eyes
of many of the counties has been a huge failure. obviously it had it in
my twelve years without a business plan if, after 9/11 they decided I

Understands it, but over the, the five years from '94 to '99 there was a
five dollar tax, special tax and this money was generated and it is
being, to the tune of 14.8 million dollars. Who has control of that 14.8
million dollars?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Griffin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, the Eastern region, which is the municipal corporation established
via the, the statutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not sure I'm speaking on the bill or Global TransPark, but I, I can
tell you that the Global TransPark has been a real disappointment for
all of us. It was a vision that never came to reality. We have, the
state has put millions and millions of dollars down there, and I do
think right now the Global TransPark is trying to do better than, than
what it did in the past, but I can understand why the counties would
want to take, take their own money out and use it for their own economic
development, if the member is telling me that this Eastern region is for
the promotion solely of the Global TransPark. Is that what you're
telling us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it's for, it's was, it was created to push the Global TransPark.
That was its main purpose, but it does claim to be for economic
development throughout the region, but its focus is on that Global
TransPark.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does that, a question for staff, does the, does the Eastern region also
receive other dollars other than, well, they're not receiving these
dollars. They're just a holding company, but do they receive other state
dollars or.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am. I'm Aubrey from fiscal research. They do receive an annual
allocation along with the other six economic development partnerships.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then, Miss Chairman, if I understand this right, you're not asking for
any distribution of that annual money that comes. You're only asking for
the money from the taxation of the, the vehicle. Miss Chairman, I move
that we give this bill a favorable report and perhaps encourage the
other counties to take their money out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Howard. Representative Bill Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. I do want to be clear, the money that we're
talking about distributing is only funds on deposit, and it's not money
that is loaned out that would require the recalling of the loans.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee will be at ease for a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I got a couple more too, so it'll.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can't wait.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess the other one would be, will the state be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wait, wait, wait, let's not put another one out there just yet, because
the people that could answer it are thus engaged. Miss Trina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Had to consult there. So our understanding is that it would vary by
county, whether, whether any of these, the assets are encumbered through
loans, and the bill could probably stand to be clarified to say
something along the lines of unencumbered assets could be distributed if
that was the will of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, a second question. If these distributions are made, will the
state then be liable for additional funding to support the Eastern
region or the Global</p>

TransPark?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You do have some interesting questions, Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I would say no. I don't think there's anything in here that obligates
the General Assembly to appropriate additional funds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, sir. With the withdrawal of counties from the eastern region cause
the failure of the Global TransPark, and would we have liability?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I can answer that one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
It appears to a lot of the counties that that's already happened. The
failure of the Global TransPark.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
If I may clarify my question. Would that end up with a bigger bill for
the state for the cleanup?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
?? for a moment.
Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I just wanted to ask Representative Speciale a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
All right. I'll get back to you in just a second with the answers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Do the members, the other members who represent the other counties in
this region, are they supportive of this bill? Because I see that you're
just the primary sponsor all by yourself. And so, there are a lot of
other counties involved and I just kind of wanted to know what your
colleagues think about this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK, this was one of the first bills I submitted. I didn't know about
co-sponsors, you know, getting other folks on board, so I'm a freshman,
so that's my... I haven't contacted the other 13 counties. This would
apply to them, if they chose, if this bill passes, if they chose to pull
out they would get it. They're not required to pull out, this doesn't
mean that anybody is going to pull out, it just gives them that option
should they do so. As far as I'm concerned, this is a jobs bill because
a lot of the counties...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
... A lot of the counties have started their own economic development
teams, and this is money that they could use. Right now it is sitting in
a pot, not being used.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I understand that, Representative Brawley. We've sort of got out of line
here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The Brawley question hadn't been answered, they're still working on
that. Let's try another one, Representative Brawley, and we'll get back
to that one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I think, while they're working on that one, I'll tell you what my train
of thought is coming from.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
My degree is in accounting and occasionally that rears its ugly head.
This is going to create a situation much like the dissolution of a
partnership, and when one does that distributions to the partnership are
limited by the potential losses on disposal of the assets and potential
liabilities. The only concern I have with this bill is if a county
withdrawals, takes all of their money out, and then it turns out that
the liquidation of the assets leaves a shortfall, essentially the last
county to head for the door may end up with a big bill rather than a pot
of cash. So, if what we're talking about doing is dissolving the eastern
region then let's do it in an orderly manner so that no one's injured.
Otherwise, I have some concerns about the unintended consequences of
this being structured the way it is, because one, if other people are
told they share encumbered funds and they can't get them out, then are
they going to sue Craven for part of the cash that Craven got, make
Craven take over some of the liabilities?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Chairman, I guess it behooves us all to read the bill closely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
On every point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
First of all, I'd like to withdraw my motion and speak to that
withdrawal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I guess I was focusing on the money that was in a fund from the original
five dollar taxation, and I still feel that that would be fair that the
counties that are in that region that participated in that fund, if that
is just sitting there and it is unencumbered, that that should be
permitted. But I don't think, I think we had some legislation last year
by other members that tried to pull their county out of the region and
take their money, and... Chose. I am not supportive of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Howard, Mrs. Griffin had something to add to what you
were saying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
We were just going to try to address some of the questions raised by</p>

<p id="60:00">
Representative Brawley. I guess this bill, as it allows the counties to
withdraw their portion prior to dissolution, but as the summary sort of
alludes to, the statutes provide for the dissolution of the eastern
region and happens upon termination. In other words, in the situation
where if every county were to withdraw and the partnership were to
dissolve, the statute provides what happens in that situation and it
says that amounts loaned for a project in a county are allocated to that
county to the extent of its beneficial ownership. There are several
provisions and it says that amounts not allocated are allocated among
the remaining counties in proportion to the amount of tax that they
collected and the remaining counties become the owners of the right to
repayments of the amounts loaned in proportion to the amount of tax they
collected. What we’re trying to say is the statute contemplates and sets
out what happens upon dissolution if all of the counties were to
withdraw. As to the question of what amounts are loaned out and which
counties had encumbered funds, we would probably have to contact the
eastern region and find out more information for you on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was regarding the Brawley question. Representative Hamilton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is probably another question for staff,
but of the monies collected from the $5 fee, it amounts to, I think you
said, roughly $14.5 million. How is the interest from that money
utilized? Does it go to pay off debt liabilities, what happens to the
interest accrued and how is that currently being used?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re double checking but we think that it goes back into the fund and
then I would suspect attributed proportionally to the counties. We have
a breakdown of how much is attributable to each county, but that’s also
something we can double check. Aubrey, did you have anything to add on
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say the interest is taken from the amount that they are
allocated on an annual basis and distributed on a proportional scale
back to the other six. It’s taken into account in terms of their annual
allocation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The subcommittee to the left of me can outside any time they want to.
Representative Hamilton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the answer. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So if one county pulls out, how does that affect the distribution? I
mean, will other counties see a reduction in that interest collected?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hamilton, repeat that one more time please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If one county leaves and takes their proportionate share with them, does
that reduce the interest collected that’s currently to benefit other
counties? How does that affect the partnership, I guess is what I’m
asking.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was meaning in terms of the other six partnerships that also receive
an annual allocation. If a county were to withdraw, that would decrease
the interest. That would be taken into account of the annual allocation
to the other six partnerships.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Rodney Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Miss Howard answered my question so I’m satisfied.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is probably a question for the staff. I’m to
understand that in statute there is something about the dissolution of
the go between spot, that there’s some statutorial procedures of how
that would go about. But there is not anything for if we allow one
person to come out early? Or is that currently in the statute that
that’s not permitted without coming through here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The current law provides for a county to withdraw, however, they can’t
take their share of the money until the entire region is dissolved. This
bill allows them to take their share prior to dissolution and upon their
withdrawal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, this money is money that the purpose of this money is to loan to
the counties for economic development. They’ve stopped loaning this
money to the counties so it’s sitting there. The counties want that
money so they can use it for economic development which is what it was
intended for in the first place. If, for example, Craven County pulls
out and gets their portion...</p>

And we’ll give Craven County an opportunity to get into their own
economic devilment program and I would move for a favorable report.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Howard:
[Speaker Changes]
I just want to be sure that I understand this.  Staff of just told rep
Carney that Craven pint county would be due 1.5 billion dollars out of
the 14.2 or what.  Is that just from the 5-dollar taxation during that 5
year period?
[Speaker Changes]
Yes mam
[Speaker Changes]
We’re clear and it has nothing to do with the annual allocation to the
various regions?
[Speaker Changes]
Correct
[Speaker Changes]
Is that correct?
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Blueky.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, I don’t think this bill is ready for prime time. And let me
explain why if I may speak on the bill.  I agree with rep Broollegy, Ger
Howard, Carkey, there is just lot of questions about this and mines a
little different and it’s this” lets say that Nash county comes up with
a economic development project but it has decided to be on its own. Now
I think we all know, certainly rep Collins knows that Edson county is a
much poorer county than Nash county. And you go down the railroad tracks
in rocky mountain and to the west is Nash county to the east is Esihon.
With your bill it allows Nash to pull away, Eshion stays in there and I
don’t understand how we have a regional development for eastern north
Carolina when you have Nash running its own operation, Edisons still in
the old system, or even Edege county pulls apart then you got two
bureaucracies that have to talk to one another and clearly
representative Collins knows this if a factory comes in to Nash county
there is going to be people form Edigin county at a minimum who ware
going to be applying for the jobs.  So I think if you think about the
stress that eastern North Carolina a faces I don’t’ think this is a good
idea and I think it was suggested that you run the bill or amend the
bill so that just craven county can pull its self away
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Howard is working on an amendment that may
[Speaker Changes]
I’d like you to consider that how you’re splitting up the whole region
when we need regional development and not county by county development
thank you.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Moffit.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. chair. I have a question for the staff if anyone’s
available.  If craven pulls out of the eastern regional, does this
result in a reduction of the appropriation for the eastern region?
Yes sir. Raven counties portion as based on the tier development
designation.
Thank you Mr. chair I have a question for the chair
If this does affect an appropriation does this is this bill still
subject to cross over?
I think it would be within the digression of the rules chair if this
needs to go to appropriations that would prevent it to be subject to
cross over.
Representative Ross
The committee here could recommend a serial referral to appropriations
based on what we think it’s impact would be on the budget and then you
keep it alive and you can work on it.
We have a couple options where we’re definitely running out of time we
may comply with house rules we will not comply with senate rules
perhaps. And we have the option unfortunately that in order to help the
member this committee will meet again in the morning at 8:30 to hear
this one bill
Thank you members of the committee there will be no further business we
stand adjourned.</p>
