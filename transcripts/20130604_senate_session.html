Let us pray together. Lord, as we gather today we want to respond to you
by saying thank you. Thank you. We thank you for the opportunity to
bring our voices forward, for the opportunity to represent the people of
this great state, for the positions that you have given each man and
woman in this chamber to have great authority. We pray that they use
that authority as a blessing, and with meekness and with gentleness and
with poverty of spirit. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
see God. I know Lord that it gets hard. But Lord, sometimes that heat
drives us to our knees  and it's in that place where you most like to
meet us. So season each senator today as you season with salt and shine
your light upon them that they might be the light of the world. But you
have ?? to be into their own unique ways. And it's in the name of Jesus
that I make these prayers. Amen.

House Bill 279. Transfer environmental permits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. What this bill does is it adds to a list of
departments that can transfer permits at foreclosure or in probate, to a
new owner. Currently ? permits, building permits etc. are allowed, but
there’s no provision in state law to allow DENR permits to be
transferred along with property. This allows those permits to go along

Thank you Mr. President. The engineering law or board now requires an
eight hour exam on paper is moving to paperless. This basically asks for
them to be able to take this on computers  and not have to sit the long
writing exam, if you will. It also changes a couple of things on their
character references, the number they have to get etc. And allows some
changes with the people in the GIS section and the mapping section with

and I do also, thank you.

[Speaker Change]
Yes sir.
[Speaker Change]
I’m a little perplexed. We've been hearing about activities in patrol
cars for the last two three years. I’m sure it’s gone on for hundred two
years. Does this Bill only apply to drinking?
[Speaker Change]
Well the way the Bill is written, yes sir. It is alcohol content in the
body.
[Speaker Change]
It would be a little late in the amendment because this is the final
show on this Bill. I’m not objecting to third reading. We’ll cover that
later.
[Speaker Change]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator [??], what person do
you arise.
[Speaker Change]
I would like to ask, I believe it’s a serious question.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Randleman, do you wield?
[Speaker Change]
I will yes sir.
[Speaker Change]
I know that, that some medications have alcoholic content and I remember
from a long time ago when we debated some of the DWI laws. If in fact
somebody’s cough syrup or something else that just has a small amount
alcoholic content, is there now safe harbor for people who might get,
because  if they have an accident the first thing that would happen is
they would be tested. And if they show up point o one or some number
that clearly has no negative effect, does not impair one’s ability,
technically they would be in violation statue as it is. Did you talk
about, or in the House, did they talk about any safe harbor for somebody
who has a legitimate reason for having some alcohol that really does not
impair them or affect them in any other way?
[Speaker Change]
Thank you for the question and my opinion the department would consider
those facts before they consider whether the person was preforming their
duties under the influence of alcohol or not. There are some pending
cases already where people had been operating but there were other
circumstances that brought the issue forward.
[Speaker Change]

Senator Newton is recognized to explain the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President. Apologize for Senator Goldsss distraction. This
is a fairly simple Bill. It passed unanimously through the House. It is
a Bill that allows for public water companies to be able to pass on the
cost that they receive from, from third parties. For example, if the
company gets a rate increase on the municipality where it gets its water
it can pass it on without bringing a rate case. The public staff of the
Utilities Commission fully supports it and I know of no opposition to
the Bill. I’ll try to answer any questions.

Thank  you. I am proud to highlight an outstanding UNC student athlete
who was named the first Sports Illustrated Female College Athlete of the
Year. In her freshman year, North Carolina’s Loren Shealy became the
school’s first student athlete to be named a Robertson Scholar. The next
year she was the second leading scorer in the 2012 NCAA Tournament
runner-up field hockey team.
But her most recent accomplishment, Sports Illustrated Female College
Athlete of the Year might be one of her most impressive. Early in the
spring Sports Illustrated Executive Director and a group of his
colleagues began a search for the perfect college athlete, one who
embodied both the best qualities of academics and athletics.
By the end of their search, they found Shealy, “We were looking for
somebody that really had that balance. We saw that Loren demonstrated
the best of both worlds. She seemed to excel in everything she did.” We
are very proud of Loren Shealy. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a Senatorial Statement honoring the life of Dr. Richard Malcolm
Fields. Dr. Fields was a dentist in Pleasant Garden for 43 years. He
also served on the Guilford County Board of Health for 15 years and he
also led the efforts to incorporate Pleasant Garden and served as the
first Mayor Pro Tem.  I would like for us to adjourn today in the memory

Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, you have the floor for a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and for the Members of the House, when I first
came upon this I thought it was a Democrat problem, but the more I look
at it I think it’s a problem that we all have. As you know, House Bill 4
passed in February regarding how we would deal with jobless benefits in
the future and it goes into effect on July the 1st.
I’m sure we’re all trying to deal with that in a different way because
there are going to be 70,000 people who will lose their benefits. The
remainder of them will have their benefits potentially cut substantially
and we’ve all got to explain that to the people affected.
Then we discovered, I discovered today, that on Monday, all of our LAs
were invited to a meeting by the Administration who passed out talking
points on how to explain what they had done. Now, it’s fine for somebody
to send me talking points. It’s fine for somebody to come in and sit
down with me and talk about talking points.</p>

<p id="50:00">
It's not fine for them to have my LA requested to go to a meeting,
informative meeting where they are given talking points and told how
they should respond. Those LAs are your employees. I don't have any
right to tell yours what to do, nobody's got any right to tell mine what
to do. And when you look at the talking points and this was done by Bill
Falwell who, I thinks in charge of something over there, two pages and
it tells us all these things we're supposed to tell them. And for the
Democrats, I would've added on there Senator Berger's number and Speaker
Tellis' number and the governor's number and said call them, they're the
ones that did this, we didn't vote for it. And we'll be added that to
our seat, by the way, our LAs. But I thought I need to bring this to
your attention, I never seen this here in all the time I've been here,
where you can imagine if this had been a lobbyist who had done this and
in my opinion in this case it's no different that a lobbyist doing it.
It's somebody in the administration pushing their agenda and wanting us
to explain it for them and instead of talking to the members who are the
ones who do the explaining, they call your LA to one side and whisper in
their ear and I think somebody needs to put a stop to it and I thought
I'd bring it up. You might not be as sensitive to it now as we are, but
you oughta be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further business to come for the senate. Now the chair
recognizes Senator Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, I move that the senate do now adjourn in honor
of Dr. Richard Malcolm Fields. Subject to receipt of messages from the
House and the governor, the receipt and rereferral of committee reports
and the referral and rereferral of bills and resolutions to reconvene on
Wednesday, June 5th of 2013 at 2pm.

stated by Senator Berger to reconvene Wednesday, June 5th at 2 pm
seconded by Senator Pate, all in favor will say aye
