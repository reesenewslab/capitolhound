...internet, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I'm glad you watched it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It was on the internet, so it was on internet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, it must be true. Right?
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? opinion, I think.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. First of all, I appreciate you all being here
today. I will try to go through a number of things. A lot of this is
technical. A lot of it detailed. We'll try to leave enough time to
answer questions you have, but today, what you've been waiting for for a
significant period of time. We unveil our vision for tax reform in North
Carolina. It's tax reform that will help spur economic growth and
provide for the people of North Carolina the largest tax cut in North
Carolina history. We expect that implementation of this concept will end
up with a $1 billion tax reduction over the course of three years for
people of North Carolina. And this means a tax cut for hard working
families and a tax cut for job creating businesses. And ultimately, the
goal is to provide the capacity for the private economy in North
Carolina to create jobs, because that's what we're all concerned about
and that's what our people want and need.
Our unemployment rate presently is the fifth worst in the nation. Over
the past decade family incomes have fallen and this General Assembly has
pledged to reform our State, reform our tax code, get things turned
around and that's what we're working hard to do.
We have, over the past two years, begun the process and have our fiscal
house in order. But the single greatest challenge we have now or the
single greatest change we can make for North Carolina is tax reform.
Our current tax code was written in the 1930's. This tax code was
written in the depths, for the most part, of the Great Depression. The
world has changed dramatically since then, but our tax code remains
stuck in the 1930's. Failure to reform our tax code has cost North
Carolina. We're standing still while other States move forward. We're
falling behind and taxes, our high taxes, are a big reason for that.
We've looked at the fastest growing States in the country and we found a
common thread. In those States that are growing, that common thread is
low taxes and in many instances, no taxes on income. Presently, North
Carolina State government receives approximately 60% of State revenue
from some form of income tax. Whether it's the individual income tax or
the corporate income tax. And that's the money that people and
businesses earn. And for individuals, the State, in many instances,
takes that money right out of their pocket before they even have a
chance to touch it.
The current system, as you read through this book, and I'm sure everyone
of you have a copy of it and you've looked through it, the current
system is riddled with special interest exemptions and loopholes that
give tax breaks to a favored few, while regular folks pay more. In other
words, this is not fair. It's not fair to the people of this State. It's
not fair to the State as a whole. Other States, States that are thriving
economically, in many instances, tax consumption or spending. That's a
fair approach for taxing, because everyone pays something, everyone has
control over how much they're taxed. The more you spend, the more you
pay. The less you spend, the less your pay. That's why we're proud to
unveil this fair, sensible vision for reform that will, as I said,
provide the largest tax cut in North Carolina history.
The tax fairness plan is a three year plan to put over a billion dollars
back  into the pockets of North Carolina's hard working families and
encourage job growth by providing tax relief to those job creating
businesses in the State. The plan will substantially reduce income,
corporate income and sales tax rates for North Carolineans. Give you an
idea of how that works. Presently, in North Carolina for individuals,
you pay 6%, 7%, up to 7 3/4% and you get to that 7 3/4% number as an
individual tax payer at $60,000. Corporate tax presently is 6.9% and our
combined sales tax for much of North Carolina is 6 3/4%.</p>

...and with members of the House of Representatives. We're committed to
working together with them to incorporate their ideas into what will be
the first comprehensive tax reform in North Carolina since the 1930s. We
know that the people of this state will have questions. We know that you
probably will have a question or two as well. We want their input and we
eagerly await the input that we receive from them. People can, if they
have questions about the plan, visit the website nctaxcut.com to learn
more about the plan. The plan also has a calculator that individuals can
utilize to see what their tax cut, what their tax situation will be upon
implementation of this plan. It is, as I said, a concept and a plan.
It's a work in progress. We will continue to work with the governor,
with the speaker, and with members of the House of Representatives to
craft a comprehensive plan that will work for North Carolina. Will work
for the people of North Carolina and will make us more competitive on
the national scene. With that I'll turn it over to Senator Bob Rucho and
Senator Bill Rabon. They may have a couple of comments and then we'll
take your questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Berger. Good to see everybody here
today. Senator Berger pretty much outlined what we were talking about,
but I want to reiterate something very, very important. And that is the
fact that under the existing tax system that is based in the 1930 model,
which was as eluded earlier, a depression model, also the fact that this
was a manufacturing economy years ago and unfortunately we've lost that
in North Carolina, and also across America. We'd love to try to
revitalize that, if possible.  We're seeing some very serious facts come
forward. One, if you look at per capita income as an average of the US,
it is declining from 1997 til today. And it is today at 1986 level, and
is continuing to decline to the 1970 level. That means that everybody's
paycheck is less. If you want to look at it medium household income, and
that is from the NNO report, that is declined over the last decade.
Again, people's paychecks are less. You're also seeing, despite the fact
that we've had huge government assistance programs, whether they be
Medicaid or all of the assistance programs on the federal and the state
level, we've seen poverty increase. And that is something that we're not
happy with at all. And then, cause we believe something very important.
The best way to fight poverty is with a job. And what this is all about
is creating economic growth and jobs. And that's what we got elected to
do and that's why Senator Berger and myself, and Senator Rabon, members
of the Senate, and hopefully the Governor and the Speaker and the House
members will join us in fulfilling our campaign promises. We're also
seeing a decline, or an erosion, of the sales tax base. What was
happening in the 30s, that was when two-thirds of your GDP or your
economy was based on selling goods, it's completely reversed. Today,
one-third is actually goods and two-thirds is service industry. And the
way our tax policy is, it is based on taxing goods only. That's like
running on two cylinders in a six-cylinder car. You can't expect to get
any type of traction or speed, and in our case, economic growth in jobs.
And the last thing that Senator Berger brought to our attention was the
fact that we are fifth highest unemployment in the country. Unacceptable
by any standards. And therefore, we believe that this plan when fully
implemented, will allow us to meet the needs of the people of our state
and give everybody an opportunity for a job. Senator Rabon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Rucho and Senator Berger. And thank
you all for coming in today. To reiterate what Senator Berger said, this
gives our state the largest tax cut in state history. And tax reform is
going to help the working families that are struggling. It is going to
provide more and better jobs, and higher paying jobs. I do want to touch
on one fact about our plan, and that is that this is going to make North
Carolina competitive and better than our neighbors in attracting new
businesses and in taking care of the hardworking people that live here
and in bringing industry to our state. If you look at the timeline and
think about what Senator Berger said, you will see that over the next
three to four years we are ratcheting down every single tax rate in the
state. And that is a very strong, good leap, and a good, a good
direction for us to head in. I think that we will be the envy our
neighboring states. And I think you're going to see very good things
come to North Carolina as a result of this plan. The framework that we
have established...</p>

<p id="15:00">
I believe it's a solid framework. We've work on this a long time. We
haven't jumped into this. We have taken our time. We've been step by
step by step. We've looked at everything we could possibly look at.
We've asked from input from the business communities. We have asked from
input from our municipalities and our stakeholders, if you will, in the
state.
We have what I feel is a good comprehensive plan. One we can further our
discussion with the house and with the governor and move forward. It is
a good day for North Carolina as Senator Berger said and I'm very proud
to be apart of this day and to be a member of the Senate taking these
steps. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will take your questions.  Scott.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You mentioned the B2B transactions. Did I understand you say that the
way you would determine that is if a customer was a payer of the
franchise tax that is how it  be—that's how you would limit the B2B.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One of the things that we are looking at is expanding the base of the
payers of the franchise tax to include LLCs. By making a modification of
the current two hundred dollars that they pay to the Secretary of State
and having that money or whatever the fee would be go into the general
fund. Then those folks would register, get a tax certificate and with
that tax certificate they would be exempt from the B2B transactions. On
the expanded base, again.
There's also a provision that would exempt capital purchases from the
sales tax. Currently, some capital taxes are subject to the sales tax,
but that sales tax is limited in many instances so we would exempt
capital purchases there. Some definition so that would go with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you or Senator Rucho talk about why you feel like that is a good way
to try to go about creating this kind of [inaudible]??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. That's a good question. As Senator Berger alluded to, what
this does is registers every business in the state. In doing so, no one
can quantify, but there is a significant part of our economy that is the
underground economy of people that choose not to pay taxes and do
nothing. By moving forward with this plan, registering every business
and by giving them the B2B exemption; if they register, you know that
they are participating in the system. If a business chooses not to
participate in the system with a consumption based tax as described
everyone will pay that tax and therefore, one way or another, they are
paying into the system. Again, what that means is talking about
fairness. Everybody should pay something as Senator Berger alluded to
and that's what that particular part with the registration in the
franchise tax will accomplish for us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Scott, one of the reasons for the B2B exemption is the ratcheting effect
that you have when you pay tax on the business inputs and then the final
product is taxed as well. So, you exempt the B2B and tax the final
product.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you feel like it's double taxation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's double, triple, quadruple. The pyramid is involved.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to follow up on Scott's question. Do you have estimated what's the
cost of that in the big picture?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have an estimate. We've been working with the Department of Revenue.
It's our expectation that the implementation cost, if that's what you're
getting at--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The B2B.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
About $5 million is the implementation cost is the estimate that we've
received from the Department of Revenue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the B2B exemptions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the moving, the tax plan as we have kind of outlined overall. I don't
know that the full $5 million is just for the B2B.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe I'm not getting to your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Don't you want to know how much you spent that to bring in by bringing
in all those additional businesses that are not getting the franchise---
[inaudible crosstalk]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is it a net gain or net loss or--?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The base gets broadened by about $60 billion dollars. Is what I
understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On just the franchise or also on the sales tax that they would be paying
on service?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How many services do you plan to tax and what kind? Are we going to tax
everyone that's being taxed in another state like the Senate proposed
earlier?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's one of the things that we are looking at.  The current concept is
that if a service is being taxed in another state it would be apart of
the expanded base. Things like attorneys, accounting...</p>
