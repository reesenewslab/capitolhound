the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate chaplain. All members and guests in

dwells in the shelter of the most high will rest in the shadow of the
almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress. My
God, in whom I trust. Surely He will save you. He will cover you with
His feathers. He will put you under His wings and in Him you will find
refuge. His faithfulness shall be your shield and ramparts. So once

the family of former Governor Holshouser, who served this great state

[Speaker Changes] House Bill 147, to amend the adoption laws.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Barringer is recognized.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President. This bill amends the laws for
family law regarding adoption. This comes from the North Carolina Bar
Association family law council. For the most part it is a group of
technical type amendments that eliminate redundancy and help with
missing statutory references. It does have some particularly substantive
law involved, for example, in a situation where a stepparent has agreed
to adopt the child, and there is a death before the adoption is final,
it allows for a procedure to make that happen. There are several other
procedural clarifications within the bill, I recommend that you support
it.

amendments.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Allran is recognized.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr, President. House bill 333 makes two
clarifying changes to the current law pertaining to registration
requirements for persons subject to the sex offender registration
program. The first clarifying change is that a a person who is released
from a penal institution is guilty for failure to register if the person
fails to register with the sheriff in the county designated by the
person as the place where he or she expects to reside upon relief. The
second clarifying change is that the person arrested for failure to
register is subject to the jurisdiction of the judicial district that
includes the sheriffs office in the county where the person failed to
register as required. I know of no opposition to this bill. Thank you.

[Speaker Change]
Senator Randleman is recognized.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, the senate version of
House Bill five forty three has two parts. The Bill prohibits a
corporation from being appointed as a guardian for any individual to
whom provides mental health, developmental disabilities, or substance
abuse services for compensation as part of a contract or other
arrangement with any other entity. It adds to the exception of
individuals who contract with or are employed with by  entity that
contracts with a [??] for the delivery of mental health, developmental
disabilities, or substance abuse services who serves as guardians for
wards. These being a licensed family foster care provider or a licensed
therapeutic foster care provider. The language also allows an individual
who is biologically unrelated and who was serving on March One, Two
Thousand Thirteen as a guardian without compensation for guardianship
services. Lastly, this Bill requires the Joint Legislative Oversight
Committee on Health and Human Services to examine the impact of the
nineteen fifteen bc Medicaid waiver. The Department of Health and Human

motor vehicles have towed. This simply, and they might not have a clue
of where the vehicle is when they’re contacted. This makes mandatory
that law enforcement is notified and they know where, they should know
where vehicles are when the request comes into them. Thank you.

[Speaker Changes] Send forth rule 29, please.
[Speaker Changes] Send forward your note.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Tucker moves to amend the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Tucker is recognized to explain the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President. This amendment here simply
clarifies that in the bill the net savings calculation in House Bill 628
cannot be used for existing requirements in other statutes for energy
saving contracts. In the original bill we had a 10 year limitation and
that gave some, for lack of a better term, heartburn, to those folks who
have energy saving agreements with state universities and others. Most
of those agreements go out to 15 years, so this amendment simply
excludes those agreements.
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion or debate on the amendment ?
Hearing none, questions for the senate?
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President?
[Speaker Changes] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] To see if Senator Tucker will yield a question?
[Speaker Changes] Senator Tucker do you yield? He yields.
[Speaker Changes] I do.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Tucker, was this run by the House Sponsor? Are
they okay with this?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir, and she was pretty rigid on the ten year
commitment and with the net savings agreement we’ve excluded those
agreements that go out 15-20 years.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir.

discussion or debate? Senator Tucker, anything further?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir. Just to explain the bill unless you otherwise
don’t want me to.
[Speaker Changes] You have the floor.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you sir. This bill came out from Representative
Presnell in the House, she was very concerned about the exclusion of
North Carolina Timber from energy efficient buildings. Primarily lead
buildings within the state and public buildings. So she brought forth
her bill and then everybody, as we know sometimes happens around here,
came out of the woodwork on it. But we have been able to reach a
compromise and everyone seems to support the bill, that would be the US
green building council. So leads does stay in, architects support it,
the timber and the steel and concrete industry and all those industries
that have certified their employees and shops to be able to do lead
construction and on this environmental bill i did want to note, Mr.
President that Senator Kinnaird and I will be voting together.

slight amendments to it. We're really gonna do a pilot program, give DOT
a chance to study how they can save %10 in some of their facility
management, in costs and operations. They'll report back to us.
Hopefully they'll find some cost savings. One thing that this will do is
allow them to take that money and reinvest it in some other
transportation needs as allowed by statute. Appreciate your support.

putting in, or adding to the traffic on a road had to pay for all the
improvements themselves. This will allow others hooking on at a later
time to share in that as they go down the road. It's a very good bill
and sponsored by the department. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's really somewhat of a technical amendment and the way this bill is ?
right now in these type of cases you wouldn't have to make findings or
facts or conclusions of law if the parties consent to agree upon it, but
also add language to say that it could be mutually binding upon both
parties so that each party would be restrained from participating
against the other one, taking any adverse action within the confines of
the law in this area. It's pretty straight</p>

but the bar association had no objections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on amendment one. Senator Daniel, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. I appreciate Senator McKissick’s amendment and
I understand what he’s trying to do, I would just advise the members
that a lot of negotiation...whenever you have a bill that involves
domestic violence issues, there’s a lot of interest groups that have a
role to play and there’s been a lot of negotiation that has gone into
the original version of the bill and I guess I would have to represent
to the body that the bill’s sponsor from the House is opposed to the
amendment and the Coalition Against Domestic Violence is as well. I
think primarily because it would give the non-movement or the
perpetrator in a victim situation sort of the same rights as the victim
who filed the original domestic violence motion. I would ask the members
to vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate. Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What this amendment essentially do, and it makes all the sense in the
world to do it, what you find in these domestic violence cases maybe
initiated initially by one person, but it may be because that person was
the first to race to the courthouse and take the paperwork out. If you
have a situation where both parties are consenting, and this can only be
done with the consent of the parties, we’re not having findings of fact
made or conclusions of law made in these type of cases. It also makes
sense to restrain both parties. Otherwise, if only one party is
restrained, the other party that is not restrained is free to initiate
as much contact, as much action, whatever they may want to say, whatever
they might want to do, whatever they might want to incite. It makes all
the sense in the world to also allow these orders to be binding against
each person so neither will threaten the other one, neither will annoy
the other one, neither will commit any type of act of domestic violence
against the other one. As I say, the bar association has no objections
to it. And it would be simply done with consent. If parties can’t
consent to it, then it wouldn't occur. If they do consent, then
sometimes that’s exactly what you want to keep both parties in a
situation where one is not initiating contact trying to incite the other
one to violate an order. It keeps people in kind of a level playing
field.

he stood up strong and forthright, how he was principled and did an
excellent job during his tenure as our governor. Thank you.
