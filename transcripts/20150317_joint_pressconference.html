If if that&#39;s the best - off of -the- an unhappy as saint
patrick&#39;s day and for those reasons were out EU grain you need if
you need is something the console a form
of commercials a member of the folder listing the home were lively oh, a
resident Larry Holden friendly the house of representatives stated, this
morning and were
you to talk about expanding democracy in north carolina&#39;s and of
course one of the ways we do they use they&#39;ll all be eligible
citizens to call him the question is
always with his eligibility, (SPEAKER CHANGES)you know we have an
engaging in our constitution and the U.S. constitution that both be able
to build and we got a couple of deals to
restore us to look there are all open and free elections where the
citizens also have the right to vote in this preserving guarantee to
them with me is so that some
of my enemy is it as well as revenue volunteers, told the Baltimore
planners tosses on both of the deals will talk about today regarding
college ID and so authorization
for voting as well is that extending the building. Early voting.(SPEAKER
CHANGES) Back to his initial in intended. All part of the mission so
they would be adding an additional week,
again the president by Sierras is unable to join us this morning though
the primary sponsor all the fields and about a simple and as we go for
talking about with
these bills do with their relatively simple meals, the one to allow
college identification; write the requirement really does one thing to
do with our students and
our colleges and universities in north carolina&#39;s who will do so
safely the same identification and proof requirement that anyone else
goes him divide the allow so
that they could go selling it to Bellevue court here with why
they&#39;re been member there was a great discussion previously about
allowing college of identification to
be you, in meeting the voter identification requirements for voting , is
you may recall a new city state colleges and universities were going to
be allowed to use
their voter ID against Iraq if patients to qualify for voting subsequent
to that the apparently in an effort to keep product, using university
from being the voters
will pay stub of the authorization for,(SPEAKER CHANGES) said these are
universities and state colleges to be you so we&#39;re asking you to be
restored in all of our colleges and
universities have an opportunity for their students war Mage to detail
identification to be able to one used in identification in the voting
process now we know will
approximate 218,000 folks to build failed boulder ID from the department
of motor vehicles from those arrested, 218,700 registered voters no
heavy and the issue
that the sole they would not be able to pull this as a multiple of the
disputed league is that the 18 to 25 year old and build a number
2001800050044000800 are
18 to 25 years old who are registered voters will soon be an adult baby
of the issue but the thing so we have a large population of both seldom
should be able to
build who are enrolled in colleges and universities and utility bill
world, we have 102,000 north Carolinians or people were students
enrolled in our county&#39;s
universities and community colleges across the state of the global
people their age ranges, gold you know from 18 even updated some cases
on shun but that is a lot of
people we make it more difficult note that in the bullpen effective are
these basically, set aside requirements of education, and their college
or university and
the chill that deal house bill 240 allow mobility, Debbie Toomey already
requirement that is what is their best impact we see it having him go
again..............

  Speaker Changes:we bring many many folks into the process which is we
should have process that encourages our citizens choosing their leaders
choosing the policies that were carried out o be in the future i want
Representative Lucas and Representative pears to gov eon the college id
before they get into voting
Speaker Changes:?? i think those many young women and men came into our
state that our future leaders surely want the future to participate they
are the brightest many young ?? come into that process i would
understand that like off me not that opportunity to understand many of
us we already know state and out state we participate in their ?? all
they are North Carolinian&#39;s and one to in north Carolina i think we
also give the opportunity to participate those re brightest ?? those are
future leaders so let&#39;s give them a chance to participate so
let&#39;s give them  better Chance so at a early age they start
participate into political process Thank you
Speaker Changes:Voting is not only  responsibility it ought to be
privilege we ought to everything that we can to encourage the
participation and that voting experience  Marvin Lucas ?? county we have
to give recognition to our students and it seems to me that any form  of
benefaction of photo that i understand photo id is all about to identify
 student so they won&#39;t so i would quite understand why would accept
student id since it has  picture has proof of the voting experience i
ought to be whole responsibility of ?? state to ensure that everybody of
the opportunity to vote and that everybody who is eligible to vote
participates in the voting process and this simply expects that how
about ?? people won&#39;t they just want to be ?? identify  picture id
does verify who the voter is as we don&#39;t understand that why we
don&#39;t allow that
Speaker Changes:?? s they go through the background checks process and
all that great job and i agree with it these students ?? they go through
the scrutiny of the school to ensure that background check anything at
least is necessary bring him into school i think we do great job with
that  also
Speaker Changes:wanna move out to our next billing in this and i north
Carolinian&#39;s to give more ?? as our state into their election
process and the government as we ?? supposedly work for them and how you
re gonna decide and ?? all employ and making employing decision which
making to come bout you know the right to vote is the ?? democracy so we
have to do everything we can to make north Carolina as way as to
available  as we talked bout the college id&#39;s we talked about the
colleges and strict scrutiny we give to the students on the many
students mind in just what we get a DMV you should license but at the
same time think of the cost in the accessibility states that have
provided so we don&#39;t have long lines in DMV as just tom take people
provided to meet the impact as just as to ?? examination process has
been issues and id that would be sufficient so it is user friendly it
saves tax dollars it makes voting more accessible and in that should be
our responsibility wanna talk bout early voting now the bill house bill
we have talked about early voting days out might recall when we first
met and early voting one of the big features of it was that it allow
more people to participate in the process and make the time it objected
we created early voting periods and created longer lines created more

  ...a barrier to people voting. We think we should go back and really be
the state that is about access to democracy, and to do that not only do
we need to make sure that people are allowed to vote who have provided
their identification that&#39;s available, but we should also make the
place available for them to vote in a timely manner. Nothing could be
worse than to someone who has their identification and and these other
new- and have met the requirement of these other new laws to get to the
polling place and have to stand in line for a period of time longer than
their lunch hour or the time between getting off work and having to pick
up their children. That is discouraging, that will prevent people from
voting, and that certainly should not have been the intent although it
is the effect of what has happened. If that was not the intent, we say,
lets restore this additional time to early voting. No one was harmed,
the board of elections folks have indicated that it made for a smoother
process, the expense was no greater they had the personnel to handle
that flow during that period of time. So in this bill what we so is
restore the early voting process.  That one week that was taken away,
and allow people again the flexibility to both maintain their
employment, still be able to pick up their kids from school on time
without paying additional fees for being late to pick their children up
and still have the flexibility on the weekends before to vote early and
participate in the process. If our citizen are in the process, then they
feel they&#39;re vested in the process, they&#39;ll participate more,
we&#39;ll have better elected officials, and we&#39;ll have a better
government that all the citizens feel they are a part of. Representative
Lucas?
[NEW SPEAKER] This bill&#39;s intent is certainly about the expedition
process. It should not be a burden to vote. It&#39;s just primary just
elementary physics, I think, that if a person wants to vote it should be
the responsibility for those who are sequestering those votes to make it
as expeditiously convenient as possible. Standing in long lines is not
the way to do it. I see nothing wrong with a longer period for voting.
That would distract from the long lines. We&#39;re doing with with
absentee ballots, and I don&#39;t know why we can&#39;t do it with early
voting. Certainly there is not as much scrutiny with absentee ballots as
you will find with the early voting process. So we need to do that,
let&#39;s make it convenient for folk to vote, let&#39;s encourage folk
to vote. I just read this morning in the media that the state of Oregon
is going to allow folk who register vehicles to be allowed to register
to vote at the same time in fact they will give them registration
materials there. I think that&#39;s being proactive. North Carolina
would do well to adopt a philosophy similar to that of Oregon, I&#39;m
not suggesting we ought to do the same thing but let&#39;s at least make
it a proactive process where folk are encouraged to vote not discouraged
to vote. Thank you sir.
[NEW SPEAKER] ?? has a saying, a vote-less people is a hopeless people
and I think we could have an opportunity to participate in the process I
think it gives them a psychological, if nothing else that they do have a
stake in what&#39;s going on and going back to what Representative Lucas
talked about I think on that part, too, Representative Lucas I think you
did make a point about that they would be able to register- but they
didn&#39;t, something about being able to vote online, whether
that&#39;s good or not, I don&#39;t know but I think these other states
are being really proactive on making sure all their citizens have
opportunities to vote and participate so I think we&#39;ll do well as
Leader Hall has said to give people every opportunity to be part of the
process, thank you.
[NEW SPEAKER] And we have from Common Cause Bob Phillips here, I
don&#39;t know if he has few words he wants to say about the voting
process as we&#39;re trying to make access more available.
[NEW SPEAKER] I&#39;m Bob Phillips with Common Cause North Carolina and
certainly our organization supports making voting easier, more
accessible and maintaining integrity. We do work with a lot of college
students and I know they will be harmed by this law that does not allow
them to use their college ID. I find it interesting that the archives in
the administrative building, both have securities that you have to go
through security stations and they will allow a college ID to be able to
you can use that to get through. So I guess to what Representative Lucas
was saying, it seems rather odd when allow a young person...

  A college student to make a transaction, to get into sporting events, to
buy things on campus using that photo ID. Even getting into an office
that houses the Governor&#39;s cabinet. And we won&#39;t allow them to
use it to obtain a ballot to vote. I think these proposals are great. I
think they&#39;re going to help make it easier and more accessible for
folks to vote. I support them. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At this time we&#39;ll
take questions that you might have about either of the two bills. Yes,
ma&#39;am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick question, Leader Hall. What we heard
last year from the last election is that actually early voting was up.
Despite the fact that there were fewer days, more people managed to vote
in them. And so they&#39;re saying that that is proof that it did not in
fact discourage people from voting, that people came on and voted
anyway. What&#39;s your response to that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s
similar to the idea that some people say it snowed on Christmas, so that
means when it snows it&#39;s Christmas. Because more people showed up
because much more effort was used to try to get people to squeeze into
this smaller period of time, and people suffered a lot more
inconvenience in order to exercise their Constitutional right does not
mean that was a success. That means the people bore the burden and spent
immeasurable resources, which is what the examination should have been.
How much were the wait times on line? What did that calculate into lost
earnings and inconvenience to people should have been the measurement
that was taken. Just making those kinds of anecdotal remarks doesn&#39;t
really paint the full picture. Again, if in the shortened period many
more people voted, then let&#39;s go back to the snow on Christmas.
Christmas means snow. Then let&#39;s go back to that and say if that
many more people voted in that shortened period, then what do we do?
Limit it to three days and then that many more people would vote, using
that logic? I don&#39;t think it works that way. Again, I think to be
reasonable about it, there was no problem when we had the extended
period. We should go back to that period and allow people to have a
positive voting experience. Not exclude them but include them, as
Representative Lucas said. Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does this bill
have a chance of passing with the Republican-controlled Legislature?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Which bill are you referring to? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Either one of them. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Either one of them? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the one that has the best chance
is the one that appeals most to the citizens who are going to write and
communicate with their legislators. We know already that the majority
made these amendments and made us one of the most oppressive states in
the nation regarding voting and voter participation. And as was
indicated by the previous question, as a result, people fought back so
to say, and said, despite what restrictions you&#39;re trying to put on
me I&#39;m going to fight through the process, the long lines, the
shortened period, and try to vote anyway. If they&#39;re going to be
user-friendly, if they&#39;re going to be responsive to what the voters
are saying, they will pass both of these bills. And if we value our
colleges and universities, our students, our faculty, and all the
graduates. And we&#39;ve got many in our General Assembly who are public
and private college and university graduates. I don&#39;t think any one
individual would say, people from my college or university should be
excluded from voting. So these bills have a chance if the public gets
behind them. We already know how we got into this situation. The
majority perceived it to be an advantage to them to maintain power. We
want the people to have the power. Any more questions? Well, thank you.
And these members will be available afterwards. We appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning, everyone.
We&#39;re still waiting on Senator Don Davis but we&#39;ll go ahead and
proceed with our press conference and our program. Thank you all very
much for being here this morning. My name is Pam Seamans. I am the
Executive Director of the North Carolina Alliance for Health. The
Alliance is a 13-year-old coalition made up of more than 50
organizations promoting policies to reduce the impact of tobacco use and
obesity in North Carolina. Members of the Alliance include the Heart
Association, the American Cancer Cancer Action Network, the Diabetes
Association, the Pediatrics Society, Prevention Partners, local health
directors, the Public Health Association, March of Dimes, Youth
Empowered Solutions, the Alliance of YMCAs, counsel, churches, and many
others. So you get the idea of the breadth of the groups working on
these issues. We are happy today to be joined by key legislative
supporters in announcing the introduction of House Bill 250, and we
understand the Senate bill will be dropped this afternoon, which will
establish a Healthy Corner Store Initiative in North Carolina. North
Carolina has over 349 ?? across 80 counties, impacting 1.5 million North
Carolina residents.

  truly support it to this. And representative Holly I&#39;ll have to sit
in the stage with all this talk about food I think we&#39;re getting a
little hungry right now. The healthy corner store initiative. I want to
be very clear, I&#39;m standing in support because I believe this
initiative is critical to helping local entrepreneurs especially as
they&#39;ll be able to sell healthier foods. Also will be able to reach
out to local communities and I believe this will have simply an awesome
impact in our local communities back at home. The initiative will also
help store owners because as they&#39;re able to sell healthier foods
fresh produce typically associated with this fresh produce tend to be
higher profit margins so I think that is important as it compares to
other product. And we stand here today especially with my colleague
senator Pate, representative Brown because we&#39;ve had an awesome
example an illustration of this in Pitt county as we have had as a
pilot, Marks food market who is owned by David Whizack and I would say
what we&#39;ve seen with David&#39;s vision is transformation within
communities. And what that means we&#39;ve seen if you talk to David
literally customers coming in and over time he started the pilot in 2011
and over time to going from coming in and buying a bag of chips and now
walking out with apples and oranges. I think that&#39;s a lot to be said
a lot to be celebrated. And watch this this is even the other part of
the celebration. And not only was that a tremendous hit for us in Pitt
county but he&#39;s looking at possibly a second location. So we stand
proudly today in support of this bill and we ask you to get it and after
you spend two hours with representative Holly come spend the next two
hours with me. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Morning everyone I want to thank you to my senators and my
representative colleagues and everyone else who supports this bill. My
name is representative Brian Brown and I signed onto this bill for two
very distinct reasons number one is what representative Davis just spoke
about which is the pilot program that took place in Pitt county and the
virtual success that we&#39;re seeing from this corner store and
providing healthy food options to areas that didn&#39;t previously have
it. And the other reason is probably uniquely to this group I am in the
food service industry. And in doing so I actually started an
organization saying we won&#39;t have fryers in our stores we will
provide healthy product to our customers. But what we quickly realized
is that&#39;s a difficult venture to take hold of. Your profit margins
can be thin and it can be difficult issue to actually source the
products. So this is a great initiative to actually help store owners,
small business owners who want to provide healthy products change
behavioral patterns of consumers but also make a living and be
profitable. Understand how to source the products and understand how to
deliver the products in a profitable method. And we&#39;re seeing that
with the pilot project in Pitt county and I think we can transcend this
over the entire state and it&#39;s going to be a wonderful program that
we can really sink our teeth into. Pardon the pun.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m Lewis Pate I represent Pitt county, Lenoir county, and Wayne
county. The reason I signed on to this bill is because of this little
women over here wearing these green stockings. I thank you very much Peg
for bringing all this information to me. It&#39;s not easy being a
farmer these days. They&#39;re having problems this would be an
additional advantage because it&#39;s going to get he farmers involved
in selling their product and perhaps even growing new product for the
benefit of our citizens. It&#39;s becoming more and more difficult for
North Carolina farmers to find markets for their products. This
initiative would help connect farmers with new markets in their own
communities. Thanks to the collaborative efforts expected between the
department of agriculture the department of commerce and the division of
public health. We believe this initiative can be helpful to farmers as
well. And we as legislators are committed to making sure the initiative
is successful for business owners and farmers a like. A major component
of this program will be to enhance a distributions system. So that store
owners, farmers, and also

  Fisherman and prosper together. Now I&#39;d like to commend Senator
Davis for his passion in this bill, and also Representative Holley and
all the folks we have around us. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, good morning. I&#39;m Representative Chris Whitmire and way west,
western North Carolina, Transylvania, Henderson, and Polk County. I want
to thank those behind me, beside me, many in the audience, and many of
those outside. This is a ongoing collaborative effort that for while was
put into the box as too hard to do, and it takes a lot to get it done
but last year in 2014 I started as a cochairman of the House study
committee on food desert zones. The committee explored multiple
challenges that people live in in food desert zones face. We had over 28
people from the private sector, non profit scope, et cetera, help us to
wrap our minds and help others to wrap their minds around the breadth
and scope of this situation. Now, estimates vary, but it is estimated
that 1.5 million of our fellow North Carolinians are living in
situations where they don&#39;t have reliable access to healthy or
affordable foods. Many of the recommendations of the food desert zone
study committee are currently being implemented without the, without
the, without legislation to make it happen because we shared so many
things that just made sense to do. This situation is an enabler with
Representative Holley&#39;s bill that so many of us has, have helped
with. When you look at the fact that individuals are more likely, living
in a food desert zone where they don&#39;t have access to nutritious low
protein type foods, healthy foods, they suffer from obesity, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and that just exponentiates many of the problems
that our nation is facing in terms of health. And you couple that with
the fact that if you don&#39;t have reasonable access as defined, and
that, there&#39;s some opinion on how that works. We want to rely on
self reliability, but on the other hand, if the place that you can get
to has basically fat laden, preservative laden food that just really
don&#39;t lend themselves to good nutrition, it just compounds the
issues. And here&#39;s just a couple of stats and you can make stats say
a lot of things, but the nexus of this situation it, it impacts public
health, our economy, energy, you can even take it out to national
security. And here&#39;s a couple of things to consider. 21% of the
healthcare expenditures are obesity related, and again, stats can vary,
but that&#39;s a big amount. That&#39;s $190 billion estimated annually
of healthcare expenditures directly related to obesity. Medicare and
Medicaid spend approximately 62 billion on obesity related issues
annually. US employers in terms of productivity lose an estimated $164
billion a year. Americans as simple as driving your car. As an airline
pilot, military pilot, it costs extra gas to push an airplane. It takes
extra gas to push a car. 3.4 billion extra dollars in automobile gas
estimated expended because of our nation&#39;s growing waistline. With
the airlines it&#39;s over a billion dollars of aviation type fuel.
Medical costs, decreased worker productivity, poor nutrition, obesity,
that trend is getting worse. It&#39;s not getting better. So in the end,
to have a solution spectrum to try to find different ways, there&#39;s
not a golden BB that solves this problem, and not necessarily one
situation is responsible for all the stats I mentioned, but they
contribute. One last sobering fact. Me as a 29 year military veteran,
one in four of our nation&#39;s youth, one out of four, is so
overweight, they can&#39;t even apply to go into the military because of
height and weight standards. That is something that gives me more
motivation to find ways that we can address our healthcare situation. So
this bill, and again, credit to so many around here, the healthy food,
small container corner store act directly addresses what we in the food
desert zone committee found, and found that makes a lot of sense. So if
we can assist small store owners in rural and urban areas alike to be
able to stock and sell fresh produce so that we can connect farmers and
agrobusiness with the market where they&#39;re needed, we all win. So
with that, there are many win, wins in this bill and I commend those who
made it happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I&#39;m Representative Garland Pierce. Just want to comment,
coming from a rural area, Robeson county in particular is just full of
fields of produce that sometimes go to waste, but our schools do a great
job from at least eight o&#39;clock to three o&#39;clock in the
afternoon encouraging our students about healthy eating, and when they
get out of school and get to go to the corner store, if the food is
there, I think

  they will take advantage of it, schools do a great job. I been behind
grocery carts, like many of you, in stores and I&#39;ve watched some of
the choices that families sometimes make that are just not healthy
choices, even in the grocery store. I think the more we could to teach,
teach, teach them about the importance of healthy eating, I think it
would do well and our corner stores definitely should have the
opportunity with this bill to empower the community with healthy
choices. Thank you, good job members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pierce, that is a good segue into the one comment
I&#39;m, unfortunately Representative Lambeth could not be here today,
he got called into a meeting with the leadership, but one of the points
that he wanted to made on his behalf is the fact that we need to do
right by our North Carolina children and a great place to start is the
environment around the schools and many, many corner stores are around
the schools. So we need to make those healthy places, give them healthy
options there. So we have one final speaker and that is my colleague
Sarah Jacobson, who is the Healthy Food Access Coordinator with the
North Carolina Alliance for Health.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hi, my name&#39;s Sarah Jacobson from the North Carolina Alliance for
Health. We recently conducted a statewide survey of registered North
Carolina voters and their opinions concerning accessing healthy foods in
North Carolina. According to this poll, North Carolinians view unhealthy
eating and childhood obesity as the most serious problems facing
children in the United States today. That&#39;s above physical activity,
quality of education, and children not spending enough time outdoors.
With over 1/3 of North Carolina children overweight or obese, this
clearly demonstrates that it&#39;s time to stop talking about this issue
and time to start doing something about it. The legislators have already
discussed how a healthy corner store initiative could help our state. It
would not only remove a barrier to healthy eating but also create new
business opportunities and help small business owners, farmers, and
fishermen. North Carolinians agree, in the poll of 70% of people support
a state-funded healthy corner store initiative, and after learning more
information, 76% supported it. Additionally, a strong majority support
the basic components of the program. 76% of registered North Carolina
voters favor state and local governments providing training and
incentives to encourage corner store owners to stock and sell healthy
foods and beverages. We&#39;ve already heard all of the different
benefits that could be incurred from this initiative. So we&#39;re glad
that this bill is moving int he direction according to what North
Carolinians want for their state. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I also want to call your attention to some of our other partners who are
here today that aren&#39;t necessarily members of the alliance as a
coalition but are partnering with us here on this particular issue, such
as the Carolina Farm Stewardship Association, the support center of the
food bank, and we&#39;ve got a health director here as well. So I want
to thank all of you for being here and being such great partners and
sharing the enthusiasm for this legislation. On behalf of the members
and partners of the alliance, we want to urge the House and Senate to
consider these bills and include the healthy corner store initiative as
a line item in the budget. Our state would realize a triple win, a win
for small business, a win for farmers and perhaps fisherman, as well, in
some areas, and a win for public health and community revitalization. We
hope that as you are moving around the General Assembly today, seeing
all the green, that you think of it as representing more than just St.
Patrick&#39;s Day and will represent the green fresh fruits and
vegetables that we hope to see in the corner stores across our state.
And with that, we would be happy to entertain any questions you might
have. Yes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not having a copy of the bill just yet, what is the cost of this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One million dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that money would go for...?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s going for a number of things, one of it, it&#39;s going for
equipment. A lot part of the problem is that the stores don&#39;t have
the refrigeration and the training and know how to handle fresh fruits
and vegetables and produce. So a lot of it is going to training,
it&#39;s going to equipment, it&#39;s going to teach them how to do it
and we&#39;re going to utilize as much as the existing network
that&#39;s in the public health system with collaboration from the
Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce. This is really
a collaborative bill on a lot of fronts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that one million coming from Commerce?

  come from you to see. We are working on that
[Speaker Changes] Also  Rep Holley if you could talk to us a bit  about
your vision specific to this bill and  South East  Raleigh and South
East Raleigh lost Nick Kruger  . Where do you see this bill fitting in.
What&#39;s your vision in the next fill in the blanks next three years
or what ever
[Speaker Changes] well, Hopefully in three years we will have corner
stores that are really doing well with us. At the same time we would
able them to  get some of the larger grocery stores at the some of the
communities that don&#39;t have access as well. That&#39;s a huge
problem. we have communities  especially in the rural areas where people
have to drive  25 , 30  miles to get to a grocery store. so that&#39;s
part of it. At the same time, we are working and partnering with public
health people to teach our kids and our citizens about healthy eating to
also enable them to make those choices. Hopefully this is a problem that
we can solve and we can have a network put in place that would do this
and within years we don&#39;t have one here for a hungry children.
[Speaker Changes] I will ask other really quick  Will this money then go
to a food line coming in or is it more geared towards mom and pop
stores?
[Speaker Changes] Thus bill  specifically is for small mom and pop small
 businesses.
[Speaker Changes] So Rep Holley, in the city it would look like a corner
store. In the rural area what would it look like?
[Speaker Changes] It may still be a cornet stores.  if you remember back
in the olden days there was general  everywhere where they used to sell
everything  and they no longer exists  in it  John Ross. Everybody  got
specialized . It may be a store that. I went to Big Lots the other day.
and Big Lots had a whole range of nutrient rich foods. They had
refrigerated pudding in. And I was thrilled to see that they are
stepping to the plate. So the other entities and other businesses can
also sell more than just food or their product. But they can add the
food along with it. Hope I answered your question. No, okay
[Speaker Changes] when you say that you know private money would go for
equipment what would it look like , is it like just freezers. I mean
most storage have you know like refrigerated units that are glass . what
would  it be?
[Speaker Changes] A combination , it depends on what is applicable to
the particular store. , Someone may want a big one with doors that they
can keep things it. somebody may want a open unit. We hope to offer  a
variety.
[Speaker Changes]Rep Holley, This is an optional opt in program for
thousands of corner stores and convenience stores  across the state. Is
there any incentive for the store to opt in?
[Speaker Changes] No it is not. since it is good health and it&#39;s an
expansion of their business. we already have [?? inaudible] copy over
seventy greenish stores  at one end. so the convenience stores want this
opportunity to either do some of these. So, it is an opt in program ,
but the benefit is just  expanded business and good healthy food.
[Speaker Changes] Yeah, Just to put it in perspective . Again , this
goes back to a year ago when the food desserts on the standing committee
took 28 different presenters. And I mean we maximized our four four hour
sessions. It was only four. But we maximized it.  I think you might have
 attended and you can attest to that. And you find prototype this being
in one of them that Buick county originated David Smart I am going to
forget the actual name . He smart wizard. They showed that it could
work. But there were tipping points. And sometimes getting that in
place, I think Senator Davis talked about profit margin and again
it&#39;s not a $4 Banana at the corner store. But showing that once
it&#39;s working that competition and the way our world is  supposed to
work will work. And that&#39;s key to it. And on the question of
ruralness most people in this room probably really don&#39;t  know about
the rural like idea where I live. Any day I love it. It&#39;s a painful
285 mile drive to get here. When I think of the question that was asked
regarding the rural area , well I think of a little story that&#39;s on
Highway 215 going on a little place called Bolsom Grove. And for years
the only place to get fresh calendar milk within twenty thirty minutes
of many of those who live there. And it&#39;s a beautiful place. people
come from all over to get there. It&#39;s right there. So you know that
said, a lot of people grow their own garden  catering to their food need
one at a time and on the other hand that&#39;s a situation and that may
be a significantly extremist situation . But that&#39;s a place where
creatures would have it. we look our sweets and all that. But
convenience is very important. So if

  Particular type of cooler for preservation. Not chemical preservation,
but coolers and such. You can&#39;t just throw it in any type of cooler.
It doesn&#39;t last long if you put it in the wrong type of cooling
device. That&#39;s something that either will or will not find its way
into that marketplace but there&#39;s quite a few examples that have
proven it will, so that&#39;s my contribution on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holley, one more question. You were asked about the types
of stores that would be part of the program, and and food ?? was used as
an example. They already have a produce section, but what about those
smaller corner stores that may have corporate ownership, like a 7-11 or
a Circle K? You said these would be mom and pops. Are we talking about
independently owned?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We&#39;re not restricting it at that point right now. We wanna see who
applies. The corner stores have to actually apply, and they will be
determined on a case by case basis. We don&#39;t need ten in one area,
so that we&#39;re having opportunities to apply. Some of the stores in
more rural areas may be larger because they have more space, but
we&#39;re looking at stores with a foot imprint of no more than about
5,000 square feet. We&#39;re not talking about your really big stores,
but just the small corner stores. Any more questions? Thank you all for
coming out, and please go around and look at the different tables on
exhibit with many people who have done some things for healthy food.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, we&#39;re gonna get started here in just a couple minutes.
We&#39;re about a minute on guests if folks wanna take the time to get
ready. And y&#39;all just let me know when you&#39;re, when you&#39;re
good to go. Are we ready? Great. All right, well welcome and thank you
all for coming. My name is Liz Kazal. I&#39;m the field associate with
Environment North Carolina. We&#39;re a statewide citizen based
environmental advocacy group. I want to thank our speakers who are
joining us today, Representatives Pricey Harrison and Robert Reives as
well as Senator Mike Woodard and all the other legislators who have
taken time out of their schedule to stand with us. After today, North
Carolinians are no longer guaranteed safety from fracking and other
types of oil and gas drilling as it now becomes legal for our state to
issue permits for fracking. From the very beginning of the process of
clearing a site for drilling through extraction, transportation, and
delivery of the finished products, fracking threatens the environment.
States like Pennsylvania have established regulations to at least help
mitigate these threats, but as our report shows, these regulations
don&#39;t prevent companies from threatening our drinking water, special
places, and public health. Our report, fracking failures, analyzes
violations of these rules over a four year period. Our message today is
clear. When it comes to fracking, every company is a bad actor. The
prudent action to take is to reinstate the moratorium so that our public
health and environment are truly protected. Here&#39;s just one example
from the fallout from these violations. On the morning of Tuesday,
February 11, a group of fracking workers were about to begin a safety
briefing at a fracking well site. The three wells there, owned and
operated by Chevron, Apalachee, and Dunkard Township Pennsylvania,
southwest of Pittsburgh, had been drilled and fracked, and they were
about to begin producing natural gas. Before the safety meeting began,
however, some workers were hearing a hissing noise from one of the three
well heads. One of them, Ian McKee walked over to investigate. The
hissing noise was methane escaping from a damaged well. As McKee
approached the well, it exploded. The explosion killed McKee instantly
and produced enough heat to rupture and ignite a neighboring well and to
cause a propane tank nearby to explode. It took 14 days to cap the
leaking wells. On March 18, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection cited Chevron for none violations in connection with the
event, including hazardous venting of gas, failing to prevent explosion
and fire, failing to maintain functioning equipment intended to prevent
blowouts, and releasing fugitive air contaminants without a permit. The
company was also cited for leaking polluted fracking wastewater and for
blocking DEP officials access to the site for two days following the
explosion. Stories like Ian&#39;s are tragic, but unfortunately not
isolated.

  From fortune 500 companies like Cabot Oil to Wildcat operators to firms
like Chevron who tout their clean records, our report down that all
types of oil and gas companies are prone to infractions of environmental
rules. The data shows that the top 20 violators of air, water, and
health protections racked up thousands of violations over nearly four
years, averaging more than one every single day. We&#39;re not talking
about misfiled papers, we&#39;re talking about serious risks for
workers, drinking water, and public health. There are at least 243
document cases of contaminated drinking water sources across
Pennsylvania from 2007 to 2014. Air pollutants are released during at
least 15 parts of the oil and gas process and fracking was deemed such a
threat to public health that the state of New York outright banned it.
The bottom line is that North Carolina has a lot to risk when it comes
to fracking and our communities deserve to be protected from harmful
drilling. We applaud those legislators who are with us today, standing
up for our environment and public health. We urge the governor and other
leaders in the General Assembly to follow their lead and reinstate the
moratorium on fracking to truly ensure that our drinking water,
landscapes, and public health are protected. Next up, we&#39;ll hear
from Representative Pricey Harrison of Guilford County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks for that and thanks for coming. I&#39;ve said repeatedly the
problem with fracking is it&#39;s largely exempt from any federal
oversight, and that&#39;s because it&#39;s been left up to the states.
Well, North Carolina does not have a history of extractive industries so
we were creating new rules from   and when the legislature lifted the
ban, lifted the moratorium on fracking, we promised the people of North
Carolina we would have the strongest rules to protect the public health
and safety and environment of North Carolina. We broke the promise last
summer, we lifted the ban, we didn&#39;t have the rules in place, and
now the rules become effective today. They have many weaknesses,
especially regarding waste water, disposal waste water and water quality
protections, air emissions, which got a lot of attention last week and
this week when we removed the requirement, the Environmental Management
commission adopt rules relating to air regulations, and the
criminalizing chemical disclosure. Just recently I read that there&#39;s
been a California report released about the problems with some of the
toxins that are contained int he waste water and the problem is we
don&#39;t even know what they are because of this disclosure issue. So I
think that we ought to hold back on rushing in to fracking, we know that
because the price of gas is so low that we&#39;re likely just going to
get the Wildcatters and those are the least responsible and the least
regulated in the industry. So I&#39;m with my colleagues here calling
for the reinstatement of the moratorium, thank you. I&#39;m going to
turn it over to Robert Reives now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Harrison, thank you Liz, and thank you for
coming and it is something that we find extremely important and
extremely relevant to North Carolina. One of the reasons that many
people who live in North Carolina stay in North Carolina, one of the
reasons that many people who don&#39;t live in North Carolina move to
North Carolina is our clean air and water and our tradition of
protecting that. We just don&#39;t feel, and Representative Brad Salmon
and I filed a disapproval bill for the rules for the reasons that
you&#39;ve heard from Representative Harrison and for some other
reasons. We just don&#39;t feel those rules adequately protect the
people of North Carolina, specifically our particular counties in
Chatham, Lee, and Harnett, which are all at the epicenter of any
fracking that may occur. One of the big issues that I have personally is
the fact that we don&#39;t give local governments control. One of the
things I think we should really concentrate on and we really need to be
careful about is telling our local governments that they don&#39;t have
the right to decide who comes in their county, who does business in
their county, and how they do business. We want local governments to
have the opportunity to regulate fracking. Right now, we&#39;ve got
issues galore with the rules, with the fact that they do not address
who&#39;s going to pay for all the damage, whatever trucks are coming
back-and-forth on your roads in your counties, how do you get that
damage paid for? You look at bonding, the bonding insufficient at this
point in time to protect us in the case of a real fracking accident.
Whatever somebody feels about the issue of fracking, what you&#39;ve got
to recognize is just like any other industry there will most likely be
some sort of accident and if we don&#39;t have appropriate bonding for
these companies coming in then that will be left to the taxpayers to pay
for that. We ought to allow local governments to have the right to
regulate the noise, we ought to have them have the right to be able to
regulate where they can do their fracking, what neighborhoods are
affected. When people buy their properties, one of the things they are
proudest of and that we&#39;re proudest of for them is to be able to own
homes, to be able to own pieces of land and to be able to have an
opportunity to raise their children and to feel safe. At this point in
time, with the way the rules are set up, you don&#39;t have those
protections. Forced pooling could cause, even if you disagree with
somebody being able to frack on your property, forced pooling could
cause you to still

  have to allow your land to be fracked. So with all these issues that
we&#39;ve got coming forward, we feel like, again, we&#39;ve got to step
back and take a look at the rules, take a look at how they protect our
citizens, and it shouldn&#39;t be about how you feel about the industry.
It should definitely be about the fact that you want to make sure that
your citizens have the best rules, the best opportunity, themselves,
their property, and their families, and thank you again for being here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, my name is Senator Mike Woodard, I represent District 22,
which includes Caswell, Person, and Durham Counties. And the shale area
extends up through Chatham County and includes 2/3 of Durham County,
which is why this is a very important issue for me as well, why Senator
Foushee and I joined with Representatives Reives and Salmon in a bill to
stop the rules, implementation of the rules, and to re-institute the
moratorium. Because it&#39;s very important to the environment and
public health of the residents of Durham County as well as Chatham and
on down throughout the shale basin. We have hit zero hour for fracking
in North Carolina, permits can begin being issued. We&#39;ve been
promised over the last five years that North Carolina would have the
nation&#39;s toughest fracking rules and here we are at zero hour and we
do not have those rules. Even just last night we once again rejected the
chance to have the nation&#39;s strongest rules. The industry and their
supporters in the General Assembly have turned their back on a safe,
clean environment and on the public health of the residents of North
Carolina by rejecting these rules and by not living up to the promise
that they&#39;ve made to the voters and residents of North Carolina for
these tough rules. For the reasons Representatives Harrison and Reives
have shared with you, I join with them today in calling for
re-instituting the moratorium on fracking in North Carolina. The rules
are simply insufficient for us to move forward with the issuing of
permits. I want to take a moment and applaud Environment in North
Carolina for issuing their report &quot;Fracking Failures.&quot; This
report documents one state that&#39;s further along in fracking and the
fact that they had rules, they haven&#39;t been followed, they&#39;ve
been violated quite a bit. This should be a clarion call to us, all of
us, whether you support fracking or not. A clarion call for us to stop
fracking now, re-institute the moratorium, and let&#39;s spend some time
with the rules. Hundreds and hundreds of North Carolinians visited with
the Mining and Energy Commission as they conducted their hearings across
the state over the last year and the people have spoken on this, the
rules that have come from MEC are not sufficient and we not stop, we
need to slow down, and we need to spend more time living up to that
promise we made to the people of North Carolina for the nation&#39;s
toughest rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, I want to thank all of you for coming today and thank you to our
legislators for standing up for the environment and public health. We
will now be available for questions, we&#39;ll do them individually, and
then just a quick reminder is that there&#39;s another event in this
room at 12:30 so we&#39;ll just be available individually or int he
hallway for questions, thank you. We&#39;ll do it individually, great.
Thank you again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m going to ask [??] this so people at home can hear what you have
to say. So, what state does have the nation&#39;s toughest laws on
fracking, where do ours fall short?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The trouble is that it&#39;s definitely difficult to go line by line and
I don&#39;t know the exact answer. The truth is is that there are
states, like Maryland, who have tougher regulations than we do. Once
again, we were promised the nation&#39;s toughest rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand. I&#39;m told Wyoming, surprisingly. I was at a Shell
briefing in Denver in the fall and that&#39;s what I was told. Actually,
did pass some really air quality protections, and that was probably
largely as a result of that pavilion study the EPA was engaged in and
stopped, prevent it from continuing. And then Pennsylvania has also
enacted some strong air rules but Colorado and Wyoming, I think, are
best overall, but Pennsylvania and Ohio, Colorado and Wyoming all passed
really strong air quality protections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is for any of the legislators who want to answer this, when
you&#39;re trying to persuade your colleagues, we know what they say on
the floor, but in private when you&#39;re having a conversation with
them, what&#39;s the tone, what&#39;s the rush given the price of
natural gas, given the price of oil right now, and given the fact that
there&#39;s two of the boards that are supposed to be managing

to commence fracking and I think the real pressure is for offshore
fracking. Is not really for the inshore fracking, it was offshore
fracking. But we know from the study that was conducted a couple of
years ago, the Commerce Department anticipate 387 jobs would be created
by fracking. It&#39;s not going to have a stay on North Carolina out of
work frackers of course, we don&#39;t have any. It will be out of state
?? like the job . So the premise is, job creation and this is not going
to happen. It is just a false premise. I don&#39;t think ??
[Speaker Changes]:I would say this is too-hardy beyond belief, because
those under 400 fracking jobs are going to be replaced by destroying a
natural resource, water, that drives the economy in every region of the
state. So water is of much greater value and it is for ever. They will
destroy the quality of ground water for ever, where they do this
fracking and the jobs are just flash in the pan, short-term, Wacka [??]
jobs, that  do not sustain economies, they do quite the opposite and
they leave local government holding the sack for the clean-up so, to
position this as a jobs decision is again just another incredible
misrepresentation of the facts.
[Speaker Changes]:This group  calling for moratorium is it stronger than
this group in numbers or this is what you got  for as vote for reviewing
a moratorium
[Speaker Changes]: I think there are more legislators, for various
reasons just couldn&#39;t be here today so, [??] I am [??]  she is
respond to the bill with me and whole delegation was in the house was
favour of the moratorium [??] so it is larger
[Speaker Changes]: you state that filling a bill to
[Speaker Changes]: We have filed the bill
[Speaker Changes]:we have filed the bill
[Speaker Changes]:Yes, senator representor Reeves,  Simon filed one in
the house
[Speaker Changes]: As short of those bills do you have any lags. Is
there a Plan B. Is there any back-up plan if the moratorium bills falls
short.
[Speaker Changes]: [??]
[Speaker Changes]: Losses. That&#39;s my guess I just think that since
we are going to have some violations between Motor Act and Clean Act and
other things and the thing may be there in the avenue, I am not sure, I
am not lawyer, audience want the answer for that. i think we were sort
of outnumbered on the regulatory end and we got  a department sort of
disinclined regulate too much any ways. It is, when I said , responded
to your question, yes ,well the states are the states that  I have
identified having strong programs,they also have problems so it is not
clear we got an area where we set up a regulatory structure that
actually does did best for the people in the state.
[Speaker Changes]: At the summit said we are shooting for the long mall
than the high mall I mean, in answer to your question earlier, I think
you looked at a lot of states and we are particularly choosing from the
best that are not there, not from the least that are out there and
pricing mentioned in the states I think we are bit taken by that , we
have been
[Speaker Changes]:  looking ??
[Speaker Changes]: Just Representor  Harris reading between the lines ,
you said, regarding these losses that would happen if the violation
actually took place or little bit of losses will up
[Speaker Changes]: i am not the expert on this but I am I guess the
premier was issued that seem to be in violation  water quality or the
federal regulation, So I think that would be the source of the losses.
we are not here  permitting I guess, aplications is not being accepted
today.  So well it is been little bit down the road.That&#39;s my guess
because I think that is the main avenue or  recourse right now
[Speaker Changes]: I also want to ask, Ronaldo ?? and  representor
Reeves if this is better for use in your district
[Speaker Changes]: We heard ten ??. We heard, there is actually business
interest in doing this right now.
[Speaker Changes]: I am not going to any promise yet being required
[Speaker Changes]: well I can tell you that I will be the last person to
contact about that.  and also we would have heard of anything at this
point of time, we just don&#39;t know and I think that part of the
problem that if you don&#39;t want to is, Wait.

  <p id="65:00">
  Until the business starts coming you want to make sure everything is
fixed and in place now. And the reason is and I speak this really from
the law side. It&#39;s better to make your rules and make your laws
before there are conflicts with people on each side. Because then it
does become unfortunately about politics about personalities things of
that sort. And we want to have those things in place, to answer your
earlier question I did want to comment on we also don&#39;t know
what&#39;s going to happen as a result of the unconstitutional finding
of the committee. We don&#39;t know what direction the governor may have
an opportunity at this point if he would like to weigh in we don&#39;t
know. And there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s up in the air but the real issue
that you&#39;ve got is that again you&#39;ve got communities real
communities with real people who have taken politics completely out of
it I can speak for Chatham and Lee county I mean to a person your
generally going to find people saying I&#39;m not comfortable with the
direction we&#39;re going on fracking. Because that&#39;s going to be a
real effect you know when you have a property or a home that you&#39;ve
spent X amount of dollars for and all the sudden it&#39;s worth half
that because again it&#39;s about perception. Too many times we get
caught up in the safe what&#39;s not safe things of that sort, I
definitely have opinions on that. But you also have to recognize
what&#39;s the perception I mean just what my seat mate just said
representative Queen we can make up three hundred and eighty seven jobs
I have that kind of confidence in North Carolina. We can get three
hundred and eighty seven jobs within the industries we already have in
place. With the industries that already want to come here. But they
start to perceive that we don&#39;t care about our environment we
don&#39;t care about our air and water, that&#39;s something a industry
coming to North Carolina is going to consider because they are bringing
not only themselves but they&#39;re bringing their executives their
bringing their families their bringing workers their brining people here
who want to locate in this state and we&#39;ve got to cautious of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I just need to add to that the Governors budget has five hundred
thousand dollars for exploratory roles. I think the point of that is to
show industry we&#39;ve got this resource. But I will just add that it
doesn&#39;t look like our own rules are going to protect us from the
problems associated with these exploratory wells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question about your businesses. I haven&#39;t heard from any
local business who&#39;s excited about this because they&#39;re just not
in that game but number two they have a lot of concerns about the use of
water. I think representative Queen hit the nail right on the head these
businesses need water particularly when you look at southern Durham
county you live in Chatham and Lee these are agricultural businesses
they survive on the water and the use of their land. And a lot of these
farmers I talked to and I&#39;m sure you have to Robert these guys
don&#39;t like the forced pulling component of this the land is very
very important to them and they use that land as their business. So if
we&#39;re dirtying up the water without regulation and without
protection these businesses are scared about fracking coming in. We have
had overtures you all have covered last summer the land speculators were
already trying to buy up land in Durham and Orange counties including a
park from the town of Chapel Hill they did show very much planning
foresight when they went to the Chapel Hill town council and wanted
their park, but anyway. And we knew the attorney general had to crack
down because these folks came in they weren&#39;t prepared they
weren&#39;t ready they didn&#39;t have their licenses in place they had
not done what they needed to do. That&#39;s the fear I think we have. Is
that your going to upset your wild caters we&#39;re not going to see big
companies those companies best prepared to come into this industry go
into this new frontier for North Carolina. We&#39;re going to have the
small companies who are less experienced less prepared to handle this
properly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How solid is the legislatures ban on using injection wells for fracking
waste water? Is there
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s an interesting issue because I feel like there was enough work
created by the prospect of taking it out east and injecting it. I think
the back lash was pretty strong so I don&#39;t think they are going to
go there. The waste water issue is huge right now all we&#39;ve got the
option is waste pits. It&#39;s tough in coal ash we haven&#39;t done a
good job of managing waste pits. So there&#39;s also a proposal to send
it to water treatment plants and we don&#39;t have any facilities that
are adequately built to filter out the toxins and contaminants that are
found in fracking that can include a number of organic compounds many of
which are carcinogenic. So the waste water issue is huge and we&#39;ve
got to overcome that and I don&#39;t know if because of that they&#39;ll
be pressured to do injection. But it seems right now it&#39;s holding
pretty strong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah I think we have time for one more then we&#39;ll
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mine is more of a procedural question I guess I can ask it later unless
someone wants to speak to
the bond specifically the clean up bond I know the mining energy
commission can and I think the rules say may have a company come in to
set a clean up bond rate some amount that is set aside for clean up is
that

  mandatory in these rules, would that be a way to tighten them up or is
there, do they have to have some money in reserve for cleanup?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it&#39;s my understanding, I&#39;ve spoken to staff over at Daimler
and DENR about this and it&#39;s my understand that there&#39;s a
minimum of a million dollar environmental damage bond that gets set and
then based on the permit of the unitization, that they set an additional
bond for cleanup and all of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How does that stack up with other states, do you know?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m not sure but I can get back to you on that. Well thank you
again, everybody, for coming. Again, I&#39;ll be available for questions
and thanks again to our legislators for standing with us. Have a great
St. Patrick&#39;s Day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d like to welcome everyone today. This is a good week for Raleigh,
it&#39;s a good week for the media, and I think you&#39;ll see our
sincerity in keeping the sunshine bright and keeping it going and also
looking after our newspaper friends. That&#39;s, many times, hard to
talk about but today it&#39;s very easy to talk about and I think we
have reached a compromise on a bill that is good for all parties
concerned. When I look at this bill and I look across the state, the one
fear I have is some of the other bills I&#39;ve seen have neglected our
folks that are in the rural areas and have no access to internet. That
hits a lot of my folks, especially in the Transylvania County area out
in the remote reaches. So we all would like to have high-speed internet
access, we would all like to be able to access records immediately but
some folks don&#39;t have that ability and it is my opinion, and I think
many of us up here, that until everyone has that option available to
them, for high-speed internet, we must do certain things to protect and
still get news out. I think this bill will do that and accomplish that
and have the public information out there for the people to see. I know
in my hometown a lot of people love to go to the legal notices first
because it gives them something to talk about when they have coffee that
morning and it also, in some cases, I have heard where it has
precipitated fundraisers to help some folks out to keep their property.
So, with that being said, I think this bill accomplishes that and I
think it protects all the folks an the media. So I recommend it to all
and hopefully we&#39;ll have a positive report out of the Senate and
send it over to our friends in the House to pass it and make it law.
I&#39;m going to turn it over to Marilyn now, and thank you again for
coming.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Apodaca. I am Marilyn Avila, represent House District
40 here in Wake County and I too, like Senator Apodaca and other people
who&#39;ve signed on to this piece of legislation, believe that we need
to keep all lines of communication open, primarily because right now
we&#39;re in a transition period in information dissemination. It&#39;s
sort of analogous to the horse and buggy days, transitioning to the
automobile. We didn&#39;t pass a law overnight and say get rid of your
horse and buggy and buy an automobile and we let it take place as people
could make that transition financially and in their own articular way
and that&#39;s true here. As he pointed out, there are certain areas of
the state that have some severe limitation in connectivity and actually
just straight out wanting to use this particular source. So I don&#39;t
think it&#39;s our job to limit, in any way, and hide, unfortunately not
maybe intentionally but just by default, the information that citizens
need on what their government&#39;s doing. The other thing, too, is the
logistics of making a change of this nature. When you look at how we
publish the information, how is it going to be gathered if we let all of
the different entities control their publication? The most, I think,
illustrative instance is someone who does business with government and
they will go into the legal notices to see

  the publication of bids for construction projects, would they have to go
to every municipality website? Would they have to go to every county
website? Would they have to go to every government entity website to
find that particular information? So, as we make that transition
there&#39;s going to be a lot of questions involved in, as we make it,
how can we make ti convenient for the public. This isn&#39;t something
that you can pass a piece of legislation on one day and say effective on
X day, you can only get your information on the internet. So I think
just the sheer way that we have structured this bill makes a smoother
transition and helps us get into the information age with the internet
for everybody&#39;s benefit. The issue, too, for me is that in taking
this approach we are not removing the responsibility for publication in
newspapers from private entities and it does not look good, does not
smell good for us to be making laws that shield us or benefit us when we
do not allow that same benefit to others. Those are just my first
off-the-cuff responses as to why I felt like this piece of legislation
was the correct way to go and I would now like to offer the microphone
to any one of the sponsors who would like to make any additional
comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Marilyn. I&#39;m just going to say a couple of words. My name
is Senator Norman Sanderson, District 2, I am one of the primary
sponsors on the Senate version of this bill. To me, this is, always has
been, and always will be a point of transparency as far as those of us
who have been elected to serve the public in government at any level,
whether you&#39;re talking about municipalities, whether you&#39;re
talking about county commissioners, whether you&#39;re talking about
state level or even a federal level. You know we have a responsibility
as those elected officials to inform the public about what we&#39;re
doing. There&#39;s an old Chinese, or there&#39;s a Latin proverb,
really, that goes back about 1500 years that says &quot;to be forewarned
is to forearmed,&quot; and I think that speaks directly to what
we&#39;re doing here. There is, in our society, i think an underlying
desire that if we as people see something that is going wrong or that
has been done that is wrong, we as a people will move to correct it. I
think just as much on the reverse side of that is if we as a people see
something that is about to happen that is wrong, we as a people will
move to block it. I&#39;ve seen it in my district time and time again
for things that have tried to slip in under the radar and try to get
done before the public knew what was going on. And when the public finds
out, if it&#39;s already been done then they&#39;re very angry. If it
hasn&#39;t been done then they move very quickly and organize to come
together to stand against it. This is about, again, we being elected
officials, the responsibility to be informed. The other side of that
coin is also that the people, when they&#39;re informed, they have a
responsibility to act, and I think that if we will do that, if both
sides of that coin will work together that&#39;s when government works
at its best. That&#39;s when we are in unity, that&#39;s when we know
that the things we do as elected officials do a great deal for the
public good. I agree with Marilyn and I agree with Tom that we are
heading, at some point, technologically advanced to the place where we
may be able to do this totally by the internet, but until that point we,
to move to this too quickly would be to disenfranchise, I think, a large
group of people that we represent in this state. I appreciate the press
core and the press association for being able to sit down, or being
willing to sit down at the table and negotiate this with us and to work
on this bill because, as Senator Apodaca said, I think this is a good
bill and I think that with your help, with the help of the citizens in
this state, we&#39;ll be able to move this bill forward and we&#39;re
going to come out in the sunshine, a week of sunshine of the sunshine
week in this state. We&#39;re going to come out looking okay, and so
that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do. Thank you.

Junior over here. The principality of Sweden was going to change what
had been in effect for centuries I suppose of driving on the left side
of the road to turn over one night at midnight and start driving on the
right hand side of the road the next day. Obviously there were a lot of,
there was a lot of chaos: front-end collisions, rear-end collisions,
everything under the sun. That&#39;s not the way to make a change, any
kind of change, especially that involves an awful lot of people. So I
use that example as a reason why, that&#39;s a bad choice of words, but
as a reason for us to go into anything very slowly and deliberately. I
think that this bill is a reasonable compromise that will allow us to
plan for the future because the future is coming. We will be much better
for taking this sort of a half-step before we go in to anything any
farther, which would give everyone a chance to do the right thing and
will keep our citizens informed as to what the legal notices are around
our state. Thank you very much.
I&#39;m representative Malone from Wake County.  And I think that the
old saying that the government that governs the least, governs the best
leaves it up to the people to have them well-informed as to what is
going on. And you know whether or not it&#39;s this or whether or not
it&#39;s protest petitions or whatever it is; when you&#39;re talking to
people, the people who live in your neighborhoods, the people who you
have breakfast with, that you associate with, that you go to Kiwanis
with, that come here and ask you for your help they want to know
what&#39;s going on.  And when you&#39;re telling them and you&#39;re
keeping things open and transparent they feel more comfortable with you.
They have ??. They feel confident in what you&#39;re doing and you can
move legislation forward if they know that&#39;s the kind of person
that&#39;s serving them. They have a right to know if things are going
to effect their lives, their bank accounts, their futures, and this is
one way to ensure that they do. Yes, one day I think that we will be
able to go electronically and I think that&#39;ll be a fine day but
we&#39;re no where nears that right now. People like to read their
newspapers, they like to get that Sunday morning sit in front of the bay
window and have a little coffee and read the Wake Weekly or the News
Observer and I think that they need need to know that information and
they got a right to it and that&#39;s why I was happy to sign on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don&#39;t want to be the only one not speaking. My name is Ted Davis,
Jr. I&#39;m from district 19, House district 19 and I was very happy to
be part of this. The history took us back to the last session where we
tried to move forward on this and we weren&#39;t successful so we
didn&#39;t give up, we kept going. We&#39;re now here and we&#39;ve got
both the House and the Senate working together and I look forward to a
great bill being passed by both chambers and put into law by the
governor. And I want to thank ya&#39;ll for coming.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll just be redundant at this point, I support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Since everybody&#39;s spoken I guess we&#39;ll open the floor for any
questions if there are any we&#39;d be more than happy to take them and
direct them to whomever. If there are no questions, thank you so much
for coming and we look forward to a successful completion of the bill.
Thank you.
