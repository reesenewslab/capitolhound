Leading the Senate in prayer is the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate
Chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s pray together. Lord, we come before you tonight
and we give you thanks for fresh mercy, for rain, for meetings that have
gone well, for meetings that have gone poorly, and as we look to the
summer as it begins, we thank you for the gentleness of rain because
it’s going to be our best ally. Thank you for carrying us through this
day with that gentle reminder of rain. Thanks for moments like this
where we can pray, we can breathe, where we can relax and be. A moment
to have a conversation maybe about basketball; a moment a moment to talk
about graduations, talk about school. It’s good to know that you’re
moving even in these small conversations, Lord. I pray you’d bless those
conversations, I pray you’d bless this evening, bless these Senators as
they serve their constituents around this great state of North Carolina.

All members of the Honor Guard provide their services on a volunteer
basis and at all times perform funeral rites at multiple services on the
same day. Which include firing traditional 3-volley salute, playing
tapes and presenting the American flag to the deceased veterans
surviving spouse or family member.
On July the 8th, 2013, the Honor Guard performed military funeral rites
for veteran World War II veteran, James Ralph Pendry, completing its
1,000th funeral service.
We are honored today to have 10 members of the VFW Honor Guard, Post
1142, with us. These men have served their country and they continue to
serve their community. I rise today to express my appreciation to the
members of the Blue Ridge Mountain Veterans of Foreign Wars, Post 1142

President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Gunn, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Just wanted to let everybody
know that you should have received that there will be, it’s called a
joint meeting of commerce, tomorrow at 10 o’clock in room 544, but it
really is for every senatorial and house member. Next week, beginning
Monday for two straight weeks, something historic is going to happen in
the quaint village of Pinehurst. The US Open is going to be held, both
the men’s and women’s, back-to-back. This is the first time in the
history of the USGA that this has been tried. It should be a great
economic boon. It’s going to be a great tourism boon. The state of North
Carolina has worked tirelessly to pull this off, Pinehurst community and
that area has, so what we’re going to do tomorrow in celebration of such
a great sport – a sport that has brought over 2.3 billion dollars worth
of economic impact annually, 4.2 and a multiplier in hires, over 53
thousand individuals – we’re going to have a small celebration tomorrow
to talk about the golf industry. And what we’re going to do, and I’m
really going to encourage you strongly to attend, we’re going to talk
about – have the golf course superintendents talk about – the economic
impact. We’re going to have the North Carolina Course Owners Association
talk about a little bit of the historical perspective of this great game
and what it has done in North Carolina. We also will have Pinehurst CVB
will tell us a little bit about the background and what has gone into
leading up to what I promise you will be a spectacular event over the
next two weeks, and I think you’ll find that perspective very
interesting, and then a small closing comments from the Division of
Travel and Tourism on sports in general in North Carolina and
particularly as it relates to golf. So I do encourager you tomorrow to
come join us. This is a great game and a great state, and I think their
support by this membership, to come celebrate such a great couple week
would be very much appreciated. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Senator. Any further notices or announcements? Any further business to
come before the Senate? If not, the Chair recognizes Senator Berger for
a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the
Senate do now adjourn, subject to the receipt and re-referral of
messages from the House and the Governor, referral and re-referral of
bills and resolutions and the receipt and re-referral of committee
reports, to reconvene of Thursday June 5th 2014 at 11 am. [SPEAKER

stipulations stated by Senator Berger, to reconvene Thursday June 5th at
11 am, seconded by Senator Daniel. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER
