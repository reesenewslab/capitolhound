<p id="00:00">
And our Sargent in Arms, we’ve got Ed, Charles, Justin, and Billy with
us today, always do a great job. Senator Hunt, are you ready? Alright,
Senator Hunt, Senate Bill 334.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, are you ready?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It’s a pleasure to be able to speak
with you this morning on Senate Bill 334. First of all, I’d like to give
a little history. In 1848, there was some civic minded citizens who
conveyed a piece of property to the state of North Carolina. That
property is some of what you see up on this slide that’s before you.
There’s 307 acres plus or minus that was conveyed to the state of North
Carolina with the stipulation that it would be for the mental health
uses in our state. I believe that on December 28th, 2012, we departed
from that vision that those people had back in those days and I believe
it is time that we right that wrong. The, our proposal would direct that
the state of, Department of Administration to release a portion of the
Dorothea Dix campus to the city of Raleigh at a fair market value,
allowing the city to move forward with its vision of a worldwide park, a
world-class park for residents and visitors and I think that’s very
important. I think there’s a location there that would be highly
suitable for that but I think there’s some other uses for the land that
we must maintain the promise and the direction of those early property
owners who said that it should be for the mental health of, assistance
for our citizens. This bill designates the proceeds from the new lease
agreement that will fund mental health programs in the state and it
preserves a portion of the property to house the consolidation of,
initially we said 2500 state employees but we have determined that there
is a correction to that and at this time Mr. Chair I would like to
submit a technical amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Send forth your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe it has been distributed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s being distributed right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Senator Pate, I think everybody’s, I think got it or close to
getting it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may comment on the amendment then Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Really, we have found that we don’t have that many HHS employees up
there and the amendment corrects that, it’s just purely technical. I
move the adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, you see the amendment. Any discussion, debate on the amendment? If
not, we have a motion, all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any opposed? Alright. Ayes have it. Alright, go ahead Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, thank you Mr. Chairman. Furthermore, this bill that’s before
you instructs the Department of Administration and the Department of
Health and Human Services to go back to the 2007 State Government
Facility’s Master Plan which really started these discussions going on
and go back and use that as a way of identifying property that’s in that
307 acres plus or minus and report their findings to the general
assembly by March 2014. This bill maintains the purpose for the
property, outlined in the original deed from 1848 and at this time Mr.
Chairman I would like to turn the proceedings over to my colleague
Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, Senator Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you members of the committee, two purposes that we’re going
through and the reason for this re-??. The first Senator Pate spoke on,
the funds in the agreement were not set aside…</p>

<p id="05:00">
… this was originally asked in the property value for the treatment of
mental health, as the terminology would now use, for providing for those
sick. The second is that under state law it did not account for the
relocation of state employees from a property that they were currently
on, as was required. Furthermore, the lease itself provides for
condemnation by the state and ending by the state. We think it is very
important that this lease may move forward at a part, but that it do so
at a fair market value, to provide for mental health in this state as
this property was originally intended. And so that we can make plans
under the 2007 master planning process that we began, to relocate those
state employees or to consolidate them on the site as we see fit moving
forward. According to the plan, there are two proposals, as you will see
in this presentation, the green areas that come from that master plan,
that could very much be available for lease to the City of Raleigh who
would be given a right of first refusal for use as a park. You will see
that in this are two areas that they have placed for that, depending on
what will fit best for the consolidation and relocation of state
employees moving forward. I think that covers most of the technical. The
lease value, the value of the property that the state had appraised in
2011 comes in at $84M. I think this lease represents somewhere in the
neighborhood of about 1/16th of what the state would be doing in an
equivalent lease.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hunt, you have an amendment I understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. The memo has been distributed. Let me preface my
remarks by saying that I have been a long-term proponent of the ?? Park
for the whole thing. This amendment is intended to give the city an
opportunity to renegotiate the deal, assuming this bill as presented
passes. The amendment simply says that the land will be appraised as
park land or open space. Previously the appraisal contemplated what
would be considered the highest and best use, which would be commercial
development, and that’s how it got to that $84M appraisal. This
amendment simply says instead of considering it at commercial use, it
would be appraised as open space or park land. I encourage your support
of this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions for Senator Hunt of the amendment? Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, having a little opportunity to look over the
amendment and going back to the lease value of the property, the comps
that they used in determining the value ranged somewhere from $129,000
an acre to $391,000 an acre. When you look at the land that was the
soccer park in this appraisal, which is separated out. It’s 60 acres
that they assume meets the use of the property as open use, that 60
acres drops in appraisal value to about $33,000 an acre. Extrapolate
that out to the rest of the property, it would drop this value, the
leased 300 acres, to somewhere in the $9M value range. I think the
purpose is to provide the funds for mental health of the full use of the
property given. I’m not a member of the committee, for the integrity of
the bill, I would ask that individuals not support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other comments? Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Chairman. In the first place, there was a legitimate negotiation and
a legitimate lease and an end to. I’m reluctant to say that the city has
to go back. By the way, a city which is a public entity, which is part
of the state, should not have to go back and renegotiate terms that they
have already negotiated. I understand what Senator Hunt is trying to do,
because he can hear the whistle of a train when it is coming down the
track just like I can. I think it’s really a sad day when one
governmental unit cannot rely on another governmental unit or the …</p>

<p id="10:00">
...each specifically to abide by the terms of the deals that it makes. I
think that Senator Hunt's amendment tends to lessen the hypocrisy of
this bill by saying the city can go back and negotiate it...as...based
on park rates rather than commercial rates. And I say that...I had the
benefit, a couple of years ago, of visiting a fellow by the name of
Julian Robertson. He's from North Carolina who did quite well. He has an
apartment, right-fronting, Grand Central Park in New York City.  He's
from Salisbury. But, he had this 27th floor apartment, and I was
thinking what it would look like a hundred years ago when that part was
conceived, and they started putting it together, if-in fact-everything
had been appraised for its commercial value based on New York values
now. And what it would look like with 80 story skyscrapers on it. And
that's the kind of vision that one has to have when he looks at what
this park could be to North Carolina, not just Raleigh. I know that
Senator Hunt's amendment says that the city can go back and renegotiate
based on parkland values and that's a lot better than the 84 Million
that Senator Hise is talking about. So it is with mixed emotions that I
support his amendment although I think it's shameful that you even have
to have the conversation about the city renegotiating a lease it has
already successfully negotiated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hunt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Blue, I promise you I'm not trying to lessen the
hypocrisy. I'm simply trying...I'm simply trying to smooth the process
when the lease is..when the...I can see the train going down the tracks,
too, but it is simply going to smooth the process when we do go to
renegotiate the lease.  I mean you're talking about significantly less
than the appraisal we've been talking about. I suspect it will be, as
Senator Hise alluded to, it might be in the 10 million dollar range.
This would significantly smooth the process of renegotiating that lease.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any more comments on the amendment? Alright. All in favor of the
amendment say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All Opposed. No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the No's have it. Ok. Now the bill's back before us. Senator
Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I don't know what the chair's plans
are, but since it is a regular bill I would assume that comments could
be made by folks that are present. Let me simply say this, based on
Senator Hise's and Senator Pate's initial comments. They are
absolutely...that Dorothea Dix was created to be a hospital for mental
patients when very few folk around the country had the vision to figure
out what we ought to do with people that we were simply casting aside.
But this state made a decision several years ago when it decided to
abandon that campus and to build a new facility out in Creedmoor that it
would not be dedicated to mental health purposes. I've been around long
enough to know that about 20 years ago, in fact in 84, been more than 20
years, when the decision was made to divide that campus up because they
didn't need it for the farm anymore and a significant portion was given
to North Carolina State University which is now its Centennial Campus
for hundred year build out, at least 75 year build out as Claude
McKinney envisioned it, that a lot of folk were saying then you ought
not do it even though you were giving it to another governmental entity,
a state entity, NC State University, or the same arguments were made
about giving a significant amount of it to the Department of Agriculture
to build the Farmer's Market for economic development.  You know these
arguments you make are similar to some of those we heard then and I
don't think that anybody would dispute what the Centennial Campus has
done for North Carolina State University and consequently has done for
North Carolina or what the Farmer's Market has done to set the standards
for new farmer's markets. If you just wanted to designate the use of the
proceeds, all you got to do is in the budget say that all the funds
received for the lease of the Dorothea Dix campus will be used for
mental health services. That's all you got to do. Or if you really want
to be concerned about the mentally ill we would adequately fund the
multitude of programs that we got. Which we aren't doing so I think that
when you think that...When you reflect on what this park has done, not
just in Wake County but across the state visionaries who can understand
what a designation, destination park, like this will mean not only to
the City of Raleigh but to North Carolina 50, 75 years from now.
Actually the state ought to be developing a destination park...</p>

in part, like that, in its capital city, but since it's not, at the end
of this lease, the state will have given to it, a part fully developed
by the city, that will then belong to the state of North Carolina. And
so, I certainly hope that you'll vote against this bill. That idea goes
a long ways toward breaking up broad arrays of people who've shared
their vision and seen what this thing could mean for the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I pay taxes here in Raleigh, I pay
taxes in Henderson County. I don't think we should be giving an
advantage to Wake County over a valuable piece of real estate like this.
And, going further, I question the word of &quot;legitimate&quot; on how
the property was signed over. It kind of strikes me, as I was reading
that wonderful editorial today in that NNO paper here, how they go back
to the late-night activities of the House dealing with things. I think
this is very similar. What happened as the former governor was leaving,
and I think it is illegitimate, if anything, and so, I think for the
people in North Carolina, and the fairness of taxpayers in North
Carolina, we need to pass this bill and move on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, just following up on Senator Blue's comment. Senator Blue,
if I understand it correctly, in the lease currently, the lease can be
condemned for public use, and that Raleigh waives the rights to any
benefit from that lease.
That's in the lease that Raleigh signed if I'm not mistaken. I do concur
with Senator Apodaca, this was a lame duck deal done by a lame duck
governor. I was in a meeting months prior to this taking place in good
faith with some ambassadors for the city of Raleigh, and we were going
to negotiate, possibly, a price for the lease, and then it just kinda
went away, and I assume, since what has happened, they just got the
secretary, I mean, the governor, and the council of state to go on and
put the deal together, so it was kind of a end run if you will, sir, to
the process. Now Raleigh can certainly renegotiate the lease, we're
willing to renegotiate the lease with them, to move forward with the
park, probably lesser property than they originally did, so I mean, I
don't think there's anything underhanded or hypocrisy or any of those
terms that are there. We have 1800 employees in that area, and I guess
you would not propose for us to go out and lease a building and spend
taxpayers' money on that property. It was meant for mental health use.
We want to use that, possibly, to put DHHS, a new office complex in
there, and to do the things that are necessary to use for that, and
during the interim, by the way, I enjoy Pullen Park right diagonally
across the road from it, a 65-acre park that's been there since I
attended NC State. It's just how the city of Raleigh spent 7 million
dollars on renovation.It is a great park. So it's not like we don't have
open space in that area for the city of Raleigh. I think we ought to
just move forward with this bill, renegotiate the lease in good faith so
everybody knows where everybody's going and we can move forward from
there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. Any other comments from members? Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, I'm sorry, when you said any other comments, I knew there were a
couple other people in the back who wanted to talk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other members? Any comments? Senator Nesbitt?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to speak briefly to this. I don't know what
the new order is, to declare anything the last governor did as bogus
because somebody talked to him and said they'd help him after they're
gone. I wanna put you on notice, I would help anybody after my McCory is
gone. So anything he does from here on out is just a lame duck bogus
deal that we can void and totally ignore. This is insane. The people of
this state deserve a little continuity of government, and to be able to
rely on government. We're down here taking assets from cities. We're
down here voiding contracts because we don't like them. There's lots of
things I don't like, but somebody did them, and they did them
legitimately, and we've got to respect government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, may I speak to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I'll finish up.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well that's fine. I've--
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I often appreciate
your historical lessons that you teach us here, but you're talking about
voiding contracts, and you're talk about the general assembly taking
property from cities. This is a point of the city taking property from
state government, a power grab without question. So your comments
they're in line. If you want to look at this question of a city taking
property from the state, probably the most valuable real estate effort--
I mean, the most valuable real estate that the state owns now, and we
want to give it away and let it be used, and we just want to have some
[safe] zone in it. And you were here in 2007 when the master plan was
developed, all this does is adhere to the master plan when you were in
charge. That's all we're doing here and we'll renegotiate with Raleigh
as we move forward. So the bill just needs to pass so we can get a clean
look and move forward from there. Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator [crosstalk].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Chair do I get to respond to that? He had two
shots at it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Quickly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Chair, my complaint is that you're declaring
illegitimate anything out here that you want to to have your own way.
And this lease was approved by the governor and the counsel estate,
which was the appropriate way to do a lease. It's the same way Mcrory
will do a lease if he does one. He's gotta go get counsel estate
approval. It went through the process, and the fact that it occurred
late in a regime, thank goodness we finally got [lot of] gaming at
Cherokee late in the governor's tenure. Surely to goodness people won't
come and undo that because it was done the last year she was governor.
We've just got to recognize when people do things that people rely on
that, and the public's entitled to good government and continuous
government and to rely on government. And these things where we come in
and just summarily take things from people has got to cease.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's do this. I know I got Senator Richardson and ??
Dockham, and I think Senator Hanes want to say-- I'm going to let. We
had one person sign up to speak. Jim Goodman, I think had signed up. Jim
I'm going to let you go ahead and speak at this point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. You know if you're not down here
much, and you come in here and you sit in a meeting like this and you
hear people say things, you wonder what happens in this building. Right?
There's a lease. There's an existing lease that was negotiated in good
faith that both parties rely upon. Now, I'm Jim Goodman, I work at
Capital Broadcasting, I'm a member of [Dixie] Visionaries, that's Greg
Pool's group that's promoted the park for eight years. We didn't do the
lease, but we really encouraged people to negotiate and do it. So we got
a lease. Now, that's a part of it. We're on the same team. Same state,
same city. I don't know what this anger is between the legislature in
cities, but we have a lease and you guys are backing out on the lease.
I'm a business person - a lot of people in here are business persons -
what lease are we going to not do next? Let's call Metlife and tell them
we didn't really mean it about the what we're going to do with them or
what. And you're also saying-- how does Raleigh know that you're not
going to do this three years from now and say, &quot;Oops.&quot; You
know the second negotiated one wasn't good and we're going to do it
again. Nobody will trust doing business with the state if you take
leases. You guys don't like annexation, and condemnation and all that
stuff, and you jump right in and condemn your own lease. Which is very
valuable to Raleigh. Extremely valuable, and those damages will be
decided by jury, right? But the notion that you can come in and take a
lease and just say, &quot;Well we're not going to do it.&quot; is
remarkable. You should hear yourselves saying that! There's no business
persons in that state that would agree with you with what you're doing.
As it relates to this partnership. Here's the city of Raleigh. Have the
mayor heard about this?</p>

I hope she saw it on television, she probably read it in the paper. Your
partner in a long term lease and you're saying you want to avoid the
lease and nobody from the state, from the legislature said anything to
anybody in Raleigh. This is just a- please think about what you're doing
and tell me why people are supposed to trust doing business with the
state? You can't. It's a lease. Now I'm not going to argue the fair
market value and all that, but my experience in the last 10 years has
been in economic development. For 3500 people in American tobacco. And
they come- businesses come here because of community development. This
is the most significant community development project I've ever seen,
this park is going to have more of an economic impact  on this area than
anything I've ever seen here except the park, except the Research
Triangle park. This is a huge economic tool. It doesn't- I'm- mental
health is very important. The lease income from- the money from this
lease is a net in mental health. It doesn't have anything to do with
mental health. But you've gotta tell me why I'm supposed to trust- why
am I going to do a deal with you? If you just you do a lease and you
decide you don't like it, and shall we say- how about we say this:
Anything done by the previous Governor within 2 weeks of leaving is
void. Right you've got to understand how we feel on the other side of
this lease. What I said is perfectly legitimate, and it's a matter of
honor. We don't break leases. This can be the best partnership the state
has ever had. You've got this land,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jim, I need you to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I can, I better.
You've got this land, you've got a long term lease on it, and you've got
a city that's going to spend 100-125 million dollars developing it.
Improving the economy for everybody. Well you need to think about how we
feel about what you're doing and how everybody else in the business
community is going to feel about what you're doing.  This doesn't make
sense and it is not honorable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, we've got about  5 more minutes. Sen. Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
I just want to say up front, I know  people want to make this lease
about the previous government, governor or other things. I could care
less. When the previous governor signed ot or what time period those
occurred, I want to stand for a fact that we will not  go into leases in
the state that violates state law. By the operation of that lease it is
clear that steps would be required to be taken under state law to
relocate state employees and the state should not bear that cost going
forward because we refuse to follow that law in entering this lease. I
also want to  protect individuals who choose to make a gift to the state
to make a purpose, now and in the future. And we will make the statement
that  the state will honor the intent of that gift moving forward. I
don't care who the governor is or who it's moving , that is our
obligation as a state. We are to provide mental health benefits from the
revenue from this because that was intended when it was given to the
state. And we will continue to honor those. It's not about which
governor. If this governor takes similar steps I'll stand with you, Sen.
Nesbitt, but this lease is not inconsistent with the interest of the
state. It provided for the state to remove from the lease and provided
the damages required if the state condemned the property or others who
have the authority to condemn the lease that is done. So the matter is
settled, it was part of the negotiation of the lease, and we are merely
taking our rights under the lease to restore what should have been done
within this state.
