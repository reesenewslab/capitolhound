approach to the voters of this state. And I also wanted to hopefully
begin to get all of their voter bills on the table so when we're talking
about the bills people can see the whole picture, I think they paint
kind of a bleak picture. Okay, Larry I want to turn it over to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Nesbitt and certainly I think you said it, it seems
that instead of encouraging our voters to come to the polls and
participate in their government and feel empowered, the story here is
we're gonna roll up the ladder and make it so you can't get to the
polling place and if you get there, we're gonna intimidate you into
leaving or not voting. Now, house Democrats have filed a series of bills
over the last few weeks to make sure that the right to vote for North
Carolina citizens is preserved and protected. You know it's probably the
most important thing we do, as we look at our Constitution, the right
and really a responsibility for folks to vote is probably the most
important thing, but even on top of that, we take an oath when we are
sworn in to protect and defend that Constitution and there's no more
important right in that Constitution than that right to vote and the
citizen's participation; if they participate in their government,
they're gonna feel part of it, and it will be more responsive to them.
So as an effort we put forward to say, we're gonna defend that right to
vote, we're gonna defend that Constitutional right, we're gonna
discharge our duty, our oath that we swore to represent the people, and
one of the things we decided to do is ensure that by filing voter
empowerment legislation, to defend that vote and put it in our laws. And
one of the first things we did, was to have on-line voter registration
which would make it simpler and easier filing process for many folks who
want to register to vote. Additionally, we filed a bill, early voting on
weekends was sponsored by representative former Butterfield and Pierce
that makes a minimum amount of early voting on the weekends so it
ensures there's a minimum amount of time available for folks to vote on
the weekend. We have what is called our voter protection and integrity
act, and it guarantees registered voters will be able to vote at any
authorized polling place. Again, all of these acts are designed to
preserve that opportunity to vote and ensure that the citizens wont be
turned away. They've earned that right, they've paid their taxes,
they've done the other things they're supposed to do, and the least they
can do is have the opportunity to vote without being impeded. Now,
finally we have a voting improvement act. And it's a more comprehensive
act, and it improves the opportunities for people to vote in North
Carolina, and again it encompasses some of the previously listed. But
these four bills are bills that show that we believe in the people. And
we believe they should be able to participate in the voting process. Now
we've heard a lot from the governor, saying he wants to improve customer
service wherever he goes. And if you get billed twice for driving on the
turnpike or the for fee expressway, toll road, he says well we want to
have customer service and make sure you don't get billed twice for that.
Well, if we're concerned about double-billing on the expressway, if
we're concerned about long lines at DMV, then why aren't we concerned
about the most important thing. How about these lines at the polling
place, which the efforts of Republicans are gonna do. If they reduce the
amount of time you have to vote, they reduce the number of places you
can vote, and certainly impose a poll tax, and Martin I think that's
definitely a poll tax, I don't see any other way to say it, that we're
gonna tax you if your children vote at another poll, we're gonna charge
you if your children decide to vote and they're not at the same poll. If
that's not a poll tax, I don't know what one is. Early voting in North
Carolina has been a great success. The citizens say they like it, they
voted that they like it, and they want it based on their participation,
and so we see what is happening now. Regardless of what party you're in.
You should really want to be engaged by the electorate, you should want
to hear from them, and you should want them to participate, it validates
you and what you do. The voting improvement act and representative
Michaux is here to talk a little bit about it, will do a couple things
that are very important, and I want to have him say some, say some
words. Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, in looking at just voter improvement all around, I'm sorry that
folks weren't</p>

law. We know that our existing law is recognized as one of the best in
its class of a moderately regulated state in the nation, as per the Home
School Legal Defense Association. That Home School bar has been firmly
set in place under our current law and best suits the diversity of our
Home School community. We feel this has to remain intact to support and
serve each home school's unique needs as the current array of choices
provides the freedom to include many options that can work together to
meet the individual student's needs while preserving the parental
responsibility.
While those of us who are opposed to the proposed bills feel a
redefinition of the law through legislative action is not needed, we
could envision a refinement of the Home School policies and procedures
set forth by the Department of Non-Public Education and a coordinating
update of its existing Home School Guide, in specific, we point to pages
2, 9, 10, and 11.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mrs. Taylor.
Our next spokesman is Lydia Taylor. Lydia, tell us your name and...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you. Hello, my name is Lydia Taylor and I'm 16 and in the 10th
grade. Home schooling in North Carolina is a privilege due to the amount
of educational freedom that mine and other families enjoy. A change in
legislation is not only unnecessary, but it puts my home education at
risk. I already enjoy supplemental classes and additional resources
legally, as clarified by the DNPE Handbook. My peers and I, as the group
these changes would most directly affect, do not wish to see our current
law change. I ask you, distinguished Senators, to reconsider your
support of this bill.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Lydia.
That's all that we have signed up. That’s all we will hear from the
public comment, and at this time I will...
OK, Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I have a question for Senator Cook. Senator, my question is, what would
be the process, right now you can have two families, what would be the
process of moving, or going from two families, or dissolving a two
family relationship and just going back to the individual family? And
the nature of the question is, if you have two families that says no
more than two families that can determine the scope and sequence of
academic instruction, and for some reason the families were not in
agreement, what would be the process of dissolving that relationship?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You...
Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you for the question. As far as I know, there's no concern there.
The people involved would...
Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Turn your mic on every ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I don't think there's really a problem here. The people involved can
simply dissolve their relationship. It allows you to have two families,
but you don't have to have two families. You can have one family, and so
they split up, they split up, it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Senator Cook.
At this time, seeing no other hands, I will see if we have a motion.
I have a motion from Senator Woodard, from Durham. Do I have a second?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
All right, I have a motion and a second. All in favor, aye. Any opposed?
Bill passes.
Senator Cook, you'll handle your own bill on the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you. I appreciate all your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Senator.
We'll go quickly now to Back to the Basics. Now what we'll do on this
bill, it's already passed the House and we're going to have a vote on
that today. We've already discussed it and we will just simply present
the bill to you. Senator Austin, if you want to make an opening
statement you certainly may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.
Actually, I think this bill has been discussed really thoroughly in this
committee, has been discussed very thoroughly in the House, and has been
discussed and is being discussed very thoroughly in the public, and I
would just remind people that, for obvious reasons, for commonsensical
reasons, I think that there is overwhelming support for this bill and I
would urge your favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Senator.
And I will entertain a motion.
Have one from Senator Woodard. A second from Senator Curtis. All in
favor, aye. Any opposed? Bill passes.
You'll handle your own bill, Senator.
I am going to step down from the</p>

[Speaker changes.]...chair, since the next bill is mine and ask Senator
Soucek to take over.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Tillman, you're recognized to explain the
bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I do need a PCS motion to
Mister Chairman.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, we have a motion to adopt the PCS by Senator
Jenkins and all in favor to adopt the PCS? Aye? (AYES.) Opposed? No? The
ayes have it...the PCS is now before you.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you very much. One of the things that I've
complained about for forty years when I worked in the schools was the
amount of paperwork and it's increased since I've gotten out of the
chair. And it's more on teachers and you'll hear teachers everyday
tellin' you that they are frustrated with the amount of paperwork. Let a
teacher be creative and let them have the time in the classroom.  I've
asked a select group of school people, including a select group of
seasoned superintendents around the state to give me a list of some
things that they would like to see be eliminated, that's either
duplicative or that they have no value and no use that they can
determine as far as their school system goes.  We are required by VPI to
send in hundreds of reports, some of them have already been eliminated
and we're gonna' get most of the rest of them in this bill. And I will
be glad to take on questions about any aspect of the bill if you have
them, I'll be glad to...if i need the staff to assist me, they are able
and capable so I'll just leave it at that, Mister Chairman.
[Speaker changes.]Alright. Do we have any questions from the committee?
Senator Stein.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. In Part two, Senator
Tillman, the disadvantaged student report, it seems like you're trying
to consolidate the reports into one report each year.  Do you know how
many are done now? And are we going to be losing any of the information
or is it just saying that the same types of information that's provided
now will provided once a year instead of more regularly?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Tillman.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Stein, that's a good question. Some have been
combined, others have been eliminated and, as to which have been done
either way, I would ask staff to brief us on which ones have been
totally eliminated and which ones have been combined and which one is
maybe gonna be reported once instead of multiple times.  Some of all of
that is going on in this bill. I'd ask staff to assist in the answer to
that question by Senator Stein, which is a good one.
[Speaker changes.] Patsy, please.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Stein, you might notice in the summary, we
found two State Board of Education policies that require reports on
disadvantaged students and they had reports in December and April so
those would be combined. For more specific information, someone from DPI
might be available.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Bryant.
[Speaker changes.] I wanted to follow up [INAUDIBLE.]
[Speaker changes.] Alright. You may speak now.
[Speaker changes.] I was interested in Part One, where you were
eliminating the EFC reporting.  I was wondering if someone from staff or
EFC or DPI, whoever would know...what are we losing? Are we losing
anything in not getting that labor and economic information.  I asked
that because the common follow-up system, I at least became familiar
with it when we were looking at how to track services, the effectiveness
of services and the activity of ex-offenders in terms of employment and
employment training and other kinds of programs and that was seen as an
effective option for tracking those kind of services and the level of
participation. So I was wondering what would be the consequence of them
not reporting. If somebody could tell me.
[Speaker changes.] Staff, do you have a response to that.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Bryant, probably someone from DPI or some of
the other groups could say what the consequences. The bill just is
exempting the local school systems from having to report according to
GS96-33 that requires any state or local government agency that's
getting state or federal funds to provide job training, education, and
placement programs to report that information to the Labor and Economic
Analysis Division of the ..</p>
