Senate will stand in recess until 11:15. The Senate will come to order.
The sergeant of arms will close the doors. Members will go to their
seats. All members and guests in the gallery, will you please stand for
our prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for this day. We thank
you for this opportunity that you've given us to be here. Lord, we pray
that you give us wisdom in our decision making and look over our great
state going forward and all these things we ask in Jesus's name. Amen.

Mister President, Journal of Friday, August 1st, 2014 has been examined
and is found to be correct. I move that the Senate dispense with the
reading of the journal and that it stand approved as written.

from the House and the Governor, and the ratification of bills to
reconvene on Tuesday, August 5th at 10 AM. Tuesday, August 5th, 2014 at
2 AM. 10 AM. I don't go for that 2 AM business. Let me say that again.
