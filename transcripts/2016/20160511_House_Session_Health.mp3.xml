  <content id="77" timestamp="239850" end_timestamp="245503">Chairman and I am curious about the first two points under that </content>

  <content id="81" timestamp="250804" end_timestamp="253939">So I don't remember what our approach is now, </content>
  <content id="82" timestamp="253940" end_timestamp="254675">whether we have a </content>

  <content id="84" timestamp="255604" end_timestamp="258227">or now we have market rates that are changed </content>

  <content id="86" timestamp="259828" end_timestamp="263987">But exactly what we are hoping to accomplish with that part of the </content>

  <content id="89" timestamp="266869" end_timestamp="270676">&gt;&gt; I think basically just what it says as opposed to piece milling </content>
  <content id="90" timestamp="270677" end_timestamp="273747">it and basically trying to consolidate and streamline to have a </content>
  <content id="91" timestamp="273748" end_timestamp="276723">state wide approach to the funding allocation for the subsidized </content>

  <content id="95" timestamp="282741" end_timestamp="288372">&gt;&gt; So I think my concern is that not knowing whether we have a statewide </content>
  <content id="96" timestamp="288373" end_timestamp="295924">approach right now or not that wed do have variable markets across </content>
  <content id="97" timestamp="295925" end_timestamp="299849">the state so that if we are trying to subsidy </content>

  <content id="111" timestamp="328567" end_timestamp="330999">&gt;&gt; Is there someone here that would like to speak from the division </content>

  <content id="121" timestamp="353985" end_timestamp="356416">So no part of money is held, </content>
  <content id="122" timestamp="356417" end_timestamp="358464">so if a child moves from one county </content>
  <content id="123" timestamp="358465" end_timestamp="359849">to the other we would have to </content>
  <content id="124" timestamp="359850" end_timestamp="363383">to pull money from one county to put it into the other county. </content>
  <content id="125" timestamp="363384" end_timestamp="368169">And so the study may look at whether or not we reserve a portion </content>

  <content id="127" timestamp="370763" end_timestamp="371946">so that when children do </content>
  <content id="128" timestamp="371947" end_timestamp="375530">move, we are not taking from one county to give to the other. </content>
  <content id="129" timestamp="375531" end_timestamp="379786">So that the child can remain in services and still have the funding </content>

  <content id="131" timestamp="380906" end_timestamp="382826">So that's what we need to have happen. </content>

  <content id="137" timestamp="396203" end_timestamp="401834">&gt;&gt; And just a clarification if whether or not our funding rates </content>
  <content id="138" timestamp="401835" end_timestamp="403466">are the same across the state. </content>
  <content id="139" timestamp="403467" end_timestamp="407517">If they are uniform across this makes more sense if they are, </content>
  <content id="140" timestamp="407518" end_timestamp="408221">so </content>
  <content id="141" timestamp="408222" end_timestamp="410846">or do you know whether they are uniform across the state. </content>
  <content id="142" timestamp="410847" end_timestamp="414110">&gt;&gt; Again this is Jennifer Johnson. </content>
  <content id="143" timestamp="414111" end_timestamp="417533">&gt;&gt; The market rates do vary by county and by start level, </content>
  <content id="144" timestamp="417534" end_timestamp="418365">so again, </content>

  <content id="146" timestamp="419850" end_timestamp="423925">at the state level would help us so that we are not again moving </content>

  <content id="148" timestamp="427061" end_timestamp="429909">then they move to other county. </content>
