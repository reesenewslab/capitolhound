</content>
  <content id="54" timestamp="291978" end_timestamp="296098">I'm not much of a lawyer anymore, but basically the case was one </content>
  <content id="55" timestamp="296099" end_timestamp="305437">in which the governor </content>
  <content id="56" timestamp="305438" end_timestamp="310762">brought a lawsuit to determine the constitutionality of the Coal Ash Management Commission, and specifically the issue was the appointments </content>
  <content id="57" timestamp="310763" end_timestamp="318007">to that commission. The appointments in the original act put six </content>
  <content id="58" timestamp="318008" end_timestamp="320746">of the appointments with the General Assembly, </content>

</content>
  <content id="61" timestamp="325304" end_timestamp="326788">And my read </content>
  <content id="62" timestamp="326789" end_timestamp="333085">of that case is that it turns primarily on the appointments issue, </content>
  <content id="63" timestamp="333086" end_timestamp="341355">and that in this bill we are trying to address McCrory verses Berger </content>
  <content id="64" timestamp="341356" end_timestamp="348267">by re-constituting the Coal Ash Commission in a way that is consistent </content>

</content>
  <content id="69" timestamp="366278" end_timestamp="370885">What's different about this bill than many bills you see is pages 1, </content>

  <content id="71" timestamp="372166" end_timestamp="377182">3 going to all the way down to page 4, is all of these whereas </content>

  <content id="73" timestamp="378617" end_timestamp="382562">And the whereas clauses are really I guess, a recognition </content>
  <content id="74" timestamp="382563" end_timestamp="386625">that we've already had a lawsuit on this, and that we have a potential </content>
  <content id="75" timestamp="386626" end_timestamp="391848">for a lawsuit again. And rather than the court having to try to </content>
  <content id="76" timestamp="391849" end_timestamp="395381">figure out what it is we intended, </content>
  <content id="77" timestamp="395382" end_timestamp="398043">we're in these whereas clauses </content>

</content>
  <content id="79" timestamp="404188" end_timestamp="408616">So that is really what that is about. </content>
  <content id="80" timestamp="408617" end_timestamp="412302">Then beginning on page 4 </content>
  <content id="81" timestamp="412303" end_timestamp="417115">line 15 Section 1a, is the provision </content>

</content>

  <content id="92" timestamp="463661" end_timestamp="467705">and I wanna make sure you understand that the original lawsuit actually </content>
  <content id="93" timestamp="467706" end_timestamp="470930">had to do with more than just the Coal Ash Commission. 

</content>
  <content id="94" timestamp="470931" end_timestamp="474259">There were three commissions at issue here, </content>
  <content id="95" timestamp="474260" end_timestamp="477484">and so this bill actually deals with three commissions. </content>
  <content id="96" timestamp="477485" end_timestamp="479849">Although for various </content>

</content>

</content>
  <content id="163" timestamp="734053" end_timestamp="735692">But basically says that if all </content>

  <content id="304" timestamp="1336524" end_timestamp="1341796">We've been working with Duke in the last four or so weeks, and we discussed </content>
  <content id="305" timestamp="1341797" end_timestamp="1345784">with them that the remaining issues left from an uncertainty standpoint, </content>
  <content id="306" timestamp="1345785" end_timestamp="1351742">that is a risk standpoint, had to do with both dam repairs and </content>
  <content id="307" timestamp="1351743" end_timestamp="1357554">the issue of how much nearby water is being impacted by the basins. 

</content>
  <content id="308" timestamp="1357555" end_timestamp="1363141">I told Duke that they must satisfy those questions, </content>

  <content id="310" timestamp="1364652" end_timestamp="1368984">And toward the last two, three, four weeks it appeared that they were not </content>

  <content id="312" timestamp="1371200" end_timestamp="1375724">and so we discussed with them the possibility of eliminating some </content>

  <content id="314" timestamp="1379850" end_timestamp="1383329">wells by hooking them up with public water supply, </content>
  <content id="315" timestamp="1383330" end_timestamp="1386366">that would eliminate the risk entirely. 

</content>
  <content id="316" timestamp="1386367" end_timestamp="1392854">So at that time, they continued on trying to convince us otherwise. </content>
  <content id="317" timestamp="1392855" end_timestamp="1397345">But when we made it clear that we were going to establish the risk </content>

</content>
  <content id="325" timestamp="1425500" end_timestamp="1430574">And so I just tell you that to explain to you the context in which </content>

  <content id="327" timestamp="1433737" end_timestamp="1438562">and it's the kind of the brinkmanship that is unfortunate. And since </content>

  <content id="329" timestamp="1439850" end_timestamp="1441536">we still had to do our job, </content>

</content>
  <content id="336" timestamp="1453551" end_timestamp="1459694">With that kind of approach, we should be able to be given the authority </content>

  <content id="340" timestamp="1466786" end_timestamp="1468782">Makes total sense, </content>

</content>
