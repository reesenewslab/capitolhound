  <content id="3" timestamp="4870" end_timestamp="12754">&gt;&gt; Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I first met Earline Parmon in 02 whenever </content>
  <content id="4" timestamp="12755" end_timestamp="19078">she first came to the General Assembly to replace Pete Oldham. </content>
  <content id="5" timestamp="19079" end_timestamp="22610">I was impressed from the outset </content>
  <content id="6" timestamp="22611" end_timestamp="28191">because Earline was all about business, but at the same time she had </content>
  <content id="7" timestamp="28192" end_timestamp="35057">a very, very unusual way to convey to you what it was that she wanted </content>
  <content id="8" timestamp="35058" end_timestamp="40254">to accomplish because she had a roundabout joking way </content>
  <content id="9" timestamp="40255" end_timestamp="43172">to get it done.

  <content id="21" timestamp="76089" end_timestamp="77496">but I'm going to the </content>
  <content id="22" timestamp="77497" end_timestamp="81822">Speaker and I'm going to you, and we're gonna put those in there, </content>
  <content id="23" timestamp="81823" end_timestamp="84792">they're actually gonna be social workers. </content>
  <content id="24" timestamp="84793" end_timestamp="85969">And we did do that, </content>

  <content id="26" timestamp="87993" end_timestamp="91294">And they stayed in the budget for quite some time, </content>
  <content id="27" timestamp="91295" end_timestamp="93598">into the poor </content>
  <content id="28" timestamp="93599" end_timestamp="95774">areas of the state, </content>

  <content id="73" timestamp="229757" end_timestamp="231772">&gt;&gt; She said, Oh my goodness! What am I gonna do? </content>
  <content id="74" timestamp="231773" end_timestamp="234972">I said, well I'm gonna take care of that, for you watching me, </content>

  <content id="89" timestamp="270552" end_timestamp="275223">But that was the protectionist that Earline was, </content>

  <content id="118" timestamp="407819" end_timestamp="412234">and shared jokes with those of us on both sides of the aisle. 

</content>
  <content id="119" timestamp="412235" end_timestamp="421029">In fact, Representative Parmon, when my party was in control, sat </content>

</content>
  <content id="125" timestamp="443046" end_timestamp="448575">She worked with the Silver Alert, and just always put people first </content>

  <content id="132" timestamp="467600" end_timestamp="472694">and of course, she thought her sorority was the best of the best. 

</content>
  <content id="133" timestamp="472695" end_timestamp="480389">So, she and I used to debate about which office was going to be </content>

</content>
  <content id="138" timestamp="504761" end_timestamp="510073">And Earline always won out because she always debated and argued </content>

</content>
  <content id="161" timestamp="579415" end_timestamp="584765">So she started this school, and called it a LIFT Academy, </content>
