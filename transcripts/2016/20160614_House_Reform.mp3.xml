  <content id="987" timestamp="3179850" end_timestamp="3186143">I think an outside contractor had presented the bill at $145,000. </content>
  <content id="988" timestamp="3186144" end_timestamp="3191224">So I asked the DO to do an in house analysis on how much the project </content>

  <content id="990" timestamp="3192421" end_timestamp="3195816">That cost came in $50,000 less. </content>
  <content id="991" timestamp="3195817" end_timestamp="3200241">And I think they actually did the job less than 95,000 </content>

  <content id="993" timestamp="3201610" end_timestamp="3205159">But anyway we're looking to save tax payer dollars. </content>
  <content id="994" timestamp="3205160" end_timestamp="3208468">So paying more in lot of what you're saying, </content>
