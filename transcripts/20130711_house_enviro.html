We are very limited for time today.  Very limited.  We start session at
10:00, we have through here and voting by a quarter 'til.  And I know
that there's going to be a lot of questions here from committee members.
[INAUDIBLE]
Well that's what I said, didn't I? Oh.  Oh.  Session at 11:00.  I'm
sorry.
Okay, our sergeants at arms today:  Bill Bass, Joe Crook, Carl Morello,
and Martha Gabson.  And we don't have any pages.  And we have no pages
this week, so that's why there's no list.  Thank you very much for being
here.  We will probably have other members filter in.
There is a P.C.S. and Senator Gunn, would you like to come forward? And
Representative Faircloth also.  We need to take a vote on the P.C.S.
Representative Samuelson, would you like to make a motion that the
P.C.S. be before us?  Thank you.
All in favor, say Aye.  All opposed, no. Okay.
All right.  And we're hoping to have a minute or two for public comment,
but there probably won't be time for it.  This is a negotiated bill.  A
lot of stakeholders have been involved all the way through this process,
and I'll let Senator Gunn explain that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning and thank you for allowing us to be here today to talk
about Senate Bill 515 and the committee substitute.  First of all, I
just want to thank the House legislative members and DENR for working so
hard to come up with a good, workable compromise bill.  So I want to
give credit right out front for the stakeholders who have helped us
craft this bill so that we can move forward.  There's nobody in here.
There's nobody in this room that does not want to see Jordan Lake clean.
 At least I hope not anyway.  I certainly know I do, and I certainly
know the Representatives in here do.  But the problem is, the truth of
the matter is we've got a very impeded lake.
What I'm going to do, and let me just briefly say on the back of the
last page of your bill analysis, you'll see what the proposed committee
substitute does.  We're going to provide that until July 1st, 2016,
additional implementation of the Jordan Lake rules and related session
laws is suspended.  Provisions of the Jordan Lake rules and related
session laws that were being implemented prior to the effective date of
the P.C.S. would continue to be implemented.  And we're also going to
provide for the modification implementation of protection of existing
riparian buffers rules.
Now, what I want to do is go back briefly and talk a little bit about
what we did in the Senate and then I want to talk about where we are as
we go forward with this committee House substitute.  Let's talk about
why we feel and I feel that these policy changes are necessary.  When
this lake was built, the federal government knew that this lake was
impaired.  Matter of fact, if you look at the first page of your bill,
we give you the history of what the comments were from the Corps of
Engineers when they impounded this lake back in the 70s and, I guess,
near 80.  Eight years of DENR studies from 2008 to 2012, the data has
shown that the nutrient and resultant agal issues in the lake have not
gotten better.  Hundreds of millions of dollars later, we have no
improvement to the quality of the water in Jordan Lake.  Evidence
suggests, preconstruction evidence and evidence from DENR, suggest that
the deployment of unlimited resources and technology upstream will never
improve the water quality of the lake itself.
And I'm very appreciative to DENR.  They have sat down with us
face-to-face and looking us in the eye and asking the question.  We
asked will the Jordan Lake Rules, at any cost, have a material effect on
the water quality in the lake.  And they were candid and said, Senator
Gunn, we cannot give you those assurances.  We do not think that they
are going to do what the bill was intended.  Good intentions with the
Jordan Lake Rules, but unfortunately where we are today, it is not
working.
We have new technology available today that DENR will ... [AUDIO ENDS].</p>

That was not available that when these rules were implemented are being
considered. I'll talk a little bit more detail about that in a few
minutes. We all know hundreds of thousands of people depend on this for
drinking water, It is a great recreational lake, it is used for economic
development. It is an asset to the state of North Carolina. We have got
to put in place rules that will actually clean the water and that is
what our commitment is and that's what I hope will be the commitment of
this house. Just for example right now, Cary is looking to spending 2
million dollars  on a purification system to try and get their water so
it doesn't smell, it doesn't taste bad and they are one of the least
affected areas. So think about it, Cary is already spending 2 million
dollars and they are in a area that is least affected. The lake rules
have caused a tremendous burden up strain on the municipalities, on the
tax payers, on development and on businesses. We are looking at price
tags in the neighborhood of 2 billion dollars as we move forward to the
implementation of these rules. It'd be one thing if we had reason to
believe that these rules are actually gonna clean this lake but we have
not got the evidence to prove that. Most of you probably know that when
this was heard in the past through the senate, there was complete repair
of the Jordan lake rules. I am here to tell you today that is in fact
not what is going to happen. As I stated for, we are simply asking as a
part of this bill is that we suspend the rules that are currently not in
place to July 1st of 2016 while keeping all other rules that have been
implemented in place and I believe maybe representative Faircloth is
going tot talk about some additional information regarding the repairing
of buffers and maybe the airport. We are committed and we need to be
committed to fixing this lake. There are new technologies out there that
we did not have and do have available now. I do wanna make sure that you
do know something then I'm going to talk about it in a minute if I can I
think probably Madam chair at a appropriate time. I don't know if these
amendments are ready to re-note and if we could, if it's ok with the
committee, I'd like to go ahead and bring forward these amendments but
let me also say that once we get those in, I'd be glad to address, if I
need to our staff can. If that will be okay, Manager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairwomen. This amendment, I don't know if it have been
passed or not, No It has been passed, thank you. It has been passed out.
If it's okay with the chairwoman, I'll also spend until it passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is this the ASP 75 version 2?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sarry one have a copy of the amendment, please explain your amendment,
representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairwomen. This amendment basically delays the rules in
question if you read through the amendment, it makes it delay. What we
want to do is to have a control, setting here to where we can look at
what we are trying to do, we can know if we are trying to do works and
then delays it for 3 years and keeps control. We have the control to
state anything we add to it after we implement this action. We will
really pollute what we are trying to do so this just delays it for 3
years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager just made a motion for ASP 75 version 2. Any
discussion, representative Samuelson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A question, I'd like to hear from the bill sponsors what they think
about the amendment and also difference between sustained and delay and
if that's the case then why are we also...</p>

&lt;h3&gt;whereas causes another stop, so I 'd like a more thorough
explanation and the response of the bill's sponsors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, let's go head and ask Senator Gunn to respond to the suspend vs. the
delay and then maybe the bill's sponsor can or the amendment sponsor can
explain the other parts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair, and thank you Representative Samuelson, if I can
madam chair I would like to have Jeff Hudson answer those questions and
then I will at a later time explain what we're going to do during this
three year period.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jeff, will you answer both those questions? Could you describe the rest
of the amendment for Representative Samuelson also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am. As Senator Gunn explained, the current version of the P.C.S.
would suspend addition implementation of the rules until July 1, 2016.
So, that just freezes the rules in place if nothing happened and then
July 1 2016 came around, then the rules would all immediately go back
into effect including some that may have effective dates or
implementation dates of 2014 or 2015. So, if nothing happened, under the
current P.C.S. at July 1 2016 you could have some issues with the rules
immediately becoming effective and local governments and others having
to try to scramble to address those rules. What the amendment does is
rather than suspend the rules basically it freezes them in place, the
amendment delays all of the effective dates by three years if they
haven't begun implementation by July 1 2013 of this year all of the
implementation dates get kicked out for three years so if you had a 2014
implementation date the under the P.C.S., if nothing happened by July 1,
2016 that rule would immediately become effective and its implementation
would be required. Under the amendment that 2014 date would get kicked
out to 2017 so there would still be some time for folks to prepare for
the coming implementation of the rule. So that's the difference between
suspension and delay. The other, the middle part of the amendment that
you see that's deleting some lines, there's certain rules I believe the
department asked for this, that they haven't become implementation prior
to July 1 2013 but they're supporting rules, they're not the full
regulatory rules. They need to go ahead and become effective and be
implemented independent of this so they're pulled out of the definition
of Jordan Lake rules so this is going to be the I believe it's the rules
listed on page two line 29-32. And Line 39 and 40 so that's G, H, and L,
those rules will continue to be implemented when their effective dates
come around.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Did that answer your questions Representative
Samuelson. OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair. I support this. This actually was part of the
good faith negotiations between the house and the senate and deaner and
when it comes to how it was worded, actually it was just a miswording of
the ?? intent was really it, it actually was negotiated I think
Representative from deanery are here and they would testify to you that
they are in agreement with this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair. Thank you Senator Gunn. I was specific
negotiations that include an environmental list, environmental
advocates, I just had a question about on page two line 13 should that
also read delay? It's just suspend additional implementation Jordan Lake
rules, should that be consistent? I just wondered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would confer to staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can do that as a perfecting amendment to this amendment. It probably
should be delay. the part there, it has no legal effect, but to clean it
up we can do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Representative Catlan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I apologies for not having memorized all of the rules in
North Carolina but could staff please tell me what G, H, and I are? They
were taken out, is it L?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We could have someone from the department answer that. Neil, or Tom
Reader? Please identify yourself and
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair, I'm Tom Reader, I'm the director of the
divisional water resources. Basically, like was said by Jeff Hudson -

<p id="15:00">
These are supporting rules. Basically G and H provide opportunities for
local governments to provide mitigation for impacts to the buffers
which, of course, the buffer rules were already implemented so they'll
stay in place. And L is simply a supporting rules that provides local
governments the option of providing options for their nutrient loads. So
again, it's just a supporting rule and they would like those to stay in
place and we concur with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Did that answer your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
So these will not be delayed. They would stay in place.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
That's correct. Okay? Thank you Mister Iler. Okay, any other questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes Madame Chair
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I'm sorry? Oh, Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Still trying to be clear and maybe it's a question for staff like for
Jeff Hudson. If I had hopes that these rules were somehow to stay in
effect sooner rather than later, I want to be for the amendment or what
I want to oppose the amendment? In other words, it's just a little bit
unclear to me why suspend is an improvement on delay or rather delay is
an improvement on suspend.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Maybe we could have the department answer that. I think this was their
suggested language, so if you can identify yourself from the department.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Madame Chair. Neil Robbins with DNR. Representative, we
suggested this language and I think Mister Hudson referenced it in his
initial comments. What we're hoping to prevent is a stacking up of rule
implementation where a prerequisite rule might come into effect
immediately in July of 2016 and then be compounded by another rule that
might be needed within twelve months of that rule. So this just sets
forth and keeps those, the distance between those rule implementations,
so that they're not getting hit with twelve months to implement a rule
that they thought they would have three years to implement.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
May I follow up? So in effect, the fourteen fifteen sequence continues
except that it's been pushed back three years.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Any further questions from committee members on the amendment? Okay,
hearing none. All in favor of the amendment, aye. All opposed, no. Okay
then, the amendment does pass. We are back on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Madame Chair. At this time I'd like to call Representative
Faircloth to come up and talk to you a little bit about the amendments
that we're making as it relates to some of the airport facilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
On page three of the bill under Section 2c, you'll see wording there
having to do with airport facilities. Particularly we were interested in
assuring that, given the nature of development around our major airports
at this time, we wanted to be sure that when an industry is a part of
the airport function for instance say, a manufacturer of airplanes or a
company that rebuilds airplanes and have to have access to the runways,
they have to be right there at the airport, that they are included as a
part of the airport facilities and treated just as the airport is. So
that was put in there to assure that we don't impede industries that are
trying to join our airport facilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Any questions for Representative Faircloth? Any questions on the bill at
all from any committee members or comments? Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. So, we've delayed implementation for three years by that
amendment. How are we going to decide whether or not, does that mean we
are going to move forward or during this three year period we're going
to learn something new and decide not to do those?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Gunn
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
You must have got my signal. Thank you. That's what I said I would
address at a later time which is now. Part of the dialogue in the Senate
and the original bill was, two things are going to happen that are part
of this because I want</p>

<p id="20:00">
Go back and emphasize again, that the intent of this legislation is to
actually clean the lake and make the water quality better in Jordan
Lake. So, let's talk about that. One thing that is going to happen
during this period is that we will have The Speaker and the Pro Tempore
instruct the ORC to form a Jordan Lake study committee. This study will
consist of Senators and House Members and we will revisit all aspects of
the Jordan Lake rules. Best practices, new technology, cost,
implementation, dates. It is very important that we look at the best
practices that are available that Deaner, by their admission, did not
have when they did these original plans. Second part of this, and I
think a very important part, is that we are going to appropriate two
million dollars to do a pilot project in the Morgan Creek and Haw River
arms. This two million dollars, the majority of that  money will come
from the Clean Water Trust Fund. I always like to use Clean Water Trust
Fund money to clean water. Seems to be reasonable to me. And we are
going to use that to do a pilot program that will probably have to do
with circulation of the lake. We know and the research that we have
done, and have seen, is a big problem with the arms of that lake are the
fact that we have algal blooms due to the lack of circulation. It's a
bad designed lake. You've got these fingers. You've got burns that
impede water flow. Just the augmentation of the lake itself, the land
augmentation initiation would help. So we're going to do a very
extensive study but more importantly we are also going to do a pilot
project for two years that will actually use some best practices and
technology that is out there to hopefully, and we are very confident,
show some dramatic improvement in the lake quality.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Now, so meanwhile let's say I'm a developer. I do not have to
meet the potential rules that might still be in place three years from
now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, you know these rules had been suspended now and we are pushing
some of those back. I do want to tell you, to let you know this,
Representative. Pushing these rules back, I want to be real clear on
this, has nothing to do with the protections of that lake. Just like
every other stream and lake and river in North Carolina, we are highly
regulated. And I'm very supportive of those regulations. The Clean Water
Act, the Safe Water Drinking Act, the Phase II Storm Water Rules, the
national permit discharge and elimination system permits for outflows
into the upstream tributaries of lakes. None of these are out of place
now. All setbacks, guidelines, storm water rules, buffer rules that are
in place remain in place. So that lake has always been protected like
the other lakes and streams and buffers in the state of North Carolina.
We are just pushing back some of these rules that we firmly believe are
not going to have a material difference on the quality of the lake. So
that we can hopefully come back to you. And it is hard. Deaner's been
very involved and I appreciate it. We can show you some real results.
That's the plan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more quick follow up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quickly, because we have a couple of other people who want to ask
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. There are municipalities that have already implemented these
future rules. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Stages.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And they don't have to take those out as a result of this legislation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, they spent a lot of money. There has actually been hundreds of
millions of dollars spent already, just in my municipality alone –
Burlington. They are completing now a twenty-four million dollar point
source discharge system. Obviously, hopefully, there will be some
advantages down the road for Burlington. And as we move forward in this
bill, part of our study, Representative, will be to look at this, this
by the way is an inner</p>

municipalities that use it, are upstream from it, are going to share in

[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Samuelson
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Madame Chair. I have a question for the bill's sponsor but I'm
guessing that the two chairs who are also chairs of Appropriations may
have the answer. In that Clean Water Management Trust money that you
mentioned are going to be used for the pilot project, is that on top of
the current allocation for Clean Water Management Trust or would that
come out of the current allocation
for Clean Water Management Trust?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative, I wish I could give you a straight answer. I'm not
positive. I do know that is where we are planning on drawing the money
from.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Then I'll ask the chairs of Appropriations. When you
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
I understand it comes out of it.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
It comes out of the current appropriation with the Clean Water
Management Trust Fund. Then I'll make a comment. Since I think that
amount of money is currently inadequate I will vote against the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Hager
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Madame Chair. Just a quick question and then a motion after
that please. Question for the bill's sponsor. In reading some of the
letters from EPA, they were a little concerned on the nine point
discharges. Just to clear that up for me, this won't shift any more
weight or any more control on the MPDS discharges will it?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
We don't believe that would be a fact. No sir.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you, and for a motion at the proper time. I'm ?? if you're ready.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Okay. Representative Harrison has
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Madame Chair and thanks to those of you who are involved in
toning down the impact of this bill from what was originally passed out
of the Senate. I am grateful for that. But I would note that we've
studied this issue to death. We've been working on it for years. We know
we've got an important drinking water source for more than 300,000 North
Carolinians. It's impaired and it's not getting any cleaner because we
keep delaying the implementation of the Jordan Lake Rules.
And we know, as Representative Catlin pointed out, we've got some
communities including some in my county that have already adopted
ordinances to implement these cleanup procedures. We've got an EPA
mandate that we can't ignore from the Clean Water Act to prevent the
further pollution of this lake. And as that letter that Representative
Hager mentioned points out, just clean out at the lake site is not
adequate and we need to focus on upstream sources as well.
If we do not ultimately implement these rules, as I understand it, I
don't know that the EPA might end up taking over control of our water
quality protection programs. The Jordan Lake Rules, as I understand it,
involve agriculture and forestry inputs and those are not regulated by
the EPA. So if we take out their efforts to clean up the water, it will
be even more expensive for the taxpayers back home. So I think it's an
unfortunate step that we are taking in delaying it. I'm very
appreciative that it's not as bad as the bill that came out of the
Senate but I urge you to vote no. Thanks.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Any further comments? Representative McGrady.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
I also think it's an unfortunate step that we are going down this road.
These rules, while contentious and very very difficult and unfortunately
expensive, are what they are and I don't know that suspending them and
studying them is any better. I wasn't actually going to speak on this
until the Senator back into the other subject, and that is first taking
money from Clean Water to spend on what is called a pilot project. The
pilot project, I believe, is going to be very clearly directed at some
technology, I think it's called SolarBee.
Taking money out of a fund that is underfunded and then giving it to one
company on technology that is unproven is a mistake. And we wouldn't
normally put up with this in other contexts. We are doing this by
creating a bill in three parts: Part of it in the appropriations
process, part of it in the study process, part of it by suspending these
rules. But together, this is still a very bad set of things that we're
about and so I will likewise oppose the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
We're going to have one more comment. Represent Luebke was next and then
Representative Catlin and then we are done with comments. We will be
voting on this bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Well just to. If you, Madame Chair, ask me to make it as a comment.

of money already into this plan so of other areas the plans are working
and members i just failed to understand a logic when a plan is working
why delay the plan for three years so so any interested time madame
chair i had like to,
Speaker Changes: senator ??,
Speaker Changes: to vote against the bill,
Speaker Changes: OK senator ?? what kind of respond to that please,
Speaker Changes: Representative ?? i make comment to that we certainly
have a fundamental difference to or believe whether the plan is working
of my conversations with people lost more than with probably national
resources will tel us otherwise that they are very concerned about their
outcome and they are  can you imagine an amount of spending i don't mind
spending thousand and hundred s of millions of dollars provided we know
that it is going to clean this up ?? prepared to do their share ?? is
gonna do their share i know apex ?? everybody wants to do their here
because the ultimate goal for all of us is to clean it up now the
technology was not there that is there today given i think that's been
evidence about many folks and lot of dialogues so i think this is
actually if you are interested if you are truly interested in green a
water Jordan lake i think this is impaired to do we do best practices
and not take money that quite honest we don't evidence that is gonna
make a tail difference let us find a way to clean this water i think i
want you to with me to clean the water and i think this is a great way
to do it,
