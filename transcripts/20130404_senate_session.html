[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning.  For those of you that may pray a little differently than
I do, or for those of you who may not pray at all, I’d like to just
start with a moment of silence.  Let’s pray.  Our father and our God, we
thank you for being a prayer answering God and a covenant keeping God.
Thank you for giving us access to you who alone holds all power, majesty
and authority.  Thank you for the promise that if we abide in you and if
your words abide in us, we can ask what we desire and we shall receive
them. Thank you for the promise of the effective fervent prayer of a
righteous person avails much.  I pray today God for our Lieutenant
Governor, our Governor for this body of officials, Senators,
legislatures. Specifically God, this North Carolina General Assembly.  I
pray for every elected and appointed official to assemble in this
chamber today.  I pray God for the most senior statesmen here to the
most newly elected.  I pray for their families.  I pray for the desires
of their hearts. I pray God that you will keep them in good health and
in sound mind.  I thank you God for this nation we live in. I thank you
God for the vision of our forefathers, that we might be governed by a
division of powers so that our destiny does not rest in the hands of one
person. So that in God, I pray that our destiny will not be controlled
by special interests, or personal agenda or racial prejudice or
injustice. I pray God for policies, discussions, outcomes that are
compassionate and also good for the common good. I pray God that the
decisions will be made in this place to empower people to do great
things.  I pray God, that decisions will be made in this place that
people will not be allowed to live irresponsibility.  I pray for wisdom
to make decisions that will strengthen and prosper our state. I pray God
both for both social and capital entrepreneurism.  I pray God for
policies that will benefit those who wear either a Timex or a Rolex. I
pray God for policies that will benefit those in public housing, as well
as in gated communities. I pray God for those with a Ph.D as well as
those with a G.E.D.   I pray for every business, every belief, every
burden. I pray for health care that is affordable and accessible.  I
pray for a n education system that results in our children being
critical thinkers and not reduced to good test takers.  I pray for the
wealthiest and the poorest of our state.  I pray for those, for those of
us who govern. That we might realize that our blessings, our prosperity
we might acknowledge that we are the beneficiaries many years removed of
the entitlements of land grants, G.I. bills and the Homestead Act. I
pray for the common good. I pray that no select group of people would
feel entitled.  God that their own comfort and convenience would have an
adverse effect on the masses.   I pray God that we embrace what G.K.
Chesterton wrote in 1909 when he stated, the first principal of
democracy is this. That the things common to all men are more important
than the things peculiar to any man.  I pray for a spirit of gratitude
that we were not born in Burundi, or Madagascar or Afghanistan. But we
were born in the greatest nation in the greatest state to ever exist.
Help those who are in this chamber to be thankful for the opportunity
you have given them to lead and to govern. And to remind each of us as
we deliberate today God, that for every vote, every meeting, every email
we will be accountable for the decisions and the deeds done in these
offices. Give us a productive day, that you may be pleased and be able
to say well done.  In Jesus’ name I pray.  Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amen.

Senator Pate is recognized to explain the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister President. Good morning ladies and gentlemen of the
Senate. The incidence of diabetes among North Carolina citizens is high
and is increasing at an alarming rate as I'm sure you have all heard or
read about. The bill requires the following divisions to develop plans
for the populations they serve that would reduce the incident of
diabetes through improved diabetes
care and control complications associated with diabetes. These divisions
are The Division of Medical Assistance, The Diabetes Prevention and
Control Branch of the Division of Public Health and the State Health
Plan Division out of the State Treasurer's Office. This bill would
require that on or before December 1st of each even numbered year</p>

<p id="10:00">
Three divisions would collectively submit a report to the Joint
Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services and
including in their report the assessment of the financial impact that
each type of diabetes has, a description and assessment of the
effectiveness of each entity's programs and activities and a description
of the level of coordination that exists among the entities.  The
development of and revisions to detailed action plans for preventing and
controlling diabetes and related complications, a detailed budget
identifying the needs, costs and resources required to implement the

closer attention to the effects of this very devastating disease and I
would ask for your approval and vote for this Bill.  Thank you very
much.

The permit ?? that we have right now, currently someone could ask for a
one time permit, on a Friday afternoon, and get a permit over the
weekend, and before the commission ?? week, and check out the permit
over the weekend. By the next Monday the events already happened and
what has happened in the past, we've had people who abused the one time
permit process to get a special permit on a weekly basis or bi-weekly
basis. It was something in the stacks of the permits, keep stacking up
and up, and the commission at ALE, they don't have the chance to go
through it before the actual permits are issued because someone will
have a one time permit. What this will do, will give ten days to get the
permit in and up before the event to make sure that the ?? commission at
ALE. To make sure that it is proper to have it while those they were
having were improper events where it was against the law in certain
parts of the state, but also, Mr. President, also, to clarify, part of
the bill is I'd like to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do the members have copies, senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can send forward your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. The amendment that you have before you is to
make sure that for our international wine companies, and other people
that are coming in from outside, they're eligible to have these one time
permits, that's currently the way the law was written. This was
something that we passed last year, it failed to pass in the house
because of the time constraints, but this is something that will allow
the international vendors to have their one time permit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ?? , for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Brock a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, we're having Willy Nelson come to the petty farm. We
don't have an exact date, but hopefully this summer, and they're
sponsored by George dickel and some other distributors of finer
beverages. That is a national, multi-national company. How will they be
effected by this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think if they listen to Toby Keith, as long as they stick to beverages
they'll be alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But, seriously, Senator Tillman, and they'll have plenty of time to get
this in that case. ?? When you have the event you'll have plenty of time
to get the permit, and also the bill closes the loophole that people are
getting special permits on a recurring basis in dry areas, where it was
not allowed by law. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, you're using logic with an illogical question. Let me go
over one more avenue with this. You know, Willy and his motor home, they
don't have permission to search his motor home do they? He could have
other things other than alcoholic beverages that he likes to bring with
him. That would not affect that, would it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. No it wouldn't. He can still bring them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I'll vote for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other notices or announcements? Senator Robinson,
for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a moment of personal
privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson has the floor for a moment
of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President, and
to the members of this body. April is Public Health Month across the
nation and in North Carolina. North Carolina has one of the oldest
systems in the United States. According to North Carolina Office of
Archives and History, we can trace the history of our Department of
Public Health back to an act of 1755. In 1877, the General Assembly
created the first state board of public health, composed of the entire
medical society of North Carolina. The county boards of health were
composed of affiliated county medical societies and were under the
direction of the state board of health. Just to share a few other
excerpts, the General Assembly adopted 100 dollars to establish the
public health system. In 1899, the General Assembly passed additional
legislation to protect public water supplies from contamination. In
1911, the General Assembly recognized the state public board of health
as the state’s medical advisor. In May of 1911, Guilford County</p>

established the first department of public health in the state and the
second in the nation. In 1931, the dental health dental care program was
established as a separate division of oral hygiene. In 1945, the general
assembly instructed the state board of health to initiate a program
related to prevention and cure of cancer. In 1949, the last remaining
county established a full-time health department. In 1965, then Governor
Dan K. Moore designated the state board of health as the official state
agency to administer Medicare. Today, we acknowledge that the North
Carolina public health system continues to play a critical role in
eliminating health inequities and preventing chronic diseases and
injuries. The public health system has a continued focus on promoting
public health programs that provide accessible high-quality medical care
and that promote healthy lifestyles for women of child-bearing age, and
it has resulted in a more than sixteen percent decline in infant
mortality. Therefore, I would like to send forth a senatorial statement
recognizing April 2013 as Public Health Month and commend it to this ??
body. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. You can send forth your
statement. Do we have any other notices or announcements? Is there any
further business to come forth in the Senate? Now, the Chair recognizes
senator voter for a motion [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I

and re-referral of committee reports and the receipt of messages from
the house and the governor, reconvene on Monday, April 8, 2013 at 7:00

the stipulations stated by Senator Berger to reconvene Monday, April

&quot;Aye&quot;, opposed &quot;No&quot;. The &quot;Ayes&quot; have it.
