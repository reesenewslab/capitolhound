I put together on one page on if you well what the findings are from as
a result of this audit and then also included several tables that will
refer to I think if you're this presentation is to help you get a better
idea some the flight family be making additionally him on that one pager
we have included page numbers from the audit report itself when the
metaphor is Wednesday more details about finding and refer you back to
pages in the are or revealing and angry and him like more details on so
I have with me this morning on our subject matter experts that work with
us on on this audit link here and when he was recognized Seesmic.php and
also hierarchy Leicester on-again subject matter expert at work with us
on this on performance I had a supervisor that was in charge of this are
that logrolling after my staff and also my manager of the form
submission category syllabi get through with all the presentations I get
get into the first if there are specific questions are specific areas in
what eventually help you with talk about authorization for doing this
audit on it was requested by the general assembly and we looked at after
talking and looking at all law itself in talking with our fiscal
research staff we look at for areas on at and determined our objectives
for this audit we were looking at determine if you divisions
administrative functionsinternal and external complied with state and
federal requirements and if they allow for efficient use of funds the
second objective was to evaluate the divisions processes annual budget
and monitoring their expenditures to determine if they accurately
predicted and assess the program cost we also look at your process for
state plan amendments and then reassess the level budget and expenditure
information to stakeholders like the general assembly and like fiscal
research studied anatomy look at lot you'll see that you are used on the
findings of the together and and explanations and background information
for together for subsections one was our administrative functions one is
under budget and financial projections and you'll see that we laid out
that one pager of findings and pretty much the same format the third
area estate plan amendments and then reporting on the first area that we
look at courses administrative functions and under that first bullet
what you'll see is that here to other states with similar medical
assistance payments North Carolina Medicaid administrative costs are
significantly higher and in your pocket or is a table that shows we look
at North Carolina in comparison to nine other comparable states annual
zero North Carolina and all of that it was only an is nine there's only
one other state that extended for administrative costs and we did and
that was on Illinois and actually they extended him out for administer
probably 3 billion more dollars the state of Carolina but if you just
looked in the average at the very bottom of that table on the state
North Carolina spent hundred $80 million more than the average of
comparable states the reasons for these higher administrative costs DNA
really only controls about 33% of the total administrative costs while
the state stands 700+ million what you'll find is that DNA only spent
about 256 million there are 10 other divisions in Department of Health
and Human Services to actually stand administrative cost or or incur
administrative cost him three of the highest our security DSS on Central
Antman and Don mental-health with three extended the most of the cost
and said him again DNA really doesn't have control over all the
administrative cost and so they had at least a celery oversight DHHS
really didn't provide any oversight to the extending of administrative
cost additionally if you look at</p>

section DHHS does not have a car or public assistance cost allocation
plan began got several divisions on you are spending monies and charging
it back to the Medicaid plan Medicaid program you don't have a cost
allocation plan here indirect costs can be allocated on to all programs
and of course Medicaid get charged is forced if you don't have a
comprehensive cost allocation plan each division in the social services
mental-health on dna there allocation plan to allow the cost may be
allowable they may not necessarily be necessary and analog don't have
centralization of the cost allocation plan and the of the administrative
costs are being allocated that you don't have very much control over the
cost under the next accent on budget and financial projections on dnase
i heard budget have exceeded the certified project and actually incurred
state general fund shortfall all all all hundred 18 million in 2012
403,000,000-11 to 16,000,000 in 20 and again you can go back to him that
the agent that audiorecorded stealth page 36 napolitano seem to be off
will send identified a country state statute dma retained hundred $31
million in federal funds i in 20 well unless that this was related to a
drug rebate money on on was practice and dhhs for several years on
general assembly and actually passed a statute that prohibited dhhs or
dna from withholding or holding on drug rebate money out of here is that
they north carolina receives rebates on currently scone through the
medicaid program state north carolina just keep part of it mna on a
portion of the night at and it was found that on that in the near total
years state north carolina your help on this drug rebate money was a
matter just holding on asked and then being able to just over this year
in and get it back next year what happens is that if you are holding
this drug rebate money and white dna does what making us is that they
will deduct this from your next year's argument as cited in essence the
state north carolina started out in 2013 with the deficit and hundred
$31 million also directed to achieve the savings were not followed on
was a legislative mandate to eliminate lectionary increases and nursing
facilities on and it appears that really activists on evidence far audit
that increases to the nursing homes was loud and the explanation for
this was that there is a cost next within the nursing homes in has to do
with sound facilities are housing people that are sicker than in other
facilities i figure the cost next to allow this inflationary increase
that</p>

cost mix will be out of [??] and what our audit found is that there were
quarterly inflationary increases that happened that were allowed and
only one of the four actually had anything to do that would affect that
cost mix so the explanation that DMA gave to the general assembly as to
why they allow those inflationary increases was not exact and the next
bullet directives to achieve I'm sorry the next DMA focuses on forecasts
for medical payments financial projections do not include all relevant
expenses what we found is that under the medicate budget there are 14
different categories of medicate expenses and what we found is that DMA
was not really seriously projecting in fact they didn't really project
and forecast a budget for one out of the 14 five of them we found that
they didn't project a budget at all and when asked basically what their
response was is that we don't know what the budget is gonna be for that
particular category so the projected dollars were zero and that happened
in 5 out of the 14 categories DMA does not follow best practices to
improve its forecasting methodology there is a formula and there are
components in this formula that have to be used to make sure that
methodology or the forecast in the projections that are done make sense
and they're reasonable to be obtained and what we found is that they
really weren't using their best practices to achieve this in some areas
one of the components would be consumption obviously controlling the
consumption how much medicate do you administer and really for
consumption on of the best on of the places I guess that can be looked
at as how much fraud is occurring within its program and we have
presented to you in other audits or presented to the general assembly in
other audits about the programs and the methodologies that are being
used by DMA to find this fraud and how unsuccessful those have been to
date and then the other way to control consumption is whether or not you
allow additional services to happen the pricing is another area where
you can control the cost and again we just talked about the inflationary
increases that were allowed by the general assembly specifically said
there are not to be increases based on inflation is allowed to happen
but again we saw that DMA did that anyway and the other area that we
noted is that for even the projections that were done that there was no
actual tracking of actual to the forecast or actual to the projection to
decide or understand when there is a variance why was there a variance
and what could be done to prevent that variance in the future and then
the financial projections did not extend beyond the current [??] best
practices recommend that you should do multi year projections and what
goes into those projections again that is well thought out there's a
good methodology that you're using information that makes sense and
again what we found is that they really weren't DMA was not projecting
more that one year at the time realistically and anything after that it
was missing budgets altogether for some other categories and then others
they weren't using a realistic consumption numbers or pricing numbers
under the next grouping state plan amendments the general assembly
mandated or requested that DMA come up with some savings in 2012 and
what we found I think it was approximately 72 million dollars that they
requested and the way they were going to achieve these savings was
through plan amendments it would be amendments to the state's medicate
plan and what we found is that what DMA submitted and said here's how
we're gonna make up that 72 million was really not realistic a couple of
areas they said basically when we make changes to the state's medicate
plan.

<p id="20:00">

And what we've found is that they didn't really consider the time it
takes from submission of a change in the Medicaid plan to CMS, which is
the regional Medicaid office that would approve these changes. So they
didn't really take into account 90 days when you submit a change in your
Medicare plan, CMS has 90 days to approve that, and then if they have
any additional questions, it may take longer than that, so the savings
that they justified took into account unrealistic effective dates. It's
another table, and it's under attachment two, and the information that I
gave you, and it shows three examples of this. You'll look at the bottom
of the page, under attachment two, and it's talking about State Plan
Amendment 10-031. You see here that the submission date is October of
2010. It was planned to be implemented or the savings to occur, it had
to be implemented in January of 2011. You'll see here that CMS' approval
didn't even happen until April of 2011, so that implementation date is
really not realistic. The next item on that list, the submission date
was March of 2011. The budget implementation date was expected to be
January of 2011, and you'll see that the CMS approval didn't even happen
until January of 2012. So the savings that came about with the
implementation of these planned amendments, it was never even
achievable, based on the implementation.. these approval dates. And the
other side of that is, when you have a planned amendment, and you're
gonna retroactively implement the change, basically what DMA told us is
that that was just unrealistic. So why they submitted this.. it was
unrealistic, because what happens in a planned amendment that's
retroactively implemented, is that you have, say, you go to a doctor and
you have a service that's allowed by Medicaid, and you have this done in
January. And say, the retroactive date might be December of the prior
year. Well that means that you have to go back to that doctor whose
provided that service, who got paid for that service, and get the money
back from that doctor, even though in good faith, that service was
provided. And so DMA told us, we never had any intention of
retroactively applying these planned amendments is because what it would
mean is litigation, problems, and then you stop and think about how
practical is that, to go and ask a doctor who, in good faith, gave a
service to somebody on Medicaid, provided a service that was allowed
under Medicaid, and then go back and tell them they've got to reimburse
you after they've done that. So the point here under state planned
amendments, they're saying that the delays, the shortfalls and them not
making their savings is the CMS process, and how this all works, but an
audit shows the basically the information given to the general assembly
was not even realistically obtainable. And then the last item, under
reporting: DMA is not providing timely and useful reports and essential
date to stakeholders. What we've found in our audit is that the general
assembly, the legislators, fiscal research, needs information to make
decisions, and while there's a lot of data given to them, none of it is
in any kind of summarized or any kind of format that makes sense to be
able to be used by anybody who could make decisions. And we found that
to be true; there is a lot of data there, but again, none of it is
summarized, and it's very time-consuming for whoever's trying to use the
data to try to get it into some kind of format so they themselves can
use it to make decisions about it. And that's a quick overview of what
the findings were in this report. I'll call your attention to attachment
three. This is a listing of the administrative resources; this shows you
what DMA expends in administrative cost. It also shows you the other
divisions within DHHS as far as other divisions that are spending
administrative monies, and how much. And then on attachment four, the
last table that I have there shows you that over a four year period,
what the actual</p>

Speaker: ?? medicate program what the certified budget was and lot of
variances that you an see from 2009 2010 there is 60 percent spent over
the certified budget now obviously the money is in ?? one of the things
that you have remembered is federal and state money federal portion of
state north Carolina spent 14 billion a year  and medicate program about
ten billion of that 10 plus billion of that is federal money and 3 plus
billion is state money with in the state money federal money you have
administrative cost and then you have medical plans so portions of this
report just have administrative costs portions of this is just like the
budget the money is over feral ?? with the state portion ?? four years
is anywhere between 300 and 400 million short for overspending state
money that is medicate and administrative themselves ?? do you have any
question about clarification of any questions and orders Representative
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr. Chairman this would ?? by surprise it was
of the administrative difference cause between us and ??  sates ?? and
multiply by two when you cut them off how carefully i guess or how you
able to determine the compatibilities of the plan for instance ?? for
also  100 percent managed care ?? with the state north Carolina
administering the way we do our plans can you give some examples of the
plans you listed here of areas were there was more specificity and more
general more specific n areas what the differences were ??i will differ
that question to you how much work done ?? comparable managed care
versus non managed care for the other nine states that we compare north
Carolina to
Speaker Changes:we really don't have time to ?? make up the program ??
Speaker Changes: thanks further question Representative ??
Speaker Changes: thank you very much for the report i was just trying to
figure out the positive here
Speaker Changes: we are still looking i guess I'm still looking at the
attachments three  lie seven insuring program and integrity and i guess
when we have this program in large we have a common program to have of
complied standard auditors to in division whats in the insuring program
integrity is there a staff with in the division that's monitoring
complain with this rules and regulation or is that weakness withing the
division
Speaker Changes: the division this is probably a better question for
secretary but understand that the division have a program integrity
group some other issue that we are running through the other audit it
appears that trying to ?? provide fraud ?? makes sense is been
contracted out to a third party and there eave issue there with the
audit that we did difference in issue that we did and other audit ??
looking for fraud looking for improper payments ??</p>

2 million. Based upon investigations that were done, does it look as if
we had people, when they were doing the planned amendments, that were
just either functionally not understanding the process and understanding
that it took the 90 days to get the approval and that it wasn’t
practical to do the retroactive implantation, or was it just kind of an
arrogant defiance? How would you classify it, because it’s disturbing to
me that kind of directive is given, that we aren’t seeing that are
consistent with that directive.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s hard, one of the hardest things in our job is to
prove intent. And so all we can do is just show the facts and what I can
tell you is that the mandates were there and we have it documented in
our audit report that things like, I didn’t know what the budget
expenditure was gonna be so I just put a zero for that line item, or the
fact that there is a mandate and that same one for the 72 million, it
basically says if you can’t find that savings with, I think one of them
was CCNC, if you can’t find your $90 million with CCNC, was ?? savings
that was projected in the budget. And the statute basically says if you
can’t find it there, you need to look elsewhere. And again, all I can
tell you is that the mandates were there, and they were not done. And we
did document conversations about, well, this was not do-able. This was
an unreasonable mandate from the General Assembly, so all I can tell you
is that was the conversation and it didn’t happen, so I’ll have to leave
the rest up to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I understand. One follow up, additionally. You mention
that there was no multi-year budgeting. When that inquiry was made,
organizationally, as to why there was no multi-year budgeting or
planning for what costs might be beyond the current fiscal year, and I
would reasonably assume that as best management practices that the
federal government would want to see us do that, perhaps they don’t, but
was there… they do. Okay. So, if the federal government requires it,
what was the explanation for us not in fact having multi-year budgets in
place that anticipated costs with some degree of validity to those
projections and a better opportunity to benchmark what actuals were
versus those projected. What explanations did you receive, or your staff
receive?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Pretty much that if we exceed the budget, correct me
if I’m wrong, Glen, Hugh, Laura. But pretty much DMA’s response was if
we exceed the budget, OSBM’s gonna allocate, get the money to us anyway.
And so there wasn’t a sense of urgency to be as accurate as possible so
the General Assembly would understand what the true cost of running that
program would look like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And one last follow up, I think I said the other one
was the last, and I apologize, but did the federal government at any
point in time express concern about this, or send directives, or make
inquiries about why things were being handled the way they are?
Particularly as it relates to these budgets or other areas of concern?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. The federal government has contacted my office
with some concerns, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you at liberty to discuss what they are?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, let me thank you for a thorough report, we
appreciate the information you’ve shared with us. I, for one, am greatly
disturbed by the findings. I would like to think that things were
operating far more efficiently, professionally, with best management
practices, appropriate benchmarks, milestones, allocation of costs. It
seems to me just what you would implicitly do if you were managing an
organization professionally, whether you’re in the government sector or
the private sector, so, I think we have some significant task ahead of

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would agree.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And we would appreciate you sharing with us at an
appropriate time what recommendations you might have, and I don’t know

findings.

Defeated [??], and in this case, if you look at the programs
administrative cost which an auditor would found is indeed the case,
there are very low administrative costs, but actually the administrative
cost functions are in the manage care entities. And if you look at what
is termed the medical loss ratio which is what the manage care companies
are allowed to use as administration. If you look at that for Arizona
their administrative costs would actually be 13.74%. And we have a
saying in Medicaid if you look at one state you see one state. So
everything has its nuance, however I don't want you all to take away
that we're not looking at this issue. How we both at the Medicaid agency
monitor other sister agencies and work with them to ensure both that the
administrative costs are appropriate but that all costs are appropriate
in our memos of understanding. So we are engaging in a very aggressive
review of the relationships and the contracts and the MOU's with the
other agencies to make sure they are carefully reviewed and in
compliance with both what you all expect of us, what the taxpayers
expect  of us and what both the state and federal laws require of us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If there are any other questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will begin the process back through the list that we
kind of have to this point and I'll begin with Representative
Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. They say if you stay and listen
long enough your questions will be asked by someone else. And senator
McKissick did some of that. I wanted to find out, there was a mention
about a last audit by the state auditor. Has there been a comparative of
that last audit to this one, and are we seeing similar problems or not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not sure which, help me with - if you're talking
about the one I was talking about on the fraud tools that are being
used?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just an audit on the department of health and human
services in general. Has there been one and when was the last one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No. We go in and audit the financial statements and
all we're doing is apining [??] on those numbers, are they materially
stated. Then we go in and we audit the major programs that they have,
food stamps, Medicaid and are they administering the program in
accordance with federal requirements. The federal grant audit that we
did we had findings, had cash management drawing down money, not paying
it back like they're support to, it was in that audit also. So we're
finding similar findings but now the performance audit and the audit for
the federal grants are in compliance with federal requirements are two
entirely different thing. We had just a few like the cash management one
that overlapped between the two.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That answers my question. And I appreciate the
thorough report that the auditor has given and it was very easy to
follow and that is commendable on such a complex issue. The other thing
I wanted to ask, are there states that have best practices as it relates
to our concerns and what are those states and are we going to
communicate with them and see what can be done to enhance our state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, yes, we are actually working with
getting information from other states on their best practices. And
presently we are as our number one goal inside of the department of HHS
is in reference to overhauling Medicaid and reforming Medicaid, and one
of the things that we are in the process of is a request for information
to the greater community of North Carolina in reference to working with
them on their ideas. And we actually are in the middle of this project,
we just have a few more days into the general community for the first
phase for the request for information for the proposals. And - was there
follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am a big believer in stealing good ideas from
whomever has them. So and we work with our national association both of
medicaid directors and there's also a national association of program
integrity directors, and I've instructed our program integrity director
to be part of that, to be very involved. The sharing of ideas is
something that's so critically important in a complex program like
medicaid and we do that and will continue to do that and seek out both
not only from the Medicaid world nationwide but from the private sector
also ideas that we can bring...</p>

Speaker: And we use to help and oversee the oversee the program ,
Speaker Changes: the members of the committee are still sitting one
member for question and i thin i will suspend taking questions on
additional information ?? as we go the next one we got on our list
please be mind of or our questions is well senator Robert,
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr.Chair thank you madame auditor madam
secretary for coming back and analyze for what people by serving and
adding n this administrative cost i think we ?? by a system north
Carolina past in terms of pulling n that data who duplicating shoes
serving for administrative services for doing it a lot of those issues
heard down to systems that hat ab;e to monitor but my question is you
mention cause allocation secretary i mean madam auditor,
Speaker Changes: ??,
Speaker Changes: your mention cause allocation with D S S is that policy
issue or department issue if that there is no cause allocation formula,
Speaker Changes: the federal governor requires that there be a cost
allocation plan  so each one of us have division  D S S one divisions ??
but each one of them have sort of coming out from their own cost
allocation plan and administering it so you may not have consistency on
how you may be Secretary ?? if allocated ?? system allocation and the
other thing is may that ?? is that really necessary so if you got
several divisions administering you own cost allocation plan ?? central
over side and consistency and how that has been done,
Speaker Changes: thank you senator ??,
Speaker Changes: my question is sort of an answer thank you,
Speaker Changes: thank you Representative ??,
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr.Chairman don't have a statement  make but
i have if you do wanna introduce to ?? and say and i look forward to ??
both of you i just have asking questions that can be answered relatively
one of the take part in how the department of ?? with the
recommendations that have been made it's specifically I'm asking about
the confrontation cost allocation of the other ??,
Speaker Changes: we are working as specifically as we can ?? to the ??
some of the issue have been actually resolved this month because we are
getting now policies and going forward in new organizations and ?? it's
happening between this month and next month but the last pair would be
very last sense of end date of this
Speaker Changes: 230th of this year have already implemented better
contract procedures monitoring on what we spending every single check
right so lot of the issue were addressing immediately the coordinates
between offices and ate management budget and the department budget's
doing the cost allocation plans that will have some coordination and
work but we will have everything completed  June 30th of this year,
Speaker Changes: follow up question,
Speaker Changes: follow up,
Speaker Changes: i don't know where the question is directed to i don't
know ho many vacancies you have in ?? and why i had like to know why
what is happening to this issue for this issues for ?? how many
vacancies,
Speaker Changes: well i never set for ?? Representative last year we
have 200 vacancies  beside of HHS beside of ?? i have that information
on this desk but i have ?? it to you today we are in the mid stuff
feeling critical positions we are looking at organizational structure
though in order to insure efficiency and effectiveness so we are not
rushing out to ?? vacant positions but we are looking strategically on
where resources are necessary like programs had integrity some other
things we know ,</p>

Speaker: Not been very responsive too but i have the information amd can
provided to,
Speaker Changes: well i,
Speaker Changes: follow up thank you thank you Mr.Chairman i know this
several weeks ago there wwas 40 because i admit with the division
director Watson and Austin what i didn't ask him is that why was the
vacancies are there ?? very concerned about expertise and the lack of
position filled and so i assumed some reason we can follow up that later
the other thing which is also questioned ?? from mere experience working
in medicate if you directed to save 72 million dollars in one year
through measures you have to have us state plan amendments knowing that
how could you do that in one yeast give the fact that yo cant get the
$72 million dollars in year because you cant get the state amendments to
in order to have $72 million dollar you should have state plan
amendments or the service which you were actually would set you out of
state plan amendments would cut more than $72 million can you how you
would ??
Speaker Changes: i would rather not criticize ?? because i wasn't in
their shows that time but i will tell you in the secretaries crystal
clear instructions or to be all us of us that is to be transparent
common sense speaker shown we talk about the program when we start this
process of developing the budget ?? governor says expectation on us in
secretaries we investigate both clearly ?? what we use to come up with
the estimates what are functions are and what the process is we are
achieving those goals so that nobody is surprised and that everybody
understand both the feral rules and the state rule for anything i would
do and again wild not criticize for say ?? that is very very important
because medicate is one of the rare agencies what we cannot do or
anything on our own it has to do through federal agency so that
communication open this between your staff and us ?? and i cannot
emphasize on who how much the secretary emphasize that
Speaker Changes:so i would just like to make a very brief comment and i
thank you all i think this is very valuable process and I'm very pleased
that can we correct most of the ?? recommendations or have completely in
place by June 30tth its' really important to indicate all are we moving
fast i do think that we do have a full discussion during the budget
process last year during the secretary process explain this issue of the
delay in the state plan amendments and how if you don't get your state
plan amendment approved by January 1 after the year is already gone and
you ant save you can save had of 72 million but you are saving from
January to June but you are bit saving from July 1 through December 31st
and if you ?? couldn't have all the $72 million dollars next year you
gonna be saving $102 million so that issue was explained to the
committee last year and i think that's why they tried to put a plan of
about retro active collections it was not either really professional or
realistic i appreciate the time and look forward to
Speaker Changes: thank you Representative ??
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr.Chairman my question is going to be
directed ought it would with the measure that were taken to monitor
would were we doing and recognize identify savings we have the IT side
of it with the feature ??  we also have the ?? report that was all
evaluations of money that saving through using C C N C i have a question
in terms of you think to indicate that wasn't</p>

A sufficient in terms of freely given us the numbers that we needed and

of the Enron debacle and MCI and what I'm hearing here you can call it
whatever you want to get it is a gross breach of fiduciary obligation to
the foster children to the elderly to the taxpayers of North Carolina
and I'm so glad it had an auditor you had the the courage to come
forward and take this on and that you two are not running screaming from
the building on my question is this you mention I'm so glad you did the
private sector the private sector has taken some tough months lately
because of behaviors like this people have gone to jail in the private
sector probably less than the S.you mentioned that what kinds of private
sector ideas are you you say stealing a recycling what kind of private
sector ideas such as whistleblowing heard from folks in the DMV
organization you're such a culture of the that they are afraid to come
forward for fear of losing their jobs whistleblowing on the
accountability I already tell this time from the top which we preach and
preach and preach in the business school the time for the top as they
are decidedly buy-in is not the implemented patient from the bottom up
from the top to the bottom I like here just a comment or two about how
you'll be looking at some of these issues since an earlier Thursday that
Medicaid I think the contracts relative but they private sector on
Medicaid I tireless present receiving antenna and working with some of
that, with many members and our extended community Comment we can best
find comments on NEPA information proposals we received will is
information not just on how your mind benefits and also how at the
financial responsibility that we have so little that we get some
proposals and in the area program integrity yet we have to do is we have
to get better and were so glad to have Jeff Cooper on what exactly I
want to get better at finding the anomalies only make the payment and
out lately 90% of the good providers are doing the right thing and doing
everything properly are not in their child's harass fire forgetting the
10% that are trying to take management program silver working with young

had bill in a state agency not just the program integrity component
things in the sense of how you build from the top to the bottom a a
mentality that we have a God-given right and responsibility to make sure
mortality when something is not right we follow my suggestions I would
like you to think about is on number seven this is called insuring
program integrity well in the private sector is called in total on his
like these folks via and I think that we get down to brass tacks I can
tell you have and I think it's those kinds of initiatives also I don't
see it as I do believe it's a God-given responsibility but I think it's
a legal responsibility and ethical responsibility just like it is in the
private sector even more so because we are entrusted with money the
people that necessarily choose to give us that thank you Sen. Connie
responds and viewpoints you made one of the many things that is urgently
being done in restructuring actually our internal audit in reference to

defensive posture in this matter for the department and making sure that
we as the taxpayers of the state and the General Assembly get this
