  Thank you, members of the committee, members of the public. I&#39;ll
begin this morning by recognizing our pages. First, we have in the
Senate Deshonda Brown. Are you here? Okay, in the back, sorry. Senator
Robinson, and Sierra Cox from Gaston with the speaker coming in. Our
Sergeant-at Arms today from the House, we have Young Bay, Bill Morris,
Jim Moran; and from the Senate, Marcus Kitz and Dale Huff. If we have
any other comments from members or the chair, the Chairman or others
today? Seeing none of those, we&#39;re going to begin today with a
presentation from the Pew-MacArthur Foundation. We have Gary
VanLandingham and Josh Waters presenting here today. They have some
investment information and other things that we&#39;re looking for in
operations, and we look forward to their presentation. The floor is
yours. You generally have to push and hold on the mike when the green
light&#39;s on.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, members of the Committee. I&#39;m
Gary VanLandingham, I&#39;m director of the Pew-MacArthur Results First
Initiative, and with me here is Josh Waters and Tom Conroy, who heads up
our fiscal and economic policy portfolio at Pew. We&#39;re very happy to
be here to talk about the Results First Initiative. And Results First is
a partnership between the Pew Charitable Trust and the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which are two organizations that are
passionately involved in helping government make better choices by using
data. And the good-news situation I think is out there is that
there&#39;s a lot of information currently available on what works. Tens
of thousands of evaluations have been done across the country looking at
a large number of programs. And collectively, as a country, we know a
lot now about what works and what doesn&#39;t. The challenge has been
how do we bring that information into the process so it can help inform
the tough choices that you have to make. Because as you know, policy
making happens in real time, and when you ask your staff, &quot;tell me
what works in criminal justice,&quot; or &quot;tell me what works in
child welfare, because we really want to make good decisions,&quot; you
don&#39;t want to hear back from them, &quot;Great question, Senator,
give me about a year-and-a-half and I&#39;ll read through 30,000 journal
articles across 15 different periodicals and look through all the
literature and tell you, sort of collectively, what we know about what
works,&quot; because nobody has time to do that. The good news
information is that there is that information out there, and what
we&#39;ve been doing with Results First is making that information
accessible and, we hope, useful to legislators to help inform the tough
choices that are before you. And what we&#39;d like to do this morning
is to talk for about 20 minutes about what Results First is, how it
operates, and then how some of the other states have been using this
over the last few years to help inform the tough choices that you&#39;re
facing. In the policy challenge these are things which you&#39;ll
recognize very well. Everybody wants to make strategic choices,
recognizing that there&#39;s limited resources the taxpayers have given
you, and the issue is how do we invest that money to achieve the best
results for policy makers. And unfortunately the way that the budget
process works in almost all states, it doesn&#39;t give that
information. What it tells you is here&#39;s how much money you spent on
programs last year. And then what that does is it focuses the debate on
what do we do to balance the allocation this year to the needs that we
see out here. And unfortunately, the budget process doesn&#39;t give you
information that&#39;s really critically important if you&#39;re trying
to make strategic choices, because the budget documents don&#39;t tell
really important things, like what programs are out there? What are we
really funding? What is in the base? That information typically
isn&#39;t there. I was legislative staff in Florida for many years
before I joined Pew. I can guaranty you that Florida does not have a
comprehensive list of everything that it funds. The legislature does not
have that, the governor&#39;s office does not have that. Most agencies
don&#39;t have a comprehensive list of the things that they administer,
because these programs have been established for years. Oftentimes,
choices on what programs are being operated are decentralized, and at
agency it&#39;s being run by the field offices, or it&#39;s being--we
have a contract with a provider. What that means is that we don&#39;t
really have a good idea of what programs are operating out there, and we
don&#39;t know how well those programs are doing. The budget process
typically doesn&#39;t have information on how much we&#39;re spending on
each program and what those programs are accomplishing for us. Now, most
states have some performance measurement systems, but typically those
systems aggregate information

But such a high level but it doesn&#39;t really help you tell what are
we exactly accomplishing in each individual program and can we compare
programs to say which ones
of these really are working best for us and as we&#39;re doing results
vs. bringing all finding ways to bring an information into the process
to give you really can&#39;t
beat the private sector investment analysis perspective of what our
investment choices what happens we put money into those different
investment choices in our their
best buys out there are things which based on North Carolina to meet
population characteristics of programs that are out there that the
people that you&#39;re trying to
serve and we know about the program&#39;s what really represent the best
ways to invest money to get the outcomes of the one with G4 missing
symptoms. All.(SPEAKER CHANGES) Our solution
is to bring the seventh in the process to make it user friendly this is
being called the money ball approach to government all money ball would
be few river back a
few years ago was a movie auditors also been a book that was based on
the experience of the Oakland A&#39;s all baseball team which
unfortunately has won 25% of the
money to fuel the winning team and a big market seems like the Yankees
help but they&#39;re the same goal of how to weave using the resources
we have, we build 18 to
allow this to achieve our goals, FOB warning that the maximum number of
games and, ideally winning the championship with 1000 by using data that
was healthier in
more creative ways and other teams they were able to field a very
competitive team with 25% of resources that other teams have and it was
worked out very well so
this is really the money ball approach to government how can we use data
that&#39;s out there to help fueled the best team the best programs the
weekend when she the
outcomes of the one which you four cities what to do a sister walk you
through record of 30,000 foot level what this looks like our approach
really is fairly basic
it starts off with one side and if I was in the base what programs are
out here and what we know about the effectiveness of these programs and
that it will lead a
former minotaur read this is a type of information that we wish we are
able to retrieve all and basically this is simply a list of programs and
the budget that is
out there for each of those programs and this is useful information but
it doesn&#39;t really tell us how well these programs are offered ample
we do next is compare
this information to what the research shows about the effect was is
information of all these inventions and there are a number of
organizations out there that are
systematically going through all the research we have on programs in
identifying how effective they are in use our national research
clearinghouses and there&#39;s a
large number of exploring houses what they all do about the same thing a
big goal for the research in the classified programs five COL Woodworth
the evidence is and
what they show about the facts in this news programs and what we&#39;ve
done with results first as the first of a barn owl system would do with
your staff is to really
compare what programs are being operated to(SPEAKER CHANGES) what that
the national research shows about the fact is these programs and Liu C
is that these research scoring all those
have some would differ nomenclature to make this pretty easy to
understand what we&#39;ve done is with color benefit all the best are
rated clerk password programs about a
defined by the 30 houses are green that shows that there&#39;s a lot of
evidence of these programs are likely to be successful if implemented
appropriately other programs
have some research behind them but could there be a little bit more
risky investments these are yellow programs is a promising programs
begun some research behind and it shows that this is probably a good use
of investment choice but not quite as his regrets investment
opportunities as programs it is a lot of evidence that they work out for
slider some programs out there which states are operating at the
research shows don&#39;t work of that sells a good idea of what when you
reduce the test these things they don&#39;t really achieve the outcomes
which we thought that the fugitive and to reinforce with some programs
alter
the state&#39;s monopoly next legal research shows make things worse of
that actually creates negative consequences for people want to go
through them and I believe that
is not what in East Asia be doing so what we&#39;re doing first working
with the staff used to identify what programs they would operate and was
no about the effectivenes
s of programs nobody is saying what would have really lost do first is
to give you some of the core branded consumer reports assessment of how
risky use the investment
in North Carolina in these programs would typically finding is that
usually about 1/4 money that the state is operating and independent
policy area is being spent on
programs that there&#39;s a lot of evidence that these are the likely to
be a factor of about 10% is often spent on programs that are promising
an hour for slider someone
is being spent on programs that the research shows are defective debate
that may have a couple stories behind them but when tested they simply
aren&#39;t achieving........

Research shows that kids to go for this program have better educational
outcomes are more likely to stay in school them or what to do graduate
and kids a budget from
Playskool we know, better outcomes in light of day or more money you
become taxpayers as a tax consumers so on average kid to go through this
program, 19500 dollar
benefit for the state compared with kids too. (SPEAKER CHANGES)Once the
other alternative program healthcare cost and ago down for a couple
reasons that the key to go through this are
less likely to commit crime the most likely going to get into fights in
the show opened ers&#39; in half to beat, Medicaid and expenditures for
them and also these kids
are more likely to become employed a drug culture rents and therefore IP
disc also on average about $400 in benefits come about white to the
eldest of the benefits
all promote long-term incumbents about $37,000 in benefits for the
investment of $3300 or about 0:49 return on investment four for watching
state so not a bad way out
the best in mighty good outcomes and were able to predict 10 this looks
like it works were able to resolve first is to really look of qualls
portfolios it&#39;s good to
know about the program works it&#39;s more prone to know how it works
compared to other programs and that this is again watching stayed in
output looking across programs.
For the child welfare and an internal justice is a subset of programs of
this assessment kick and it can look at ways to use that there really
typically isn&#39;t a big
relationship between what program costs and whisper projected to which
she four a state some programs are pretty cheap and it produced good
outcomes some progress a
more expensive to produce OK outcomes but on a dollar for dollar basis
going through some of the discipline investment approach of analyzing
programs for it looks
really help states identify what looks like the best dollar for dollar
investment and we see that some programs can produce very strong outcome
soul All Star (SPEAKER CHANGES)
programs also $100 foot through them and watching state about $2000 into
an outcome for 123 dollar for term investment for rebel wrist and put
into this all it did
in comparison parents as teachers and other programs serving children
all basically by 1 to 1 record, not a bad outcome of boat is simply not
predicted as much for
corona basketball the program is putting money into a different program
at four for the programs out there which is as I mentioned, don&#39;t
work, scared straight to use
a relatively cheap program called cost about $66.00 and watching status
on digital thunder prison for bank of unfortunately does research shows
the highly effective
program if you&#39;re trying to increase crime all be because rather
than its caring escape and stay on the straight and narrow sending a
child to prison for they
basically demystify as prison for the many still here just don&#39;t you
would like to keep regard to what I did a blend of care they hear things
like what you really
wanna make money at the thought of doing tax instead, soaking again came
to go through this outcome to actively harmed by the program and
that&#39;s not what states want
to be doing so what is really allows states to do is to look across
different investment choices in identifying one return on investment
would you get by putting
money into these programs and really being able to compare about based
on what would be able to get from these programs and visual powerful way
of using this
information into the process and ideally finding ways of targeting might
force programs that work better about spending more money to solve
social programs to
spending the money to scan the system Alps worse things as simply worked
better than most it&#39;s been doing in the past when a kid Alistair was
over to Josh Waterston
to talk about publicity but has been used by some other states to to
help inform the budget foursomes from pigs.(SPEAKER CHANGES) Again and

Ensues this pity with employment forms the core of the model and if you
think about it makes sense because one of the social policies that
states implement also
lead impacts the criminal justice system mental health policies if those
people are assisted a missile with nickel all five issues all will
eventually wind up
producing one of the criminal justice system similar to build justice
policies from some really it&#39;s been close the core of the approach
bomb that is in a cell in
Unicef to run the analyses on the criminal justice system by the water
the DO needs to be populated and the bulk and we&#39;ll just a small in
order to realize the
benefits from other (SPEAKER CHANGES) policy areas bob after Doug
okamoto&#39;s to some point we ought to suggest the states with actual
justice child welfare league are other bigger
other core components of a model that really affect the benefits of from
the other components and finally also a missile also since you spent a
full education from
some states are working with oracle mining malls will call series of the
same time I&#39;m also working with the state of Colorado see this
tender doing adult criminal
justice juvenile justice and child welfare simultaneously all existed to
really get the core keys a model bills as quickly as possible say could
work on the other
areas as well so the role of our partner states would bar with the state
we ask banks, the gates are bob or actually requires us to get letters
of commitments from
both from one side of your set from thing authors as well as the
governor and is the cause the services that we provide state are free of
charge we provide a model
we provides technical assistance to provide the other fools no to the
foresee partners, and so for Hr Investments in helping the states are
working with the state&#39;s
we aspects BBS have one is a commitment from the leaders of all that
state doesn&#39;t mean that the results have to be used in this means
that they&#39;re committed to
looking at the results in taking this into consideration and the
policymaking process, additionally we ask that a policy work group B
appointing N. Tom in some states
and six legislators in some states legislators and zombies any branch
officials other states of executive branch officials depending on ball
where the mall and work
as housing estates and that really is to direct the work of the staff
workers, (SPEAKER CHANGES) Selig said the priorities of what programs
look at what all serious a look at and
really depends at the time line for moving forward from third as the
distaff or group be established with a person who really takes
responsibility for providing work
forward as a staff from product manager, Tim this week, soulful and
working with other states Tom in order to both communicates between B OM
the pols were probing
the staff or group and a mix of work things on an assembly
session,(SPEAKER CHANGES) and finally as the state&#39;s collaborate
with five&#39;s to strengthen the model and Siebel the warning
committee of states, we work with our see partners of final whites Beyer
policies are and we say those backs the mall developers to work with
filling out those
particular areas of the model, one of the reason we heard about from
foresee partners is the political arena and so we&#39;re now working
with the losses in suits to
build out those areas of the model and sell these are the services that
we provide, we provide software retraining news staff repro to provide
ongoing technical
assistance and using this pope interpret the results and really comply
with sheer lessons learned between states com and also extended up to
the model of good model
is is is populated and is some cause populate the states and the boss is
the data and Tom we were the states to build out and really make a
specific states centric
model and so without I will preclude my presentation and about two
questions representatives to thank you Mr. Chairman and I&#39;ve been an
active in politics one and
a ticket really paranoid from cell on the entire thread to and no one
can skins about his word of mouth and a ball approached and I&#39;m
I&#39;m happy it&#39;s very promising
but I know we have programs that work here mean we are the hallmark of
an securing france&#39;s Campbell is ours spring training is ours and
our programs were built

  It uses that model. It&#39;s a model like system of care is a similar
model where you look for the students strengths. You identify people you
require them to go home every weekend. So you don&#39;t just treat them
or punish them you build a community where they can exist. So I guess
my, sounds to me like what you are providing is a package where you have
program that have names like functional family whatever and so is that
the same program that we have or is it a different program and would you
bring in your programs and we buy your programs and replace ours with
what you have. Or do you look at the programs we have and you say your
model here is very close to what we have we&#39;d like to tinker with it
a little bit so that&#39;s the kind of question I had.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, great question representative. Couple of answers to it one
is we&#39;re not here to sell anything. What we&#39;re trying to do is
to provide you with the best information that is nationally available
about the effectiveness of the  programs. ?? is in the model because
that program has been researched. What we use with the research that is
in the model is really the best information that&#39;s available. And
every state also has program which have been developed have been studied
here. If they&#39;re not in the model then you can add those programs to
the model when North Carolina specific evaluations. So if UNC or Duke or
other universities have done evaluations of them and your confident that
those evaluations are well done you can add them to the model. Our goal
here isn&#39;t to force you to do anything. It&#39;s to give you tools
that become North Carolina&#39;s tools. They&#39;re your data,
they&#39;re your tools and the choices of what will be done with them
will be yours. What we&#39;re seeing is that all states have information
that&#39;s never been evaluated. I mean it&#39;s never been nationally
reported. Everybody does evaluations unfortunately because a lot of
evaluations are never published that data is never being able to be
shared. So as we&#39;re working with states we&#39;re seeing hey North
Carolina has got some great programs we can add to the model, New
Mexico&#39;s got some great programs we can add to the model and then to
build that that national sort of conversation and ability to share
information from each other and help all states make the best choices.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One of the things I&#39;ve talked to staff about before that is a
frustration I think is that you can have a lot of research on a model
and you can bring the model in but you don&#39;t fund all of the
components and then you pretend that you have a evidence based model and
you wonder and I think lots of times you look ahead and we don&#39;t
evaluate whether we&#39;re getting the results we want. So I guess maybe
that&#39;s a comment how do you deal with that I mean sometimes the it
makes the program we need to save money so we think we can cut out this
part of the program and not lose anything. So is it, is that part of
your program to promote a fidelity to the model?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s a very powerful issue. State run into trouble in a couple of
areas. One is that investing money in programs the research shows are
not effective. The other is exactly what your talked about investing in
a good program but not doing it with fidelity. And therefore doing a
good program badly doesn&#39;t get you where you want to be. We did a
report last year which really lays out a comprehensive set of things
states should be paying attention to in doing programs. And you know
it&#39;s not just picking good programs it&#39;s making sure that
they&#39;re being implemented well tracking outcomes to make sure your
getting what you pay for using the evaluation of resources to look at
programs that look promising but really need to be proven here in North
Carolina. And really coming up with a comprehensive holistic way of
looking at this. But yes that is a big issue programs needs to be
operated with fidelity. There&#39;s recent research now which shows some
of these areas what are the key things you have to do to get the
outcomes you want to achieve. How much can you tweak the program before
it&#39;s no longer that program. And unfortunately your totally right
states when money is tight tend to cut monitoring and things like that.
What that means is that after while you lose confidence that agencies
will be able to deliver what your giving them money to then to deliver.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have one more question but I

  Do you recommend that if we take a program that is proven and have the
data that the studies have been done, that we continue to do our own
evaluation of it? To collect data and analyze that? Or is it more
important to analyze whether or not we&#39;re being honest, true to the
model, or both?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Representative, that&#39;s a choice for the state to make.
I think the question is what&#39;s known about the program, does the
state have confidence it&#39;s being done with fidelity? If you have
questions about it than you can direct the legislative evaluation
division to go out and do an evaluation because it really is building
the discipline into the system that, &quot;This is what we&#39;re
buying, we have confidence that the agencies will deliver it well, we
have an outcome monitoring system that tells us are we getting where we
should be going, and if not, what mid-course corrections can we
take?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Gentlemen, again, thank you for being here. I love
the operative word you use, free. We get charged a great deal at this
state for using consultants. This question may be for staff, has the
department ever submitted to you, Ms. Jacobs, the list of programs that
we&#39;re funding now, on a spreadsheet, and what the expense is on each
one of them so that we could take that information and convey it to the
PEW Center and they could evaluate what programs we had prior to them
coming back with some recommendations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, members of the committee, we do not currently have a
comprehensive list of every program in Health and Human Services, the
department may have one. We have requested, for this session, a list of
programs focused on the ages zero to five that we&#39;re talking about
this session. They do have a database that they have online that&#39;s
called Open Windows where they have information on various programs. I
am not sure if that is up to date, I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s
someone here from the department can talk about their Open Windows
database and what it consists of. I will tell you that for a lot of
programs it does not have outcome information, that&#39;s they key
component that we&#39;re missing. It has some budget information but it
does not necessarily have the outcome information that the committee
needs to make decisions. But I would say that Open Windows may be the
most reliable source that I&#39;m aware of that the department
maintains, but as far as a comprehensive list of programs funded by
every source that&#39;s within the Department of Health and Human
Services, I&#39;m not aware of one other than that database.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, one follow-up, Mr. Chair. Mr. [??], you&#39;re sitting back there,
you had done an evaluation at HHS, were you able to find an inventory of
all the programs that we fund? Meaning I&#39;m just asking do we know
where our money&#39;s going and whether we&#39;re effective or we just
continue to keep looking at a number that we spent the last budget cycle
and we just add on to it and it must be a good program and go forward.
Were you able to find out any real outcome, evidence based evaluation
from what your group&#39;s work did?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Senator Tucker, we do not have a comprehensive inventory.
Now, we&#39;ve gone in selectively at HHS, a few years ago we looked at
grant programs and the non-profits that administered that received those
grant funds and we found the overwhelming majority of those non-profits
did not have outcome measures in HHS at the time. The previous
administration was not requiring those outcomes. Now they have been
working hard on contracts with their grantees, but that&#39;s a
selective inquiry, it&#39;s not the comprehensive inventory that
you&#39;re talking about. As you know, PED is sent in on a project by
project basis and we haven&#39;t done anything like that, no sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Final follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Landingham, is this scenario that&#39;s just been spoken to about
the list of inventory, and I certainly don&#39;t know all the programs
in HHS, and we go through the budget process, is this fairly common when
you come into a state? I think I heard you imply that, is that fairly
common that a lot of states don&#39;t know where they&#39;re spending
their money when it comes to a lot of programs, but primarily what
we&#39;re talking about today in HHS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Senator, that is exactly the

  <p id="40:00">
  the situation we find in every state that we work in. Typically it takes
several months to work with staff and their working with the agencies to
come up with that list. That really, I think, points to that the
challenge that all states face in making strategic budget choices is
that if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s currently being funded it&#39;s
very difficult to say, &quot;Well, we should cut this,&quot; because
there&#39;s no information to really target cuts so legislators do what
they can do, which is cut things across the board. Which, unfortunately
then, hinders the best programs while preserving those that have failed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question, when you&#39;ve gone in to
these various states, what collaborate group generates the most success?
Is it a department similar to HHS says we need issues taken care of? Is
it when it&#39;s a legislative invitation? Is it when you&#39;ve got the
governor behind it? What is the most productive scenario of support that
once we get this information we can turn it into actionable, productive
outcomes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman. So it really does depend on the state where the work is
housed. In our most successful states, the work is either housed in the
legislative budget or policy analysis shop or the governor&#39;s office
budget or policy analysis shop. Really, the policy group that directs
the work is very important and for that to be successful you need strong
leadership on the group itself and that usually comes from legislators
or from executive branch officials. As for the staff work group, the
most successful states, the work has been housed in the legislative
budget shop or the governor&#39;s budget shop. So, really the staffing
work group is a key component in that as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I have a couple of questions and I guess this is for Mr.
VanLandingham, in terms of the way you conduct your analysis, you
initially start out by saying you look to what&#39;s been successfully
done in other states, but I&quot;m trying to understand how that would
function within the context of knowing that different states have
different programs. How do you get the apples to apples comparison, but
more importantly how do you account for important variables such as
management and staffing? Because you can have very similar programs but
if they&#39;re ineffectively managed or organizationally they&#39;re not
structured right, or the resource is not provided, they may appear to be
quite dissimilar or function in different ways. So in terms of getting
that initial comparative analysis, how do you go about doing it to get a
true apples to apples comparison and then customize all of that
knowledge to look at what we&#39;re doing here in North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Senator, the way that the process works is we&#39;ll work
with your staff first to do the inventory, what programs are there, and
then the question is what&#39;s known about programs like that? So if
it&#39;s functional family therapy but with a North Carolina bent, well
how much of a diversion does that look like it is and what&#39;s the
research show about the impact of those, that those tweaks to a program?
Then the next level of analysis would be working with your staff to make
a call on how much confidence does the state have on the management of
this program? And that&#39;s important for a couple of things, one is
that by using the model, it tells you where a program should be able to
be in terms of the outcomes that it delivers. Washington state ran in to
this problem exactly like this, the legislature had been investing in
functional family therapy and wanted to know, &quot;Are we getting what
we&#39;re paying for? Your model says that it&#39;s a 22% reduction in
recidivism, tell us if we&#39;re getting that.&quot; So they task their
evaluators to go out and look at functional therapy to see if
they&#39;re getting that 22% reduction in recidivism. If, after doing
that study, they came back and they said, &quot;Well, the good news,
members, is in about half the state we&#39;re getting 22%, just like the
best research predicted. The bad news is in the other half of the state
you&#39;re not getting anywhere near that, and in some cases the
providers are making things worse because they&#39;re not doing this
program. They have not hired good staff, they&#39;re not managing them,
they&#39;re doing their own thing and what they&#39;re doing doesn&#39;t
work.&quot;

  <p id="45:00">
  and are you happy with the way that that&#39;s working or do you want to
put some more provisions in place and put some pressure on management to
do the program? I think the strength of this approach is it allows you
to tell, &quot;Here&#39;s what our program should be able to accomplish
based on what&#39;s known about programs like this,&quot; and then you
can customize that by how much confidence you have in management and use
outcome data that may be collected by the state and evaluations that may
be collected by the state to come up with your own assessments of where
we may be. For some of these programs you may say, &quot;Well, based on
this program, if done well, we should be able to solve half of the
problems this client group has, unfortunately our best data shows were
only half of the way there, so what do we need to do to improve our game
so that we&#39;re able to serve these people more effectively and get
the outcomes that we&#39;re able to predict?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Chair. Let me ask this, assuming you sit with staff, you
come up with that list of programs, based upon what you know about today
about North Carolina, what kind of time frame would you be looking at
for being able to conduct your analysis, to come back and provide
meaningful, insightful data based upon what is effective, what&#39;s
ineffective, and what can be done better? What kind of timeframe are we
looking at. I guess it depends upon the umber of programs that your
inventory covers and what the scope is, but do you have any thoughts
about that at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Senator, what we&#39;re finding is that in the states that
we&#39;re working with, they can get the initial components of the model
done in an interim period. Now, obviously they can&#39;t do everything
the model does. The model covers eight different policy areas now, so
states need to pick and choose what you want to get done the first year.
Typically the program inventory, assuming that you get strong executive
branch buy in, which is why the letter from the governor is so
important, that typically takes a couple of months to go through that
process and then getting data on North Carolina so were able to make
North Carolina specific predictions, that, again, will take a couple of
months. So, typically it&#39;s taken around six to seven months for
states to get the initial cut of the model operational in the first
couple of policy areas and then expanding into new policy areas over
time. But our goal really is that this becomes a resource that&#39;s
useful to legislature that becomes part of the process and that takes
time. Typically, states have some of the data that you want to have, you
use proxies for the rest of it, and next interim you clean that up a
little bit. Washington State has been doing this for 15 years and
they&#39;re continually tweaking this model to provide more information,
deeper information, and hopefully more useful information to the process
each year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Last follow-up. As I recall, PEW Charitable Trusts worked with us years
ago when we were looking at the justice reinvestment act and providing
some assistance to our sentencing commission and to help us construct
what looked like would be a good way of moving forward with that
initiative, and of course data has been forthcoming, it&#39;s coming
back in to us but the way you work with us on that project, of course it
would be different from this one but in what ways would it be similar,
in what ways would it be dissimilar. Because I&#39;m familiar with what
you did on that occasion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Senator, what the Public Safety Performance Project does,
which is a judicial reinvestment initiative that you mentioned, is that
they work with stakeholders in a state to reach a consensus on
what&#39;s driving the criminal justice populous, population growth,
what are options for dealing with that, and then helping build a
consensus within the state to pass a law that would implement those
choices. Then, after that passes, they move on to work with other
states. But it&#39;s more of a policy focus. Results First really is
much more of a focus on individual programs, how is the state spending
money, is there better investment choices the state could be making to
predict it to get better outcomes? So it&#39;s not based on that policy
focus but also then we typically work with states for many years once we
start because this work expands. Because it&#39;s more programmatic
focus, the politics are different. There are some winners and losers
occasionally. If you find that a program that the state&#39;s been
investing in isn&#39;t working then you have to deal with that but it
tends to be more, probably, staff-oriented at the beginning because your
staff will be working to collect this data and to bring it into the
process and then you choose what to do with it during the budget
deliberations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. We look forward

  states for multiple years in doing this and we&#39;ve been working with
some of these states for four years, so we have not walked away from any
state. We view this as a long-term partnership because you&#39;re
totally right, there&#39;s more analysis that can be done, there&#39;s
more programs, there&#39;s more data that can be done but our
partnership with the state would be long standing to really build this
as deeply as it can be done in the state, to answer the questions that
you want your staff to answer. Again, we view this as capacity building.
It&#39;s not us coming in and doing this work. It&#39;s working with
your staff, whether it&#39;s in PED or whether it&#39;s in
Appropriations staff or it&#39;s a partnership with the executive
branch, we work with them to train them in what this approach is,
provide the tools, and then provide technical assistance to help them do
all of these deep dives. But it is something that, as you have more
questions, your staff will continue to do more work.

One last follow-up, Mr. Chair. Long-term, you would stay here, is
long-term free, too?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Senator, yes it has been so far. We&#39;ve been working
with states, I&#39;ll look at my boss, Mr. Conroy, with this but this
has been fully funded by the PEW and MacArthur foundations for the last
four years. We&#39;re confident we&#39;ll be fully funded for the next
three years after that. Just like you can&#39;t commit future
legislatures, I can&#39;t commit the board to doing things forever but
this has been the basis of this work to date.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that&#39;s an excellent answer and I would only add that if we
are able to help the state of North Carolina generate savings by
allocating your limited and constrained resources towards programs that
work, that generate better outcomes for your citizens, and cut programs
that don&#39;t work and make your budget decision making life easier,
and ultimately save millions of dollars for the residents of North
Carolina, there&#39;s a value to that that we would be providing to you
and perhaps several years down the road, nothing in the short term, but
several years down the road we would like to entertain a conversation
with you about the value that we are providing and whether or not
compensation would be appropriate or whether free is the model going
forward.

Senator Pate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Gentlemen, it seems to me that someone has to see
what the target really is before we let the arrow go. Is there some sort
of study that your folks are capable of making with partnership with our
government to see how we get to, first of all where we want to go and
secondly how we get there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Senator, as part of what we call the due diligence
process, it really is you assessing us at whether this partnership makes
sense for the state and us assessing whether we think the state is well
positioned to move forward. We&#39;re confident that North Carolina has
the legislative staff with a skill set necessary to do this. We
haven&#39;t done a data assessment to get an idea of where the data
sources will be needed to populate this model and we&#39;ll have some
conversations in subsequent weeks to talk to people about that. So it
really is a choice that you would make, are you confident with where you
want to go with this? We can share case studies of other states that
give you an idea of what this has looked like, we&#39;d be happy to give
you names of both members and staff in other states that you get an idea
of what this has meant to them. But we do really want everybody to be
going in to this eyes open because the good work that Washington State
and the research clearing houses have done meant that this information
on what works is available to us. It doesn&#39;t take an army and a
state to do this work but typically it&#39;s been a staff work group
over an interim who leads this. It needs to be people who have the
technical skills to do this, who are part of the process, that are
honest brokers for you, who can do this work long-term. So you have to
make the decision, who do you want to have do this, what capacity would
they have over the interim to do this, how do you want to structure
this? We&#39;ll make a decision whether we think that the state has the
data

the Waco is up Mr. Members in the Bork early working width 16 states and
woodworking was
almost 8424 years ago and noticed it to talk about lessons learned about
nine eight commemorate with all the states can you give us a specific
examples of some of
the lessons learned about the freeze to death while all Mr. Mandala
representative 56 impalas is warranted a week or use to do some really
important to get that the
high level commitment from states to do this, we started off by working
with some agencies and the challenge was they could do the analysis
point that the staff from
a digital system made a student of their own bodies stafford loans that
the legislature so the report that going places about 41 help but this
volume. It did to fix
a educational process for agreed to change their thinking disorder
asking for questions on what works with identify policy lovers about the

insert move the system court says all for example Mississippi.(SPEAKER
CHANGES) Passing a wallet says visible we mean by government so the way
this has come forward with no we wanted
to win new program no questions are one of Azusa the best likely to work
show was the evidence because no one fun things that are seven inspired
so you can really use
building this into the process of feet before the cube losses were born
and we&#39;ve identified calls to lovers and other states have used
across wouldn&#39;t unquestioned
DD down from outmanned Andre am all for what would happen to 1D6 to
seven month. In North Carolina this was done out Mr. (SPEAKER
CHANGES)and all we have more plans in other states
have used out and then we&#39;ll we&#39;ll give those to staff the
customer call System Works here in North Carolina all together is to be
that the ownership of staff level
so that is one key questions is pretty one have do this work and then
we&#39;ll share information with him to tell bill duplication point said
Wells made to Mr. Kerr
question for any of the presenters are listening to your model it seems
like if you applied that model two of which are doing you might be
overlooked state government
and the size of our government and its population and everything your
North Carolina and review that vs. overstates it to work with in other
words can you give us a
range of potential savings is no throttles HHS Dept is the smoothest
operation you&#39;ve ever saying what would be the savings that we&#39;d
say anything says Brian zucchini

states do so did those comparisons between states are worse are fraught
with difficulties so I think it utilities are of your call logic of this
worried much more
meaningful than mine in terms of accomplishing that would be with a

doing in doing dumb well home
center put items to homage to the Willingham since we&#39;re picking on
you and we&#39;ll all slide in the fragment politics is an error here

other states put everything could change 10 home of the even numbered

program could change as a result of that they&#39;ll be you, they bet in
your long-term relationships
with the states of miss chairman senator one of things said that the
thing support is why keep expectations for reasonable this isn&#39;t an
approach that comes in and
says our goals and take the politics of the budget process may call it a
