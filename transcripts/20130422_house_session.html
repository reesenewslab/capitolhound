Will this bill provide for any emergency situation or natural disaster
that might've happened that will affect the 3 year period that you are
talking about? Is there an exemption in here or some other way or case?
?? Has two years of problems and then has a natural disaster, which of
course would necessitate a third year of debt. Is that in this bill ?? ?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Natural disasters are not addressed in the bill. Over common sense, I
think would handle the situation. If a local ?? has a disaster, or
they're facing a disaster, and they can't handle it. They're gonna have
to get some help from somebody else, in which would be the commission.
However, a natural disaster I do not think would push them into the
takeover by the commission.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentlemen yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well Representative Cleveland, based on the way the bill reads now it
appears to make it mandatory that after the 3 year period that they
would take that action, is it your intent under the bill for that action
to only be discretionary and that they in fact consider other factors
other than that?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
We're speaking about a specific incidence where a natural disaster has
happened. A natural disaster is not covered by this bill. Over a 3 year
period, if the utility shows an inability to conduct your business in a
financially correct manner the commission can take them over. If we have
a utility that's failing, it'll take them over. If they're over the edge
and they're not able to recoup the commission will take them over.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Further discussion? Further debate? If not the question before the house
is the passage of house bill 238 on it's second reading. All in favor

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Committee ?? for house bill 315, developing ?? an act that will require
that degradable plastic products be clearly labeled to prevent
contamination of recycled, plastic feed stocks. General ?? of North
Carolina ??
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To debate ??
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
It's ?? speaker, colleagues, this is a bill that's about two things.
First it's a bill that separates recycable plastics from degradable
plastics, and secondly it's a bill about protecting a large sector of
our economy and that's the plastic recycling industry, which is really
big in North Carolina if you weren't aware of it. I just wanna give you
an example real quickly of why the bill is needed. Right now we recycle
a lot of plastics, about 30%, but if you put recycable plastics is put
together to decompose in light or by microbe action on that plastic, you
put them together and they get recycled, the new product that gets put
out there is likely not to last very long. It's gonna begin to break
down. Whether it's carpet, whether it's plastic in new bottles, or
whether it's plastic. Safety requires that plastics that are noted to be
compostable or degradable also state that they're not recycable. This
will help the consumer, this will help those people trying to recycle
plastics, as they sort through bottles and what not, and this will
hopefully add to the viability of the business here. Several
legislatures have worked on this bill at various point of time ?? It's
received favorable recommendations from ??</p>

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In spite.  Environment and natural resources, and we had an extensive
discussion.  Department of environment and natural resources.  And we
had an extensive discussion in the environment committee, where the bill
passed with bipartisan support.  I've had enough of questions and the
committee and sense that I thought I'd explain the situation to some of
you in other areas of the state.  I started my career in a community
were over 50% of the jobs were in manufacturing.  That has changed.
Those weren't big fancy plants, the kind that we give incentives for.
There were largely started over the ??  century, by returning veterans
in the world wars, who after years of death and destruction decided they
wanted to be creative and do something, and build something.  They
started businesses.  Not big ones.  50, 75 employees, a hundred
employees.  But they made a living.  They supported their family.  They
sent their kids to North Carolina schools, without debt.  They supported
their churches, their PTAS, their scout troops, and their communities at
large.  Their employees were like family.  During that process, we piled
on regulation upon regulation, and near the end of that process, we
decided that the things they made, the furniture, the hosiery, the
components were too expensive, and we would be better served to buy them
from cheaper sources in other parts of the world.  The businesses
started failing.  The regulations worked well here, but they didn't seem
so necessary in the parts of the world where we couldn't see the
environmental degradation or child labor.  The plants didn't fail all at
once.  It took some time.  See, these folks it had been in these
businesses for generations.  Granddaughters, grandsons, great grandsons
and granddaughters.  They kept these things going 'cause they had little
debt, some capital, and they held on.  They held on and bled.  For
years.  But we've now reached the end of that.  We have hundreds of
these just in my county.  To add insult to injury, the state of North
Carolina said you can't bury your dead building on your property. You've
got to fall it across a county or into another county, whatever it
takes.  We don't care that it cost you one time, twice, three times,
four times what it would cost to bury it there.  So the buildings didn't
get torn down.  We've suffered an economic storm in Piedmont, North
Carolina, and we can't rebuild until we clean up the debris.</p>
