Started. Again, we’d like to thank our sergeant of arms, Reggie Sills,
Marvin Lee and Mike Clampett for always being faithful and being with
us. We have a host of pages with us this morning. And ladies and
gentlemen if you would stand when your name. Hannah Landy from Wake
County. Hannah, I see you. Anna Morodeaux? Am I saying that right? I’m
so sorry. Thank you. And Anna is from Guilford. Griffin Matsou, help me.
And Griffin also is from Wake. Then there’s Thomas Moore III from
Orange, I can pronounce yours. We’re glad to have you, Thomas. Haley
Nelson from Mecklenberg. Haley, we’re glad to have you. And Cammy
Holland from Guilford. Cammy. And Riley Pierson from Wake. And Carter,
help me. Thank you, Carter, from New Hanover. We appreciate all of you
being here and you get to go home at 3:00 today so I know you’re ready.
It’s been a [LAUGHTER] tiring week for you. We appreciate you being
here. Members if you take your seat, we’re going to start on our agenda.
Senator Tillman’s Senate Bill 105, clarify political sign ordinance. ??
Senator Tillman, welcome to the committee. Representative Brawley?
Representative Brawley moves that we have the PCS before us for the
purpose of discussion. All in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed will say no. Senator Tillman, we have a
PCS. Would you like for staff to explain for that for you? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If the staff would run through it quickly, Madame Chair, thank
you. And thank you for inviting me over here and for having me first
today. I love you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We always are glad to have the
Senate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The PCS presented for 105 section 1 of the
bill clarifies that a municipal political sign ordinance may apply to
state highways that are within the corporate limits, and the second part
of the bill is what the PCS is, it adds a new provision unrelated to the
first provision that would add the towns of Elizabethtown and Matthews
to the state health plan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee,
are there questions for the staff? Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] My question is on adding the towns to the state health plan.
Maybe one of the bill sponsors would tell me what the background is on
that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’d be me. Thank you for your question,
Edgar. The request came from both towns. They’re small towns, and in the
current excellent operation of the healthcare market, they’re having
difficulty covering their employees. The way this will will work is
actuarial notes are being prepared to ensure there’s no impact to the
state whatsoever. The towns will be responsible for all the costs
associated with putting their employees, and this is only employees.
Retirees are nto included, on the state health plan. If additional
coverage for dependents is added, the town will still be responsible for
paying that. There’s also a provision in the bill that if they pay late,
they pay a late fee of 1.5% per month on the overdue balance. So that
the state will not have to pay anything for the towns, but will be
insulated from any additional cost accruing to the state by the presence
of the towns on the state health plan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Starnes, we
have David Vanderweide here, I believe he can also address any of your
questions. I can’t see him. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, here. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] David, sir, would you add to that conversation? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] David Vanderweide from the fiscal research division. Yes, that
is correct. We are preparing the fiscal committee actuarial health note
on this. We have just received the data and haven’t had a chance to have
the external actuaries process it. There would be no retirees. There is
the potential, well the local governments will pay the premium, the
employer premium into the state health plan, there is always the
possibility that the analysis will show that their costs are in fact a
bit higher than that premium. We just don’t know until we’ve done that
analysis.</p>

Speaker Changes: Mr ??,
Speaker Changes: So you said and I'm looking for the ?? look like we got
a handful of counties getting in here, Is this a trend then or just got
basically everybody all the local government going into the state health
plans because they cant get it onto the other market is this where we
are going,
Speaker Changes: David ??
Speaker Changes: ?? Representative ?? i can answer that question ?? this
was a request from my local government what i will say is there are many
town in the ?? over there years so we are adding ?? this is the minimal
impact i have discussed about this with Representative Collins that it
should be explored on a broader area ?? eventually every every town and
if we are going to open it up ?? so the decision to do that is not being
made now and i will have note that ?? in your hand before you have asked
this to vote on the floor
Speaker Changes: Madam chair,
Speaker Changes: Hold up just a minute,David would like to answer this
question are you seeing a trained was the question that member i ask,
Speaker Changes: ?? this Bill is the only one this session yo add these
two this PCS there is a bill house Bill 1213 that would allow any local
government that wish to join to join the plan ?? the cost can be
determined because we know that the local government would like to join
under the provision,
Speaker Changes: Representative Robert ??
Speaker Changes: When the state help plan was set up it as understood
that may be some counties would not get health insurance because at the
time making it state plans available to citizen counties as long as the
make as actually ??so didn't called to taste anything but would ?? local
government access to anything plan,
Speaker Changes: Representative Holly,
Speaker Changes: Thank you madam chair ?? in the ate health plan,
Speaker Changes: Yes there are,
Speaker Changes: Looking at the summary a think you'll see a lists of
them,
Speaker Changes: Follow up,
Speaker Changes: Yes,
Speaker Changes: With that ?? choose the overall health plan for the
existing employees can that have an effect on the overall rates for
existing employees ,David can you answer that sir,
Speaker Changes: ?? it is possible these town are very small the total
plans in and out the ?? roughly three billion dollars the total payments
for these two towns are beyond one billion dollars so i mean i by ?? it
is possible if again these due cause ?? would bump up the employee cost
by state health plan by some infinite has found out Representative ??,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Madam chair for the motion at the appropriate
time ,
Speaker Changes: I'll take that motion and will continue to debate where
everybody satisfies with their question Representative Luke ,thank you
this would be a question for the staff i believe what about the 15 unit
rule,15 government true that we have established for in certain cases
as for as what a local bill is that's the question right,
Speaker Changes: ?? the bill which you have before actually not written
as a local act ,some of the local government were brought on as  ??
becasue it's really not correct variation from a general law instead
allowing governments allowing on a state wide program and so the bill
before you is not a local act that's would a 15 would not come to play ,
Speaker Changes: ?? do you have anything to add that debate,</p>

Ryan answered it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, let me get
your names. Representative Jones. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madame
Chair. I have a question regarding section 1, regarding the political
sign ordinance. And I just wanted to ask are these state highways or
within the corporate limits of a municipality and what we’re doing here
is allowing the municipality to set the ordinance on the signs. And I
don’t know if Senator Tillman’s still here or if staff would answer
this, but I guess my question is who would ultimately be responsible for
the enforcement? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff? I’m sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
No you go ahead if you want to. Yeah, you speak with more authority.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We’re on the original part of the bill, so Senator
Tillman did have to step out. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So under the statute
regulating signs, there’s a provision that says that municipalities can
by ordinance either prohibit or regulate the placement of the signs,
only on municipal streets. And if there’s no ordinance, then general law
applies and basically I think DOT is responsible, general speaking, for
the regulation of signs. And so what this provision does is say that
they can as part of their city ordinance also regulate the placement of
signs on the state highways that are within the municipal limits. So my
understanding from when this bill was introduced last year was that part
of the issue was that frankly the cities had more resources to deal with
the signs than DOT. But we also have the league here who might be able
to address that. But that’s my understanding that the cities would be
able to enforce that ordinance within their city limits. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Jones, do you want to address any questions to
the league? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, not unless someone has a different
understanding, but I interpret that answer as saying that the
municipalities themselves would enforce it and not the state. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Cohen is here this morning. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think one
of the issues was that people didn’t quite understand that the city
ordinance didn’t apply on state streets and in many cases the
enforcement officers and the candidates had no idea what was a city
street and what was a state street. So it’s very confusing for everyone
involved. Where it’s more likely that people will know that an area is
or isn’t in the city limits. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cochran?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair. Since we just got this, I
haven’t been able to read the whole thing, but going back to corporate
signs or things that are not political signs, if for a family function
or houses, are they in this same clause as well or are we just talking
about only political signs? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cochran,
this only refers to political signs and there’s a definition in the
statute that says a political sign is any sign that advocates for
political action and the term does not include a commercial sign.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does that answer your question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
just to follow up, just for understanding, so if volunteers put out
campaign signs for any candidate and then they’re in the wrong place,
campaigns can be fined by the city but other forms of speech will not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right, this provision is limited to political signs as
defined by this statute. And so the cities can’t at least under this
statute. I don’t know if there’s another provision that relates to
commercial signs but the provision that this bill deals with is only the
political signs. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there limits already in the law of the
amount of funds that can be accrued by one campaign? Because we had a
campaign in just our city that I believe was hit with $70,000 and my
opponent was hit with 10,000. So I’m just kind of wondering about this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Cohen, can you? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, cities are
generally authorized to levy if it’s classified as a misdemeanor, fines
of up to $100 per occurrence, so a city could choose to treat every sign
as an offense, or treat all the signs as one offense. So that would
really be up to the city’s ordinances to whether it deemed each
placement of each sign to be a separate misdemeanor or not. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Cohen, just to clarify, just political</p>

Speaker: Science not other science,
Speaker Changes: Right cities have central authority well what happened
is that legislature carved out of special rule of political science I'm
not sure exactly ?? whether cities have the right to regulate the
commercial science state highways and in and out of the neither ways
,but the legislature up special rule for political science that
treatment involves ?? within city limits of medical campaigns ?? what
the authority has the ability to regulate commercial science,
Speaker Changes: That would be great,
Speaker Changes: Would you like to address the question somebody from
the league,
Speaker Changes:??,
Speaker Changes: I believe there is someone can you come to the
microphone and give us your full name in your position please,
Speaker Changes: Thank you madam chair ?? i have conferred to the couple
of colleagues we don't ensure to that would be happy to look and get
back to yu
Speaker Changes: Representative wells,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Madam chair ??
Speaker Changes: Wells
Speaker Changes: I'm in favor if this and appreciated ?? to bring it up
,a couple of years ago ?? by carving out that special exemptions for
politicians  .In hope we got a month before the primary i realize the
attractive of the city in which i lived in turned into political science
hell ,that would be helpful for the folks running the ?? it would be
more helpful if the cities actually enforce those but generally what
happened in the general statue 42.Everybody just put in two line you an
put science ?? and if somebody takes them down ?? so it was absolutely
uncontrolled ,this clears up all the confusions ,it's now illegal puts
science ?? right away but the peoples on the campaigns don't understand
it ,the city officials don't understand it and everybody scared to wait
into it ,this makes us very clear that the cities can enforce city law
beside the city limits,we need to do this thank you sir,
Speaker Changes: ?? is coined to try to address road city ?? last
question if we can get into it ,otherwise I'm gonna ask the league to
please respond before the that would come to the floor,
Speaker Changes: ?? I'm happy to follow up with you I'm getting more
information ,but i just want to point out you in your summaries see the
full statues and sub section a that follows with commercial science it
basically says that ?? you know authorize ?? provisions at this statue
and that is said out in sub section D which says basically how big  the
science have to be have close they could be to the worlds and then it
states that anyone who violates the chromite ?? have the authority to
remove the science and ?? sneaked out it doesn't seems to ?? under the
cities of commercial that's what ?? independent authority you know
something in 168 would allow them and regulate ?? but i just want to
point you that there is provision about commercial science in this
statue but this bill doesn't address any fact ,
Speaker Changes: I do not believe that the members question have been
properly addressed so I'm gonna ask the league to please come with her
before the bill comes to the floor ,
Speaker Changes: Representative Madam chair ,
Speaker Changes: I regret on the floor yesterday disagree with my friend
representative wells and matter relating to ?? but i gotta absolutely
agree with him as this list today the leaders are expected to lead by
example exactly your point and this right sets  up to do that ?,
Speaker Changes: Thank you,</p>

...we have a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Madam Chair. My hearings not
really the best in the world sometimes. I move that we give Senate Bill
105 a favorable report for the PCS and unfavorable to the bridge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, you've heard the motion. Is
there any further discussion on the motion? We can't, we don't do that
until the...
Representative Waddell's motion is before you. Are there further
questions or concerns? If not all in favor will say aye, all opposed
will say no. Thank you. Senator Tillman and Representative Brawley, good
work together this morning.
Representative Hager, sir, you were first on the list. House Bill 1056,
Lake Lure Official Map via Annexation. We have a PCS, Representative
Setzer if recognized, that we have the PCS before us for the purpose of
discussion. All in favor will say aye, all opposed no. Representative
Hager, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Chairwoman. This bill is PCS because we
removed the deannexations of it, it got to be a little controversial. So
all this map is cleaning up the map for Lake Lure due to some old map
issues. They've straightened those out and we have to come to the
legislature to make sure it's OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, are there questions?
Representative Samuelson. You are recognized for a motion, seeing no
other hands. Representative Starnes. I almost got it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Almost. My question is do you time to enact to the
General Assembly that to clean the map up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff, would you like to answer that question, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma'am. In this particular...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Greg Rooney is recognized to address that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is Greg Rooney with the research division and they had
a reference, the General Assembly made a reference to a map that can't
be found and so this is correcting that map reference. The General
Assembly did it and the General Assembly is going to have to go in and
fix it. It's just all driven by the fact that the map can't be found.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, we broke it, we're hear to fix
it.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson, ma'am. Your recognized for a
motion. We have a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I move that we give a favorable to the PCS
for 1056, unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, you've heard the motion.
Further questions? Seeing none, all in favor will say aye, all opposed
no. I believe that's unanimous. Senator McKissick on Senate Bill 871,
Raleigh Durham Deannexation/Annexation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a very, very simple bill. There is no
opposition. What it effectively does is deannexes about one acre of land
from the City of Raleigh and annexes to the City of Durham. There's no
opposition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Martin, you're recognized, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I actually, just a question
for Senator McKissick and then a motion. Senator McKissick, this is
exactly the same form that the City of Raleigh has no objection to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is exactly correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. Always careful when folks in
Durham are trying to steal Raleigh's land but move for a favorable
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Or vice versa.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, sir. We have a motion before us
to give Senate Bill 871 a favorable report. Are there other questions or
concerns? Seeing no hands, all in favor will say aye, all opposed no.
Thank you, sir. Who's going to handle the bill for you? Representative
Luebke will handle the bill on the floor.
Senator McLaurin, sir, are you in the room? This is Rockingham
Deannexation. Anybody want to take a stab at this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll rise and talk. [laughs] We'll let staff explain
or do you want to put...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, that's OK. Senate Bill 767, in the absence of
Senator McLaurin, Representative Brawley has volunteered to have the
bill before us.
Staff, you want to make a stab at 767 and let the House be generous and
kind to the Senate in their absence.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Or...</p>

Maybe it won’t turn out that way [LAUGHTER], so Seth? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am. What this bill does, is it de-annexes a piece of satellite
property that was annexed. Last night I spoke to the town manager to try
to get the background on this. And there was a steakhouse that wanted
liquor by the drink, and so they did a satellite annexation for the
steakhouse and the name of it was Little Bo’s Steakhouse. Well, the
steakhouse has now went out of business. The building has actually been
burned. So now [LAUGHTER] the city has a piece of satellite property
there, that they’re supposed to provide services for and they’re only
getting taxes for just a vacant piece of property. And so that was the
situation so the property owner and the city would like to just erase
the annexation and only the General Assembly can de-annex property.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
And my question was, was this the entire site lot or just a portion of
it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] My understanding is that it’s the whole piece.
I’ll have to say I didn’t specifically ask the town manager about that.
He, the representation to me was that this was just this one, I asked
him was it a donut hole and he said yes. Which is just this one thing
that they did to just get the restaurant. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Warren, sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madame Chair.
Question for the bill sponsor. [LAUGHTER] Representative Brawley, do you
know of anyone opposed to this motion? [SPEAKER CHANGES] He wouldn’t
have a clue. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] The true answer is no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The question for the bill sponsor. [LAUGHTER] Could you even
point to Rockingham on the map? [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually,
sir, I could. Because I was born in Richmond County. And I’ve been
working with Senator McLauren on some other issues related to that area,
and that’s why I’m doing him a favor because that way as the Sicilians
say, I don’t do favors, I collect obligations. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair. As
the representative from Rockingham County which is two hours North from
Rockingham, [LAUGHTER] I would be pleased to make a motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Tine has ?? on the motion. Representative Tine,
sir, you’re recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion for a
favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Are there any other
questions? If not, seeing no hands, all in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed no. A matter of cleanup.
Representative Starnes moves that the minutes for the previous meeting
be given a motion for favorable. All in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed will say no. With that we
stand adjourned.</p>
