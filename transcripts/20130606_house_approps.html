Members will take their seats. If all of the other visitors, if there
are conversations, could you please take those outside the Committee
Room? If I have everybody's attention, we'll get moving here.
We're pleased to have with us today four Pages, and if you will raise
your hand or stand up, I think you're over in this direction out there,
Caitlin Sisson from Mecklenburg County, sponsored by Representative
Jeter; Aaron Walker from Wade County, sponsored by Representative Murry;
Sandy Goulsby from Hertford County, sponsored by Speaker Tillis;
Yushawnda Hurst from Wade County, sponsored by Representative Stam.
Thank you for being with us today.
We have, as always, our expert sergeants at arms. Today with us is
Carlton Adams, Young Bay, Bob Rossi, Joe Crook and Patrick Mason. So we
appreciate them being with us this morning - this afternoon, really.
You should have on your desk, I believe this is a revised PCS from
yesterday, and Representative Cleveland moves that the House proposed
Committee Substitute for House Bill 998 be before the Committee for
discussion purposes only, without objection. No objection being heard,
Representative David Lewis is welcome to the floor, the well of the
Appropriations Committee to explain the bill. While he is coming
forward,
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will say that for the purposes, if you could hold
that though just a moment, for the purposes of the Appropriations
Committee, all that we will be considering today in any amendments would
have to relate to the the actual appropriations in the bill itself. So
just the section that is being appropriated. Representative Stevens?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just for a point of clarification, we've seemed to
have heard back here that you said we were going to only consider this
bill, are we actually going to vote it out?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's the normal motion. It's the motion for the PCS to
be in front of the Committee for discussion purposes. Sometimes you add
the extra language, sometimes you don't. So it's a standard motion. The
PCS is properly before us and Representative Lewis is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, let
me begin by saying to all of you, thank you for the hard work that you
are doing to prepare our budget. I know it's been a lot of long days,
and there are many more long days and nights ahead so please accept my
sincere thanks for all of your hard work.
House Bill 998 that you have before you, &quot;The Tax Simplification
and Reduction Act&quot;, is an important step in reforming North
Carolina's outdated tax system. We're continuing to work, we have [??
started], and this plan puts North Carolina on track for further tax
reform efforts in the future. This bill is a major step in the ongoing
process of tax reform. Under the plan, the working families of North
Carolina will see more dollars in their pocket and our state will become
more competitive for job creation.
So what's the bill do? All North Carolinians get a personal income tax
break. It eliminates the three tax brackets that we have and establishes
a fair, flat 5.9 percent rate. That tax is a lower rate than most all of
our neighboring states. It helps low and middle income earners by
doubling the size of their standard deductions. The most vulnerable
North Carolinians will have an effective zero personal income tax rate.
North Carolina will have one of the most generous standard deductions
for blocks of income exempt from...</p>

state taxation in the entire nation. This bill more than doubles the
child tax credit for low and middle income families. It protects seniors
and families by preserving existing exemptions from state taxation on
food and drugs. It keeps a mortgage interest deduction along with a
property tax deduction capped at a $25,000 maximum amount. It also
allows for unlimited charitable contributions. Further, the bill cuts
the franchise tax by over 10% and starts on a four-year path to reduce
our corporate income tax. It does broaden the sales tax base, but it
does so in a way that makes sense by asking only those who are already
equipped and accustomed to collecting and remitting sales tax to do so
on the services that they provide in so far as installation and
delivery. With that Mr. Chairman, I’d be glad to go through the bill
page by page. I do not think that is what you have asked me to do so, I
will stand to follow your direction at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do have one amendment and we’ll take questions while that amendment
is being passed out. Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to ask Representative Lewis a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you enumerate the services that the sales tax is going to apply to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir I can, representative Michaux. Let me direct you - tell you what
Representative Michaux, I’m just going to answer what you asked and then
perhaps staff could direct you to the exact part in the bill. I
apologize, I left my glasses on my desk in the chamber. I can’t read it
so - I’m not sure those would help Craig but thank you. What this does
in terms of expanding the sales tax base, Representative, is it would
tax the sale of extended warranties and service contracts. As best we
can tell, those are taxed now in nearly all other states. It would also
tax the delivery and installation of tangible personal goods. What is
that mean? It means if you were to go and buy a dishwasher today for
your home, you would be charged the current state sales tax rate of -
well if you bought it in Dunn you’d be charged 6.75%, if you bought it
in Durham it be 7.5% but you would be taxed on that and then if that
company that delivered it to your house had a fee for doing that, that
is not currently taxed today. This bill would contemplate that that
would in fact be taxed. The service to install it would be taxed.
Another major change is that currently, when you go to have your
automobile repaired or in my case, when you go to have your lawnmower
repaired, the repair parts that are installed on your machine are taxed
at the full rate but the labor to install those parts is not taxed
today. It would be under this plan. There is also an expansion of the
sales tax base in the area of amusements.</p>

<p id="10:00">
your past, your very distinguished past service here, that we had a
hodge-podge, if you will, of the way that we taxed various events. This
will set all those events to be taxed at the standard sales tax rates. I
guess the easiest way to describe that would be the admission ticket
that you might buy to go and see a movie this weekend. This bill does
propose to end, or to repeal the energy star sales tax holiday. That
would begin this year. And there is a strange little quirk in the law
that certain vitamins that are bought from a chiropractor are not
currently taxed. If you buy the exact same ones at GNC or Wal-Mart or
even at a doctor’s office, they would be taxed at the full rate, so that
is part of the clean-up language that we have in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Let me try to get a little bit more specific. Can
you tell me about drugs, about food, and there’s one other one I had on
my mind a minute ago, before you got on that litany, but I’ll think of
it in a minute. But food and drugs, oh and, if you could tell me about
that it will come to me in a minute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, thank you for that. This bill keeps
the vital exemptions on sales tax for food and for drugs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Gill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to just ask one
question, and it’s on page 15, section 4.2e, that talks about elementary
and secondary school athletic contests, dances and other amusement.
Could anyone expound on that? Is this the regular little inter-mural
games that they play at school, the contest within the county, and why
would we include this, and how much money would it generate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I believe the lady asked about page 15.
Is that right, ma’am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Page 15, line 23, if you want to be-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, could I direct that to staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Which staff member?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Avery.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Avery is recognized to respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Gill, those are the exemptions. Right
now we have a tax on different forms of amusements, we have a gross
receipts tax on them. And in that gross receipts tax statute, there are
some 13 or 14 exemptions. This bill preserves all of the current
exemptions, and that high school is one of them. So those are the things
that would not be taxed, that are listed on page 15.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions? If not, I move the amendment- it
will come back- Representative Torbett, you've got a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. A question of the bill sponsor, Mr.
Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll be glad to yield, Mr. Chairman. I apologize. I
don’t see where the Representative…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, over here to your right. That’s fine. Page
13, “Creation of Fund, Administration.” It looks like we’re removing
part of that from a public school building capital fund. If so, what
kind of impact, monetarily, is that on to what they currently have
access with the fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, so much for that inquiry, sir. The answer
to that is none. The public school capital building fund, this portion
of their income has not been included in any budget or distributed to
the locals since 2008. This bill just</p>

Representative Presnell.

Social Security is still exempted?

Yes, Mame.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Any further questions before we address the amendment? Representative
Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I'm sorry, I arrived just a few minutes late, you may have described
this. But, I'm just wondering is there anywhere in this tax reform
proposal that you take into account transactions on CraigsList?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No, Mame.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Stan, do you wish to answer that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Oh, no. I have another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay. All right.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Quick question on the increase in the tax on an
electricity and how that is distributed and then, a follow up question.
I'll wait for that answer and then a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, representative. Currently the tax on electricity currently
has two parts. It consists of the franchise tax, which is about 3.22%
and then, it consists of a state sales tax part. What this bill does,
the repeal 3.22% and  then, place electricity into the state sales tax
base. We did provide language in the bill after consultation with Duke
Energy. We did provide language in the bill that would provide for
expedited review of this by the utilities commission, because Duke says,
they can lower the effective rate, that they charge. Because, the hidden
franchise tax has been removed.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Stan, do you need to be recognized?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes. Quick question. On page 15 and 16, section 4.2C, did understand
that that's a list of the exemptions from the sales tax or is that new
taxes?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Stan, thank you for that. These are 12 items, that
through the years the general assembly has passed bills to exempt from
sales tax. This bill would just maintain that those events would remain
exempt.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Question for the bill sponsor, and I know this
is getting confusing. But, it appears that the PCS allows for an
unlimited deduction for a voluntary charity giving, but would limit a
deductions for mandatory things, such as property taxed $25,000, is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, for that inquiry, representative. You are correct. Charitable
contributions would not be capped in this bill. This bill would allow
for mortgage and interest deductions, and specifically to address what
you asked about property tax is paid on your home to be combined and to
be deducted from the amount that you will be taxed at. We did cap that
at $25,000, because based on the research that we've done that accounts
for certainly over 97% of the folks, in the state who pay these bills.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative McNeill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I'm right here. I see you got your glasses now.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
All right. All right. I appreciate it. You and I had a conversation
yesterday about the tax on the service plan and how it affected, maybe
the parts and the labors on that, and whether it was actually a double
tax.</p>

<p id="20:00">
...appreciate you that. But I'd like a little bit more clarification, if
I could, from you or the staff on how their taxing a service plan and
how that works. Maybe if when a person goes to get their car fixed if
the service plan doesn't cover all the cost. Because some of the service
plans have deductibles and sometimes when you go to get it, the cost is
not 100% covered. I just wanted a little clarification on maybe how the
law would work in that case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, could I request that Ms. Averitt reply
to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Averitt is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. On page 19, beginning on line 41, you'll see
another sales tax exemption for the items and service that is used to
fulfill a service contract to the extent the purchaser did not have to
pay for it. So those, with the thought that those were currently,
anything the purchaser receive free of charge, the purchaser had already
paid for when it purchased that service contract. If there is some part
that was charged at the time, then that part would be subject to tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? OK. So what was covered under the service
contract would not be charged again, but if they had an additional
charge, they would pay sales tax on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Thank you. Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I thought of my other questions. Representative Lewis,
on the charitable gifts and the mortgage interest, is that applicable
both to personal and corporate mortgage and interest payments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, sir. Representative, this would apply only to
individual tax payers. As you know, if you own real estate through a
commercial entity the interest that you would pay is a business expense
that would flow through to the bottom line.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So let me be clear, I understand that that's what it
is, so individuals cannot take their full deduction, but businesses can
take the full deduction?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, sir...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Because of the fact that it's a business item?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To be clear, sir, most every individual can take their
full deduction. We'd be glad, at the Chair's discretion, to go through
how big an individual mortgage can be before they would be hurt by this
cap. But I can assure you that it is a very, very small percent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm over here, Representative
Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not used to you being on my left, Representative
Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. I'm very comfortable over here. My question
is on page 17 regarding the way that the franchise tax on electricity is
converted to a sales tax and then remitted to the municipalities. And I
know the goal is to make sure that the municipalities were held harmless
and I'm sure that you've done the best to your ability to do that. I'm
just not clear as to, explain how the ad valorem tax rate of a town
figures into the equation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman? Could I direct that to Ms. Averitt, as
well? She might be able to do it a little more concisely than I have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, Ms. Averitt is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, the bill provides that, what
we did was we calculated about how much of the sales tax proceeds the
local governments currently receive. To make an analysis, and that's
about 44%. So what this says is that 44% of the sales tax revenues
received will be distributed to the cities. That allows for it to go up
or down. Then that transfer consists of two parts. The first part is
what those cities received the last time they received the gross
receipts franchise tax. So that's a determined amount and they get that.
But then, say, there's some left over. How do you distribute what's left
over because of growth and what seemed to be the best proxy was the
property tax value in that city. As we looked...</p>

<p id="25:00">
looked at it, staff trying to figure out what was the most analogous. So
that's just to determine if there's any money left from the direct part
what was most closely analogous to something we could fix, and that was
the property tax value, because that would include the business property
etc..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, one follow-up then, well then when they, use that ??? tax
rate to determine how the excess is distributed, which municipality
benefits? The one with the high tax rate or the low tax rate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's based on the value, not the tax rate. It's based on the ??? tax
value determined.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So it has nothing to do with the tax rate, just simply the value?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, that is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions before we go to the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've got one moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What's, what's after the adjustments that you've made on this, what's
the total cost on here and this? As it now stands?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know what it better be. Or under, or less.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, the response to that is, if you include the
repeal of the estate tax, which we contemplate the Senate will pass, the
first-year impact  from what the consensus revenue would have been to
what it becomes is $40.2 million, and over a four-year period the
savings is currently contemplated at about $1.6 billion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions? Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I understood yesterday that when you pulled out the
charitable contributions, the Howard amendment, for better words for it,
that that figure would be about $1.5 billion over a 5-year period, and
this one is now $1.6 billion over a 5-year period?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, the largest change in this bill is actually
found on page 1 starting at lines 35 and 36. What this bill would
propose to do, as you recall 2 years ago, this general assembly passed a
bill that allowed the first $50,000 worth of pass-through income to not
be taxed, to be taxed at 0%. When, and as a part of the legislative
process, we have proposed to sunset that this year. And that allows us
to make the projections that you have before you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a statement, Mr. Chairman, I'm still, pardon can I? Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. I'm still puzzled as to why we could not still, I'm
looking at the 1.5 and the 1.6 billion dollars that you now are talking
about, and I'm wondering why you were just, at first we started out with
the billion, and then when the Howard Amendment got in, it got to 1.5
billion, now, we have taken the Howard Amendment out, and it's now up to
1.6 billion, and I guess, I guess, I'm a little bit perturbed as to what
all the hullabaloo was about this part as far as the Howard Amendment
was concerned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I might add, sometimes you'd be careful of what you read in the
papers, Representative Lewis is recognized.

Change was that the amendment that was sent forth in Finance would have
had a 5025 million dollar impact on this current budget year.  And we
have that after consultation or perhaps lecturing might be a better way
to describe the conversation with the Appropriation Chairs. It was said
that was too big of a jump to take in one year.  But we had contemplated
that credit expiring in 2014 anyway and so it does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I wanted to try to answer one of Representative
Michaux’s question about mortgages.  Because mortgages vary in terms of
who this might impact, but we looked at the first impact that it would
have on somebody with a $417,000 mortgage. If they were paying 6%
interest, would lose $20 of their interest deduction. So I hope that
helps you but everybody’s mortgage will vary but ti took getting to that
number at that percentage point before a homeowner would suffer not
being able to carry some interest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hollo.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Question for the bill sponsor.  I’m looking at the
effective dates, and can give you me, I guess a summary of the effective
date of the income tax decreases because I believe it has to tie in with
the calendar year and I believe some of the other dates and where the
other tax rights are going to change maybe July 1, 2014.  So am I
correct in thinking that the actual income tax breaks are going to begin
in the next calendar year?  Because it says it will become effective
when it becomes law at the bottom there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, the transition to the fixed flat rate would begin January 1st,
2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions before we address the amendment? Representation ve
Hall?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.  And really a two point question.  The first one
being, with the flat tax that is now being implemented for all citizens,
what is the tax cut if any to folks currently paying the lowest rate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Representative Hall, I appreciate that.  You’ve got to understand
that this bill provides exempt blocks of income that are taxed.  And so,
if you want to take a let’s say a married filing jointly, if they
currently make $12,000 or less they wouldn’t be taxed at all. So their
rate would be zero.  If they make $24,000 their rate would be somewhere
in the neighborhood of 2.8. Because we’ve got to remember that to help
the lower-income folks we do have, unlike the current law which taxes
from the first dollar earned in the state, we now have lots of income
that are taxed at 0%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Baskerville. Excuse me, Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Question for the sponsor.  Did you do some
calculations regarding the sum set of $150,000 deduction for ?? income
for say small business owners that have an income out of that of
$100,000 or so. Can you give me some idea of what the difference would
be?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Candidly, Representative I don’t know exactly what the impact would be.
Let me just reply this way.  Part of the reason that the $50,000
exemption was put into place was that North Carolina has had and
currently has the highest marginal tax rates in the southeast.  7.5</p>

<p id="35:00">
[SPEAKER] A Percent. So with the cut from 7.75 down to 5.9, we think
that there will not be a big impact, if you will, on the folks that do
receive, pass through the entity income. But I don’t know quite what
that exact amount is yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Baskerville.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Faircloth will answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to follow up on
Representative Michaux’s questions about the 1.6 billion specifically.
Is there, and I, maybe you need do answer, I know this is pretty
complexed but is there some way that we can get a chart that will show
where that came from? We had an original bill that took $1 billion out
of our revenue stream. When Representative Howard’s amendment passed, it
took an additional $500 million out of our revenue stream. So you put
that back in but you must have taken out enough else to take out $600
billion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There is a chart at the back of the bill. It’s
attached to the back of the bill, and Representative Lewis, if you want
to make any particular comment on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko, all I would do is, and I was
doing math on the fly here when I got asked about that by the gentleman
from Durham. But please just look at the chart. And what you’ll see is
that this revenue plan does contemplate growth.
I wish I could stand here and tell you that I was proposing a grand tax
cut. That’s everyone who runs for office on my sides dream to be able to
do.  What this bill does though is slow the rate of growth of income
into the State but still provides enough income to meet essential state
needs. So, I would contend to you that, to say that it is a cut is
correct in that it is a cut in the rate that the revenue would have
grown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I thought I, I intended to say that it would
reduce our revenue, which it does. If I said it was cut in the total
revenue, I was mistaken. That was misspeaking.
Can you tell me, maybe another question would be, should I make the
assumption that the original billion is the same and what’s changed is
in that additional $600 million or were there changes throughout? And
probably . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I think that’s very, very fair thing to ask. I
think what you see, it is the earlier sunset of the $50,000 or business
income method out against expansion, if you will of the charitable
contribution deduction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to follow up perhaps
on the question that I understood Representative Hall to ask regarding
what a low income individual might pay under this legislation versus
what they are currently paying and by asking you if I’m understanding
this correctly.
Currently, let us say if we were talking about a single parent who
qualified as a head of household. In looking at the current rates that
are set out on page two, it appears to me that before allowing for them
taking any deductions that they might otherwise be entitled to, that as
I think you said, Representative Lewis, beginning with the first dollar
of income up to $17,000 they would, let’s see, yeah. Up to $17,000 they
would pay six percent income tax on that.</p>

<p id="40:00">
Am I correct so far?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under the new proposal for that same single parent who qualifies as head
of household $9,600 at a minimum, but maybe more, itemize their
deductions will get them a higher amount would be tax free and whatever
their taxed on over that amount is going to be five point nine percent;
less than what their currently paying plus the increase in the amount of
not subject to first dollar tax. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Harris
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mister Chair. Representative Lewis I opening any conference of
text the state undertakes including closing a lot of the loopholes. I
understand, if my thinking is right, list at the back of the bill are
the proposed eliminations of exemptions that reference EnergyStar tax
repeal and the chiropractor nutritional supplements plus the list of the
current exemptions and loopholes that we have in our tax code that are
going to be eliminated, is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. It would be helpful to put this in context if the staff has handy
a list of all the exemptions. I know that they cost our state millions
of millions, if not billions, in lost revenue. Everything from the bank
exemption, there's the farm sales between equipment, and lucutary
yhates. I would be interested, if it's possible, to see a list of those
exemptions. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollars, are you going to take comments too? I don't have
any other questions but I would like to make a comment too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Your recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Louis mentioned that this, even though we were removing,
1.6 billion dollars from our revenue stream it left an adequate amount
for our essential services. And I know that our budgets for us this year</p>
