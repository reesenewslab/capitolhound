To extend the courtesies of the gallery to a friend of this body and
former legislator Gio Pridgeson.  Gio, please stand and let us welcome
you.  Representative Burr please state your purpose.
[NEW SPEAKER]
For a motion, Mr. Speaker.
[NEW SPEAKER]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Mr. Speaker, first I'd like to move that House Bill 108, row and vehicle
personal use exemption be withdrawn from finance and re-referred to the
committee on government.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Without objection.  So ordered.  If the gentleman's motion is to
adjourn, if you'll yield for a moment. Pages, if we could have you come
to the front please and those of you at the dais if you could step down
for a moment.  Pages I want to thank you for your service to the House
this week.  I think we've had a pretty active week, although we have
today what we're calling a skeleton session.  So for those of you in the
gallery, you're wondering why some of the seat are missing.  Today is
one of those days where we're not taking any recorded votes and some of
the members are either in committee meetings or have gone back to their
home districts. We hope over the course of the week you got an
opportunity to make some friendships with your fellow pages. You had an
opportunity to see how this legislative body works and hopefully you'll
carry those stories back to your family members, your brothers and
sisters and friends, and encourage them to come back and serve this body
as well.  As important, hopefully one or two of you have found enough
interest in it to where you'll replace some of us old timers and come in
and actually serve in the legislature some day. So thank you very much
for your service this week and I hope you have a great end of the school
year and great summer.  Thank you. You may now return to your stations.
Ladies and gentleman of the House, the Chair sees some students that are
visiting with us today.  I know that at least the Central Elementary
School from Eden is here but I think I see a few other classes.  So if
you're visiting with us and you're students from any school from any
part of North Carolina, I'd like you to stand now.  I'd like to thank
the students, the teachers, and the chaperones for coming out and
visiting with us today.  Hopefully you'll have a great day.  Please
stand and let us welcome you. Ladies and gentleman, this completes the
calendar. One thing I meant to mention yesterday when we had more
members present.  But, next week will be a special week. We're going to
have educators here for three consecutive days.  The first day we've
invited each of the 115 Superintendents to join us on Tuesday.  You'll
be getting a notice.  Certainly if your Superintendent is here we would
encourage you to find time to meet with your Superintendent and if you
have time have breakfast with them or lunch with them. That's on
Tuesday. On Wednesday we've invited 115 Principles of the Year from each
of the LEA's.  They will be joining us again on Wednesday.  And then on
Thursday, we've invited 115 Teachers of the Year.  And the goal of those
three days is first to have them meet with their respective members. We
will be hosting a session here in the chamber where we've asked them to
sit in your seats.  So it will almost be as many as there are of us. To
spend an hour or so here in the chamber just hearing from them, we would
encourage you if your calendar permits, to come in and listen and let
them talk.  We hope that that's just the beginning of a continuous
dialogue as we go through and we work with our traditional K-12 public
schools to see what good ideas they have.  Because I'm absolutely
convinced the good ideas for public school, improving public schools,
are going to come from the folks that are actually out there doing it
already and it's our goal to listen to them and figure out how we make
their job even better and let them realize their passion for teaching.
And again the reminder, please take note and make your calendars
available for the ethics training that were announced yesterday.  The
next one is on the</p>
