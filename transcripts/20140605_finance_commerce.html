Good morning, morning. Uh-oh. Hello? We're good. This mic on? We're
good. Good morning. I'd like to call the meeting to order, the Joint
House of Commerce Committees for a really, really what I think's going
to be a special treat for all of us to hear a little bit about the golf
industry and it's impact in North Carolina and we'll share some, I
think, what's going to be some great stories. Before we get started, try
to make it official, we do have pages with us today. From the House we
have Ashley Sidden from Iredell County, Representative Brawley, see you
there somewhere? Okay. Christian Stouks, New Hanover County,
Representative Hamilton. Jane Nunn, Guilford County, Representative
Faircloth. And Vita Honeycutt, Wake County, Speaker Tillis. From the
Senate, Reeven Waters from, is it Moyock? Where is that? Don't I know
where that is? It's over yonder. There it is, down east, Representative
Cook. Alex McCray, Greensboro, Representative Berger. Thomas Barr, I'd
have to do it again, Chuccawindy? Did I get that co-, Chawkawingy[??]
works. Representative Cook, thank you sir. I'm gonna have to learn that
soon, aren't I? Gabriel Nutter, hometown Oxford, Senator McKissick.
Caroline Hauler, Clayton, Senator Rabin. Lance Coffee, Brewing, Senator
Soucek. Before we get started we've got Representative Jamie Boles here
and I want to thank you for being here but he's got to present a few
bills. The U.S. Open is on his home turf, literally. So I'd like to call
on Representative Boles for a couple comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, committee. There we go, good morning. First of all I think
it's an honor that North Carolina has been chosen for the third time to
hold the men's U.S. Open. We had it in '99 and 2005 and now the
historical event, both the men and women's that we're going to host in
Pinehurst in 2014. We're very honored that Pinehurst is featured on our
North Carolina, the official 2014 travel guide. I have copies up here
for you if you don't have any. I'd just like to welcome everybody to
Pinehurst and I, come down for the U.S. Open. I think Mr. ?? is going to
present some statistics on the U.S. Open. We anticipate 55,000 a day for
the men's and 25,000 a day for the women. So it's an honor to represent
Pinehurst. It's also a honor that golf plays an important economic
economy here in our state and we like to call Moore County home of golf,
the American golf, and welcome any time. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't have any tickets!
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you have room for how many of us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah when is the pre-party and after party. I want to know that. We'll
be looking for that invitation. Just let me, as Chair of Senate
Commerce, just briefly officially welcome you again and on a personal
note I have a passion for golf and I know many of our members, both
House and Senate, do. I just don't think I ever realized the impact that
it has. You see, everywhere you go you go by a golf course. Everywhere
you go you go by a golf course. A little personal story, any time I fly
I sit there and stick my head out and I'm just looking right there out
the window and I'm trying to identify golf courses. So it's in our blood
and North Carolina is in the forefront of the golf economy not only,
really, worldwide it is recognized. It's certainly recognized as one of
the biggest golf destinations in the United States and we've got a lot
to be proud of. I do want to thank our Commerce Depeartment for their
efforts to give the golf industry it's much deserved recognition as an
incredible economic engine and as a</p>

a driver in travel and tourism. They've done a wonderful job and I've
had dialogue with them and I appreciate it very, very much. So anyway,
thank you for being here. I think you're going to hear some great
stories today that should make you feel good about what we're doing in
North Carolina and how this industry is playing such an important part.
At this point in time, we really do have some great special guests. I am
going to call, by the way Chris Velori, Legislative Council for the
North Carolina Golf Alliance, has been very, very active in helping us
along to bring golf even further into the forefront and I do appreciate
it, Christ, your efforts. You've done a great job, thank you. At this
point in time I am going to call on Tim Kreger. If I got my notes right
Tim is the Executive Director of the Carolina's Golf Course
Superintendents and I'm going to allow you, Tim if you will, to
facilitate the presentations and I want to thank you, again, for your
service and your roll you're playing and we look forward to a great
event here, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Gunn, and all of you for taking the time to be here
with us this morning. My role is really facilitator. Not only in putting
the studies together but also in the presentations here today so I'll be
brief. We worked with the Stanford Research Institute and Golf 20/20, a
national golf organization out of Florida, to put together an economic
impact study. We did the first one in 2007 and then we updated it in
2011. The groups that were involved in that are all here today. Myself,
I'm with the Golf Course Superintendents' Association. We've also got
Mr. Brian Stiehler from Highlands Country Club, it's with the Golf
Course Superintendents'. You'll hear from David Lee who's at Hope Valley
Country Club in just a minute. We've got the Club Managers' Association
with Corrine Grimaldi, the Executive Director. Ken Kinka, who is the COO
at North Ridge Country Club and their legislative representative. We've
also got Del Ratcliffe who you'll hear from also later with the North
Carolina Owners' Association. Representatives that helped with the study
that couldn't be here were also the Carolina's Golf Association, Jack
Nance and his team and Ron Schmid with the Carolina's PGA section. But I
do want you all to understand, I'm not trying to steal anybody's thunder
here today. You're going to hear a lot of numbers but I think one of the
most important things you need to realize about the game of golf is that
it is an economic benefit to the state of North Carolina and there's
over 50,000 people who are employed by this game/sport. And a lot of
those people, I don't know the exact percentage but it's over 75%, don't
even play this game or sport. So it's a tremendous, tremendous asset to
the state, not only from the tourism side but also from the
manufacturing that goes on in this state and those families that provide
equipment throughout not only the country but the world. It all starts
right here in North Carolina. So without further ado I'm gonna turn it
over to David Lee who is the golf course superintendent at Hope Valley.
And I did forget, we do have another representative with us today, I
apologize. Turner Revels, who is the president and owner of Revels Turf
&amp; Tractor of Fuquay Varina. Been in the industry, very instrumental
in the John Deere brand for 40-plus years. His family, you make know the
name Quality Equipment, they distribute throughout North Carolina.
That's his family that does the agriculture side of John Deere as well
so it's important, we want to recognize Mr. Revels with us as well
today. David.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator, and thank you committee. As Tim said this is a
special opportunity for us int he industry to come out here and tell our
story, so to speak, and it's a really special day that we can sit at the
table with you guys and explain what we do, how we do it, and how we're
trying to help our industry and the state of North Carolina. I know
everybody's busy and got a ton of stuff on their plate so I'll go ahead
and get started. My portion of the presentation this morning is just to
kind of sum up our most recent economic impact that study that we did
with SRI in 2011. I think is 2011 data that's 2012 date. So this is post
the recession. I think if everybody , I'm not gonna highlight some of
the comparisons that we had from our earlier study in 2007. These
numbers are in your handout, your economic impact of golf handout that
you have, but out industry was not, as you may have guessed, was not
immune from the financial problems we encountered in 2008. So anyway,
let's get to see what golf is in North Carolina. First thing, as Tim
alluded to, it generates jobs. As Senator Gunn said, when you're driving
down the street and you see guys out there on lawn mowers, those aren't
the only jobs that golf creates. Golf creates</p>

<p id="10:00">
… jobs from a manufacturing standpoint, from a food and beverage
standpoint, from a travel/tourism standpoint. There are a lot of things.
I’m sure Caleb’s going to hit on some of the jobs that have been created
this week and next week and the coming weeks in Pinehurst. So one of the
big things it does is it creates jobs and a lot of them in our state. It
draws a lot of visitors to our state. I was down in Pinehurst with my
wife and Marsh, and it’s hard when you’re in the 19th hole, it’s kind of
hard to meet somebody from North Carolina. They’re from Canada, New
York, Florida, California. It’s kind of good to see a lot of guys’ trips
and couples coming in there enjoying North Carolina and the weather and
the golf and the comradery. It gives back to charitable causes. I think
everybody in here hopefully has played in a fundraising golf tournament
where there’s the local high school Rotary Club, the Jimmy V Foundation
for Cancer. The Duke Children’s Classic is another one. All levels of
golf provides that revenue to help charitable charities, and it also
provides a great pastime for anybody, any age, any skill level. It’s a
great way to go out, spend four hours, five hours, six hours with your
friends, your family, your son, your daughter, your wife, and it’s
really special out there because you don’t have a cell phone, you don’t
have a computer, you don’t have a phone ringing. Unfortunately it’s
becoming more commonplace on the golf course to see that. So we
challenged the SRI to see what the economic studies were, and not only
did we want them to just see what the facility impact was, but the
indirect and the direct impacts golf has on the economy, and we also
wanted to put in a comparison with some of the other industries in our
state, and if you look in the handout, in the first paragraph they’ll
have some other industries that we feel we’re very comparable to that
North Carolina is very well known for. The scientific R&amp;D industry,
we’re very comparable to that. I think we’re larger than the NASCAR
industry. Is that not correct? Everybody think that North Carolina’s the
home of NASCAR, and actually the golf industry is a larger industry.
We’re getting close to our ag. crop industry and also the electronics
components manufacturing, so we’re a real player in the state of North
Carolina. I think that’s important. On the other hand, there are a lot
of things that golf facilities, most of them, are recognized as small
businesses, so we’re impacted by certain environmental regulations that
come down. We’re also impacted by certain tax implications that may come
down, and I think it’s important for us as an industry to stand in front
of you guys and represent ourselves so when some of these policies are
brought up on the table that we can do a little give and take and have
some conversation where we give some and you guys give some and we can
all make it work, because we’re just trying, again, to have a voice at
the table and hold our own. So if you look at this graphic here, it kind
of describes what golf is, and the middle one on the top kind of is the
golf facility operations, and that’s what you see when you go down the
road. You see the guy out there on the mower, the snack bar so to speak,
the guy that’s working in the clubhouse, but then you start looking
around, “How did that place get built?” I’m a member at a country club
in Durham right down the road, and we just did a two and a half million
dollar project renovating a pool and a terrace, and that never would
have happened if those 500 members don’t like golf. And when we did that
project, we had local electrical contractors, building contractors, the
pool company’s from Greensboro. There were people from all over the
state that came in and participated in that. So that’s the indirect
benefit of what golf does for our business. We also have our major
tournaments. I’m going to defer to Caleb on that; he’ll have a lot
better information and more detail than I will. We also have our
golf-related suppliers – Dick’s Sporting Goods. The Bass Pro Shop sells
golf stuff. Golf Galaxy. All those places are generating income, putting
people to work in North Carolina, all for the benefit of golf. And then
we’re talking about the hospitality and tourism. Again, I’m going to
defer to Caleb on that, but there’s a lot of people coming in, and food
and beverage and everything revolving around the golf. And one thing we
haven’t touched on right now is the effect that golf has on real estate.
What’s the value of a house on the 18th green or three roads back from
the golf course? There’s a pretty significant difference on what
property owners are getting value for their property on that, so that’s
another benefit – indirect benefit – that the game has. So here’s some
hard numbers on revenues.</p>

<p id="15:00">
office of the operations revenues, 2011, 1.15 billion dollars. That's a
real number. Golf course capital investments, this may be some of our
pools, this may be rebuilding golf courses when we rebuild greens or we
re-, put in a new irrigation system, 86 million dollars. Golf related
supplies, you guys can read the numbers. Anyway, we get down to the
total, 2.3 billion dollars of revenues into the state of North Carolina
from the game of golf. So we have 556 golf facilities in the state of
North Carolina. We're estimating that there are almost a million trips
into North Carolina for golf-related purposes or involve golf, 250
million dollars in real estate development and added value, and then we
got our suppliers, our John Deere's of the world. We have some great
R&amp;D companies in the triangle, BASF, Bayer Crop Science, that are
based out of research triangle that have a big play, big part in our
golf research, ?? in Greensboro, they have a big R&amp;D facility there.
We're unique, Jacobsen out of Charlotte, we're just real unique with the
amount of big players in the golf industry that we have right in our
back yard. Again, we've talked about the retail. So how do we measure
the economic impact? And I'm not going to get in to this, I'm sure you
guys have seen plenty of these impact studies. Basically, total impact
is a function of our direct and indirect and induced, they use a RIMS
modeling system that, because I'm a golf course superintendent I'm not
versed in how they generate those numbers, but I think they're pretty
well accepted in the industry. So this is the result of their
indirect-direct numbers. You can see the bottom line. We already talked
about the direct 2.3 billion dollars but you include the indirect and
the induced numbers and you're getting a total number of about 4.2
billion dollars. And with that you're getting, as Tim said, almost
53,000 jobs that we're putting to work in the golf industry or is a part
of the golf industry. Total wages of 1.2 billion dollars. So all those
things combined is a significant impact on what golf is doing for this
state. And this is just kind of a summary slide. Our 2.3 billion dollar
golf industry supports 4.2 billion dollars of a total impact on the
state of North Carolina. 53,000 jobs and 1.3 billion dollars in wages.
If you're interested in the text in the handouts you can compare those
to some of our other industries that are thought out or probably a
little more in the forefront. With that, I'll entertain any questions
any of you might have and if there are no questions I'll introduce Del
Ratcliffe from the North Carolina Golf Course Owners Association. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, thank you so much David. Let's see if I can get here, into
mine. Well first of all I want to tell you I am excited to be able to
come up and speak with you about one of my favorite topics, golf. So
thank all of you very much for your time. We've heard a lot of numbers.
We've heard about the economic impact. The things that I'm going to be
talking to you about today, very briefly, are the people that are part
of golf. The business of golf and the courses that make up golf here and
collectively we are golf and golf has a great heritage in North
Carolina. We're definitely really ingrained within the culture of the
state. So to give you, kind of a more personal look at what golf really
is and what it means to each and every one of us, I'm going to take just
a few minutes here to go through some of the things about it. First of
all, the people. You may recognize Mr. Al Czervik here from the movie
Caddyshack and we certainly have people like this in golf. Golf has a
lot of colorful characters in the game. We do fight some kind of an
image battle out there sometimes, in terms of stereotypes. Golf
typically is not viewed by the people that don't play the game as what
it truly is. In fact most people, when you mention golf to them, they
tend to think about the PGA Tour and events like the Wells Fargo
Championship, the Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, and even the
upcoming U.S. Opens that we're having down in Pinehurst. These
back-to-back Opens, which Caleb's going to talk about in just a few
minutes, are tremendous events. They're gonna be bringing world exposure
to our state and to the game of golf. But quite honestly, golf, this is
a part of golf but it's a lot more than just this. We actually have,
within our business, I mentioned some stereotypes here. Golf is viewed
as an elitist, rich man's game.</p>

<p id="20:00">
Not very open to the average person to play, but the reality is, many
average people do play golf. And it touches the LIVES of many more
people than what that typical stereotype does. In fact, our typical
customers are much more average people. They're average, economically,
and apparently, they don't have a lot more highly intelligent level than
the average person does have here. We see stuff like this quite commonly
on our property. So, you're much more likely to see an image like this
right here. Golf is certainly becoming much more open to the masses. We
have a lot more people playing the game. It is truly a family sport. And
in fact, in many ways, golf is a better family sport than some of the
others that we see out here. Now, think about that for just a minute.
The typical young people's sport these days involves the kids playing
some kind of an event on a field. It might be football, soccer,
something like that. The kids are out on the field. They are having a
good time. They're playing. The parents are up in the stands. Every now
and then, they're cheering for the kids. The parents are talking to each
other. The kids are interacting. But, in golf, we have a totally
different environment. In golf, you can go out and you can spend quality
time with the family. It doesn't matter what the age differences are. It
doesn't matter what the skill levels are. You can go out and you can
have a good time. I often tell--if you go up and tell a family, &quot;If
you go out and you go play golf, with a young man or young woman, by the
third hole, you're going to be having your arm around them. You're going
to be talking about them: what's interesting to them, what things do
they like. By the sixth hole, you're going to know how they are doing in
school: what classes do they like, what teachers are being good to them.
By the twelfth hole, you are going to know who the boyfriend or the
girlfriend is. And by the time you come off that eighteenth green,
you're going to have a friend. Now, I challenge you to find any other
sport that you can find that in. And it is inherent in golf. North
Carolina is a broad state, and a lot of people think that golf is owned
by big mega corporations, but that's not really true. Many of our owners
are mom-and-pop type operations--just small business owners, like Hilda
Sloan, who owns The Links at Cotton Valley. He have Mr. Charlie--I'm
going to have to look at my notes here--Mr. Charlie Walker owns Beau
Rivage down in Wilmington. A lot of our courses are owned by
multigenerational families, where even second and third generation
members of the family are still operating the family business. This is
true of Kelly Miller down in Pinehurst, Mr. Scott Knox at Verdict Ridge
in Lincoln County, and also, Mr. Mark Hagel of Mountain Aire. And
Mountain Aire is actually up in Ashe County. I think gravity must be
affecting his star--something on this map--because it is a little bit
higher than that right there. But these are small businesses that are
all across the state and they have a tremendous impact on the economy of
North Carolina, as we just saw from that economic impact study. And it
goes beyond just the golf courses. We mentioned Mr. Turner Revels and
his business that he has here, but we also have a John Deere
manufacturing facility that manufactures turf equipment for the industry
right down at Fuquay-Varina. Charlotte is headquarters to Jacobson Turf
Equipment, which manufactures turf equipment into the golf industry and
is distributed all across the world. And it is headquartered right here
in our state of North Carolina. Also, in Charlotte, we have Smith Turf
and Irrigation: the largest ?? distributor in North America. And so the
impact of these businesses go far beyond what people normally realize
within golf. But at the same time, golf, as a business, presents some
challenges. We have a very unique business that's highly affected by the
weather. In some instances, we're really just glorified farmers. And if
it's raining or if it's cold out, people don't play golf, but the bills
keep coming. We still have to pay our power bills. We still have to pay
our light bills. We still pay our tax bills. So, all of these things
still continue, but in our business--it is a very difficult business at
times for us to manage. And it's a complex business. The management of
the golf course, itself, can be highly complex in nature. The average
superintendent today has to be more than just somebody that cuts the
grass. They have to be part engineer. They have to be part scientist.
They have to be part artist to achieve all the things that they have to
achieve, and they do it--these men and women that do this, do it on a
budget that is very highly dependent on what the weather is. It is very
difficult to budget based on what the weather is going to do twelve
months from now. But we're often forced with having to do something like
that. And so I wanted to talk about the difficulties of this business
and just give you a little idea of what we face from the standpoint of
operations. In the golf business, we also have a food service component.
This can range anywhere from a snack bar to a full-service sit down
restaurant in our club houses. So, we're in the restaurant business, as
well. Our pro shops are really and truly retail stores, and we're faced
with all the challenges that the typical retailer has, in terms of
merchandising, displaying, stocking, reordering--all of those
things--inventory control. They all come into play in the retail
operation that comprises our pro shops. And all of this is before we get
to what our real core business is, which is selling rounds of golf at
the counter, just like this. So, I just wanted to let you know that the
typical golf course operation is very complex. It's a lot more involved
than a lot of us tend to realize. But at the same time, we love our
business. We all love what we do. And there is a true passion within our
industry for what we do</p>

<p id="25:00">
And any time we have the opportunity to talk about it in front of a
group like this, I’m highly appreciative of that. Now there is something
that I want to mention to you. In our business, it’s very unique in a
lot of ways. Every golf course is unique. There are no two golf courses
that are alike out there and they vary all over the map, and in today’s
world there’s kind of a move towards standardization, trying to come up
with a one-size-fits-all-type strategy for things. In our business,
one-size-fits-all is not a good idea, and I want to thank this
particular legislative committee for posing for this picture of a
recent… up at Lake Lure, they were on a retreat up there and everything.
In our business, we have to schedule very tightly. We’re kind of like
airlines in the fact that we only have a certain amount of product that
we can sell at a certain given point of time, and in the airline
business if a plane takes off and it’s got empty seats, you can’t sell
those seats. If we lose a tee time in golf we can’t sell that tee time,
and we do it in lots of four, so we so it four at the time, so there are
challenges to this business. Golf courses themselves contribute a lot to
our environment, the environment that we’re in. You might be surprised
to know that golf courses are really fresh air machines. In fact, the
typical 18-hole golf course produces enough oxygen to support between
five and seven thousand people. That means the almost 600 golf courses
that we have here in North Carolina produce enough oxygen to support
over ten percent of our population. Now as an industry, we’re in favor
of breathing. We want you to know that, so we’re happy to support that.
Another thing that’s an interesting statistic is gold courses are huge
water filters. People don’t realise this but the turf actually acts as a
natural bio-filter. There are studies that show that golf courses clean
the water, and I’ve got quotes from the ?? Society where they’ve gone in
and looked at golf courses and determined that water filtering through
the turf grass on a golf course is actually cleansed of a lot of the
contaminants that it has even as it falls as rain water, so by the time
it gets down to the aquifer, the water’s in a much purer condition than
what it was when it first fell. This one is something that’s really kind
of interesting too. My text didn’t come up really good on this, but a
golf course is an air conditioner, and I’ve got a real specific quote
that I want to read to you right here too. “A University of Manchester
study’s calculated that a mere ten percent in the amount of green space
in built-up centers would reduce urban surface temperatures by as much
as 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit. This 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit drop in
temperature, which is equivalent to the average predicted rise through
global warming by the year 2080, is caused by the cooling effect of
water as it evaporates into the air from leaves and vegetation through a
process called transpiration.” So golf courses actually help to cool
areas in which they’re located. Another thing, and if you play golf you
know this, but if you don’t play golf, you don’t really realize this.
Golf courses are refuges for wildlife. We are truly wildlife habitats.
There’s deer, rabbits, foxes, squirrels, snakes. My daughter, who is
actually in school right now – she’s going to pharmacy school down at
Campbell – she serves sometimes for us and works at one of my courses as
a beverage cart girl, and she will testify that there are plenty of
snakes out there on the golf course, and as a matter of fact, she said
to me, she said “Why in the world do you want to tell them we’ve got all
those animals out there?” But they do. Golf courses are home to a large
number of wildlife. [SPEAKER CHANGES] They’re not all crawling on the
ground either. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s right. They’re not all crawling
on the ground. We have birds, we have all kinds of wildlife out there,
and a golf course is one place where you will actually see nature.
You’ll see wildlife out there living, interacting, eating, playing on
the golf course in the same space that humans are out there doing the
same thing. They’re actually having a good time out there playing golf,
and you’ll see creatures just like this deer out there on the golf
course, interacting with humans in a way that’s very unique and you
don’t see it in a lot of places. So the bottom line on this is golf,
it’s good for all of us. It doesn’t matter whether you play the game or
not, golf is good. It’s good for our economy, it is definitely
intertwined within our culture here in North Carolina, and it is
something that all of us benefit from whether we realize it or not.
Thank you again for the time that you’ve given us today, and I’d like to
bring up Mr. Caleb Miles now to talk about the back-to-back US Opens
that we’re having down in Pinehurst next week. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Dale. I had one question for you. The typical golf course is how
many holes? [SPEAKER CHANGES] 18 holes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Please don’t
tell my wife. She thinks there is a 19th hole. As a matter of fact,
other day we finished, I told her I was going to go to the bar with the
guys. She said “Well you ain’t going to come home drunk, are you?” I
said “Well where do you want me to go?”</p>

<p id="30:00">
Again, I'm Caleb Miles, I'm from Moore County, and thank you Senator
Gunn, thank you. Following Del is always tough because you're always
going to learn something. And as long as I've been involved in working
with the golf industry, I've always learned something new from him. And
that's one of the great things about the game, it's that it's so dynamic
and each course is different. You know, in next week, we get to start to
celebrate a pretty amazing event: The US Open championships. With an
&quot;s&quot; on the end. We've never been able to say that before. It's
two events, back to back, and my job is to tell you a little bit more
about that, answer any questions that you have on the upcoming events.
Some background: A lot of you probably have heard this, but I'm just
going to run it down real quickly. Again, first time back-to-back men's
and women's opens. It's the -- you can see the third US Open since '99,
we've had three since '96 at nearby Sutton Pines at Pine Needles. Two
weeks -- now here's some key numbers here.  Four hundred thousand
spectators over the two week period.  Let me put that into perspective:
If you have a football game going on at NC State or Carolina, a full
stadium, you'd have four of those taking place consecutively to cover
the Men's Open for the championship rounds. If you had a football game
at Duke, and had four of those consecutively - Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday, full stadium - you add that into the picture. And then
you add the rounds of a stadium that's about half full for the practice
rounds. That's how many people are going to be at the Open championship
the next two weeks. I don't know of a larger professional sporting event
that's ever taken place in North Carolina. It may be no one's come -
we've sort of put the challenge out. If you know of it, let us know,
then we'll say we're the second largest. Right now we're going to claim
the first in terms of total attendance in people and impact and when we
get to that in just a minute. Sixty-five hundred volunteers. Tell you a
real quick story, it was in California doing a preview of a championship
in San Francisco, and I ran into some folks in Los Angeles who were -
and I asked them what they were doing there, what was the purpose of
their visit, and they said &quot;Volunteers&quot;, and I said
&quot;Volunteers? What do you mean?&quot; &quot;We're recruiting
volunteers.&quot; They were having a Senior Open Championship, which was
about the size of a Women's Open championship, and they were going all
the way to San Francisco to get volunteers to come down to LA to
volunteer. Do you know when the volunteer list filled up for the US Open
here in North Carolina? Almost a year before the event even took place.
It's a testament to North Carolina, and the love of golf, but the
willingness to volunteer and help out for their state.
I'm going to talk about the economic impact here in just a minute.
Talked about the largest sporting event, I had to put it in writing up
there. Visitor spending: One hundred and five million dollars in direct
spending by the people who are going to be here for the two weeks. These
are estimats, and I'm going to talk about how in just a second how we're
going to verify all this information after the fact. The total estimated
economic impact: A hundred sixty-nine million dollars for the two weeks,
Men's and Women's open. Now never before in a US Open or Womens' Open
have we verified those numbers after the fact. With the USGA, we kept
asking the United States Golf Association if that's something they could
do - they started doing it a couple of years ago, and that's going to
happen at  this event. There'll be kiosks located throughout the US Open
Championships, so if you attend I encourage you to go there and use the
kiosks and there are a series of questions to measure it. But here's
what we did, we went one step further. The kiosk program is put together
by a Canadian company, out of Vancouver. We didn't feel like it did
really full justice to what we needed so we recruited some of the smart
people of North Carolina, in particular Dr. Gene Brothers from NC State
University to help us make that study even better, and we put some
resources together to have even a better study. So when that's done,
we're really going to be able to report to you the full impact of the
event.
Hosting: Just real quickly on this, the United States Golf Association
runs the show. Theres some confusion -  some people think it's the PGA,
it's not. It's the United Stats Golf Association and they run thirteen
national championships, the US Open Men's is the largest one, and then
they run other ones: Women's, Seniors, and on down the line every year.
The people who do that for those championships are located in Moore
County, their offices are actually there. The USGA's main offices is in
New Jersey. The USGA took a risk by putting the championships back to
back, and their real motto is &quot;It's two championships, one
event.&quot; So they're running it seamlessly, there's some economy to
scale, but they're not making any extra money, the main motivation for
doing the event is, and they've been saying this over and over, is that
they really want to showcase the Women's -- the quality of the Women's
game by playing on the same-- at the same venue as the men. And I think
you're going to see that.

<p id="35:00">
of the next two weeks come true. The U.S. Open is a North Carolina
event, and let me assure you it could not happen in Moore County if we
just put up fences around Moore County and said everything's here.
Between the housing, the food and beverage, the corporate support, all
that has to be in place for North Carolina to have an event like the
U.S. Open Championships. Here's just some quick numbers, we'll have, the
core block in Moore County will have about 30,000 room nights consumed.
The spectators, media, and volunteers, about another 60,000. So almost
100,000 room nights generated as a result of the U.S. Open. All at a
premium rate. We get a little bit of heat for our room rates being too
high. We've had to work real high to keep those down but it's the old
supply and demand factor. So we've worked really hard over the last
couple years to try to help make sure people have a place they can stay
at a good rate. I've got to talk about private home rentals and the
importance of it. In Moore County, thousands of homes will be rented
which lets people stay there and not have to travel further distance. I
want to thank all of you, in particular Representative Boles and Senator
Tillman, for helping the recent legislation that passed to help us deal
with the sales tax and occupancy tax issue related to private home
rentals. Logistics. People tell us, and I've been to a lot of U.S.
Opens, the transportation system as a U.S. Open here in North Carolina
and in Moore Country is the best, bar none. When I recently went to San
Francisco to the U.S. Open, I had to park at Candlestick Park. I had to
walk about 15 minutes around the lot to get on a bus. I had to go
through security, which took about another 20 minutes. Then it took
about 45 minutes to finally get to the site. Ours, from the minute you
get in to one of the two parking lots, by the time you get off the bus
and go in to the main gate it's going to be somewhere in the
neighborhood of about a third of that, half to a third of that, in terms
of total time. So, a big difference. So it actually is, being a small
town, helps because we have a lot more space. We don't have the
congestion that a Washington D.C. or a New York City has, and the USG
likes that. The USG likes to be able to set things up their way and this
is kind of, this is the place, really, that's pretty special to them. By
the way, you probably know the answer but I'm going to ask you anyway.
What community, what golf course, what open, holds the record for the
largest attendance ever at a men's open? Any Guesses? Pinehurst, 2005. A
lot of people are surprised by that. No it's got to be New York, it's
got to be-, well they can't because the infrastructure and available
footprint to put the event on is too small. We have the largest
footprint. That Pinehurst can close two courses and it doesn't affect
them. Just real quickly some of the things we're trying to do a little
bit better are to you, we're going to have some ambassadors there, Moore
County Airport has been upgraded. We actually bring in a temporary tower
for air traffic control it's so busy there but they'll have that there.
They have to do that. So a lot of things going on. A lot of events
taking place in the evenings, both in Pinehurst and Southern Pine, so if
you're there we encourage you to take advantage of those. Media
coverage. Some people ask what's the most important thing. When it's all
said and done this actually may be as important as the dollars I talked
about, 44 hours of live TV coverage, NBC and ESPN. NBC, this is the last
year that they will present the USGA package of events on television.
Fox will take over next year. So it's kind of a neat opportunity for
them to  say farewell but do a super job of presenting the championship,
150 countries. So for commerce, what better way to send a message to
countries around the world about what a great place North Carolina is to
visit and do business than have it broadcast for you in 44 hours of live
coverage in those 150 countries? 2,000 media credentials will be issued.
Down on the lower right hand side is what the media tent looks like.
It's pretty amazing. What they did is they took about 8 of the tennis
courts out of commission at Pinehurst resort and just put this tent on
top of the tennis courts. So that's where it takes place. One of the
behind-the-scenes secrets. Merchandise pavilion, this was the week
before they stocked it. They stocked it last holiday weekend, the end of
May, 40,000 square feet, 50 cashier stations, the average person will
take 12 1/2 minutes to walk through the championship. The average
person, some people will take even more time and I kind of kid about it,
as people walk out $1,000 in the left hand, $1,000 in the right hand.
It's not unusual if people spend that much money because what they do is
they come with lists from their friends of stuff they need to buy. 500
logo items, 50 different vendors, and they change it over for the
Women's Open and they change the apparel appropriately because they have
more purchases for women. I'm winding down here, I just want to mention
a couple other things. We really wanted to try to leverage the U.S. Open
a little bit better this time. In '99 and '95 we just</p>

... kind of hosted it. Pinehurst Resort had a bigger role in running it.
So we asked our community, what are some things we can do to try to
leverage the US Open, and one was talent recruitment, so we created an
entity called Moore Alive, which talks about the quality of life in
Moore County and why you might want to live there, and then Moore
Forward, which has to do more with entrepreneur development. So we’re
real excited about those two programs and if you’re interested in that
from a commerce perspective, let us know. We’d be happy to share that
information with you. Here’s some resources. The good news is the Men’s
Open is almost sold out in the championship rounds. Thursday still has
tickets available. We have information. The USGA as a great website,
USGA.org, and now also the usopen.org, and homeofgolf.com is our site
for housing, golfing, dining, etcetera. And following me is going to be
Wit, I think. Is it Wit? Is Wit up next? Wit Tuttell. And Wit is, I’m
sure you all know, he does a terrific job for North Carolina tourism,
and Wit’s going to tell you a little bit more about how they’re
leveraging the US Open to make sure that the effect afterwards is
significant as much as it is during the event. Do we want to wait for
questions or take questions now? Any questions? Thank you. Appreciate
your time. Wit? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll get this going. I’m just going to
talk a little about how we do golf tourism marketing for the state.
Thank you, I’m Wit. I’m the Executive Director of the Division of
Tourism. So I want to talk a little about how we market the state for
golf. Of course, we are the division of tourism, so our purpose is to
get more people – to get them to come here, stay, spend more money and
then leave, as they will do with the tournament, so that’s always great.
We really do that through leveraging partnerships, and that’s why it was
great that Caleb introduced us, because we don’t just want people to
think “I want to go to North Carolina.” We want them to book a room in
Pinehurst because that’s where the economic impact comes. That’s a big
part of what we do, is work with those partners throughout the state.
Every county has a tourism office and we work with all of them –
Pinehurst, Southern Pines, Aberdeen. CVB is a great partner that Caleb
runs. Just as an overall impact on tourism, from 2013, tourism is a 20.2
billion dollar industry in the state, and that’s just direct spending.
Nearly 200 thousand jobs, and of course it brings a lot of tax revenue
back into the state. We tend to typically work in our area with the
state with out-of-state visitors because they’re spending is higher when
they come in rather than in-state visitors. It’s a real good synergy we
have here because a lot of the county tourism offices focus a lot of
their dollars and their efforts on in-state visitors, so then we assist
them with them leveraging their resources to generate out-of-state
travel, and as you can see, one of the big keystones for North Carolina
is that we have so many different offerings for people to do. One of the
great features of North Carolina is our diversity, and I tell you, we’re
the envy of so many other states, and this is a chart of what people do
when they come to North Carolina, and there’s no other state in the
county that has as many options and activities for people to do, and
golf is a big important part of that. We don’t want to become a
monoculture where people come here just for one thing because if that
one thing goes away, that has a serious impact on your ability to
leverage visitors, so the beauty of North Carolina is we have a lot of
different things that people like to do, and golf is one of them. We as
the Division of Tourism work with those partner industries throughout
the state to talk about helping them spend their money, so we look a lot
at how they spend their dollars and invest them, because primarily what
we do are co-op activities where we leverage their funds and our funds
and put them together to get further along, and in that way, we leverage
our 3 million dollar advertizing budget and turn it into 9 million
dollars in advertizing to spend, and part of that we’re doing is on the
US Open. One of the biggest things we do is draw people to our website,
visitnc.com. It generates about 4 million unique visitors a year, and
what we’re real proud of is it gets about 1.2 million downstream
traffic, and so that would be people coming to Visit NC to plan for
things like the open, and then going and booking a room in Pinehurst or
researching a restaurant, those kinds of things. So we’re real proud of
that. We have a whole special section up on Visit NC for the open and
are promoting it in several different ways, and I wanted to talk some
about our golf travel marketing, how we market golf in the state. We
have a big challenge. A lot of people have heard of the Robert Trent
Jones Golf Trail in Alabama – I’m sure many of you have heard of that –
and we get a lot of questions about that. We actually spend more money
on golf marketing than the state of Alabama does. Unfortunately, the
Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail is owned by the Alabama Retirement System,
which also owns Raycom Television. Raycom owns 53 different television
stations, including some operations in Charlotte, and they give that
golf trail 12 million dollars in free advertizing every year, so we
don’t…</p>

<p id="45:00">
have that luxury. What we have to do is leverage the funds we have to
get as much exposure as possible. So I'm going to talk about that a lot,
and i agree with Caleb 100%, one of the most important things about this
event is, there's the economic impact but there's also the media
leverage that we have and that the eyes of the world will be focused on
it. And that's important for us, not just for tourism, but also as part
of the Department of Commerce, that's important how we film it as well.
So as it was already mentioned we put the golf on the cover of our
travel guide, our annual travel guide. There's 600,000 copies of those
go out every year and we also do golf sweepstakes in our regular
marketing. We do about $200,000 worth of marketing every year for golf.
We have a website dedicated specifically to golf that mentions every
course in the sate and so we're proud of all those efforts. I'm going to
talk a little more. We, you won't see us on the NBC broadcast and that's
because it is very expensive and NBC makes a lot of money but that's
part of the big impact that it has. So what we're going to do is find
ways to leverage around the edges of this event to get our exposure. One
of the things we do is an in-state marketing campaign with the North
Carolina Print Association and the North Carolina Association of
Broadcasters, and you'll see there are two ads up top that will run.
They'll run in newspapers throughout the state and they'll also run in
radio and television and we're actually adding a piece that you'll see
on the highways coming up soon with the North Carolina Outdoor Media
Association. So that, what you''ll see across the bottom there is a
billboard that's going to run on some of the major highways. And the
idea there is to leverage the aspect of our website can help people get
away and find ways to get away and do great things and play golf. Now,
that's a wonderful program for us. We get a 10-to-1 return on investment
for those spots, which are essentially PSA's that are run by the
Broadcast Print and Outdoor Media Associations. We'll also do a lot of
digital advertising. What we found is that we can leverage our golf
experience easier and more cost effectively by using other things other
than direct golf media, such as NBC.com, which is very expensive. We use
things like Amazon.com, find people when they're actually searching for
golf products so we know we've got a qualified customer there, that's
somebody that really loves golf and we'll put a digital ad in those type
of spaces. So primarily the way we advertise are on Fox Sports, PGA.com,
places like the Bleacher Report, and Yahoo Sports. These are places that
generate a lot of sports fans, a lot of golf fans, but they don't bring
the high cost of advertising that a place like NBC would. So we'll be
doing a lot of that, about $200,000. We also do some new, we're trying
some new advertising, contextual advertising, with a group called
Contera[??] and so what that will be is when you're on a website and you
notice sometimes the text is highlighted, if you click on that text
you'll see a video ad and you'll get to run, take a look at our video. I
wanted to real quick show you our golf video and this is really the way
we market North Carolina golf. If I can get it to run. Let's try to get
some sound.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[ADVERTISEMENT]
Golf, it's a game of great odds. You don't just play the other golfers,
you play against yourself, you play the natural surroundings, you play
the course designer, the greens keeper, and the rules of the game.
Taking on these odds in North Carolina is a unique experience. When you
play amidst stunning beauty the game begins to change. The course
invites you to conquer it. Picturesque views inspire you. The challenge
becomes enjoyment and successes become stories. From the highest
mountains in the east to the warm winds on the coast, you'll find great
golf that's out of the ordinary. If you're looking for beauty, it's
everywhere. If you're looking for challenge, you'll find it. When you're
ready to play golf on a higher level, look to North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So that's the way we leverage the state's beauty for golf, and that's
really our brand and we're trying to sell more and more of that. I
wanted to talk specifically about the Opens and what we're doing there
and that's really a partnership of the whole entire Department of
Commerce. What we're doing is we're spending about $500,000 on a
hospitality area. We're going to bring in about 150 international and
domestic corporate executives and we're gonna showcase the state. We're
gonna have meetings there, we're gonna try and use it for an opportunity
for business development. We're gonna bring in about 50 international
tour operators, travel agents, and</p>

. . . journalists to have them come back and do stories about the whole
State. We're bringing those writers, not just to Pinehurst, but we're
sending them also to the mountains, to the coast, and throughout the
State, and in those ways, we hope to leverage this opportunity and that
boosts us in partnership with the Research Triangle Park Organization
and also the Pinehurst CBD. So we want to bring a lot of people in, and
use this time to leverage and market, and also use this group as a focus
group as we continue to brand the State to find out what their
perceptions are of the State, and to encourage them to develop more
businesses here.
That's really our plan for the Open from a tourism standpoint, and I
don't know if Chris wanted to come up - has it finished - or if we can
answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for the presentation. I know the Senate goes
into a session at 11:00, so I wanted to see if any members of the Senate
had any questions or comments about the presentation we've heard. I
think it's pretty remarkable. We do a lot of important things here in
the General Assembly, but it's also good to look at the fun things that
happen in our State that have an economic impact, like the Golf Industry
with the over five hundred and fifty courses that we have, and almost
seventy thousand jobs that are supported. It's about a two-and-a-half
billion dollar economy that we're talking about here, so this is not a
small subject that has an economic impact on our State. Many of our
districts have residential communities that have golf as the center hub.
I know my district with Prestonwood Country Club - it's really changed
the landscape of that area and the Triangle. So if any member has any
questions or comments . . . I appreciate the presentations that we've
heard today and I look forward to a successful event next weekend. And
with that, this meeting is adjourned.</p>
