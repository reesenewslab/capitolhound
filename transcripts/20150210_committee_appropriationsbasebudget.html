  Swansboro, Senator Brown. Ben Marklune from Roxboro. Senator Brock.
Moxville, pardon me, I read it correctly but it was written down wrong.
And Connor Simmond from Charlotte. Senator Hartsell, thank you for being
here. I hope you have a good week this week. Today we&#39;re here to
hear the gas tax portion of the bill that was rolled out this morning,
Senate Bill 20, and we will welcome Senator Rabin to the podium to
explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. Members, good afternoon. I will go through this
again. Many of you heard my spiel this morning but we&#39;ll take
another stab at it. What the motor fuels tax changes, portion of this
bill, does is it immediately provides a tax cut of 2 1/2 cents per
gallon to the motor fuels tax. This effective date will be March of this
year. That is the long and the short. It is a 2 1/2 cents cut. As you
know, the motor fuels tax went up 1 cent to 37 1/2 cents January 1 of
this year. In making this cut, we will have to adjust the motor fuels
tax formula and that is what the next section, or section 2.3 of this
bill does. It does it in this way, it has a fixed or set tax rate of 17
1/2 cents plus a possible 17 1/2 cents, that would make 35 if that
happens. The other part is it would change the 7% variable rate to a
9.9% variable rate on the average wholesale price of gasoline over the
testing period, or over the period of the year. Another thing that this
bill does, and an important thing, is it sets the motor fuels rate once
a year rather than twice a year and it will be set annually on January
1st, rather than twice a year as it is set now, January 1st and July
1st. September 30 will remain the closing date for the year for the
readjustment come January 1. This bill will need adjustments of the
budget in the amount of $33M dollars, just a mathematical figure in the
highway trust fund, SAD, which comes out to a little over $8M and that
leaves us the remainder to come out of the Highway Fund and you can see
in the bill how those figures are arrived at in the Highway Fund.
That&#39;s the long and the short of it. It is very highly a technical
change to existing formula and the adjustment of the tax rate.
That&#39;s what it boils down to. So Madam Chair, I&#39;d be happy to
answer any questions from members of the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. Madam Chair, could we get staff to answer the
question what happens with the passage of Senate Bill 20 with this PCS?
What in happens year &#39;16-&#39;17, 2018 and 2019.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Ford. Chair recognizes Ms. Cameron.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Cameron. I serve on the transportation team on fiscal research. I
will direct you to a handout that you have. It should be on the bottom
of your packet and it is entitled &quot;The Comparison of February 2015,
Transportation Consensus Forecast and Senate Bill Changes to the Motor
Fuel Tax.&quot; The first part of this chart shows the current consensus
forecast and you can see it begins with the forecasted motor fuel tax
rates and it includes the revenues that are expected to be generated. On
the second part, includes what happens as a result of Senate Bill 20. So
the only changes from

  <p id="05:00">
  The forecast to the Senate bill changes, are to the motor fuel tax
rates, and to two lines, the motor fuel rate that is deposited into the
highway fund which is 75% of those revenues, and the remaining 25% to
the motor fuels tax line deposited in the highway trust fund. So if you
compare the tax rates, which I believe is your question sir, you can see
how those rates change. Again, the bill stipulates a 35 cent per gallon
rate. In the February forecast of course there is no cap or floor and
that rate is dependent on a 7% variable rate. If you move down to the
Senate bill 20 changes, that rate is reflective of a floor of 35 cent
plus a variable rate that changes from 7% to 9.9%. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Miss Cameron. Follow up, Senator
Ford? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair, I just want to make sure that I’m
reading this correctly. 2015, it appears that there’s a loss of revenue
of 33 million and looking at 16, years 2016, 17, 18 and 19, that to me
looks like a motor fuels tax increase. Is that correct? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Miss Cameron? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The forecast for 2016, under
the Senate Bill, has a rate of 35 cents. The staff does believe that
rate would be likely a little bit lower. Probably more around 34.8 cent
per gallon and that increases to 35 with the floor. Compared to the
forecasted rate that will go into effect next fiscal year, an average
rate of 30.4. I’m not going down that fox-hole. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up, I’ll go down that foxhole. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford for a
follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma’am. I appreciate the follow
up. This is a tax increase, Senator Rabin. And I respect your wording
and description of it, because in year one, it would be. But under,
without the change, the motor fuels tax would be at 30 cents. We’re
going to, with this change in the bill and I want to make sure I’m
correct, with this change we’re going to cap it at 35. So at its current
rate in 2016 it’s going to be 30, in 2017 it’s 31, in 2018 it’s 33 and
in 2019 it’s 34. So, by my comparisons and understanding in looking at
these numbers and I’ve looked at quite a few, this with all due respect
is a motor fuels tax increase. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. I
do take exception with what you’re saying. I will continue to call it a
tax cut, anytime you go from 37.5 to 35 from NC State, that is a cut.
And I will tell you that more than just that, what we are attempting to
do at the same time with this bill is to cut taxes on motor fuels,
stabilize the motor fuel and continue to have a flat line or a straight
line in our budgeting going forward for the department, for the
legislature and for the industry. It’s a very necessary step to take at
this time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Rabin. Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair. Senator Rabon, if as Senator
Ford wishes it happened that we drop that gas tax to 30 or 29 or
whatever, if we achieve what he wishes to do, what would be the impact
on transportation in North Carolina? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, we would
have to drastically slash our bridge program, which this bill holds
solid. We would have to address our contract resurfacing and maintenance
of our roads and we would by the end of the time period that Senator
Ford is talking about, we would have more than 800 million dollars
deficit in maintenance and improvements of highways throughout our
state. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Did you have a follow up? Senator Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. And can staff give me an
answer over the last three years, how many times has the General
Assembly changed the rate or the formula for the gas tax? I know the
floors

  Caps other that have gone forward. We&#39;re talking about forecasting
out over a five year period. What&#39;s been our history in the last
three years of leaving that alone for five years. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss
Cameron, fiscal research. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I
will start with January 2012 and give you the rates from there. In
January 2012 there was no cap or floor at the time and the rate was
$0.398 per gallon. Moving to July of 2012, the formula rate was $0.377
but the actual rate was $0.375 due to a cap being in place. On January
2013, the rate would have been $0.386 but again the cap applied at
$0.375. In July of 2013 there was no cap or floor and the rate increased
slightly to $0.376 per gallon. The rate also slightly increased starting
in October of 2013 due to legislative action but again a cap was in
place at $0.375 per gallon. Again, a cap was placed for this current
fiscal year beginning in July 2014, but the rate was lower than the
$0.375 so the rate from July to December of this past year was $0.365
per gallon and again it is now at the capped rate of $0.375 per gallon
and I will be happy to email this out to everyone since this is so many
numbers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Follow up, Senator Hise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And to follow on that, for the years 16, 17 and 18, what is the
expectation of the average cost of a gallon of gasoline for each of
those years. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Cameron? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;re
gonna get right back to you with that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ll come
back. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If they can give that information that&#39;s
fine, just make a quick comment on what it is. We&#39;re talking about,
I think obviously we&#39;ve seen that the likelihood of this not being
changed by the General Assembly as we adjust or move forward over five
years, to claim that this is a tax increase going forward assumes that
we will not continue our pattern of changing this rate as we have done
and that we hold to a steady increase of the cost of a gallon of
gasoline consistent over five years when in fact our history would show
us that that is a very volatile calculation that could move greatly
within a year or six month period. So quite frankly we have no idea what
the revenues would be going out forward and to claim that in some way
we&#39;ve raised those taxes ignores both of those purposes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You&#39;re correct, Senator Hise, and that&#39;s a point well
taken because this is an effort to stabilize and to know what we would
be doing at least through next January and with the volatility of oil
prices we&#39;re just looking at a fiscal wall and what we want to
prevent is the boom and bust that we have been through before and when
you see the changes in the Transportation Budget that pale changes in
the General Budget, you&#39;d better take notice and stand up and do
some kind of what the right think is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for
you comments Senator Hise and Rabin. Senator Tillman. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chairman. I wish I had a map of the United States,
Senator Ford, I would show you that only one state has more roads and
maintains more roads than the state of North Carolina, that being the
very large state of Texas. Now, since we have the second highest number
of roads and bridges that we have to maintain by state dollars, and
folks will tell you Senator as they do me, well, we have one of the
highest gas taxes in the nation, Senator. Many states finance their
roads with property taxes. We don&#39;t, and if you want to see a mess,
turn this thing over to the counties and it&#39;ll all be busted in a
year

  To fix this problem and this is a temporary fix, it&#39;s not a long
term fix. Those long term needs are billions of dollars that we&#39;re
not addressing right here. But to get stability and to get some kind of
a guarantee that it won&#39;t drop completely out of sight and that we
can&#39;t maintain, and that we can&#39;t build the bridges and so
forth, I think it&#39;s the only thing we can do. You call it a tax
increase, it may in time end up being that as you&#39;re trying to point
out. But you got to, when you&#39;re bleeding, you got to stop the
bleeding. I think this does a good job in doing that Senator. Thank You.
[speaker changes]
Thank you for your comment Senator Tillman. Senator Brown.
[speaker changes]
Thank you madam chairman. ?? Give us a little history on revenue coming
into the state on the gas tax in the last few years. With cars getting a
lot better gas mileage, it&#39;s made it more difficult I think for
transportation to fund projects because it&#39;s continuously dropped as
far as revenue goes. Also without this bill, what would it mean to
projects moving forward?
[speaker changes]
Well, without the bill a lot of the projects that have been put on the
current STIP will fall off. That&#39;s a given as revenues decrease,
projects go down. The really damaging thing and the worse thing that I
fear is that we would not be able to maintain our, and keep up with the
bridge program we started and with that contract resurfacing and taking
?? as Senator Tillman said of what we have of the federal government has
brought along and is sponsoring or endorsing legislation ?? that says we
are going to have to be above 40 even up to 54 miles per gallon and over
the past two years consumption of motor fuels in this state has
decreased, the number of car in the state has increased, the number of
miles driven in the state has increased. The damage to the roads and
bridges has increased but the motor fuels consumption has decreased.
We&#39;re in a catch 22 with that, and I think it is noteworthy too, to
bring before this group the fact that North Carolina in keeping with our
entire big picture package, is able to at this time cut this tax and it
will be cut through the rest of the year, at the same time that our
neighbors to the North and the South are raising their gas taxes. So
this again brings us in line with our neighbors as we&#39;ve been trying
to do with our corporate tax, our ?? tax and all the other taxes, so
working and looking at our whole tax package, I think this is a big plus
for the state.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Senator Rabon. Further questions or comments from committee.
