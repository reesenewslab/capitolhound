Good morning if you will take your seats I want to welcome everyone back
I hope you had a nice holiday. I didn't get exactly what i wanted at the
race track, but it was a good event and i appreciated all those that
participated. Our Sargent of arms we have Doug Harris, Martha Parish,
David Collins and Bob Rossen. Our agenda today, first thing we are going
to take up is house resolution 11-46. And Patsy will be handling this.
Patsy.[Speaker Changes]Thank you representative Johnson. Member of the
committee if you would look at your bill summary for the house simple
resolution 11-46. This is  to just set the date of Tuesday June 17th for
a vacancy election. That will be held on the house floor that day. The
house had elected you might remember last march William Collins Jr to be
one of the house members of the state board of community colleges. And
he resigned to take a job with a commerce department on December 6th
2013. So therefore the house needs to fill his vacancy on the state
board of community colleges for the remainder of the unexpired term,
which ends June 30th 2019. And your summery just goes through those
statutory procedure. The speaker of the house has selected the house
education committee to handle this elections. SO once you pass this
resolution off the floor of the house then staff will send to each
member of the house a nomination form and also the directions. And you
will have until June the 4th at five pm, to get your nominations into
the house of principal clerks office. As you know your nominees will
need to complete a statement of economic interest form and send that
into the state ethics commission, also about five pm on June Fourth.
This committee will then meet again on June the tenth to review your
slate of nominees. And to vote on which nominees are all nominees to
send to the floor for the June seventeenth election. If you have any
questions please let me know. Thank you. [Speaker Changes] Do we have
any questions? Yes go ahead [Speaker Changes] Formation at the
appropriate time Madame chairman.[ Speaker changes] I have a motion for
a favorable report, all those in favor say &quot;I&quot;. All apposed?
Resolution passes.We are now going into House bill 10-40. Improve
administrative program, monitoring for DIP and Representative Julie
Howard will be presenting.Representative Howard would you like to do
your little technical amendment?[Speaker Changes] Yes Mame i would like
to send fourth the technical amendment please. And I will ask staff to
explain it if members have there copies.[Speaker Changes] Kara McCrawl
?? [Speaker Changes] The technical amendment simply is to correct a
drafting error we were being redundant and repeating the superintendent
instructions title twice. Just need to remove that so it will read in
conformity with the rest of the statue. [Speaker Changes] Do we have any
questions about that? Representative Horn most favorable report. All
those in favor say &quot;I&quot; All opposed &quot;No&quot;? OK it
passes. And the amendment passes. And representative Howard you have the
floor. [Speaker Changes] OK thank you Madame Chairmen.As many of you
know the program evaluation does a lot of studies and research for
various departments and reports. And i look out and see that there are
several folks on this committee that are also a member of the program
evaluation. And this bill stems from one of the</p>

<p id="05:00">
reports that program evaluation did for us. And basically what it will
do is based upon the findings and recommendations of the program
evaluation division, we can save about 19 million dollars annually. And
also another 6.1 million in one-time savings. The bill does about five
different things but it improves the school bus efficiency. If the
budget folks would decide that facing down the buffer in the budget
rating formula used to allocate state funding from 10% to 5% until
fiscal year 18-19, this will result in 19.3 million dollars in annual
cost savings when it's fully implemented. The bill requires DPI to
conform its school bus funding formula to the recommendations of a 205
consultant study of transportation required by the general assembly.
Secondly, limiting the statewide inventory of spare buses 10% of
regularly used buses and in 2012-13, the inventory data suggests that
the sale of 996 unnecessary buses would generate 3.1 million dollars in
one time revenues. The third thing is reducing the school bus
replacement part inventory levels maintained by the local education
authorities, the LEAs. For example limiting the average days of
inventory to 30 for very high valued parts would result in an estimated
reduction of 3 million dollars in state funding. Another piece would be
requiring statewide term contracts for certain school bus replacement
parts and amending state law to require the LEAs to purchase school bus
replacement parts with term contracts unless a lower price can be
obtained. Another piece would be improving the compliance with the
school bus safety inspections and scheduled maintenance by using
available information to improve the state inspection process. Another
piece in the bill that the textbook services program staffing level
would be reduced and the warehouse space which is not necessarily at
this point would also be reduced. Another piece in there would be
determine the cost effectiveness and continued need for the school
facility consulting services provided by DPI. Ensure the LEAs have
workers compensation programs that are designed to minimize the program
cost and establish an effective performance management system for
administrative services. Basically this is a cost savings provision that
has been recognized and found by the program evaluation division, where
we can utilize our budget dollars more effectively. Madame Chairman,
that completes my report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative ??.
I did not make the announcement that this bill is for discussion only.
Although I do wish that we would go ahead and thoroughly go ahead and
discuss this bill as we will eventually be voting on it. And it does
have a serial referral to finance so we will be voting not long down the
road. Do we have any questions? Yes, go ahead, Representative Shepherd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair. Representative Howard, I see
here that you say DPI will also direct and eliminate certain textbook
service positions. And I saw in the Governor's budget that he's
allocating more funds in his budget to buy textbooks. Is that any sort
of a conflict or did you all find in your studies that perhaps these
were unneeded positions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well we found in the study at
that time was that we were overstaffed, and the space was, we had leased
space that was not being properly utilized.</p>

And as you know now, everything is geared toward the technology of
having most of the information on the iPads and that sort of think as
opposed to having hard copy textbooks. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that sufficient Representative Shepherd? Representative Lucas:
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair.  Having had the opportunity to
have sat in on program evaluation, I will share with you that some parts
of the bill were a bit contentious and somewhat controversial,
especially as it relates to Sections 3 and 4.  So I'm happy to note that
we won't be taking a vote on this today.  I don't know if your plans are
to allow any public comment from agencies or individuals, but if so, I
think some members of the state board may want to speak. [speaker
changes] Thank you representative Lucas.  Representative Glazier.
[speaker changes] Thank you very much Madam Chair.  I appreciate also
hearing from folks.  I've got three questions please.  One is on the
textbook section, Representative ??.  I start off saying, I agree with
portions of this bill very much.  I've got two sections that cause me
some concern and I apologize to you, I had scheduled a meeting with
program staff, but when my granddaughter was born, I canceled that
meeting and I have not rescheduled it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As you should.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am sorry that I didn't ask these in advance.  My
first question is on the textbooks, several of those positions I thought
were dedicated to deal with Braille and EC issues.  So my question is, I
wonder if they are fundable in designation because I'm not sure those
positions, even though we've reduced the textbooks ought to be replaced.
 I'm wondering if that discussion came up in committee or how you might
respond. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chairman, we have some of the research
folks from program evaluation if you ??? your questions. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Certainly ???, I believe we have Chuck ??? here, could you
answer that Chuck?  We actually do what to hear from you, we'll find you
a mike. [SPEAKER CHANGES} I'm lead evaluator on this project, our
understanding is that there are ten positions currently assigned to the
textbook services program and that these positions are responsible for
processing orders from LEA's for adopted textbooks and that they are
associated with the purchase and distribution of hard copy textbooks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Follow up please [SPEAKER CHANGES} Follow up [SPEAKER
CHANGES} And I understand that and I wonder if maybe this is one of
those which is why it a good bill for discussion which we can talk about
later with staff and Representative Howard.  If a couple of those are
designated and have speciality areas of Braille and working on materials
for the deaf, not sort of easily exchangeable.  Maybe we can look at
those positions. Would that be acceptable? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Thank you.  My last question then is on the bus
segment.  I don't disagree with the 1 percent provision, but I wonder
what the response is to the DPI response about the counting differential
on spare buses.  It seemed like DPI had some very different data and may
we'll hear that from the department, but I wondered what your response
was to their response. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I believe DPI did present in
the committee when we had this report, but it's  a matter of reduction
from 10% in spare busses to 5% in spare busses.  Every district is not
the same and we all know that, you may have some areas</p>

In the far West or where it’s more mountainous and you have problems
with parts and getting parts, but when we looked at the overall
allocation, it is a place where we could adjust and make some sizable
savings that could go other places. If everybody would just try to work
together. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Last follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I think I understand.
And as I read the bill, Representative Howard, it’s to limit the
inventory to criteria subject to get to the 10% number. Is that not
correct? Again, if there is a difference in the data, that underlay
that, would that be something again, just so we can get to some clear
agreement if there is a difference in the data, is that something we
could look at over the next few days. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Absolutely.
Absolutely. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes,
and I do want you to know that the reason that we are just hearing it
today is we realize that it is comprehensive and that a lot of people
are opinionated about it. We are going to hear from the public also. But
this will give you a chance to get the staff in if there are things you
don’t like in it, or to approve it then that’ll give you a little bit of
time. I have Representative Fisher and Representative Jeter and
Representative Graham and then I’ll ask. Okay. Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Madame Chairman. I’m going to go back just to
sort of the nuts and bolts of school transportation just for a second,
just to refresh my memory some, if that’s okay. I looked at the idea of
reducing our inventory of buses and I wonder, and this is another
question that maybe we can get into when we discuss it more thoroughly,
but what is the demand for transportation these days in our school
systems overall across the state?  And are we meeting the
responsibility, the requirement of transporting children who live a
certain distance away from their schools. Will we, with the reduction in
this inventory, be able to meet that need? [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Howard. [SPEAKER CHANGES]I don’t think we’re
making any adjustments, Representative Fisher, in regards to the
children that we are transporting now. This should have no effect on the
current routes and the transporting of the students. It’s the number of
spare buses, backup buses, that each LEA has on site, in their
locations. So it shouldn’t make any difference at all on how we
transport the children, doesn’t matter where they live. We have a
responsibility to get them to the school. It shouldn’t make any
difference. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Fisher, is that? Okay.
Representative Jeter. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Madame Chair. Thank you
Representative Howard , for presenting the bill. I have one question,
and it may be in here and I just can’t find it. You’re talking about 19
million dollars worth of savings. Is that savings going to stay in DPI?
Does it go to the general fund? Do we have a plan for it, or is it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Jeter, that would be up to the
appropriations, the budget directive of what happens and it will take a
while to implement and then achieve those savings. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Jeter, is that sufficient? Representative Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madame Chair. Just a point of clarification
in Section 2. What is a non-compliant county maintenance facility? Are
we talking about facilities that maintain our buses? And also how would
that be non-compliant? [SPEAKER CHANGES]I’m going to ask our research
folks to address that question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir, each county
has its own maintenance facility that maintains school buses, and by
non-compliant we identified over a thousand buses that were operated
during the fiscal year that were being operated while</p>

<p id="20:00">
Not in compliance with the thirty day safety inspection requirement. And
we also identified approximately 25% of all preventative maintenance
activities were performed after the scheduled period for which they were
supposed to be performed. And that’s what we mean by non-compliant. It’s
more non-compliant activities versus a non-compliant maintenance
facility. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Madame Chair? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m kind of alarmed when we talk about bus
safety. How could we allow busses to be on our highways when they are
not safe to operate? Is this an issue with funding, lack of personnel,
we’re not meeting those timelines? I’m really concerned about the
implications. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me defer to our research person. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, Mr.
Hefferin? [SPEAKER CHANGES] They are prepared to answer that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We’re not asserting that the buses were unsafe that were
operated, but this statutorily required 30 day safety inspection is
designed to ensure or help ensure that these buses are safe. And you
know, we think that we found extensive non-compliance with this 30 day
safety inspection requirement, and recommended that DPI utilized the
data that we used to identify this non-compliance and use their existing
process or modify their existing process of inspecting county
maintenance facilities to help ensure that this situation improves.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative – [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I understand this is for discussion and I’ll probably want to
talk about this a little further. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitmire. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair. I’m
glad this is discussed and there’s one particular item from personal
experience that I have a question on and I’ll leave it to you, if
there’s someone in the audience to direct it. Our state’s geography
certainly varies, and in my three counties especially. In one of them,
the geography goes from 1200 feet to 6000 feet, so windy undulating
mountain roads tend to wear things out. And a couple years ago we had a
terrible problem on activity buses and yellow buses with clutch fans. So
when it comes to inventory whether it be spare buses or spare parts, I
just want to make sure that places that aren’t necessarily near and dear
to the flatlands, we don’t have an unintended consequence of cutting
their inventory to the point that we just get into a bad situation. You
couple that with some other items that we did recently when we look at
mileage to a large degree and some counties that may run their buses
three times a day. Actually three shifts, one in an evening. Most
counties don’t do that so they don’t achieve the mileage criteria. I
just want to make sure if there’s someone in the audience who might be
able to speak to that, I would greatly appreciate hearing from them,
whatever your discretion allows. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Representative
Whitmire, we’re going to allow speaking from our visitors but I’m going
to stop and see if someone has an answer to that question. If you’ll go
to the microphone, but in the meantime I want to introduce, we did not
have our pages when we started today, and I’d like for y’all to stand
when I call your name. I have Ian Vonner,  is that correct? Lauren Lee.
Lauren is from Mecklenburg, and Ian is from Orange County. And I have
Connor McVicker? Connor. He’s from Alamance  and he’s Representative
Riddell’s. And Emily Morris. And she’s from Union County, and she’s
Representative Horn’s page for the day. Would you identify yourself for
the record? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, my name is Derek Graham, I’m Section
Chief for Transportation, with Department of Public Instruction. I
appreciate the question about the geography. We’re well aware of some of
the differences that take place across the state, and many of the things
that we do focus on making sure that we treat all counties the same way.
That includes the way that we do our funding formula. Specifically to
the parts inventory, one of the things, and this bill would require that
we develop a policy, and kind of what’s been going around in my mind is
our policy would need to</p>

<p id="25:00">
Include such things for parts inventory. For instance if you have a
small county in a rural, whether you talk about rural in the coast,
rural in the mountains, you may have a particular part that you only use
two of every year, for instance. All right, so does that mean you keep
on the shelf and then six months later you buy another one? You know, we
don’t really think so. We think that the LEAs need to have the
flexibility to stock two or three of those in case you go above average
and you make sure that you get those buses back on the road promptly.
When delivery time and even supply time can impact the ability to get
those parts in place. So part of the policy that we’ve kind of always
operated under and that would certainly be recommended if this
legislation passes, is to include those kinds of things especially for
the smaller LEAs. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Graham. Does that
answer your question, Representative Whitmire? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It
helps, thank you ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re welcome. This bill
comes from program evaluation and Representative Howard’s counterpart,
Senator Hartsell, so let’s hear for backup today as Senator Hartsell is
there anything you’d like to say? All right. I have two people that have
asked to be heard and that is Eric Aker and I believe if you’ll come to
the microphone and give your name and who you’re with, who you
represent? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Eric Aker, Lincoln County schools
transportation director. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that you, did you say you
– [SPEAKER CHANGES] Lincoln County Schools. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Lincoln,
okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair and members of the
committee for allowing us to speak today. My name is Eric Aker. I’m the
director of transportation for Lincoln County schools and I also
represent the North Carolina pupil transportation association. Our
association represents a large share of LEAs across North Carolina. Our
purpose is to further the safety of our student transportation here in
North Carolina. With all due respect to the bill’s sponsor, I’m
requesting today and asking to consider changes to House Bill 1040, in
the following ways. In section 1A1, changing the text to read require
all LEAs to bid bus parts, tires, fuel, and supplies to secure the best
price possible while maintaining the minimum required safety standards
for any commodities purpose. The reason for the change? Transportation
budgets have been cut more than 5% in the last five years, which equates
to approximately 25 million dollars, while inflation has increased
significantly on repair parts, tires, and other school bus supplies.
Over the last three years tire costs have risen 35%. Oil cost has risen
between 12 and 15%, and with LED lighting now standard, the cost to
replace lighting has soared from just a few dollars to now over a
hundred. In addition, school bus replacement schedules have been changed
to keep buses in service longer, which will also affect cost
maintenance. At the same time costs have risen, LEAs have absorbed
additional operational costs and mechanical costs that include
transportation of homeless students across school boundaries, which is
now federally mandated under McKinney Bento Law, an increase in
exceptional children’s transportation with modified day scheduled,
repair to air conditioning equipment, dealing with engine issues from
certain manufacturers, and the list continues to go on. LEAs have made
adjustments over the past few years to improve efficiency, to be able to
manage these escalating costs, so any further adjustments to funding
formulas will result in budget reduction. One that a majority of LEA
transportation departments simply cannot afford. In summary, reducing
the funding buffer, which is supposed to account for situations that can
be mathematically predicted with the current funding formula, will
result in another budget reduction for LEAs. In section 1A, number 3,
NCPTA requests the removal of this section. Reason for this? Reducing
current inventory levels will negatively impact transportation
departments in the following ways. This action may limit the ability of
an LEA to take advantage of cost savings on bulk pricing for high volume
items. This may affect the ability of an LEA to stock hard-to-find
parts. This action may affect turnaround time for repair parts that have
to be ordered. This action may cost LEAs additional funds through added
shipping costs. Under section 2, change the section to read the
department of public instruction in consultation with North Carolina
public school transportation associate shall revise the state inspection
process</p>

<p id="30:00">
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For inspecting school buses to focus on safety-related
items that ensure safe and effective school bus operation and the
remaining of that legislation should stay the same. Reason for this, the
current school bus inspection program needs simplification so that more
buses can be inspected by DPI with existing staff. Currently there're
over 421 items that can remove a school bus from service some of these
items do not have an impact or are not safety-related to the operation
of the bus. The NCPTA is experienced in safe and practical school bus
operation this experience should be considered when making changes to
the school bus inspection program. The NCPTA respectfully request
inclusion in the process to ensure the inspection program is effective
practical and ensure the safe school bus operation crossing the state of
North Carolina. Before closing, I would like to add the house bill 1040
is not the only proposed house legislation that suggests funding
reduction to public school transportation. The governor’s budget refers
to claim expenditure for at fault claims to be reimbursed to state using
local dollars. This is another reduction in funding and added expense to
local school districts across the state. Thank you for the opportunity
to speak and I will be have to answer any questions at this time. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Akers and if you all will notice you had
a hand out. We are running pretty close on time and we will have this
back up so, if the next speakers will just speak for minute or two. I
have someone from DPI and is there anyone here from, Ben Matthews? and
is there anyone here from the state board? I had a note there,  and a
John Bunion? Mr. Matthews.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning. Ben Matthews director of safe and
healthy school support in the Department of Public Instruction. The
majority this bill is covered by, excuse me cold, covered in my division
in the Department of Public Instruction. First and for most on the
transportation piece we are just maniacal about school bus safety. The
points that have been made by the gentleman who just spoke. Talked about
the number of issues when we inspect the bus. There are some of those
and are superfluous not really related to the safety piece. The safety
piece we are really totally focused on. We have three regional field
people across the state of North Carolina at this point. It is obviously
physically impossible for all three of those people to inspect all the
school buses in North Carolina. We have a training program in place to
help the locals inspect their buses and we spend time daily across the
state making sure our buses are safe.I want the public to understand
that our kids are riding on really are safe. If our guys find a bus that
is inherently unsafe we park it immediately. To the point on the text
book warehouse. We are currently working very diligently with other
agencies, Department of Commerce, Department of Public Safety,
Department of Agriculture, Department of Security Commission to be sure
that that space is used appropriately. So, we have reached out without
any direction from anyone basically being good public servants to be
sure that that space is being used and we have changed our process just
to just in time service to the school districts. So, we are on top of
that thing. In terms of reducing positions there. The government is
putting money back in for textbooks. If we eliminate those positions we
will not be the position to serve our district when the budget is
passed. There was also a point made about getting ready for digital
distribution. Currently the state gets a discount because of the way we
manage textbook distribution. We’ve already been in conversation with
some of the major IT vendors who put out the material for digital
equipment and if we continue the process the way we have it. We would
continue serving the state by shipping digital equipment to the public
schools. You’ve got a thing in place already that it is saving the state
millions of dollars and to eliminate those positions, furthermore we
don’t want to eliminate them, and Mr. Heffer mentioned it earlier, we do
have some those that are totally dedicated to the provision of equipment
to the site and hearing-impaired across North Carolina. To get
eliminate, those the federal government would be on us in a heart beat.
They’ve already been on us and one of the things we did over the years
have changed that process to be…</p>

[speaker changes] Thank you, thank you madame Chairman.
[Speaker Changes] Our next bill is house bill 1060 and we will be voting
on this bill. I believe Representative Martin will be handling that.
Floor is yours Representative Martin.
[Speaker changes] Thank you madame Chairman and if you'll permit
Representative Holloway is going to join me also since he did most of
the work on this.
[Speaker changes]He's already been lobbying at me this morning.
[speaker changes]Good. Members it's a pleasure to be here and it's a
pleasure to be back on the education committee after an absence of
several years from it. House bill 1060 deals with military children we
have in our system throughout North Carolina. Under current law
principals are required to identify military children in their schools,
but we don't have a way of getting that state wide. So at the request of
the Department of Defense this bill would seek, to direct DPI to come up
with a system to get that data state wide. This came through Ed
Oversight and we had a great bi-partisan or rather non partisan working
group on this with Representative Holloway, me, Representative Poore and
Representative Glasier. Madame Chair I'll stop there, but I'm happy to
answer any questions the committee has.
[speaker changes] Thank you. Representative Shepard.
[speaker changes] Thank you Madame Chair. Representative Martin, my
question is I talked with our local school officials and they're already
capturing that data and I guess the question I have is since they're
already doing that is this going to encumber them more by forcing them
to go to another system or doing it a different way which will cost them
more money, is this something we're going to push back down to them when
they've already done a good job of capturing that information are we
going to require them to do more than that or change what?
[speaker changes] Right, outstanding question. THroughout this whole
process one of our overarching goals was not to significantly add to the
burden that our students already have, as I mentioned of course
principals are already required to collect this information. Statewide
systems are already going to a common system of reporting data up to the
state and already the state has fields created in that database that the
systems can use to enter this data.
[speaker changes]  Follow up
[speaker changes] So what you're telling me is since I know that they're
already capturing this data in Onslow County. So with that being said,
then it would just be a matter of making an adjustment with the system
they've got, they're not going to have to go to anything new or it's not
going to cost them anything more out of their pocket since they're
crunched for money already, ok.
[speaker changes] Right, good question. I think the answer to that, I
may call for staff help on this or Representative Holloway, is it
depends on what system they're using. My suspicion and I'll look to
staff pretty quickly to come in is that they're probably if they're not
already using going to be moving to the system that we're using state
wide. And if they're already doing that anyway theres nothing additional
that they would need to do this. Madame Chair if I could just look at
staff to see if I've stated that correctly.
[speaker changes] Staff, you have a clearing. Karen McCraw.
[speaker changes] Representative Shepard, there is the uniform education
reporting system power school you've probably heard of is the way that
they keep the data. Right now Power School does not have fields for
military children, so this would be a new checkbox that they'd check in
Power School. Right now because there is not a way to put that in Power
School, principals have to keep up with it in some other fashion and we
don't know they may be doing it on spreadsheets and hard copies. Once
it's in Power School it would be accessible  throughout the district and
you wouldn't have to duplicate that entry if a student moved between
schools.
[speaker changes] And Representative Shepard to add in, the additional
this will by going to the common system, this will allow at the state
level how our  military students, how do they perform when there's a
deployment out of Legume or Bragg and so forth. I neglected to mention
the additional equal benefit of this which is the</p>

Us, to better compete for federal impact aid. That if we can make a case
to the federal government on the number of military students we’ve got,
we can make a better case for the federal impact aid that can follow
those military children. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Well I understand that our system,
they’re using federal calls that they fill out and they capture that
information from all them so that they do get that impact aid and so
forth. That was my concern, was it going to cost them more money or were
they going to have to go to another system when they’re already doing
one that’s capturing that information currently. Thank you for your
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Shepherd, I understand there is
someone with DPI, Louis Fabrizio, that might shine a little light on
that? [SPEAKER CHANGES]Lou Fabrizio, DPI, director of data research and
federal policy. In our discussions about this particular bill, we are
aware that some school districts have been collecting the information as
was stated earlier by the staff member. That information typically is in
an Excel spreadsheet. Our person who works with the Powers school system
has stated that we will have the capability of importing any information
that’s in an Excel spreadsheet into the system to alleviate that burden
from the school district. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Lucas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Madame Chair. I want to commend the sponsors
of this bill, for working so diligently in finding a way to make our
state more military friendly. We proud ourselves on being a military
friendly state. That being said, Madame Chair, at the appropriate time,
I’d like to offer a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At the appropriate time.
And I understand that we can do it a little better. I think we’re ranked
27th. We could do, this will maybe help move us up. Representative
Torbec? Okay are there any other questions? John, want to try again to
identify yourself? [SPEAKER CHANGES]Members of the committee, John
Busshan for the North Carolina press association and virtually all the
newspapers around the state. Here to say that the press association
applauds the spirit of the bill, and the work that’s gone into it. And
just has a question about potentially unintended consequences that might
have been built into this. There’s language in the bill that says
essentially nothing from this point forward that relates to military
student identified information would be accessible under the public
records law, that’s GS132, except as allowed by FERPA, which is the
federal education records law. And while that sounds like that’ll
continue to allow the public to have the current level of its right to
know preserved, many of our members have been in battles already with
some state universities, one in particular, over getting information as
simple as who’s run up 500 parking tickets and how they’ve been paid and
that sort of thing, and if this ?? an entire group whose identities are
no longer accessible, then our members would be opposed to that. But I
don’t know the answer that, just having looked at it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you like to reply, Representative? [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very
much, Madame Chair. And we definitely had a discussion in our working
group about that very issue, the balance of privacy versus openness to
the press and to the people. Our thought on that and our intent in this
is that’s a battle worth, a discussion worth having, but that just to
treat this information just like it has in the past. Whatever decisions
are made elsewhere on the broader topic of student privacy, this could
be part of that, but the intent is not to carve out anything additional
but as we’re creating this new data to keep it protected under FERPA is
just that it is right now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not sure that is -
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I’ve never known press not want to a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]With the chair’s indulgence, Madame Chairman, I’m not
sure that the language is clear on that point, and I’d welcome the
chance to talk some more with you about that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Be happy
to meet with you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]I believe our staff can help you a
little bit also. Cara McCraw. [SPEAKER CHANGES] There is a sort of belt
and suspenders approach in additionally stating that this is a exception
to the public records law however all student records are</p>

Section to the public's record law and that is in another section except
for anything that a school has designated as directory information so
because this has an exception for FERPA. If a parent wanted to designate
that as something that could be released if something the school system
had made it directory information they could, but otherwise as with all
other education records they are considered confidential.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Alright, thank you very much. Representative Holloway
is there anything you'd like to say? Alright, I have a motion for a
favorable report from Representative Lucas, seconded by Representative
Tolbert. All those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. House bill 1060
passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you madame chair and thank you members.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Holloway am I correct in your asking
that 1062 can be put on next week's? Alright, thank you. With that said
does my co-chair here have anything he'd like to say? Like to give us an
update? Okay if not I declare this meeting adjourned.</p>
