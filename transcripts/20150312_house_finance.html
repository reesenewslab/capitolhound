Let’s bring this meeting to order so we can all get where we need to be
and that’s home. First of all the Sergeant-At-Arms staff: Peggy Sills,
Marvin Lee, Young Bay, Terry McCraw thanks for being with us. We have
pages today, Abby Martin, ?? McConnell, and Armistead thank you for
being with us and we appreciate all the staff and the members and the
other Chairs being here today. First on the agenda would be House Bill
73, if there is no objection…Well, I don’t see the sponsor. Is anybody
here to fill in for the sponsor? If not we will move to the honorable
gentleman from Gaston County, Chairman Torbett for House Bill 5.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Chairman and good morning members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Consent the bill before the committee, seeing no objection the bill
before the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen House Bill 5 actually is a
very easy bill, I’m hoping you guys will agree with that and as far as
questions go but anyway here we go, it simply just honors our veterans
by allowing them to get a license plate that would be note them as a
veteran and what branch they served in and that’s pretty much it, we
have a fiscal analysis memorandum and over the additional cost for
fiscal year 2015-2016 the cost is net state impact 0, 2016-2017 net
state impact is 0, and to make life easy in subsequent years the net
impact is 0, and with that Mr. Chairman I will take any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The honorable gentleman from Rutherford County, Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, I have heard Representative Torbett quite enough
in the last few weeks, so I would like to move with favorable.
[Laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, that we would discuss it in transportation about 300 signatures or
300 requests has that been evaded or that’s still in this particular…?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That has no barring on this whatsoever that has gone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, second Representative Hager’s motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, so an extra charge to the ?? and specially
placed and so where does that money go?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Over the years back when I was a Chair of
Finance, we were very concerned about the many, many applications that
were put in by members basically and we had the minimum number because
otherwise I mean there are some plates with 55 signatures, 155
signatures. So I guess Representative Torbett the question is—why not
the minimum here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are currently I believe the numbers are around 24 to 28 additional
types of veterans plates that capture this group or that group, or this
group or that group which currently require that amount. This is simply
a wide net passed out that encompasses any veteran that might not be a
member of a group to prohibit them or not prohibit to have it much
easier for them to get recognition on their plate without having to go
around the state and try to line up 300 signatures, trying to get the
dollars that it cost for the plates upfront if you know the red tape
that’s involved with that is not as easy as just 300 signing. So this
just honors our veterans across the state and by denoting their veteran
and what branch they served at no additional cost.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett to support the bill, I was curious for a
different reasons what is the issue with the minimum numbers? Is that
requires other types of special plates or something I’m just not
familiar with it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. To further amplify the answer to Representative
Luke’s question and I appreciate him asking, most plates do have 300
minimum but there is a tradition in this body to wave the minimum on
several military plates…

  For example the disabled veteran plate has no minimum, was authorized in
1991. Air medal recipients in 2005 with no minimum. Bronze star valor in
2007 with no minimum. Bronze star recipient, 1998 with no minimum. Coast
guard auxiliary, 1987 with no minimum. Disabled veteran, 1991 with no
minimum. Distinguished flying cross, 1998 with no minimum. Ex prisoner
of war, 1995 with no minimum. Gold star lapel button, 2006 with no
minimum. Legion of merit, 2011 with no minimum. Legion of valor which
would include congressional medal of honor, distinguished service cross,
Navy cross, Air Force cross and coast guard cross, 1993 with no minimum.
Military reservist for Air Force, Army, Coast Guard and Marine Corps,
Navy Reserve, 1991 with no minimum. So we’ve got a couple others out
there. This isn’t really breaking new ground. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
further questions? Seeing none let’s put the question before the
committee. Those in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Those opposed say no. In the opinion of the chair the ayes have
it. Thank you Representative Torbett. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman and members of the committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Next Chairman
Dollar have your bill before the committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman, mine is coming up, may I make a request under rule 24a to be
excused and I’ll give written notice to the clerk. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. With unanimous consent Representative Dollar’s bill will be before
the committee. Hearing none, the bill will be before the committee.
Representative Dollar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the committee this is a very simple, straightforward
legislative annexation. The community of Holly Brook’s water is leaving
rings in the toilet bowl so to speak. It’s not a good situation. They
have met as a community. They’re in favor of being annexed by the town
of Cary. The town of Cary is amenable and looking forward to them coming
in. I know of no opposition. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
honorable gentleman from Catawba County wish to be recognized? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I serve in Catawba but thank you. To make a motion for
favorable report at the appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
honorable gentleman is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I make motion for
favorable report for House Bill 73. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further
discussion? Those in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Those opposed say no. In the opinion of the chair it moves
forward. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members
of the committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further business from the other
chairs or the committee? Staff are we clear? This meeting’s adjourned.
Let’s go home.
