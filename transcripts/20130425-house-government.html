Good morning.  Good morning and welcome to the House Committee on
Government.  I want to start off with the introduction of the pages.
Joseph Boes(?) from Catawba County sponsored by Representative Setzer.
Caroline Glukus(?) from Wayne County sponsored by Representative Bell.
Cora Evens from Wake County sponsored by Representative Bell.  Hannah
Simpson from Gates County sponsored by Representative Mobley.
Introduction Sergeant at Arms, Young Bae.  Where you at, Young?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.  Bob Rolson(?).  There you go.  Charles Goodwin.
Patrick Mason.  There you go, Patrick.  Thank you so much.  Ladies and
gentlemen, I'm going to ask you to come on in and get settled down.
We've got a large agenda today.  We've got a lot of bills to go through
and we're going to have some ground rules up front, so please take a
seat and prepare.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We've got about seventeen bills on the agenda today, give or take.  For
the members in the audience, we have a huge sign-up list so I want to
make sure you all get this.  We're going to ask for each person speaking
for or against to pick two or three on each side, not to exceed two
minutes.  Please remember not to be redundant because we have a lot of
bills to go through today, so we'll ask for you to work with us as we
try to push these bills through today or the Committee just makes their
decision.  All right, today first up House Bill 108.  Representative
Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  We'll make
this quick because we do have a very large agenda.  I don't want to hold
you up long.  This is a local bill requested by my county sheriff and
what he asks us to do is to allow him to have an exemption where he
could, with the county commissioners approval, utilize the county
sheriff's vehicles for some off-duty use like parking in front of a
school, or let officers drop their children off at school on the way.
So as just we have a police presence at some of the schools.  It's a
very passive, security type thing and I'd appreciate your support on the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for a motion at the perfect time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just had a question.  Would the sheriff
submit a list for the county commission to approve, or would this just
be a case-by-case issue?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It'd be a case-by-case issue and it's a very cooperative effort between
the county sheriff and the county commissioners.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions from the Committee?  Any questions or comments from
the general public on this bill?  Representative Burr, you have the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I move that we give House Bill 108 a favorable
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a motion.  All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any opposed?  The motion carries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Warren.  Next up, House Bill 422.
Representative Brawley.  You have the floor, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I don't know what the record is for shortest
bills, but this might be in contention.  It's a one-liner.  Basically,
the town of Marshville ?? briefly explain.  The town of Marshville, by
resolution, has asked me to remove a section of their utility billing.
Marshville is one of those communities that... we just had a bill this
week by Representative Cleveland called &quot;Water and Sewer Fiscal
Health&quot;.  If Marshville doesn't do this bill to help their fiscal
health of their water and sewer department, they will be approached by
the state to help out.  Basically, what they're doing is they want to
revise their utility billing procedures to match... and they will take
as a guideline the section 163, A314 statute.  Any questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Make a motion to represent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any other comments from the Committee?  Representative
Brawley(?).
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to make a motion for favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Mobley, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.  This bill, would it require the customers to be aware
of and had they been made aware of the fact that this is going to
happen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, they generally wouldn't be aware that it's going to happen.
They'd probably be aware that-</p>

… did happen, if it does. What’s happening in Marshville is that they
provide their own water and sewer services and they charge, the full
budget is about $900,000. For the whole town, about $95,000 of it is
delinquent or unpaid, and what they are trying to do is shorten the time
by which they can turn off the water. Right now, it’s almost 70 days.
They want to shorten it to the statutory limit which is just over 30,
about 35.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions from the committee? Representative Collins, you have
the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to make a motion for a favorable vote on House bill 427.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a motion. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill next is 442. Municipal incorporation changes. Representative
Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It appears we have a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a PCS before us. Representative Presnell makes a motion to put
the PCS before us. All those in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re going to have the PCS. Representative Brown you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Members of the committee, what this bill does is
give a voice to property owners who aren’t necessarily registered
voters. It gives them a voice at the front end of the process of
establishing a municipal incorporation. I got some interest in this two
years ago because of an issue that we were confronted with, and realized
that this bill is not going to pertain to a large number of people in
this state. But for those it will effect, for those who own property,
who live elsewhere a majority part of the year, and who are registered
to vote elsewhere, they still own this property and they still deserve
to have a voice in weather or not a municipal incorporation goes
forward. At present they have no voice whatsoever. So this bill, if you
will look at section 1, the petition, signed by 15% of the registered
voters, we have just matched that with a petition signed by 15% of the
property owners with each property having one vote. It doesn’t matter if
the property is owned by multiple owners, each owner will have to sign
the petition, but there will be one vote per property. That is the most
significant change in this bill. What we did not want to do was to
effect the way that municipal incorporations, the basic way that they
are established in this state, because my county has so many, they have
incorporated so many areas, and we know that traditionally and
historically this happened because of encroachment, of fear of
encroachment by larger cities. So I in no way wanted to impair a
community’s ability to incorporate for any reason that they saw fit.
Except for this change, there are some technical changes throughout the
bill. At the end, there is a closing. There has to be an end point to
this process. Right now there is no endpoint. We have municipal
incorporation petitions that were started back before 2000, and we know
that those are not valid. People unfortunately died, they moved, they
divorced. So we put an endpoint of three years for a community to get
the petition done and to submit it to the subcommittee on municipal
incorporation. I think that’s a very fair timeline to get that done, and
it certainly provides for more valid petition process. If anyone has any
questions, I’d be glad to take those, and we have staff here as well if
I get stymied. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Brown. Any questions from the committee?
Representative Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion at the proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Anyone else questions from the committee? Representative
Ford, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Move favorable to house bill 442 to the PCS unfavorable to the original
with a referral to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a motion before us. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any opposed? Committee chair the aye’s have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Thank you very very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next before us we have House bill 625, Zoning Healthcare Structure.
Representative Moffitt. Sir you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, member of the committee. For those of you returning
from last session, this bill will look very familiar. This bill
originally presented to the committee on government, did have some
issues. Representative Robeson at that time recommended that it go to a
subcommittee that was chaired by Representative Faircloth, with members
including Representative Floyd and Goodman. Also during that
subcommittee meeting we…</p>

<p id="010:00">
This with the league of municipalities in the city of Charlotte at the
same time, but essentially what this bill does is it provides for a, the
authority for the cities and counties to zone and regulate temporary
healthcare structure. Temporary healthcare structure is really designed
to provide for a structure to be placed on your property in an area
that's zoned single family residential for the purposes of providing
either a place to live for an incapacitated person either end of life
care or somebody that's recovering from an injury or traumatic event or
a place for the caregiver to reside with the primary patient, if you
will, residing in their home or for providing those care services.
Essentially, the city and county, if you go to the second page of your
bill summary all the following apply to the temporary healthcare
structure. The one that I want to recognize is that a permit is required
prior to the installation of the facility. There is a fee required. The
city or county can at reasonable times inspect the temporary healthcare
structure. They also can require an annual renewal of the doctor's
certification of the physical or mental impairment. That's the
explanation, I'm prepared to take your questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Moffitt. Questions from the committee.
Representative Moore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Representative Moffitt, hopefully we can encompass one, when you use the
word temporary, give me your assessment of what that actually means.
When you say temporary do you mean a structure that's going to be there
for one or two years, six months, two to five years, and my second half
of that is when does that particular, if it's over a certain time
amount, when is it deemed as a permanent structure to the property if at
all. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Moore. I think for the
sake of time, I'll let Miss Erica Churchill answer your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Representative Moore. This bill as drafted does not put any time limits
on the structure itself because it could be there indefinitely, but it
is temporary to the property because it is not permanently installed on
the real property. The city or the county would have the ability to ask
the property owner, who is the caregiver, or the individual needing
assistance to annually prove to the county or city that that individual
still needed assistance with a recommendation from the doctor for that
individual. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Representative Goodman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to say that I
was on a subcommittee like Representative Moffitt said. We studied this
issue carefully. I think it's a good bill and I'd like to offer a motion
at the appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir.
Representative Wilkins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Representative Moffitt what I'm reading I think tells me that rather
than superseding the zoning this works hand in glove with zoning. Am I
reading correctly? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have
a question that may really, it doesn't really have to do with government
committee exactly, but I'm wondering about how a family, a caregiver,
might apply for or if this goes into effect would it be eligible for
Medicaid or Medicare cost. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Reimbursement? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Reimbursement? [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I answer the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative
Fisher. That's actually a very intriguing question. What I will do is
I'll try to get an answer for you between now and finance, and I know
you're not on finance, but that is a good question to get an answer to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hallie. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chair, I have a quick question. In areas that have protected
covenants about other structures which would have weight with this,
would this be allowed in areas that have protected covenants about other
structures that can be built on the property. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Representative Hallie. It is my understanding that if a covenant
exists, the covenant would supersede this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other
questions from the committee? Representative Warren.</p>

Thank you. Representative Moffatt, would you consider an amendment to
this, not at this time, that might set some type of recognition for a
time limit or time for removal after its function has been performed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Warren.  There’s actually a provision in the
bill itself that once the intended use is no longer needed, we have to
remove the temporary healthcare structure within sixty days.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you consider that’s something that defines the time?  I understand
that in some cases, it might be two years, three years or whatever –
some way to define what use has been fulfilled.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, if I could defer that question to staff because I feel that
it’s adequately covered in the bill as it’s written now, but I could be
wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  On page 2, line 34, is the language
Representative Moffatt is referring to. When the temporary healthcare
structure is no longer needed for the care of the medically or mentally
impaired person, it must be removed within 60 days. The determination as
to whether or not the mentally or physically impaired person is no
longer receiving or in need of assistance is actually the determination
of the doctor of that person, which is the county or city’s ability to
ask for an annual renewal statement of that doctor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Warren. You feel comfortable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely and I apologize for not catching that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions for the committee? At this time, Representative
Goodman.

Next up, House Bill 841.  Representative Ramsey.  The Chair apologizes.
Next above us is House Bill 769. We do have a PCS before us.
Representative Bell makes a motion to put the PCS before us. All in
favor say, “Aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ramsey, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning.  Thank you, Mr. Chair. Members of the committee, it’s my
honor to present House Bill 769 to you.  I appreciate the other primary
sponsors on this bill for bringing this forward.  The purpose of this
bill is to allow single-family manufactured homes in counties for that
to be a housing option. For folks, that is a very affordable housing
option, oftentimes for individuals, especially with the economy the way
it is. That is something that is oftentimes needed. I want to make it
clear, though, this bill does not affect you if you live in an
incorporated area.  It does not affect you if the land has deed
restrictions that would prohibit that.  And currently, state law says
that counties cannot exclude manufactured homes from their jurisdiction,
but oftentimes they locate these homes in often undesirable areas of the
community.  But it does provide, and this is part of the reason for the
PCS.  This bill does provide that the counties can regulate design and
aesthetics standards. It can regulate the picture roof, the type of
shingles, the type of siding, providing porches and other things to make
sure that these rooms fit in with the conformity of the community.
Again, it’s only for single family homes. I would appreciate any
questions that you might have about this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions for the committee? Representative Burr.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for a motion at the appropriate time, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was just interested to know how the bill
changed from the original bill to the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Fisher. I think the original intent of the
bill was to give counties the ability to regulate aesthetics and design
standards.  I think the original bill though, in actuality, perhaps did
not do that.  The purpose of the PCS to make it very clear that the
county should have the ability to regulate appearance and design
standards for manufactured homes.  Actually, this is somewhat similar to
House Bill 150.  We’re making it clear that county’s do still have that
authority only with respect to manufactured homes to relay any…</p>

?? that folks in the community may have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative. Any questions from the committee.
Representative Brody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ramsey, if you could, we had this discussion we had this
discussion on 150 and I’m kind of a little fuzzy on it, but the
restrictions allowable restrictions for a community limit square footage
of the houses. I don’t know if that’s included in the design standards
and aesthetic standards. Most of the subdivisions have square footage
standards and of course, some of these manufactured homes are a little
bit smaller.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, Representative Brody. It’s my understanding, and maybe perhaps
staff could clarify. The bill, there is a minimum square footage through
the HUD code home. Unless there were private deed restriction that limit
to 1000 square feet or a certain size of the home would not be
regulated, but the design and aesthetics would be, so picture groups and
things like that. If a staff member maybe can clarify that, but that’s
my understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Question of the bill’s sponsor.  Tell me how this
would affect a municipality.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would not affect a municipality at all. this does not apply to
incorporated areas. This bill only applies to unincorporated areas, so
that’s why it’s sites counties specifically. There were other zoning
jurisdictions. This bill does not apply to those areas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions for the committee.
Representative Burr, you’re recognized for a  motion.

Substitute to House Bill 769 a favorable report, unfavorable as to the
original.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next to have the floor is House Bill 778. Representative Torbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This bill is a
simple bill. If you’ve had a chance to look at it. The point of origin
of this bill is when I’ve had the pleasure to work under the tutelage of
Master Gunnery Sergeant George Cleveland last session in ??. The state
auditor brought forth to us and was telling some things she had worked
on and found out and I asked her, what happened to her once she had
concluded. She said, pretty much there was no official next step, so
this provides that next step. As representatives of the people with
their fiduciary responsibility at heart, this provides that next step
and allows for the General Assembly to review the state auditors’
reports and decide where to do we go from there. Do we move on them, do
we act on them? And it places that in the hands of the Appropriations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Torbitt. Questions from the committee. Representative
Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For a motion when appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is probably a stupid question, but, he says each Senate
Appropriations Committee and House Appropriations Subcommittee. Is there
reason for the difference between committee and subcommittee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I have a stupid answer as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senate may or may not have subcommittees so they have a
committee that oversees it whereas the House decides to have a full
approps and then sub out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a quick question for the bill’s sponsor. I
dont’ have a problem with this bill. Has the state auditor given any
opinion about the text of this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe someone in her department tweeted that they like it. I’ve
heard no opposition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions from the committee. Representative Holley.

auditors to the committee to determine that there’s</p>

Any legislation needed, but is the governmental entity involved in this
process at all, like is it, if it comes from DOA, if that is the problem
identified do they have any input input into it at any point or time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you repeat that again? I was listening but I
caught the middle of it, I think I lost a couple of important words.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No problem, okay you're taking it from an ?? into an
governmental is coming over here for report and action. Is the
department, the governmental entity or the department that is being
audited by their participant in this process? In trying to you know, I
know that there is a lot of problems that they can fix internally, and I
see that you covered some of that, but are they part of the process as
far as areas that they feel legislation is needed, are they a part of
this at all?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't think it specifically listed being part of it
but, most definitely they would be. And I'm actually reviewing a little
clause I may add at the next step to just put that language in, but
yeah, I would think as like I say again, of having a ?? ?? of the people
at our heart, that we would look at both the report, the audit, and
discuss it with whatever that audit was regarded to, and then this is
pretty much just the action taking step.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions from the committee? As time
representative Cleveland, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]?? at first if I may ??. Any audit that pertains to a
government agency, if it's being reviewed by an appropriations committee
would include the agents and it would not be excluded it would be
defending themselves, and the idea of them not being included is
outlandish. My motion is favor a report on house bill 778.

ground water. The river allocations are reduced, the new seven q10 are
reducing allocations for almost everybody, and the new environmental

Five ways to protect our water resources locally, and presently, utility
authorities do not have the rate flexibility necessary to do that. I’ll
give you an example. If you wanted to store the water in an aquifer at
??? Beach during the wintertime, when you’ve got extra capacity, you
would have to charge them the same rate that you charge everybody else,
which would make it unaffordable to do the aquifer storage.  This would
give them that flexibility to negotiate that.  Also, we’ve got a well
filled that is dewatering ponds and wetlands, this would allow them to
put water during the wintertime, when they have excess capacity, in
these ponds for aquifer recharge and wetland recharge. So it’s a way to
provide that flexibility, and water is going to be the future goal for
North Carolina. If we don’t have adequate water supplies, nothing we do
is going to entice business to come here or keep people here.  So this
is a way to maximize what we have during the low flow season, and store
as much as possible to either protect or mitigate problems that have
happened.  This could also be used in all of the coastal utility
authorities, and possibly could be used for above ground storage and
some of the inland or piedmont utility authorities. So, I urge your
support of this bill please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman do we have any questions from the committee?  Any
comments?  Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. Chairman.  I guess I’d just like to hear a little more
about how this will be implemented in your particular area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I served on the Water and Sewer, ?? Public Utility Authority as a
Commissioner.  And we talked to ?? Beach, for example, about storing
water in the aquifer during the wintertime. But there was no rate
flexibility and so it was unaffordable to do that.  All this will do is
give the opportunity to start negotiating, it won’t necessarily solve
the problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follw-up Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will this bill allow you to, allow your town to spread the rates equally
across the members, the people who are using the water, or will it allow
for some variation depending on the use/usage?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, there is no variation for the users.  This is only for protection of
the water resource.  That’s the only flexibility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I’m somewhat at a loss of exactly what we are
doing here.  Are you saying that we are going to pump water into an
aquifer for storage?  Or we’re going to not have people pump out of an
aquifer at certain times of the year?  I’m really kind of at a loss of
exactly what we’re doing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I apologize, it is a complicated issue.  All this does is if, ??
Beach wants to do aquifer storage, or Carolina Beach, or Curry Beach, or
Figure Eight Island, they can negotiate with the utility authority for a
rate that’s affordable.  If they’re not successful in the negotiation it
won’t happen.  It doesn’t force anybody to do anything.  It does not do
anything to stop people from using wells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess you’ll have to define aquifer storage for me, because aquifer’s
hold water and we pump it out and use it.  So if you would define
‘aquifer storage.’
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You take treated water, and you put it into the ground, and in our case,
it would actually cause a barrier to salt water intrusion, because once
the aquifer’s become salty, they’re gone forever.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe in the state of North Carolina, this law is presently to
prevent the pumping of water into the ground, if I’m not…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe we can ask staff one question.  Staff can you answer that quest
for us? We’re asking the question if it’s currently against the law to
pump --
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?  It is for waste water but not for treated water.  And
right now, aquifer storage occurs in New Hanover County, but not
necessarily at the right  places.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions?  Representative Ramsey</p>

Representative Katlin, does this bill, in any way, impact - you know,
there's been a long going debate about water resources and the ability
of private individuals to use ground water under their property. Is this
impacted in anywa way by that?

The state and the city of Wilmington and so the ruling, the rule is
currently that they would in order to redevelop those sites they had to
be brought up to the current day standard. Well, as Representative
Catlin has mentioned, lots of these properties are small and they are
unable to meet those requirements. What was frustrating to me as a
planner when these projects would come up was that there were ways to
improve the stormwater runoff of these properties through redevelopment,
but they were unable to meet that higher standard of redevelopment, so
what this allows us to do is take those allocations, those stormwater
numbers and where they would have to be brought into total compliance,
the numbers could be shifted over to other areas of town where there are
regional treatment areas and allow for the redevelopment of the site
which ultimately serves to improve the stormwater runoff from that site.
It may not be at 100% of the current requirement, but it would be a net
improvement to what currently exists, and this is to those of you in
more urban counties, when you're not in a downtown area, there's more
peripheral areas that are still considered urban. This allows us to
improve stormwater runoff water quality/water quantity issues. Although
not bringing it up to the highest standard, it's still a net
improvement. For example, in most central business districts across the
state, we don't require any stormwater retention at all in those central
business districts and historic districts, so this is just allowing more
flexibility in defined redevelopment areas, and I think it's really one
of the best bills that I've seen come through the general assembly in my
time here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Real quick. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, real
quick. This is also, you know, cities cannot annex anymore so the answer
for municipalities is redevelopment of what they've got. This is a tool
to help them improve. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions from the
committee. Representative Wilkins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Representative Catlin, if you had to hang a name on it, would it
be mitigation or credits or a little bit of both or something different.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's a good question. It allows allocation
flexibility of excess stormwater capacity for urban redevelopment. I
don't know what one word would do that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would have a motion
when you deem it appropriate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir.
Representative Collins. Representative Faircloth. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Catlin, if we have a suburban
developer who needs capacity for runoff and, am I gathering here that
that could be a possibility for a city to work with them and provide
that runoff on an off site? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. I actually read
it wrong. It authorizes counties and cities. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does it have to be public land for the runoff or
can it be a privately held piece of land. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't know
that there's any restriction on that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Holly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Is there a minimum
standard? You know, you can go in some redevelopment areas and you can
make an improvement, but still in 10 or 15 years you're going to have a
problem again. Is there a minimum level of improvement that must be done
in this? [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is strictly a flow calculation. If the
stormwater pipes can handle the flow of that proposed project then they
can allocate that capacity to that project. That project still has to
meet the quality requirements, which might be sand filters or something
like that, but that is going to meet that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other
questions from the committee? Representative Wilkins, you're recognized
for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. We are still
dealing with the house bill, is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And there's no further referral. That being the
case, my motion would be for a favorable report.</p>
