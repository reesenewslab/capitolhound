Enemies tremble upon hearing the words &quot;United States marine
core&quot;.  We see television ads that speak about the few and a proud
and the first to fight, that there are no former Marines.  Once a
marine, always a marine.  Today, we are privileged to see all of these
definitions up close and personal.  The checkerboards are monuments to
their motto, &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot;, always faithful.  I know that
you'll join me in honoring the service of these brave and proud
individuals, and now departed heroes by voting in favor of this
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker ??.  For those of you who are unaware of the
camaraderie that marines share, and as Representative Howard said,
always faithful, once a marine always a marine.  And so, some Marines in
the gallery possibly, or some marines on the floor may know what that
call was.  And whenever we hear it we know there are other Marines.  As
you see, George Cleveland, I even have his attention.  And so, other
Marines know there's a marine in the house, or on the floor.  I want to
talk about fixed marine air support, and how important it is to the
missions that our great Marines perform around the world, and how
important BMFA312 was to the progress we made in close air support, such
that Marines are renowned worldwide for the skill of having a combined
arms team that has air support as well as ground troops in the many
missions they perform around the world.  The checkerboards played a
great part in this history, and the development of air cover.  So the
names you heard of those Marines and that one Air Force officer who was
so blessed to serve with so many Marines will live on not just because
of the history of that organization but the development of close air
support, and the great part it plays in what America does around the
world today.  Whether they were in El Toro in California or ?? Japan, or
Demaine.  They develop both a unit, a spirit and a purpose, and they
carry it out with honor as they do in the tradition of the Marines.  I
would say this.  Because of the sacrifice of these Marines, as well as
so many others, and all the other services, we are a great country
today.  They challenge us by their deeds to live up to their greatness,
and I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Setzer, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House resolution 303 is a reminder to each of us that we should
contemplate the dedication and devotion, the services extended each
today by past and current armed services.  It is always appropriate that
whenever the opportunity arises we honor the memories of our fallen
heroes, and the lives of those veterans still with us.  For without the
numerous untold personal sacrifices extended by the checkerboards,
squadron members and others, the way of life that we all hold dear could
very well have been lost in the balance.  It is often said that freedom
is not free, and with recent current events, we can see that fact with
greater clarity.  Today, as we honor the life and memory of those 20
souls who were listed in this resolution, we are reminded of the great
debt that each of us owe them, their families, each living veteran and
each current person serving in the military.  We are truly thankful for
each and every one of you.  Each member of the checkerboard squadron
understood their duty to honor and country, and the obligation therein
contained, and they fulfilled their duty with character and integrity,
always faithful.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitmire, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very briefly, this weekend I'll be serving with some Marines.  It's an
honor and a pleasure to serve with the former Marines that are in this
body, and I commend
this resolution.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitmire, the only thing I will tell you, after brief
discussion with Representative Paul about two or three years ago, there
is no such thing as a former marine.</p>

Whereas the full run of the modern Extension and Community Association
in North Carolina was extension homemakers and homes demonstration. And
whereas in 1911 doctor I. O. Schwab recruited Jane S McKimmon for the
position as the first North Carolina State home demonstration agent. And
whereas beginning a hundred years ago, Jane S. McKimmon worked to
improve the quality of rural life and helped this state prevail during
the great depression and two world wars by deformation fo the community
clubs of volunteers to support the work of home demonstration. And

with the state council of negro home demonstration clubs of North
Carolina to become North Carolina Extension Homemakers Association in
1966. And North Carolina Extension and Community Association in 1999.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Women have always been the heart and soul of
the family in the home.  As nurturers, they have an unlimited capacity
to want to make things better for our families and communities.  And
when we were asked to do this resolution, I was so honored to be asked
to help do it, because I didn't realize all the things that these women
have been responsible for.  I want to name a few, and then it will be
others who will be speaking to it.  During world war two, home
demonstration led counties to recycle scrap metal, grease, paper and
nylon hose for the war effort.  Home demonstration joined North Carolina
federation of women's clubs and Nor Klein nurses association to raise
four million dollars to commission the U.S. army hospital ship, the
Larkspur.  And in recycling still today, they advocate for recycling
programs in communities across the state, including providing education
to general public about the benefits of recycling, and working with
local decision makers for recycling facilities in rural areas.  They
have provided millions of dollars in loans and scholarships to college
bound students since the 1930s.  Today, the organization at the state,
district, and county levels provide almost $200,000 in scholarships and
loans per year to deserving students to help them further their
education and improve their economic status.  Home demonstration raise
monies to purchase books and book mobiles, the forerunner of our public
libraries and rural counties.  Often, the first libraries were housed in
the extension offices.  I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Mobley, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Several areas that have benefited us as a
result of this resolution.  One being the rural electrification.
Through advocacy, home demonstration helped bring electricity to North
Carolina, to the rural citizens in particular.  I can truly remember
when electricity first came to my home.  We lived back up a lane, maybe
it was the woods, because there was no other house back there but ours.
But I do remember well when we stopped using that kerosene lamp, and REA
was responsible for us getting light.  Some accomplishments come by
community canneries.  During world war one, North Carolina's governor
selected Jane Mckimmons to direct the food conservation program.  Home
demonstration trained and operated community canneries.  Today, FCS is
the only community resource or Home Food preservation.  That I remember
as well.  At the high school that I attended, when it was prior</p>

Integration. During the summer, there was a cannery operated on our
campus. On the high school campus. And we always looked forward to
gathering our vegetables, and our fruits to carry to the cannery. Apple
sauce was probably my favorite. Didn't particularly care for corn, but
that was another thing that my mother did. And it was interesting how
the person responsible for the cannery would allow us to stock up these
tin cans and you stored your vegetables or fruits in those tin cans. And
after about a week or two, you could come back and collect them. So that
was an interesting process that we were able to endure.
Farmer markets and local foods. During the Great Depression, home
demonstration led the efforts to establish relief gardens and curb
markets where home makers could supplement family income. Today there is
hundreds of community gardens through the efforts of extension.
Recently, my church, in conjunction with A&amp;T state university,
established a garden at our church. That is a community garden. They
haven't progressed  enough to start selling anything. They just kind of
give it away when the season is available. I recommend the resolution to
you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister speaker.
I'm sharing a few more accomplishments of this organization. School
cafeterias. Today's school cafeterias resulted from home demonstration
agents and club members organizing and serving hot lunches in North
Carolina's public schools during the nineteen thirties. The family
consumer sciences and extension and community associations continue to
work in the area of good nutrition for children.
The cotton mattress program. In the nineteen forties, North Carolina
realized a cotton surplus. Our women were taught to make mattresses. A
hundred twenty five thousand low income families were reached. Over two
hundred twenty one thousand mattresses and almost fifty five thousand
comforters were made. I commend the resolution to you.

Further discussion? Further debate?

Representative: …the chair has in its possession some 8-9 amendments. It
is the intent of the chair to allow full debate from anyone who wishes
to speak throughout the amendment process, as well as the bill. The
debate will not be limited as dictated by the rules. For those in the
gallery, this is a matter that I am sure many of you are aware of, it is
a matter that has passion on both sides of the issue. The chair would
simply remind you that any disruptions in the gallery, either in a
positive or negative manner, will be met with a recess and a clearing of
the gallery so that we can continue a civil debate. House bill 589, the
clerk will read.
Clerk: Committee substitute 3 for house bill 589, a bill entitle dan act
to restore confidence in the government by establishing voter
information verification act to promote the electoral process through
education and pre-registration of voters, and by requiring voters to
provide photo identification before voting, to protect the right of each
voter in casting a secure vote with reasonable security measures that
confirm voter identity as accurately as possible, without restriction.
NC general assembly enacts.
Speaker: Representative Lewis, please state your purpose.
Representative: To speak on the bill.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. The house will
come to order.
Representative: Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of the house. I
rise today to speak about the open and transparent process this house,
under the duration of our speaker, has taken in developing the voter ID
bill, now before us. In the development of this bill, the elections
committee held two extended committee meeting where experts on the
merits and implementation of voter ID have made presentation and
answered questions. Experts who spoke in favor included Civitas and the
heritage foundation. Those who have opposed include the southern
coalition for democracy, democracy CNC, the NC NAACP, and the brennan
center. The committee has also received testimony from elected
administrators in Georgia, Indiana, and Florida. Further, and perhaps
more importantly, we held two public hearings where any citizen wishing
to comment on the concept of voter ID was invited to do so. Input from
these was appreciated and used in formatting the bill that is before
this house today. The bill was then heard, debated and amended in three
distinct committees, including elections finance and appropriation s. I
note that every member of this body is a member of at least one of those
committees. This means that the development of this bill before us
includes more than eight hours of public comment and more than nine
hours of committee time. There have been more than twenty amendments
offered, debated and voted on in committee. Every member wishing to
amend this bill was given the opportunity. I say all that to say that
this has been a fair, open and transparent process, as we have
committed, it would be. So why are we here today? We are here today to
pose our system of government depends on open and honest elections.
Having people prove who is they say they are a s a condition of voting,
makes sense and guarantees that each vote is weighed equally and
cumulatively determines the outcome of the election. I am not the only
one who things this: in 2005, the federal election reform commission,
headed by former president Jimmy Carter, and former secretary of state,
James Baker, stated that the electoral system cannot inspire public
confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud</p>

<p id="050:00">
Or to confirm the identity of voters.  Photos, ID currently are needed
to board a plane, enter Federal buildings, or cash a check.  Voting is
equally important.&quot; We are here today, because seven out of 10
North Carolinians understand and support this concept and this idea.  We
are here today, because when voters are disenfranchised by the county of
improperly cast ballots, or outright fraud, their civil rights are
violated just as surely as if they had been denied the chance to vote.
So let's talk a bit about some of the things that we've heard discussed
in committee.  Let's talk about disenfranchisement.  We're told, we're
led to believe by talking point after talking point that the institution
of a photo voter ID requirement reduces electoral participation,
especially among minority groups.  I stand before you today to tell you
that there is absolute hard, imperical evidence, proof in state after
state after state that has done this that that is not true.  In fact,
minority participation after the institution of the voter ID law has
gone up as a percentage.  We've also been told this thing is a poll tax.
 I'm going to respond to that simply by reading from a Supreme Court
decision.  Such an argument represents a dramatic overstatement of what
fairly constitutes a poll tax.  Thus, the imposition of ?? burdens does
not transform a regulation into a poll tax.  Moreover, the cost of time
and transportation cannot plausibly qualify as a prohibited poll tax,
because those same costs also result from voter registration and in
person voting requirements, which one would not reasonably construe as a
poll tax.  We have heard in this process that there are concerns over
absentee votes.  So, to prove that the words and the members and the
general public who came forward and expressed concern, as a sign of good
faith that their advice and input was heated, you will find that
absentee voters are addressed in this bill.  I've also heard, very
recently about the cost of this bill.  And I'm sure that's going to come
up today.  And most of the time, when I hear about the cost it's always
in the respective of do we really need this, what voter fraud is there?
My favorite one came in an e-mail, where a person done a statistical
that all of our sacred constitutional rights are upheld.  I'm proud of
the effort of this house so far.  I appreciate the hard work of the
bill's sponsors.  And I commend the bill to you.  Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.

Representative Warren, please state your purpose.

answers to cover different segments as well. And I'm going to start out
with you on page 1, part 1, and talk about VIVA. VIVA stands for the
Voter Information Verification Agency which will be appointed by the,
Advisory Board, excuse me, which will be appointed by the State Board ??
by the County in a sincere effort to get to people and educate them on
the provisions of the bill and again to encourage participation in the
voter process.  There is by no means in any of this section anything
that would pertain to suppression or voter disenfranchising. The entire
intent of this 24 month program ?? was talking about earlier.  Part 2
refers to the photo identification requirement for balloting in person.
It says here that every individual voting in person in accordance with
this article must present a photo identification bearing a reasonable
resemblance to that person. In a few minutes Representative Murray will
talk about register voting curbside in ?? Photo identification as
outlined in this bill and I will cover these with you and you can see it
on page 2, item E1, an identification card that bears either a date of
expiration or a date of issuance that is no more than 10 years beyond
the date of expiration or issuance, whichever is later, issued by a
branch, department, agency or entity of the United States, this state or
any other state and those identifications would include a North Carolina
drivers license, a learners permit or provisional license, a North
Carolina special identification card for non-operators, a US Passport,
an employee identification, under this category an identification card
issued for government programs of public assistance.  These cards almost
all have either a date of issuance or a date of expiration and a photo.
Secondly, a veterans identification card issued by the United States
Department of Veteran Affairs that's used for Veterans Administration
medical facilities and also qualifying as an identification card that
bears a date of expiration that is not expired on the date that the
voter reached the age of 70 that was issued by a branch, department,
agency or entity of the United States, this state or any other state.
I'm going to ask you to turn now to what I have as page 13, section 17.
This refers to the education and publicity promotion and there's a lot
of things enumerated here most of which are existing.  These are all
provisions that would be utilized by the VIVA Program as well as the
BOE.  We did have some amendments throughout the process where people
wanted to dictate basically what shall be used but we did not want to
limit the BOE to how it should address these different media and ways of
getting out the education to the voters. So you have those all listed in
there.  Section 20 is a part of the bill that directs the State Board of
Elections to review and make recommendations back to the Joint
Legislative Elections Oversight Committee by April 1st of next year 2014
regarding the concept of establishing a state-wide digital photo data
base as another means of enrolling folks in the electoral process to
make it easier not only for people to comply with the requirements of
this bill but also for the voting process, to expedite it and to make it
easier for the BOE. This program feasibly could have voter recognition
and an interstate agreement for sharing information on votes that were
cast.  And finally under Section 22, this section refers to the phase-in
part of the bill which is spread over a very generous two year period to
educate and to enroll people and to help people find and acquire
acceptable means of photo id. And I'd like to call your attention to
item 5 under section 22 and that starts a process whereby in elections
in 2014</p>

...forward, voters will be asked, at the poll, if they have a photo ID.
They will not be required to have one to vote, but would be polled to
see if they do have one. Voters who identify themselves as not having
one will be asked if they need help or assistance in acquiring one, at
which point, that information will be turned over to the local VIVA
organization there, or the local party chairs who work with VIVA in
helping get to these people, and to help them acquire a photo ID. At
this point I'd like to turn the microphone over to Representative Murry
to cover several other parts of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, without exception or without
objections, Rule 12D is suspended. Is there objection?  Representative
Murry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr Speaker. If you will turn to Page Three
of the bill and look at Section Five, that begins the section that deals
with curbside voting, and voters who are qualified but because of
physical disability and physical barriers at the voting place, are
unable to vote – walk in, physically walk in to the polling location. It
allows for, in addition to presenting a photo ID, they can present a
copy of a document listed in a general statute commonly known as a
(HAVA?) document for persons with disabilities. This is an exemption
that allows persons with disabilities, because of that physical
disability who can't walk into the polling location, and the State Board
of Elections is directed to promulgate rules and regulations for the
implementation of that. Moving on to Page Six, Section 11: this deals
with how provisional ballots are counted due to failure to provide a
photo identification when voting in person. As Representative Warren
mentioned, if an individual presents themselves for an Election Day or
at an early voting site without a photo ID, they will be offered the
opportunity to case a Provisional Ballot, and before noon on the day of
canvas, they have to present themselves back to the Board of Elections
with a photo ID in order to have that vote counted, and that's detailed
in Section 11. In Section 12, most of Section 12 on Page Seven is
existing law. This just adds the ability for a voter to be challenged by
any member. Any active voter in that precinct who doesn't present
themselves with a photo ID, that is another reason why a voter could be
challenged at the precinct. The challenge process is already laid out in
existing law, and this just simply adds that photo identification, in
accordance with this new law, is another reason for challenge. That
concludes the sections of the legislation that I'm prepared to present,
but I will also add, there will be  – if anyone should have a question
about the North Carolina Constitution, or just exactly what our
provisions in the North Carolina Constitution contains, I would be glad
to answer and engage in discussion about the North Carolina
Constitution. Or if you want to talk about the Rational Basis Test under
the 14th amendment of the US Constitution, feel free to direct those
questions to me, and I will gladly be able to answer any specific
Constitutional questions that you might have. But at this point,
Representative Samuelson would like to continue discussion of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, my colleagues here have done a great job of
helping you understand that you're going to need a photo ID to vote by
2016. One of the things we wanted to do was to make that as easy as
possible. So if you'll look on Page Seven, Line 19, we start Part Three,
which is the implementation piece, and it has to do with the fees. If
someone does not have a driver's license and does not have any of the
other types of IDs provided, we have made provision for them to get a
free non-operator ID card at the DMV. Already DMV issues these cards to
certain individuals for free, and if you look here, it has the list of
them: if someone is legally blind, or at least 70 years old, or had a
driver's license and had it removed for some reason so they now need a
non-operator card., or they're homeless. What we have added are two
sections, Five and Section Six. Five says that if you are only getting –
or your primary reason, because we know people will use these, which is
one of the benefits, they'll use them for other things – but if your
primary reason for seeking [RECORDING ENDS]</p>

<p id="065:00">
An ID card is for the purpose of voting. You may sign an affidavit to
that effect saying that that is why you are getting the non-ID, the
non-operator card and you will get that card for free. One of the things
that we added to this at the request of some of the members of the
committee was since people can already go into the DMV if they’re
getting their driver’s license and getting registered to vote, if some
one was going in to get their non-operator’s card and they were not
registered to vote, how would they be able to get this card if they were
having to make multiple trips? What we did was we added section 6, so if
some one comes in, registers to vote and says that they were coming in
for the purpose of registering to get their ID card, they may also get
it free under that case.  Section 14 goes through how we will compensate
DMV and the clerks and registrars for this because for some people, they
need not only the card, but they may need a copy of the documentation
that will enable them to get the card, which could be a birth
certificate or a marriage certificate. So we did not want to have this
as an unfunded mandate to the county departments and so this is how they
would compensate it. And under the same scenario, the person goes in and
says I’m a registered voter and signs an affidavit under perjury, the
penalty of perjury that says, I’m needing this documentation so I can go
get a non-operator card for the purpose of voting. The clerk will then
verify that they are a registered voter either by looking them up
online, calling the Board of Elections office, or, if the individual
actually has their voter registration card, they may present it. Then,
if you will look forward to page 11 line 21, we get to the issue of
absentee ballots. Currently, there is posted a form similar to the one I
have here, which anyone can come look at if they’d like, for people who
are requesting absentee ballots, but there are also other ways that you
can get them. Under the Bill, what you would do if you want an absentee
ballot is you would either go online or you could call the Board of
Elections and ask for this form or you could write the Board of
Elections and ask for this form and they would make sure, or someone
else could give you this form. But you would get this form and fill it
out and mail it in in order to get an absentee ballot. What we’ve
changed on this is we’ve added that you need to put some sort of
information on their like your driver’s license number or the last 4
digits of your Social Security number or you can get a HAVA document on
it. For those of you are pages that will soon be going off to college,
we still will allow your parents or legal guardians to request the form
for you if they need to so that you can vote in the county where you
should be registered to vote. So you send this in and then they will
verify it when it gets to the Board of Elections. If the information
checks out, then they will mail you your absentee ballot. If there is a
question they need from it, they can contact you to get that information
from it and because depending on how and when you registered, you may
have your Social Security number or your driver’s license, by signing
this, you are also giving the Board of Elections the opportunity to
update their database so that if you one year provide your driver’s
license and one year provide your Social Security number, they would
have that information and be able to verify it. They will then mail you
the absentee ballot. You will on both of these forms now need 2
witnesses and your witnesses will need to put their name and address so
if there is a challenge to it, they will be able to find your witnesses
and you can send those back in. The other change would be on page 13
line 12. I mentioned to the pages that your parent, you’re your legal
guardian, could sign and order a form for you. Well there are people who
do not have what we would normally think of as a regular, verifiable,
legal guardian. They may be in an institution where the institution is
their legal guardian. So we have made a provision here, and it was
originally 3, we changed it to 10 at the request of some of the
Disability Rights people so that the person, it may be one person or as
many as 500 people for whom they are the technical guardian, that person
can’t sign and approve all the forms. So they may appoint up to 10
people to help provide that role form them in the case of needing them
for balloting. I think I’ve covered most of the rest. Any types of times
when someone is having to sign something under the penalty of perjury,
that will be made very clear so they know that and they are not signing
something thinking they’re just being friendly and that they know what
they’re doing. And then also that the State Board of Elections would
reimburse the Division of Motor Vehicles for any expenses that are
incurred in it. I urge your support of the Bill and we are open to
questions.

Representative Tine moves to amend the bill on page 2, line 19, by
adding the following sentence at the end of that line:
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This amendment is largely
about rural access. On your desk you have a sheet which lists 23
counties that have less than 5 days a week access to DMV. Two of those
counties are completely without access to DMV. Two of my counties that I
represent only have access two days a month to DMV. So what this
amendment would do is three things, one is direct ??VIVA to assist in
advertising the current access that exists, two, it would allow the
counties to offer IDs where the DMV is not available 5 days a week,
under the DMV rules, and then also, it would allow the state to
reimburse those counties since they are making up for what the DMV would
have done already. And also, the third thing is is a technical change
that was requested by the bill sponsors that changes the timing to be
effective immediately so the process can begin and be reviewed, while
the ID requirements would not start still until 2016. I commend the
amendment to you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the
reason I rise is to talk about absentee ballots and I believe that any
voter identification act that we do today should be not only about
preventing fraud but not limiting access to the constitutional right to
vote. Right now I believe this bill fails on both fronts. If integrity
of the vote is truly our goal, then all ballots should be screened for
voter ID. All ballots should be treated the same, but this bill doesn't
do that. Instead this bill creates two separate classes of voters: those
who vote in person and must have a photo ID and those who vote by mail
and are not required to have a photo ID. Distinctions like this are what
leads to allegations that partisan motivations are behind it. Maybe it's
just a coincidence that one party enjoys a substantial advantage in
absentee ballots. I don't read minds, so I won't speculate to people's
motives. But I don't see any valid reason why you would treat these two
types of voters any differently, why you would create two classes.
Especially when you look at the numbers. I was unable to get the numbers
updated, but I had saved the chart that we were given last time in
reference to in-person voting and mail-in absentee voting. And what the
board of elections concluded was that in 2010, 0.5 people out of 100,000
votes created in-person, verifiable voter fraud. On absentee ballots in
2010 it was 12.5 people per 100,000. So that's what, 25 times as much,
in absentee ballots. The total for the two periods 2008 and 2010 was 4.2
people per 100,000 of absentee voters. So as a percentage, the rate is
actually 7 times higher for absentee voter fraud. And if you think about
it, it makes sense. If there's a 30 year old who wants to vote for his
grandfather, I ask you what is more likely. That he shows up in person
on election day to vote for someone that is 60 years older than he is
and that they know the date of birth on the....</p>

If we wanted to treat everybody the same which is what I hear that this
is not about separating people that we should treat them all the same.
The same ID requirement  whether you’re there in person or not for
absentee as in person. Whatever is constitutional for one class of
voters should be constitutional for all of them. You have the
opportunity today right here right now to show this legislation isn’t
about partisan gain. That it truly is about fairness. I’d ask for your
support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson has done a good job of laying out how complicated
it was as we were working to try to figure out how do we do absentee
balloting and the photo ID in person. It is very complex. And I could go
through point by point on all the reasons we picked the things we did.
But I’ll just give one example. He talked about the poll workers and you
go in, in and the, the poll workers signing off to say they know them.
Well, the odds of me finding two people who actually know me to sign it,
it’s a lot greater than the odds that I’m a walk in the poll and they’re
gonna automatically know who I am.  We’ve also got the issue of just
because you have a copy of my grandmother’s ID and you mail it in with
an absentee and have it signed with my grandmother’s name on it doesn’t
mean that was my grandmother sending in the form. So we do request that
you not support the amendment. Vote no on the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Murray please state you purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. I would also arise and ask that you do not support this
amendment. First the notary public provision of this absentee ballot
amendment is, is just completely unworkable. And we’ve had, we’ve had
concerns that the two signature requirement was too much. We’ve added,
we’ve doubled the signature requirement in this legislation. So I,I
think, I think what you’ve got in this legislation we agree that there
are, there are some things we need to do to tighten up how absentee
ballots are requested. And I would submit that to you that this
legislation does that. Now we do, we do require with the form with the
standardized form that you have to have a copy of your driver’s license
or a copy of a HAVA document. Currently you just have to have a hand
writer request. That’s it. In order to get an absentee ballot all you
have to do is hand address, hand address, hand write the request out and
you get a ballot. We are tightening that up with this legislation. You
have to have your last four of your social or a driver’s license number,
a HAVA document or a copy of your driver’s license. This is tightening
up the absentee process which is good for voter integrity. I would ask
that you do not support this amendment and support the bill as
originally written to help improve the integrity of the absentee
process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
join my fellow primary sponsors and asking you to vote no for the
amendment. Again the notarized portion of the amendment itself is
problematic and I’m sure that would a cost to the voting process for the
notary for the individual as well as a hardship. And the point of the
bill is not to create a hardship in the voting process. If for one, if
one were to accept this for absentee balloting then it follows natural
suit you would want to have the same provision for someone who shows up
for curbside balloting which we’ve generous in that respect as well. I
urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Deborah Ross please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker
and ladies and gentleman. I think that probably one of the most
important parts of what Representative Jackson shared with you was the
facts about the type of voter fraud that’s committed in North Carolina.
Though it’s not a lot of voter fraud there’s significantly more voter
fraud that is committed with absentee ballots. And that just has not
seemed to be a concern when we’ve talked about this bill. There have
been some changes. Yes, that’s fine. But there have not been tremendous
barriers placed in the, in, in front of people who wanted to do absentee
voting. I’m not trying, I’m not saying that we should shut down absentee
voting. What I’m saying that if you really care about the integrity of
the ballot, don’t talk about people who show up and try to impersonate
other people. It rarely happens. Recognize where there have been
problems and vote for the solutions. I think that Representative Jackson
has done a narrowly tailored rational solution to this problem and if
you really care about fraud you would vote</p>

Thank you. I just wanted to clarify a few things, Mr. Speaker. One, I
wanted to make sure people understand this is a photo ID or notary, not
both. You don't have the expense of a notary if you have the photo ID.
The second thing is, I have a list of states,  proved workable in

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Representative Murray. I had this question when you outlined
section 9 of the bill, on the curbside voting, would you clarify for me
letter E? Does that mean, that the person who brings the voter must also
have an ID? I'm not clear about what that is saying.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I'm on my dashboard, so I'm going to sit down. I'm not being
disrespectful by sitting down, looking at my computer to get to the
section you're looking at. Section 9, part E.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes. That would be line 41.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, we have identified a process in this

amendment addresses the issue of allowing our state tribes to use their
tribal card as an official document for the purpose of voting. Those
tribes are the ??, the ??, the Lumbe, the O'Harian, the ??, ?? of the ??
nation, the ??, and the ?? tribes. This amendment will give these tribal
members, who are enrolled and who have an official tribal card, an
opportunity to use that document for the purpose of displaying and
having a ballot. I have a copy of my tribal card, this card was issued
and it was issued in accordance to our process to receiving that card. I
had to present several documents to prove who I was, that I am a member
of the tribe, I had to submit a certified birth certificate. I had to

by inserting the following between those lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the House, many of you
probably know that I spent 40 years of my life in higher education
teaching at Bennett College in Greensboro. Our education has had a
stellar reputation in North Carolina with our 16 public universities,
our 36 private colleges in universities. And we spend a lot of time
involving students in civic engagement, and pressing upon them the need
to be responsible citizens by voting. And overall, students have
demonstrated that they are interested in their state, local and national
government. After all what we do in fact, and in fact impacts them in
terms of the laws that we passed, our private colleges and our
universities and the students who attend them should be valued equally
and voting privileges should be valued equally as well. And many of
these schools are in our districts and many of us in this House at least
30 members in this house and I've provided a list for you, have attended
these institutions, have earned degrees from them and some of you have
earned two degrees from more than one private institution. And those of
us who may not have attended them have them in our districts. I was
privileged to study at North Carolina A&amp;T State University. This
amendment that was just read is really about giving citizens of our
state who happen to be students attending private colleges and
universities the same rights that we are affording in this bill to
students who attend our public universities as it relates to ID cards
issued by their schools to be accepted when they vote. Now, you need to
know that 16 states already require a college ID for students to vote
and none of them make a distinction between public and private
university student IDs. All students are treated equally. And if you
look at the cards that I have provided for you, I have public
university, private university as well. You see the student's photo, you
see the student's name, the ID number and the expiration date. And the
school that they attend is identified on the card as well. So this is a
good amendment, it's really about fairness. It is the right thing to do
and I would appreciate your support for the many students who you
represent who are constituents in your districts, who are attending
schools in North Carolina and who help make this state as rich as it is.
And I would appreciate your support and I commend the amendment to you.
Thank you.

For those of you all who sat through all the other committees we had,
this has come up regularly and in fact I wanted to thank Representative
Adams for giving us a nice picture of one of our own Sergeant-at-Arms
who I didn't know was in law school, so I'd like to commend him the next
time I see him. However, the reason we have not included them is because
we always have to draw the line somewhere and so we say we would do
government issued IDs. Once we go to private universities then what
about our businesses, Bank of America is a large business that has…</p>

ID cards but then you get down to the smaller business’s ID card.  We
had to draw the line somewhere.  We also had the issue of what
constitutes actually being a college in North Carolina now that you’ve
got more online educational tools.  So we decided to draw the line at
government issued ID’s.  Any of those students that go to the private
universities are likely to have driver’s licenses and if by some chance
they don’t have another form of government issued ID we will be happy to
help them get a non-operator ID card that will qualify for them to vote
and make sure that they know about it through the VIVA program that will
be sure to educate them on how to get that card should they need it.  We
ask you to vote against the amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’d like to ask the lady a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Samuelson does the lady yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Samuelson as it relates to students
who attend these colleges and universities who have ID, who have
driver’s licenses are we going to recognize a driver’s license from a
state that I come from like New Jersey?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes if it’s not expired or it’s within the time
limits on there.  If it has a date of issuance or a date of expiration
and has their picture on it and it’s a photo ID.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  But you really think we should draw the line and not
allow these students who attend these universities that by the way we do
support.  We provide tuition, scholarships to students who attend our
public universities, our private schools because there are 89000
students.  89000 students in these 36 schools, who attend these colleges
and so you really think that we should draw the line and ex out these
89000 students?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  We’re not ex-ing out those students.  We’re making
sure that people who have a government issued photo ID are allowed to
vote and we will do everything we can to make sure they’re included in
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Luebke please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To speak on the ?? actually if I might speak to ask
Representative Samuelson a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Samuelson does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Representative Samuelson.  I ask you this
in the finance committee and I know that there’s sociologically and
there’s a difference between Duke students and NCCU students but I just
can’t understand and want you to again explain why I should tell a
constituent who is from NCCU that you’re okay, you can run on down with
that ID and vote but tell a student from Duke that he or she can’t do
that.  I just don’t understand why you drew the line where you did.  It
seems to me you could just as easily draw the line and include all
college students as being eligible with their student IDs to vote.
What’s wrong with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   We could’ve drawn the line in a number of places.
We chose the cleanest and clearest way to do it was to draw it on
government issued IDs and we would do everything we could to make sure
they had access to those IDs should they need them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  May I speak on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Speaker, members.  This is a good
amendment simply because it will allow all college students to have
equality in terms of their ability to vote.  Drawing the line, I don’t
think that Representative Samuelson said anything  except she has to
draw the line somewhere but certainly college students are essentially
all alike in terms of their decision to register to vote at their
college address which where they are nine months of the year.  That is
supported by the courts so they may do that notwithstanding a bill that
got filed in the Senate running contrary to that.  It just makes no
sense to me and I don’t think really if you represent Davidson, the area
around Davidson College or Livingston College, ?? College or Barton
College, how can you really defend that to those students that they
have, they can’t just use their student ID to vote?  So I know these
amendments are going down but I don’t think you can explain it logically
to students, to those college students in your district.  So thank you.
Hope you’ll support the amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To speak briefly on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  I was interested in Representative
Samuelson's response to Representative Adams and Representative
Samuelson said that's just where the government or where they chose to
draw the line.  Governments do draw lines.  Government line drawing on
fundamental constitutional rights is a treacherous business.  They have
to be drawn where there is a compelling governmental interest to draw
that particular line and that line has to be very narrowly tailored and
drawn and since their record is absolutely shorn of any evidence
anywhere in any hearing that the ID's at Methodist University or Bennett
or Peace or Davidson or Wake Forest are any less reliable or valid that
those at Fayetteville State or Carolina or Western Carolina and because
those are exactly the same students trying to use their ID's in exactly
the same way and with no evidence in the record to make this
classification, the classification being made is quentisentially
arbitrary and capricious and sets up a major and first constitutional
test of this legislation and it is precisely the reason that so far as I
can tell almost no other state in the union that has voter ID laws makes
this distinction.  For that reason I am going to be voting for the
amendment and for those of you that want to preserve this bill, I would
hope that you would be voting for it as well.

list of the acceptable documents and the justification for doing it,
doesn't the fact that there is some degree of control by the government
over the issuance of these licenses, an area of authority that we would
not have over a private entity, say a Bank of America or a Duke
University?

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, certainly
we've got some very skilled debaters in this body and I don't want to
match wits with them but I don't want to leave the impression that has
been made that there are 89,000 students that will be disenfranchised if
this amendment is not adopted.
There are very few college students in this state no matter where they
go to school and that don't have a driver's license.  When you go to
vote you show a state issued ID which is for all practical purposes a
driver's license.  Now there are going to be a handful of students for
various reasons that don't have a driver's license and in that instance
then they can show their student ID but for most parts, don't be fooled
into thinking that there are 89,000 students that are going to be
disenfranchised.  The vast majority have a driver's license.

and gentlemen this just adds one more exception to the list of
exceptions on page two for people who, for people whom the governor or
president of the United States has declared their county a disaster
area. It will give them the opportunity to cast a vote without having a
photo ID, considering it may have been lost with the rest of their
belongings or for whatever reason they may have been displaced. And this
is something that we can sort of relate to the hurricanes in New Jersey.
We're looking at a small window of time here where people would have to
come up with a driver's license, get into their polling place to vote,
and this exception just allows them to have the time to do that, but
short of that time to be able to sign a declaration stating that they
are a part of a disaster area. I urge your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To

Representative Fisher an award for persistence-y on this. She brought it
up in every committee and we kept trying to work on the language, and
I'm going to let the other two bill sponsors address this as well, we
are going to ask you to support this amendment. It has now been narrowed
down to just the areas where the disaster has occurred so that if
somebody comes in and wants to vote and there's been a disaster that
they're not going to have to try to get back there twice when there
could be road issues, flooding issues, that sort of thing. I commend the
amendment sponsor for working with us on complications before and we do

support this amendment and remind everyone if you just read the
amendment there are only two individuals that can declare a disaster,
the president and the governor. Disaster declarations are narrowly
tailored to specific areas so this would be narrowly geographically
defined. How we had it originally defined, is that someone would come to
the election, come the polling location on election day and say they
were subject to a natural disaster and then have to come back and fill a
form out later. This allows them to fill the form out on election day
and two individuals declare disaster and I think this is pretty narrowly
defined and I would ask that you support the amendment. [SPEAKER

Amendment AST 52. Representative moves to amend the Bill on page 2,
lines 37, 38 by inserting the following between those lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr Speaker, members. This amendment is one that was
run in appropriations the other day and let me state very briefly the
basis for it. First, it is predicated on Alabama Law which looks to this
exact kind of language but the idea behind it I think is more basic. If
we believe that voter id and the photo id is really necessary to make
sure that the person voting is who they say they are, as a way to
protect the integrity of the voting process. And I know a number of
people in here believe that and I accept that they believe that to be
true. The whole goal then is to make sure that the person voting is in
fact who they say they are but photo id obviously in every circumstance
isn’t the only way to do that. In fact on some occasions, whether it’s
someone who is elderly who has voted for fifty years at the precinct,
someone who has just come back from returning overseas and but has grown
up in that precinct is as Representative Jackson talked about that in
his speech. There are times that people may not get their photo id in
time. If the person who shows up at the poll because they’ve always
voted, they’re known by the people, they’ve grown up in that
neighborhood and two elected officials, two election officials, the
neutral officials whoever they are, personally identify him and both,
the voter and the two elections officials sign a declaration of his
identity or her identity then they ought to be able to vote. It is, if
we are not put form over substance, we are not put form over fundamental
right. The goal here is to get it right and to allow the voter who is
perfectly eligible to vote and who we all know is the voter. And so it
may be that the elections officials then tell them, “look, this is your
one shot, you may not be alleged to do this again but you get to do it
because the law allows you here to do it under, under these kinds of
circumstances but to say, “I’m so sorry Jack, we know you for fifty
years, now we know you to be honorable, we know you always voted, I’m
sorry you forgot your card, I know its 6’o clock in the afternoon on
election day but we’re not going to let you vote” makes no sense to me
at all under those circumstances. Now will they be allowed to then vote
visionally and will have to come back? Well that, that may work if they
are able to come back. And so the problem I think becomes, are we
exhalting form over substance? And I think that that just doesn’t make
any sense and neither did the state of Alabama. And so I would ask for
your support. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Couple of points here. One, remember that taking one piece from another
state because I think the second amendment would do the same thing to
it, is not taking it in context. Just because Alabama did it doesn’t
mean that it would necessarily fit here because it’s not the full
context of the Bill. Secondly from a logistical standpoint, I’ve changed
precinct several times in the last ten years so we have a more mobile
society. Part of the issue, in fact somebody in committee I think said,
that this is part of the problem not the solution, whereas the society
becomes more mobile. You do have areas where people may know you but you
have other areas where they may not. And people talked about creating
different classes of voters. In a way will this not in some way create a
 class of voters, the one who has lived there long enough to know their
precinct worker and the one who moved in four months ago who doesn’t? So
we think we need to keep with what we’ve got which is a voter id and
we’ll do everything we can to help them and if the poll worker knows
Jack, he needs to make sure Jack has during this phase-in period, the
time to go and get his id and have it with him the next time he comes to
vote. I ask you to vote against the amendment.

People will come in and they've just got their children from ____, they
just finished dinner, they rush into the polls and they're asking,
&quot;Am I too late?&quot; Well, under this bill, no matter if they've
lived there 50 years, they will be too late if they don't have an ID.
This amendment is a reasonable alternative to making sure we have the
person they say they are but not making them turn around and leave and
be denied the right to vote, and I ask your support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, this amendment is based on our sister
state South Carolina law and it deals with the issue of reasonable
impediments to getting the ID. What it basically says is a recognition,
again, in our human frailty, in our human condition, and things happen.
They may be time particularly, let's say, people who have moved here,
passed the 2014 election and the timeframe for the test run. We're
heading into the real thing in 2016 and because of four specific things
that South Carolina suggests but other states do others, that there may
be time that there's a reasonable impediment to getting the ID and those
deal with prolonged disability or illness, where they've had no
transportation to obtain photo ID and here I want to take a point, a
privilege to talk about this.
I didn't think in my district, for example, or my old
district...Representative Szoka now has part of this district...that
that much exists, that I really didn't think I understood that. A few
years ago, I went to an outlying part in the rural part of the district
for a totally different reason and knocked on a series of homes in a
very rural area and most of them were very elderly people. It was more a
discussion of healthcare but I found out that a vast majority of people
in this couple mile area hadn't gotten out of their homes, didn't have a
car or transportation, hadn't seen a doctor in 20 or 30 years, had never
been to the library, had never done anything except when the church van
picked them up to go to church, and relatives would bring them
groceries. So the lack of transportation really is a problem in some
places.
The lack of a birth certificate is third. For those, particularly in
eastern North Carolina, who know, there are a number of families and
people over the years and generations who lack those certificates.
Finally family responsibilities...</p>

for a sick or infirmed spouse or dependent.  For those of us who have
been in that position, or are currently in that position, we understand
that that is an overriding obligation, and sometimes it's just going to
take the priorities, so you just don't get out to do what you set out to
do.  And what the statute simply allows is some discretion to the local
board of elections to allow these people to vote when they believe there
is a credible, reasonable impediment to the person not getting the photo
ID, and at the same time, totally able to challenge it, if the voter
says that, puts it in an affidavit, that the board says, No, we really
don't think that's credible, then the board can say that and don't allow
them to vote.  But if they do believe it to be credible, if the person
signs an affidavit to that effect, then it's one of these things, i
think that as human beings to human beings, we ought to allow that
person the opportunity to vote.  South Carolina did, so should North

Samuelson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I wanted to point out that once again, the comparison
to another state.  South Carolina did not have a phase in period, and
did not have Viva.  It also didn't have as comprehensive a free ID as we
have.  But, I want to go back to the Viva thing in particular on this
amendment.  The Viva is going to be an outreach, it's going to be an
outreach to churches, it will be an outreach to community board of
elections, it will be an outreach to schools and other groups, and the
kinds of people that are shut in as mentioned by Representative Glazier,
it is unfortunate that we have people in our community that have these
kinds of extra challenges in their life that can make getting an ID a
little more complicated.  However, with the phase-in period, and with
the viva period, we will be providing as much opportunity as possible to
reach out to those people and make sure they have an ID, or that they
know how to do an absentee ballot.  So, I ask that you not support the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Baskerville, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Just to follow up with what
Representative Samuelson said, in fact South Carolina did make an effort
to enact a similar voter ID bill, as to ours.  This particular provision
is lifted directly from South Carolina's voter ID bill.  The bill that
did not pass federal scrutiny without this provision in there.  The bill
that did pass federal scrutiny after they included this provision in
their bill.  The amendment, it requires folks to show photo ID cards,
unless they can show a reasonable impediment in obtaining one.  My
colleague, Representative Glazier just talked about what a reasonable
impediment is.  If they have a reasonable impediment to obtaining an ID,
they can sign an affidavit to that effect, and then the local officials
are to count that ballot, if they find that it is credible, if they find
the affidavit credible, and that they find that the person is who they
are saying they are.  This amendment gives local officials the ability
to say, Alright, this affidavit is not credible, I don't think there's a
reasonable impediment to you obtaining an ID, caught and requiring that
person to get a card.  This gives more authority and discretion to our
local officials, who I have complete confidence in, regarding their
ability to administer our election laws, and our elections efficiently
and properly.  I have total confidence in them for that.  Why is this
particular amendment important?  Number 1, it's important because it
allows folks the right to vote, it allows them to vote on the spot, also
it's important if this body wants this law to pass federal scrutiny.
It's important for it to be included.  If you want to spend millions of
dollars defending this in federal court, for the court to just come back
and say.</p>

Our political signed ordinance authority.
Senator Tillman is recognized to explain the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. President.  Members, this bill simply
clarifies that the municipalities may enforce the ordinance that
pertains to political signs that deal with the state roads and highways.
As you know, all municipalities have a state road or highway. All that I
know of anyway, goes through their municipality. This simply clears it
up that they may enforce that legislation, as they would any other
legislation. Even though they are within the municipality. And I think
this’ll make it uniform as people that are running in multi–districts or
statewide , it’ll be a little more clear to them about the ordinance
pertaining to the signs. Appreciate your vote.

Thank you Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen.  Senate Bill 201 will
allow anyone who has obtained a federal permit to purchase and possess a
suppressor to use it when hunting. This legislation is supported by the
Wildlife Resource Commission, and I appreciate your support.
Is there any further discussion or debate?
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President.
Senator Walters for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill.
Senator Walters has the floor to speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] As most folks know in this chamber, I’m from rural
North Carolina and have a great respect for hunting and been a part of
hunting all my life. But, being a member of the Forest Products
community, and having to go into the forest every day, in a working
environment, I have concerns about folks hunting with silencers. It’s
dangerous. Also, being a land owner in eastern North Carolina, and
living on a farm, we always step outside the office, or outside the
house. If you hear a gunshot go off, you know someone is trespassing on
your land. I’m all for hunting, all for the second amendment for bearing
arms. I just have huge concerns about using silencers, while you ‘re
hunting. So, I’d ask for you to not support the bill.
Is there any further discussion or debate?
Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President. Thank you Mr. President to ask
the bill sponsor a question.
Senator Randleman ,do you yield for questions?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] I heard this discussed in judiciary, but I didn't pay
as much attention to it as I should have. Would you tell me , Senator,
why we need this bill?
[Speaker Changes] Well, for a lot of  hunters , they have experienced
hearing loss. And I have a letter from one of my audiologists who says
that he has performed hundreds of hearing examinations on people and
that this bill tends to and leans towards helping those people that have
experienced hearing loss from use of firearms over the years. Typically,
hunting rifles, generally fired a round of 160 decibels. A suppressed
rifle varies based on the specific suppressor and the type of
ammunition.  But they typically lower the decibels to between 120 to 140
range.  Anything above 140 range is when the damage which is caused by
the rifles can be permanent damage, and it is irreversible.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President
Senator Tillman
[Speaker Changes] Just a comment. Senator Waters, I've got a farm over
in Alamance County and know the timber’s all been sold. But, I tend to
agree with you. I've had, I've had hunters down there, when we did have
a lot of timber that were hunting and if they had suppressors I probably
wouldn't know they were there. And that concerns me. And one other thing
that concerns me about this bill it is certainly well intended bill,
Senator Randleman, and I.</p>

Thank you very much mister speaker and while there are many things we
may disagree on today the one thing I think we all agree that this bill
will do is make it harder for people to vote. Now how much harder and
why that should be there is much disagreement in the room about. For me
the problem with the bill starts with its premise, in voter fraud. And
the bill resolves an imaginary question. And since it resolves in sense
an imaginary question most of its answers should never really come to
pass and its analysis in my opinion very rarely apply. But to the extent
that the bill really is addressing, what is for some in our society a
real fear, about voter fraud, my suggestions are these. Fear in the
photo id context is particularly problematic since these laws completely
deny the right to vote to one group of legitimate voters, individuals
without a photo id, or typically indigent, and elderly, and often
members of minority populations in order to calm the fears of another
group of voters. Measures that ensure confidence in the electoral system
are important, but their salutary effect has to be balanced against the
burdens they create. Freedom from fear is not a fundamental right but
the right to vote is.
Voting is one of the most fundamental rights under our constitution and
once the state has granted a right to vote it cannot under the federal
constitution, and as representative Michelle I know will talk about
later, it cannot under the state constitution abridge or deny that right
to any groups. And any law restricting fundamental rights is subject not
to rational relationship tests, but to strict scrutiny. So even if it is
reasonable at some point in time fear like other forms of public opinion
it is fickle, and it is malleable, and it is manipulable. And it is
vague and it is an undefined harm and in the photo id context the actual
rights of actual voters and eligible voters who lack an id are
sacrificed to address the fears of other voters.
Those individuals who are harmed by the photo id laws are robbed of the
very means by which they can fight back, participation in the political
process. And unlike fearful voters who wish to express their discontent
with the state of the electoral system, voters without ids can no longer
effectively contribute in the debate over valid access versus valid
security.
People may fear something that does not exist or they may fear something
that does exist disproportionate to the harm it poses. Evidence of
widespread voter fraud was argued in Indiana, and in Georgia, and in
Missouri, and yet the records in all those states that set up their laws
failed to produce any serious evidence in fraud in the proportion to
which it was argued. And if we look at the record of public hearings,
and I really have to say that I thought that representative chair Lewis
did a magnificent job in directing those two public hearings, but if you
look at those two public hearings anecdotal tales abounded, the facts
were almost never seen. And so in a sense this bill is using a sledge
hammer to hit either a real or imaginary fly on a coffee glass table. If
the harm is present, the solution is at  a minimum, fully
disproportionate to the problem.
The cost in the photo id is the abridgment of the fundamental right,
since laws that address one group of voters fears of fraud that may or
may not exist do so at the expense of another group of would be voters,
who's actual right to vote does exist. Law making that places a higher
priority on preventing hypothetical harm rather than protecting actual
rights seemingly adopts William Faulkner's rumination that there is a
might have been which is more true than the truth.
And further if the majority, whether it was the democrats when we were
in control or the republicans  now can strip the minority of rights
simply by reference to fear then the foundations of democracy are
undermined. Such reasoning lacks a logical stopping place. The promise
of democracy carries with it the risk of uncertain</p>

Voter turn out. What is 65% of registered voters cast a ballot. Well
above the national average. This bill this afternoon will attempt to
roll back some of the strong voting that we’ve had in North Carolina.
This bill will block thousands of voters from voting. The General
Assembly really has no legitimate argument for attacking voting rights.
This bill would make it harder for thousands of North Carolinians to
vote, especially our seniors, young people, voters of color, people with
disabilities and the working poor. They should have their voice also
heard at the ballot box. This measure is sometimes we look at it for a
purpose of partisan politics and that’s wrong. Decades ago, courageous
Americans spent their lives fighting for the right to vote. So that
their voice could be heard.  We must keep this fight going and stand up
to those who would fight against it. We have a great opportunity today
and I’m quite sure that some on the other side probably feel the same
way but for certain pressures you’re afraid to vote along with what you
know is right. But I call upon you as people of conscience. It’s time
that we do the right thing.  I think the thing Ken Goodman said is, to
show good partisan politics.  To show that we can work together on
issues that sometimes we can’t seem to get our hands wrapped around. But
I’d encourage all of us this afternoon to do the right thing and I would
ask that you would join with many of us who will vote no to this
legislation.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Deborah Ross, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. I think we’ve
talked about this bill it seems like for two weeks now and for some of
us, two years. But I want to just emphasize two practical effects that
this bill is going to have and who will probably be affected the most.
We’ve talked a lot about who might not have IDs and who’s going to have
to be the target of this VIVA program. But when we’ve looked at the
people in North Carolina who don’t have IDs and then we think about who
they are and whether or not they’re trustworthy. Every bit of data we’ve
gotten about who the greatest population is of people who don’t have
ID’s comes up with the same result.  It’s older women.  It’s basically,
well for me, my grandmother.  But for some people it might be an aunt or
your mother. These are people who are the least likely to have an ID
that matches, either to have one or one that matches up to the poll
book. They’re also frequently if they were born in North Carolina, the
least likely to have a birth certificate.  Because it used to be in
North Carolina that a lot of people were born at home. We’re trying to
bring that back a little back this session with the midwives. But they
are not basically your profile for people that are fraudulent voters.
They’re people that have contributed to their families and contributed
to their communities. And I think when we talk about this we forget a
lot about it.  That we’re hearing all about, let’s do this digital
imaging and there might be illegal immigrants and we don’t like the
college students.  Let’s be honest.  Every bit of data says this bill
will make it more difficult for grandma to vote. Now let’s talk about
who the bill is going to effect in the mean. It’s going to affect  every
single solitary voter in North Carolina. And in particular it’s going to
affect every single solitary voter if some of the other bills that we
see coming down the pipe get passed. Like the ones who talk about having
fewer voting sites open, the ones that cut down on early voting, the
ones that cut down on Sunday voting. Because guess what? It’s going to
take longer to vote. It’s just, there gonna be longer lines. In this
building there’s this whole complicated challenge if you don’t look like
who you say you look like.  Might be the first time in North Carolina
that some people who have thought that a lot of black people look alike,
don’t start looking alike.  Its gonna take longer, it’s going to be more
contentious at the polls. And that’s it going to make it harder for
everyone to vote. So think about that if this bill goes into effect and
you start to hear from your constituents.</p>

That you have just made it more inconvenient for them to vote. Please
vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Alexander, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of the bill’s sponsors and to make a statement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To which sponsor does the gentleman wish to direct his question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I’ll start with my good friend, Representative Samuelson and.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ll begin there. Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question is simple. I was perusing through my nightstand copy of the
State Constitution and I came across this language in Article VI,
Section 4, which says that every person presenting himself for
registration shall be able to read and write any section of the
Constitution in the English language, and I was wondering how that
squared up with the bill before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I’m going to defer that to Representative Murray because he has
volunteered to handle all of the constitutional questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murray, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman may state his response.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That provision of the Constitution of North Carolina has been ruled
unconstitutional by the U.S. Constitution, so it does not apply.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wish to direct another question to another member?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I’d like to ask our learned sponsor a question. He just said that
section has been ruled unconstitutional. I was under the impression that
it was affirmed in the 1950’s case in that it’s ?? because of the
Federal Voting Rights Act which is in itself being challenged.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield. Mr. Speaker, it’s my understanding that the Supreme, the United
States Supreme Court has invalidated this notwithstanding any provision
of the, what you’re talking about the Federal Voting Rights Act which is
before the Supreme Court right now. And I believe a decision might be
this fall. But at the end of the day, there’s no way that we could
enforce this provision as well. As far as application of the Voter ID
Law that we have before us that we’re debating, and this provision of
the constitution, I do not see any nexus between those two provisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaker, I would now like to just make my statement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m going to quote from a letter to Mr. Henry Ashbury penned on November
19, 1858, by a young Abraham Lincoln, he said and I quote, “The fight
must go on. The cause of civil liberty must not be surrendered. At the
end of one or even one hundred defeats.” I think that quote is appro-po
because at the end of the day all of our discussion is about whether or
not this bill advances the cause of access to the machinery of
government by our citizens or whether it retards that process. And on
the side of the rubicon where I’m standing, it seems to be a measure
though much better than the measure first advanced during last session,
it is a measure that still makes it more difficult for the exercise of a
fundamental constitutional right, which is the right to vote, the access
to register. And for that reason though this bill is better than it was,
I still believe it to be unnecessary and I still cannot find a reason
why we need it or why I should vote for it. Thank you.

Representative Glazier please state your purpose.

&quot;Messiness everywhere, but wide spread participation furthers
democratic legitimacy by producing a government that reflects the will
of all people and allows diverse groups of citizens to hold government
officials accountable to their decisions. Representative Samuelson
talked earlier I believe about the Carter-Baker commission the
Carter-Baker commissions report that led to the idea of voter id. It's
interesting to note that on the basis upon which the Carter-Baker
commission issued it's report was invoking the results of the 2004
Wisconsin election, here's what they said. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
investigators said they found more than 200 cases of felons voting
illegally and more than 100 people who voted twice, using fake names or
false addresses, and voting in the name of a dead person. More over
there were more than 4500 voters cast than voters listed. Commission
Susan Malonary a republican and former congress woman asserted that the
photo id requirement was justified because the election in Wisconsin
decided by illegal votes. A fact established in a joint report she said
by the US attorneys office, the FBI, and the chief of police both
republicans and democrats. Unfortunately those Wisconsin numbers ended
up being not true and misleading. In fact of the nine double voting
individuals named by the republican party at the time of their press
conference in Wisconsin, none were ever indited by the republican
appointed us attorney, six of the cases involved clerical errors. and in
three cases the individual who voted had a similar name but with a
different birth dates, in Chicago, Madison, and Minneapolis. So we know
that there's a real need at this arena, to get past our fear and our
anecdotes and our emotions into the facts and yet that record in this
case, is almost short of any evidence or facts. You know, we have too
major problems in the end with this bill. The first is in what kinds of
voter id were going to use if we are going to do this. The rationale was
that we would accept any public identification except of course the two
votes in committee we would except public high school identification.
Then the rationale  continued but we will have public id's but we won't
except any private ids. With no evidence at all to support why the ids
at Wake Forest or Duke or Elan are any less secure or valid that the ids
at Fayable State, or North Carolina NT, or ECU, or Western Carolina.
Then we have the issue of what can substitute for the photo id. What we
know is that there doesn't need to be a photo id for absentee balloting
where all the reports say that if you got any fraud that's really there,
but where the reports say that there's less fraud in person, in where
you have the ability to see and you have other options and alternatives
that most states apply there we are going to apply the strictest
standard and require the id. Completely different than how we are
treating the classic people who are voting absentee. Leading to the
conclusion as Representative Jackson said is truly the idea of, no id
vote absentee. Hardly one that would instill confidence in the justice
system, or the electoral system, or what we want to encourage. In the
end what have we done is two things. We have as I said earlier made it
hard for every North Carolinean to vote. Secondly we have created tears
in tears in classifications in voters. Some need id, some don't, some
can use the identification they have, others can't. It seems to me we
have made the wrong call under the constitution of the state of North
Carolina, and under the federal constitution, and there is no guard for
this decision so benign, as to obscure the import of what this bill
does, in doing what we have done we make the system less free and less
fair and less accessible, and this bill instead creates a cost
unnecessarily, creates obstacles and inequality, limits accessibility,
we tread on this territory at our peril, and I am thatically decent from
this bill and on the path that majority taken and will be voting no for
these reasons, thank you.&quot;</p>

There was scripture that I was fond of when I was a little boy. It was
the book of Daniel. And it is common, a common story about the
handwriting on the wall. And none of the wise men of Babylon could
figure out what this translation that this mysterious hand on the wall
wrote. And I’ll be very brief. It said that God has numbered your
kingdom. He has weighed you in the balances and have found you wanting.
Mr. Speaker. Thank you for your, thank you for your indulgence and I
oppose this bill and ask that you do as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. It
deeply distresses me that some of the opponents of this bill have
brought the issue of race into this discussion. As a Christian I believe
as the Bible teaches that we’re all descended from the one man Adam. To
me this means that there’s only race the human race. We just happen to
come in a variety of colors. The color of our skin is merely genetic
trait just like our eye color or our hair color or whether we tend to be
tall or short or fat or slim. I tend to be on the fat side sorry to say.
But skin color I say makes no difference absolutely no difference to
God. And should make no difference to us. And we shouldn’t allow it to
come into these kind of things. And it shouldn’t, it shouldn’t matter.
So I’m offended by the suggestion that this bill is intended to suppress
the vote of people who are not white because to me this bill seeks to
address the issue of voter fraud. So to say that it is intended to
suppress the vote of citizens who are not white is to say that only
non-white people are likely to commit voter fraud. And that idea offends
me on behave of my brothers and sisters who are not white. Cuz I believe
that white people are just as capable of voter fraud as anyone else. So
to say this bill was meant to suppress the vote of people who are not
white is really I think an insult to them. And I reject that. My second
point I’d like to make is to address the idea that there is little or no
voter fraud in the state of North Carolina. A great deal of public
comment addressed to the elections committee indicates that there is.
But even if we accept the idea that there is no voter fraud in North
Carolina it reminds me of the story of the fellow who was walking down
the road beatin’ two sticks together. And a friend came along and said
what are you doing with the sticks? He said it’s to keep the Bengal
tigers away. And the guy says there aren’t any Bengal tigers around
here. And he says see how well it works. So I say that an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure. We know that voter fraud does exist
elsewhere and we should not think that we are immune. So before we
simply leave our state open to voter fraud rather than allow voter fraud
to take root in our state I say let’s stop insulting non-white citizens
by the implication that voter fraud is a concern only among them. Let’s
not insult everyone’s intelligence by saying it can’t happen here. And
let’s bolster the integrity of the voting process in this state by
passing this bill. Thank you sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry
Hall please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill as
amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. And I
certainly acknowledge the efforts that were made in having public
hearings on this bill. And I don’t think anybody challenges the fact
that we had a lot of hearings. Now whether or not we took the
information and the facts and whether or not we processed them and put
them in this bill that’s another discussion. But yes we had a good show
a good exhibit of openness and disclosure. And what was the objective of
having those hearings? A lot of money was spent over the last two and a
half years to say there was voter fraud. And I mean millions of dollars.
And we know in electoral politics when you get a good issue you work it.
And if it ain’t broke you don’t fix it. You keep workin’ it.</p>

<p id="175:00">
And so, we seem to be prisoners of our own creation now here in ??, we
said there is a problem that didn't exist and we continued to spend
millions to create that perception in the minds of our citizens and then
even as representative Lewis said now we have to create a bill that
addresses that perception that was created by those millions of dollars
spent in those two election cycles, and so now we're trapped in a cage
of our own making saying 'how do we get out of this box? How do we get
out of this trap?'. We said this problem exists and now we have to say
we have a fix for it so we can walk away when all the time the objective
in - it is a game we all engage in - but the objective was to get
political power and now that we have the power, and we have made the
promise, we have to come up with something that we can pass off as a
solution to the problem. And so, what does this bill do for the citizens
of North Carolina? The perception that we are trying to address, that
fleeting perception that we created, what does this bill do to address
that perception? What did the hearings do to address that perception? We
said the hearings were a fair and open process, but did they that
perception? Even at the start of the hearings we finally acknowledge,
there was no voter prop for all our problems in North Carolina, now the
question is confidence in government. We want to restore the people's
confidence in government. Now this is bearing in mind after we spent
millions of dollars telling them that there was a voter fraud problem in
North Carolina that doesn't exist, now they have a confidence problem
with us and now we want to tell them 'Here's a solution to a problem
that never existed, that we told you existed, and now you don't have
confidence in us, so we're gonna pass a bill to address a problem that
never existed, that we told you existed and now we have to come up with
the solution.' And we can stand there and loop over and over and over
again. We've created two tiers of voters here, and we tried to offer
amendments that would say 'lets not just have voters who present in
person be the standard, but also all the voters, lets have one
standard.', and I've heard members say 'well we don't wanna have two
standards, but we do have and we recognise that and it's documented in
the bill.' We have the power, we're going to pass this out, I know we
are, and that's the way its gonna be, I think my good friend Ed ?? said
it, you gotta elect it, you gotta do what you wanna do, you don't care
what the people say, and you're not gonna apologise, so we understand
that. But we do understand also, that there is some issues out here that
are related to voting that are going to come along as well. Now we tried
to address issues of making voting more accessible to the citizens of
North Carolina, more transparent, it would not delay voting in North
Carolina, and so we submitted bills that would provide for online voting
almost a month before this bill was submitted, and of course they end up
in rules, and everybody knows what rules is. We submitted another bill
approximately a week before this one to provide for early voting, and of
course its been rules, no extensive hearings on it, public not invited
to hear whether or not, or give their opinions as to whether or not
those bills were relevant, or would provide openness and fairness,
they're in rules, in a draw somewhere I would presume, or in the
electronic graveyard on someones computer. And so that concern we say we
have for out confidence in the government is not exhibited or the
solutions we would ask to be discussed and debated in the public. This
bill causes delay in voting, and unfunded mandate on our local voice of
election, and so we know that's going to happen, I hear someone say
'Well, we've got two years form this bill to work.' And that's a good
depiction if you wanna -</p>

buy into it and act like you don't know that the majority of our
citizens, or the great number that we deal with during elections, come
out during Presidential elections. So we know that's when many of the
voters that we won't see until the Presidential year, the year this bill
goes into effect. They will not be engaged and involved in this supposed
glide path toward voter I D. We know what the history is, the volume
during Presidential elections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, please state you purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A point of order. I've been sitting patiently
listening to the debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady may state her point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There's been some attacks on personalities and there's
been some imputing the motives of members, which are breaches of the
House of [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady's point is taken. The Chair will just simply
direct the Member to remain focussed, primarily on the content of the
bill versus the motives and intentions of other Members within the body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and . . . As we look at the
causes of this bill, what caused this bill to come into place and what
are the effects gonna be. And I've heard a lot of information and a lot
of comments directed at the intent, the intent, the intent as long as .
. . etcetera, then we don't have to look at the outcome. But again, the
outcome of this bill is to delay to make it more difficult for citizens
to vote who have that right, who constitutionally have that right and
should be provided that right without that delay. We say justice delayed
is justice denied. Well, the franchise delayed is the franchise denied
to an eighty-eight year old grandmother standing in line who has to wait
even longer because of these provisions. So that's the franchise delayed
and the franchise denied if she can't stand in that line longer. Now the
citizens of North Carolina already said they believe in the system we
have and we've had record turnout in the voting process. So for us to
say now there's a demand or there's a confidence problem, there is no
confidence problem in the system. The confidence problem we now perceive
and see as a confidence problem in us. I hope that's not a . . . when I
say 'us', I hope that no one takes that as a personal criticism. But
that is one directed at us because, as I said, the system itself, if we
aren't the guardians of it, and if we don't respect it, then of course,
we become victims of it. It was once said by Mr. Walt Kelly, &quot;We
shall meet the enemy and not only may he be ours, he may be us&quot;.
This is our system, we're the guardians of it, we have the
responsibility for it and if we don't do the right thing, the effects
will be visited on us in the generations of North Carolinians to come.
So I hope that you will consider what you are doing today. I hope you
will turn away, if not today on this voter I D bill, these other
attempts to limit early voting, to cut out the number of polling places,
to make it more difficult for people to vote at their universities, I
hope you will turn them back in good faith. If you truly believe you're
doing the right thing today in voting for this voter I D bill, then do
not engage in voting for those other bills that will exacerbate the
effect of this and make it more draconian in its effect on our citizens.
Our citizens are from every race and walk of life. Our senior citizens
are from every race and walk of life. Our students are from virtually
every state in the country. So please do not vote today as if this is
the only bill we're gonna do, and then bring those other measures that
will make it worse, and exacerbate it and change the effects of it. I
ask that you vote against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First, I guess I'll make a disclaimer like
Representative Murray. You want to know anything constitutional about
this bill, how about seeing me. I've got forty-seven years of practice
of law in all the courts of the State and the United States. I served as
United States Attorney and I served as a prosecutor, so I might have a
little knowledge about the Constitution and to remind you that in the
law there are always two sides to a question. You'll get one side from
him and you'll get the other</p>

<p id="185:00">
?? I’m going to give you the other side right now. First of all what you
are about to do is pass an unconstitutional law you have sworn to uphold
constitution of the state of North Carolina not in consistent with the
constitution of the United States of America. Let me, let me, and I do
this because I wanted to be very clear. Here’s what the constitution of
North Carolina says when it comes to suffrage and eligibility to office.
Article 6 Section 1 who may vote? Who may vote? Every person born in the
United States and every person who has been naturalized 18 years of age
and possessing the qualification, possessing the qualifications set out
in this article shall be entitled to vote at any election by the people
of the state except as if in provided. That’s article 6 section 1 of the
constitution. Now section two sets out the qualifications of voting and
that’s divided in two sections. One is the resident’s period state
elections the other is the resident’s period for presidential elections
and the third is the disqualification of felons. Now all of this says to
you folks that the constitution that you swore to uphold is the guiding
light setting qualifications for voting. It doesn’t say anything about
motor id, it doesn’t say anything about showing this, that, or the
other. This is talking about voting. Your constitutional right to vote.
But now let’s go look a bit further in this constitution. You go to
section three it talks about registration, not voting, registration. It
says every person offering to vote shall be at the time legally
registered as a voter as here in prescribed and in the manner provided
by law. General assembly shall enact general’s laws governing
registration of voters not the casting of the vote but the registration
of voters. So, so I guess I am going to give you a solution to the
problem let’s get registration id rather than voter id when you go to
register the age we live in now you can take a picture when you go
register digitize it and put it in the file and then when you go to vote
you don’t have to show voter id because when you give your name they can
bring up the picture and see who you are. Now to me you want a solution
that’s it but to go against your own constitution stating that you don’t
have the power to put qualifications on this you can only do it by a
constitutional manner which sets up additional qualifications. Now just
go back to the 1868 constitution where one of the qualifications prior
to that constitution was that you must owe property before you could
vote or hold office. That was a qualification the 1868 constitution took
that out. So that even more ?? of the fact that the qualifications for
vote are put in the constitution and this is the way you ought to go.
Now folks, we embark on things and I agree with Representative Hall and
I agree with the majority leader representative Starnes you got the
power to do anything that what you want to do and you don’t have to
listen to us and I am about to say some things that you ain’t going to
like. But it don’t make no difference to me whether you like it or not
my folks sent me here to do what I’m supposed to do. But im going to
give you a little history because voting is important to a certain group
of people in this state and in this Nation. And it is important because
that group of people</p>

Had to fight, had to fight you to get that right the right that you
already had. You had no idea, that anybody had to fight for the same
rights that you had.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mister speaker point of order
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
representative Stevens pleas state your point of order
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Are we gonna history lesson or are we gonna stay relevant to the bill. I
think we have gone a little far a way from that in therms of imputing
motives again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The lady point is taken. The chair would just ask representative Michaux
to just stay focused and specific. References to you, if you is directed
to members of the caucuses, is clearly out of order. Or members of this
chamber is clearly out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Well mister speaker, all I was doing is trying to give a little history
of why this bill is unnecessary, and that's where I'm going. and I told
you I was gonna say some things some body ain't going to like, and that
is the way is turning out to be. Here again we had to fight for the same
rights  that you have. What you are doing is you putting and impediment
another impediment. That you don't have the right under the constitution
to do. Is just that simple if we have to go back and fight for that
right, like we had to fight for it before, then its gonna have to happen
that way. Because you gonna set it up for it to happen that way. This
bill is not necessary, we had good fair and free election in this state.
Some folks came in and talk to about some fraud, I had one lady come in
form Durham,  to talk abut fraud being in Durham by a person who was
dead, and voting. The unfortunate ting about it she call the persons
name, and I knew the person who was dead. I also know the son who had
the same name, still voting the election. Director in Durham wrote and
sent you all emails telling you that the lady was wrong. Yes his father
had died in 2002. But his son how was name the same thing, live with him
and living in the same place, that he live then, was voting and he
living and he is living. They told you about 69 fraudulent votes in
Nashville. I look back and say 'well they may have a point there. But
they never told you that those 69 votes, they say were fraudulent,
weren't counted. They never told you that. We got a good system. Why do
you want to feather it up with more bee stings. That are gonna cause
more people not to vote, there gonna cause people not to exercise that
constitutional right. You talk bout having to show ID to board a plane,
to cash a check. You ain't got no right to to board a plane or cash a
check. That's a private situation that's not a constitutionally
guaranteed right. So that's not bad. The only thing that you got here,
is that you are trying to do something that your constitution wont let
you do, and I would suggest that you think long and had about it.
Because since you won't let me history, to try to keep you from making
the same mistake. That a lot of other people make, particularly
republicans made.

law suits. That you not going to be able to defend.

<p id="195:00">
untrue assertions made repeatedly with the idea that the constant
repetition of something untrue can render it true. There's several
examples of this, the first is that some voters might be denied the
right to vote by this bill. Students, I, I can't see them from where I
am, mouths taped, someone point out in this bill how those students are
gonna be kept from voting. We've gotten sidetracked on the issue of
student IDs. Well, there's several different forms of IDs that can be
used under this bill to vote and I hope that our educational system,
particularly our colleges and universities are doing a good enough job
that 18 to 20 or 24 year old students can figure out how to get some of
these photo IDs. It just, it baffles me to keep hearing that. Next
there's the assertion that there is no voter fraud. This is a bill in
search of a solution, a solution in search of a problem. And that
assertion just isn't true from the evidence. I understand some dismiss
those who came to the committee and told stories, some of what they had
personally witnessed. And there is a lot of frustration particularly
among some of the core activists who go out and volunteer and stay at
the polls all day and see some of the things that are going on. Dr.
Larry Sabateau, hardly a conservative, he's a professor at the
University of Virginia of political science, Director of the University
of Virginia Center for Politics and author of the book Dirty Little
Secrets: The Persistence of Corruption in American Politics. In
testimony before congress I think put this issue in pretty good
perspective. He said when we look at the registration system and voting
process we have to balance two conflicting values. One the goal of full,
informed participation in, of the electorate, and two the integrity of
the system. To the extent that we keep expanding the participation rate
and make it easier and easier for people to register and vote, we almost
certainly increase the chances for voter fraud. So in a sense it's a
trade off. To move completely in the direction of one value as opposed
to the other is foolhardy. My strong suspicion based upon scores of
investigated and unexplored tips from political observers and
interviewees over the years is that some degree of voter fraud can be
found almost everywhere. And serious outbreaks can and do occur in every
region of the country. In the book Dirty Little Secrets it noted that
some of the liberal activists that had been interviewed for that book
took part justification in fraudulent elect-, electoral behavior on the
grounds that because the poor and dispossessed have so little political
clout, quote, extraordinary measures are required to compensate,
unquote. In Crawford vs. Marion County Election Board, The United States
Supreme Court Decision that upheld Indiana's Voter ID bill, the majority
opinion which was written by Justice John Paul Stevens, one of the
court's most liberal members, said, it remains true that flagrant
examples of such fraud and other parts of the country have been
documented throughout this nation's history by respected historians and
journalists that occasional examples have surfaced in recent years that
demonstrate that not only is the risk of voter fraud real, but that it
could affect the outcome of a close election. In an earlier level of the
same case, in the seventh circuit, the seventh circuit pointed out that
the relative rarity of prosecutions for voter impersonation can be
explained by the endemic under-enforcement of voter fraud cases and the
extreme difficulty in apprehending the voter impersonator. Don't keep,
don't take my word for that fact that voter fraud occurs. We have
witnesses, we have experts, we have Supreme Court appointee-, justices
and we have Chris Matthews of Hardball who said that impersonation voter
fraud has gone on since the fifties. He s-, said that this is how it
happened, someone calls voters to ask them whether they intend to vote,
then all the sudden somebody goes and votes for them. Said Matthews, I-,
quote, I know all about it in North Philly.</p>

<p id="200:00">
It's what went on and I believe it still goes on. John Fund and Hans Von
Spakovsky in their book on voter fraud Who's Counting said,
investigations of voter fraud are inherently political because they
often involve race, they often are not zealously pursued or prosecuted.
Many federal and state prosecutors remain leery of tackling fraud or
intimidation and sentences imposed for conviction are often far too
light. While voting irregularities are common, the number of people who
have served hard time in jail in the last few years as a result of a
conviction for voter fraud can be counted on your fingers, several
prosecutors told the authors they feared charges of racism or a return
to Jim Crow vote suppression ??  if they pursue fraud cases. Another
mistruth is the argument that voter ID laws will suppress voting by
minorities, the poor, and the elderly. This assertion, too, has been
disproved by the observable reality in states which already have such a
law, and it does... I find it a little bit amusing that some of the same
people who believed we should make laws that would cost billions of
dollars based upon a projection of questionable validity that the sea
would rise 39 inches in a hundred years are complaining about addressing
[CROSSTALK]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are we not going a little bit astray here at this
point, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair takes the gentleman's point well. The member
will focus his comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the comments are focused, Mr. Speaker. But the
voter suppression charges... the same type charges, the same
predictions, the same type rhetoric was used in Georgia. And in Georgia,
the actual participation, and this is the problem opponents of this law
have, you have an observable situation in Georgia and Indiana where the
voting participation rate went up. I don't see how you can maintain
still the same arguments you've been maintaining when you've seen it in
the reality on the ground. And I won't go back over those statistics and
it's in all elections, even off-years. The voter participation and
population groups were vigorous opponents of the ID law and said there
would be suppression and disenfranchisement of voters. Far fewer voters
did not have photo IDs than opponents of the law had falsely claimed,
numerous states have voter ID and numerous studies have proven that
voter ID laws do not negatively affect turnout, the voter ID laws do not
suppress voters and that voters are not disenfranchised by such law.
There is no evidence to the contrary, none. In court cases during
discovery, particularly in Georgia, those challenging voter ID laws have
been unable to produce a single person in response to discovery that can
say their vote was or will be suppressed. Not one. In Georgia, the
liberal groups that were challenging the law put out urgent appeals to
hey, give us some names, give us some people, and not one person was
found, not one. If you won't take my word for it, take the word of
Arthur Davis, former congressman from Alabama and active member of the
congressional black caucus, the first representative outside of Illinois
who endorsed in 2007 Barack Obama for president, who seconded the
nomination of Barack Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in
Denver, who has come strongly to support voter ID. Quote, the idea that
people in low income African-American communities are bothered or
intimidated or burdened by attaching just a few responsibilities to
their all-important core right of voting, it's a condescending idea.
It's a patronizing idea. If the law works the same with respect to
everybody, it's free and clear of whatever history or bigotry or racial
animus exists. I've changed my mind on voter ID laws. I think Alabama
did the right thing in passing one and I wish I had gotten it right when
I was in Congress and political office. When I was a congressman, I took
the path of least resistance on this subject for an African-American
politician. Without any evidence to back it up, I lapsed into the
rhetoric of various partisans and activists who contend that [INCOMPLETE

requiring photo identification to vote is a suppression tactic, aimed at
thwarting black voter participation.  He goes on, he says he's seen
wholesale manufacture of balance of the polls, and absentee voting in
the name of the dead, in the nonexistent, and the too mentally impaired
to function, and this cancels out the rights of citizens who are
exercising their rights.  That's suppression, by any light, he says.  If
you doubt it exists, I don't.  I've heard the peddlers of these ballots

Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.

Mr. Speaker, I still raise the same question.  If I wasn't allowed to
complete my historical remarks, then I think he's getting off base too,
sir.  I really do.  If I can finish mine, then I don't have any problem
with him finishing his.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I would just say I am quoting someone who is talking about
the very law with which we are debating.  If that's off subject, then I
don't understand the subject of subjects.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, in this particular case, I do believe the
gentleman is using references to make a point about the voter fraud, and
for that reason your point is not well taken.  The gentleman may precede
for a period not to ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He's talking about
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
3 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Going back to quoting.  Democratic legislators in Rhode Island passed a
law,who had the nerve to support a voter ID law in that very liberal
state.  Voter ID is unlikely to impede a single good faith voter, and
then only gives voting the same elements of security as writing a check
at the store, or maintaining a library card.  The case for voter ID is a
good one, and it ought to make politics a little cleaner, and the
process of conducting elections much fairer.  We've reached the sad
point where so many on the left are now happy to exaggerate fears about
the bad old days coming back, that they no longer represent a meaningful
moral tenure in our national conversation.  The fact is that reasonable
precautions against voter fraud are nothing like the billy club, the
cattle prod and the charging state trooper of the past.  We need to
recognize that, and confront the critics who go over the top on this
issue.  And I close, with Rhode Island, which also has recently passed a
photo ID to vote bill.  Governor Lincoln Chafee, an independent, ignored
the overheated rhetoric, and signed the bill, noting that
&quot;requiring identification at the polling place is a reasonable
request to ensure the accuracy and the integrity of our elections&quot;.
 The democratic cosponsor of the bill said it was wrong for party
leaders to make this a republican vs. democrat issue.  It's not.  It
simply good government.  It's simply a good government issue.  We as
representatives have a duty to the citizenry to ensure the integrity of
our elections, and a requirement to show an ID will ensure that
integrity, and I believe that the government of Rhode Island, the
sponsor were correct, and I urge you to vote for the bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] A lot of people may have read the papers, but us on
the democratic side had suffered a tremendous loss of one of our
colleagues and one of our advisers and one of our consultants. A young
27-year-old woman lost her life yesterday, and it has been really
painful for a lot of us. And could have not met a better person if we
all continuously see her smile all day long today. So we offer our
prayers to Nation, her husband, and ask that you join us in prayer
because this is really a difficult time for us on the democratic side.
Thank you.
