  Senate will come to order. Sergeant at arms close the doors. Members
will go to their seats. Rule 17 is suspended until the end of the
session. Leading the Senate in prayer, the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate
Chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let&#39;s pray. Lord today we need your blessing. Like
Jacob gave to his twelve children, we need your blessing. We come to you
and remember what you said through Aaron. Lord bless you, the Lord keep
you, and the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you his
peace. And certainly Lord we need that peace in the midst of a violent
and strife-torn world. But your love prospers us here, and we ask you
for that love and that blessing today. In Christ&#39;s name, Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President, the journal of Monday, February 16, 2015 has
been examined and is found to be correct. I move the Senate dispense
with the reading of the journal and that it stand approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, the journal for February 16 stands
approved as written. Notices and announcements. Senator Hise, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, Senate Bill 15,
Enhance UI Program Integrity and Reporting, is on today&#39;s calendar.
I move that it be displaced from today&#39;s calendar and put on
tomorrow&#39;s calendar for consideration. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without
objection, so ordered. Any further announcements? Any further business
to come before the Senate? If not, the Chair recognizes Senator
Randalman for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I move that the
Senate do now adjourn, subject to the standard stipulations set forth in
Senate Rule 24.1, to reconvene on Wednesday, Feburary 18, 2015 at 3PM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn, subject
to the standard stipulations, to reconvene Wednesday, February 18 at
3:00. Said motion is seconded by the hardest-working Senator Jeff
Jackson. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, no. The ayes seem to have it. The Senate stands adjourned.
