Our first bill today will be House Bill 517. Representative Jones, you
are recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. House Bill 17 is a
local bill for Rockingham County only, and it provides for no
right-of-way spotlighting for hunting. You say, well, that should be the
case already. The law, as it currently exists, does not allow hunting
deer or game animals with right-of-way spotlight, but what people tend
to do in getting out of being convicted for that is they say they're
hunting coyotes, and so we don't want coyotes in Rockingham County, but
we recognize that public right-of-way spotlighting is dangerous, and so
Rockingham County commissioners are asking that we prohibit all hunting
with artificial lights on the right-of-ways and there's no known
opposition to this bill, but I stand for whatever questions you may
have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move for approval of favorable report. There's
no PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the appropriate time. Any other questions or concerns? Representative
Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman. I know we had all these bills two years ago where we were
doing this or that for one county after another and I think
Representative Jones, you were here with some other small items having
to do with hunting, and my question is is there a way to get state-wide
bills on this stuff? Why would anyone want to allow headlights to shoot
coyotes? Do you know the answer to why we can't have a state-wide bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, you're recognized to answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, I don't know the answer and I don't know that
there would be a problem with that, I'm just bringing the bill because
my county commissioner's asked me to do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, could I just ask staff for an opinion as to could we not have
a state-wide bill on all of this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, you are recognized to address Representative Luebke's concerns.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, you could do a state-wide bill on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion? Further debate? Representative Horn, you're
recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You've heard the motion. Any further discussion or debate? All in favor
say aye. Any opposed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bill passes, thank you Representative Johnson. I might inform the
committee that House Bill 663 has been removed from today's calendar if
it was on the agenda that you had. Our next bill is House Bill 584.
Representative Brisson, you are recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I need a motion to have the PCS before the committee. Representative
Horn makes a motion for the PCS to be before the committee. All in
favor? Any opposed? Representative Brisson, you're recognized to explain
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair and committee members. The PCS, all the PCS does
for this bill is on line 12, it removes from the original bill
&quot;transporting hazardous materials.&quot; It just removes that
wording. The bill is actually just exactly like it leads off, entitled
to act to allow the governor to temporarily suspend routine weight
inspections of trucks prior to severe weather events, and our
commissioner of agriculture supports this strongly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion, at the proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions, further debate? Representative Tolson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there a prior ?? what's your time frame?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's basically what's the bill's purpose. We have had a bill like this
in the past and the DMV had a little problem because we had it specific
times, but this is- farming is year round, so we're taking in crops and
putting in crops, so this is yearly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Following up on Representative Tolson, it seems to me there
ought to be some language that requires the governor to act within two
weeks? Ten days? I mean, you don't have a three-week storm. I'm just
concerned, Representative Brisson, on page 2 whether we could amend that
to say that the governor determines within three weeks or two weeks,
because it's really open-ended. Right now, the governor could do it in-</p>

Representative Brisson, you’re recognized to respond. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to ask, answer Representative Lucas’ question, why not give the
Governor, I mean we never know when the adverse weather’s going to come.
You shouldn’t have a waiting period or you shouldn’t have, and it’s
working directly with Commissioner ?? on the recommendations of it,
which is, these are two of the people that know when it needs to be. I
mean and if you’re around it could happen any time so. This is the
purpose of the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May
I, he asked me a question. May I answer his question? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may answer his question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is the way I look at
it, Representative Brisson. You have a situation in which the Governor’s
very busy and all we’re asking is to ensure that there be a decision
taken within as I’m saying three weeks, you can put in what you want.
But the fact of the matter is we are suspending checking of the weight
of the trucks. And you and I both know there wouldn’t be weight
restrictions if the trucks didn’t do damage to the road if they were
overweight. And I am completely in sympathy with you that under these
circumstances, it can be waived. I don’t have a problem with that. But
the idea that we have no deadline while these trucks are presumably
doing damage to the road if they are overweight, I truly don’t
understand this. I mean it’s your bill, but I would really encourage you
or I’ll work with you to put an amendment up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brisson? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, and I’m going to ask
David, commissioners to respond to it. But I think at the end of the day
this bill actually allows the commissioner to go ahead and move forward
with it, Mr. Luebke. But David. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. ??, you’re
recognized to give an explanation to the concerns of Representative
Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would just point out
that when the Governor declares a state of emergency under the Emergency
Management Act, there are no statutory timeframes built into that. It’s
based on the discretion of the Governor and the needs of the state and I
can assure you that in the situation like this, the highway patrol and
motor carrier safety unit will be offering the other side of the story
and they’ll let the Governor know when is a reasonable time to suspend
it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Chairman. A comment, just to follow up on the previous discussion. I
mean, we’re talking about here specifically temporarily suspending or
vehicles hauling livestock, poultry or crops, ready to be harvested,
that are at risk of damage to the processing facility, or point of
further distribution. It’s very narrow. I don’t see that we need a
deadline or anything. It’s very specific. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is it proper
for the Chair to make a comment? Or would I just carry the bill? [PAUSE]
[LAUGHTER] ?? One of the important aspects of this legislation is not
the issuance of the suspension, but the important language here is when
the suspension ends. And the suspension ends, and this is very critical,
just because the storm is gone does not mean that the threat to the loss
is gone. And the suspension or the lifting of the suspension comes after
as the language points out here, after the threat of damage. And those
are two very different times. If it wasn’t for getting that language in
the statute, there would be no reason for this bill because the
Commissioner at any point can say to the Governor, “You need to
suspend.” So we don’t need legislation for that. Representative Horn’s
recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move for a favorable report
on House Bill 584. Is there a serial referral? Favorable as to the
Committee Substitute. Unfavorable to the original. Is there a referral?
No referral. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’ve heard the motion</p>
