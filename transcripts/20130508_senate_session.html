Speaker: Senate bill 32 the clerk will read,
Speaker Changes: Senate bill 32 ?? and exploration of the bill,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? is recognized to explain the bill,
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr.Speaker and i have my file toady senator
??,
Speaker Changes: This Bill comes from the joint administrative procedure
over side commission we are actually discovered that there are we know
that there are 22000 rules that they out their and published identified
by various ?? many of which are not reviewed for eager accuracy or ?? or
legal authority for as long as twenty years what the bill does it does a
?? for rules review commission review of those rules in some ??  that
they have suggested and then periodic review of every ten years  for ??
of various rules or other provisions stood that generally fall on those
lands i would commend to i had a question raised previously by senator
stone because ?? like need to and we will probably object by third
reading we had like to try and answer for any other further question,
Speaker Changes: if any discussion any debate,
Speaker Changes: Mr president,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? for what purpose you ask ,
Speaker Changes: The gentlemen yells a question,
Speaker Changes: senator ?? do you yell,
Speaker Changes: certainly,
Speaker Changes: Thanks senator ?? this is calls for the APO or the
rules review commission that actually say that the sun setting that
start of the al over again with the rule making it's one table does both
but it's a time such that a sunset is not a current table to various
departments to urge and review the rules what do you have ,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? do you yell,
Speaker Changes: Did you all consider reviews by rules commission and
some process by which all of the if you are stand girls are not appeals
or some line of process that we can file the bill repair or more some
thing more than automatic repair my concern is there are 22000 rules and
probably 21000 of them or Monday rules have to do with process filing
papers for that field that kind of stuff that make state by run i hate
by the whole process with those 21000 not being able to get the pipeline
that time i concerned about the body that you are putting on the system,
Speaker Changes: Mr president frankly they are voluntary to do this and
first set of rules that might be comes from actually department of ??
services which has 4556 rules that we have but those are bot sun side
are not expired anything until at the earliest of 2016 so we have time
to reveal this concealed things and we have ?? for most of these things
that ?? if the ??were anything from 3 to 4000 in course of the rules in
days of Monday that i don't see anything particularly ??,
Speaker Changes: Do you think he yells,
Speaker Changes: He yells,
Speaker Changes: I think we are talking past each other i don't have any
APO review commission who ever is gonna review but D H S A agrees to
sunset all it's rules and 16 act them all the medicate rule and all
that's the,
Speaker Changes: they agreed to it,
Speaker Changes: yes,
Speaker Changes: no,
Speaker Changes: what you yells another question,
Speaker Changes: Representative ?? do you yell,
Speaker Changes: certainly,
Speaker Changes: Where that's the part of the bill that I'm certainly
concerned about because the rules process may take 2 or 3 year to enact
the rule and if these all those 4035 of those are routine are required
by medicated or whatever why in order to sunset them and put them in the
pipe line to get i the way that all the other rules that way want to
look at,
Speaker Changes: I'm i Mr.President,
Speaker Changes: Yes,
Speaker Changes: We anticipate that,</p>

reviewed in place for their sons and that is what they told us and we
have enough time to look into that inversion problem we can address it.
I will have at least two more sessions, legislation for any of these one
problems is quite honestly, the court several thousands of these rules.
I will never ever been reviewed at all and the foam was we need to get
some systematic way to at least take a look at them again and those that
are adequately established are actually in place and operating there
would be a problem with the re-enactment involving the rules review
commission actually do that if it is the general assembly wishes
intervene in some fashion on a particular one, they can still do that to
just try to get some system to looking at things that have been
addressed and probably in some cases, real thirty years to speak briefly
on the bill, said Ernes to 's floor speech on the activist government
was ascended out of the estate on anything. it has been adored by the
growth of our broiler on this please everybody else around here
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
we do
have a tendency for rules to build on one another, not all that, not
three hundred percent with your heaven. all these things reviewed by
somebody could look at them for, but the bottleneck of the rules process
is getting those highest and each candidate will object to it. it
doesn't bias in news .com. the General assembly, and I think before we
get to the point of saying that all world for data, we need to give us a
call or were going to be over here. video the wait for a twenty two him
enrols most of which may have slowed enough and that their mandated by
Medicaid are mandated by the federal government and somewhere love and I
don't think that's a process that we've got the time or the patience to
do and if we can figure out some way to where once we won't do some
about found us automatic, or for that and start over. almost, but all
I found that my theory is that the end of the day we end up getting mad
about the APA and how sorry they as we go away with it because we can
get always roof of the pipeline and I'm telling you the APA rules
process on the best lines ever happened to the state so that agencies
have somebody looking over their shoulder when your neck in these roof
might sure they have statutory authority to do it so hard. only you can
take another look at the part about Vista make involved in on a certain
day sooner reverse draws hundreds
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
to speak a second centre is the second two project for reading the same
as seven an interesting experience dealing with them. Susan is with us
eleven through still a mystery procedure. it is about his various
general statutes commission, maybe not quite as much, but that's
progressively sorry in reviewing rules are adopted and have been in the
hands we got totally agree with all the alien and the instability of a
government to to do this right procedure and due process. I also
discovered that many of those rules are actually identified and never
had him a toy telephone tried to move those rules and the expense
associated with them. one fact in many cases they don't exist, and is
very difficult to single out a particular one to some particular
individual or individual has been asked as a particular problem by which
I will sleep is to create a system that is these can be effectively
reviewed over to think that this is best for you have right now is even
the best way to approach it as being so that we don't have the sun is
cumulative. the fact I can tell you that there are several agencies that
have adopted. finds the college season</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clark is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.  Senators, Senate Bill 420 is
nothing more than a clarification bill.  It deals with a portion of the

terms of their unemployment insurance contributions. There was no

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 454, Registration of Petroleum Device
Technicians.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook is recognized or Senator Barefoot, who
wants to do it?  Senator Barefoot, you want to take it?  Senator
Barefoot is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  Senate Bill 454 amends the gasoline and
oil inspection law to provide statutory authority for the registration
of petroleum device technicians. The reason why this is needed is
because when a state inspector shuts down a gasoline pump because it's
not measuring gas properly the pump owner calls a service person, a
petroleum device technician that's already registered by the Board and
that technician must make repairs and put the pump back into service and
currently right now a state inspector has to go back out and recheck the
pump again and before they can let it be opened to the public. By
recognizing these people by the State it would take a step out of the
process.  I urge you to support the bill. It is pro-business.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.  Members, this bill is
crafted very narrowly to only apply to the SBI Crime Lab in Ashville
Center in ???.  As we move forward Senator Daniel to put a new facility
in ?? North Carolina or Asheville, not Morgington.  This would allow the
SBI lab to stay where it is now.  The landlords have agreed to keep the
rent the same for a three year period. So that's what this bill does. It
would have to go to Counsel of State for approval but the landlord has
graciously agreed to leave the rate the same way to give us time to get
that new lab built in western North Carolina.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Discussion or debate. Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is passage of Senate Bill 483 on its second reading.

Senate Bill 490: exclude custom software from property tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  The bill does exactly what it says – excludes
custom software from property tax. Most states subject only embedded
software to tax.  North Carolina has taken a different approach to
interpretation of statute.  North Carolina Department of Revenue has
divide local assessors that the cost of improvements and customization
of software purchased from third parties is included in the assessable
value of the purchased software. This position harms companies that is
one of our big growth sectors, particularly with data centers.  The fix
is simple.  This will clarify the intent of the existing statute to
exclude custom development work on and improvements to purchased
software. This simply is a clarification of the existing statute.  I
appreciate your support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Members of the Senate, House Bill 13, as many
of you know, currently the Department of Administration is required by
law to maintain an inventory of state-owned property. What this bill
does is say that at certain points in time, state agencies will identify
and report by ?? the Department of Administration the use of the
property, and if it’s not used for at least two consecutive years, then
it would be declared surplus. Finally, it would report to the General
Assembly the amount of revenue generalized by leasing space properties
we already own. I would commend it to you, but I would expect to object
to third reading.

here in the gallery today and I just wanted you to recognize how
important the golf industry is to North Carolina. It’s something that we
really should be proud of, and the governor even said that he was at the
airport the other day and noticed on the brochures for travel and
tourism there was not one golf course. Not one golf course, so you may
see some reprinted travel and tourism brochures coming up. Great
industry and even though Senator Tillman has yet to perfect the game,
I’m glad that there are courses out there that will still take him.
Thank you.
