Thank you very much Mr. speaker. First of all if I may note the irony of
asking everyone to silence anything that makes noise and then calling on
Representative Horn to speak. (laughter) But on a more serious note, I'm
sure everyone saw on the news that yesterday the president awarded the
medal of honor to a former army paratrooper, sergeant Carl White and I'd
encourage everyone in here, if you haven't already to read the stories
about the actions that lead to his receipt of the medal of honor. But I
think it's particularly important to note that Sergeant White, after he
left the army, came to North Carolina, went to the University of North
Carolina in Charlotte and has made North Carolina's home. And I just
like to say that I hope our country will always be the kind of place
that produces people like Sergeant White and I hope North Carolina will
always be the kind of place that folks like him want to come and put
down roots, thank you. (applause)

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker I have three purposes today. The first off course
is to welcome our great guests that are here and to speak about all of
the many benefits of NASCAR, the tremendous economic boost that it
brings to our state but more importantly that NASCAR is truly a North
Carolina sport it’s a sport that brings families together, it’s a sport
that we all enjoy to pull for our favorites and perhaps pull against
something we don’t like and it is a uniquely North Carolina sport and we
are so proud to be home to it. Also I want to point out specifically two
of the guests that are on floor today. The first Mr. ?? I was asks to do
this and I’m glad to do it, how much you do for our department of
commerce? How much you do to boost tourism in our state for the many
great jobs that you provide and you are a true asset and an innovator in
our state. So, we are so honored and thrilled that you are here. And
also Mr. Speaker get to talk about my favorite race car driver, ?? is
sitting on the floor with us today and that is really cool sir. I have
been a fan of the true car for a long time and I wanna to share a brief
story with you because I think it connects with how NASCAR continues to
grow and to thrive as a sport and it does that because it values its fan
and it cares in most times with his fans. Mr. Wallis does not remember
the first time we met but I do, it was in February, 2000 and he was
signing autographs after happy hour at the North Carolina Motor Speedway
in ?? and I was in a very long run and my wife was not able to come to
that race as we were expecting our first child and time was getting
close so as we got close to Mr. …

As I got close to Mr Wallace I pulled out my cellphone and called my
wife who was at home, pregnant, and I said babe you aint gonna believe
what I'm about to do.  I'm gonna get, I'm gonna ask Rusty Wallace if
he'll sign this beautiful $21 poster I believe it was that I had just
bought so that we could hang this in our new child's room and I'm going
to see also if maybe he'll say hello to you.  And sir I know you don't
recall this, but as I, as I got to the front, and those of you who know
me know it's not easy for me to say anything but I explained to Mr.
Wallace that my wife was also a big fan and that she was not able to
come because we were expecting our first child, would he say hello to
her?  And much to my surprise, he actually took the cellphone, propped
it on his ear, course the staff kind of pushed me on through but he
talked to her for like 5 or 10 minutes as he signed the stuff.  Finally,
they gave the phone back to me and I said, babe, what did y'all talk
about, and she said well maybe Rusty's not such a bad name for te the
kid, I mean you know...
&lt;laughter&gt;
But I share that with you to say that I think NASCAR is one of the
unique things about our state.  It brings people together.  It is a time
of great excitement and enthusiasm for all of us who have a chance to
attend the races or watch them on tv.  I want to thank all of the NASCAR
pioneers, those that are here in the room with us today, those who could
not be, those who have carried the torch for this great sport, and as
great ambassadors for our state for so very long.  Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.

Speaker Change:  Representative Carney is recognized to debate the
resolution.
Speaker Change:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Ladies and Gentlemen of the
House and distinguished guests with us on the floor and in the gallery.
I rise today to speak in honor of this resolution, very proudly, as a
North Carolinian whose Mom grew up in Person County and was very
attached to some guys in that county who left to go out and race cars on
the weekends, so I grew hearing about a lot of these drivers as a city
girl.  I do want to talk just a little bit about the investment that
this legislature made in 2006 for our Hall of Fame which resides in
Charlotte, North Carolina, but it is the North Carolina NASCAR Hall of
Fame.  We're very proud of it in the Charlotte region and I know those
of us across the state also share that pride.  I just wanted to share
with you just a few information, a few information facts, first of all
if you have not been you should come and visit.  It is an incredible
interactive entertainment experience that you will have honoring the
heritage and the history of this great sport that is known around the
world.  It is a must see attraction by NASCAR fans and people that are
not necessarily fans.  They have come with others, and when they leave
there after seeing the history and being a part of the interaction
within there, go away wanting to come back, or refer people back to us.
It is, the customer satisfaction for those of you who have heard
anything about it, it is, on a scale of 5, customer satisfaction is a
4.7.  That's a big plus for us.  The Hall of Fame contributes 6 billion
dollars a year to the motor sports industry and 20 billion dollars a
year to the tourism industry.  It is the 20 billion dollar a year
industry, the NASCAR Hall of Fame is part of that.  Ovr 85% of our
guests indicate that they will come back.  And we also have on our
information 2.5 days is what they stay when they come to visit the Hall
of Fame.  I will tell you that it has been a great investment for us and
this state, but also I want to just say that of these inductees that are
here today, there are 25 that have been inducted over the last 4 years.

When the Hall of Fame opened four years ago 25 inductees I know that
it’s very hard for those on the committee to make that decision as they
go forward but they have made some great selections, in next week they
will be making the next round of inductees into the Hall of Fame. For
all of us in here I know we carry a great deal of respect and admiration
for these drivers and on a lighter note we appreciate you having your
experience in driving the cars, we try to be in here last session to
pass a bill that when increase to speed limit on our interstates to 75.
I personally thought against that because none of us have the experience
in driving a car the way you all do. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen it is indeed an honor for
me to speak to you today on this resolution and to acknowledge two
Catawba County sons who are not only the two only living father and son
inductees to the NASCAR Hall of Fame but they are also the proud of
Catawba County and the entire race community. This racing and this
family racing dynasty begin in the 1950s when Mr. Ned Jarrett inert the
arena of NASCAR and haven’t being gifted with determination, grace and
___[??] he was able to succeed in the endeavor. Mr. Ned Jarrett and ??
success during his tenure behind the wheel which included him reaching
the pinnacle when he captured two championships in 1957 and 1958. With
this impressive career and his ability to promote the sport of NASCAR
throughout his life Mr. Jarrett has become one of the NASCAR’s greatest
ambassadors and the sport is a better place because of your efforts Mr.
Jarrett. Mr. Jarrett son Dale soon took a hold of the rains of his
family tradition and continued to reach numerous victories during his
career taking the check route flag in 1999 Sprint Cup Championship
series with additional top five championship, top fives for 1993 to
2003. The Jarrett family has earned their rightful place in the NASCAR
Hall of Fame. And we are proud of this accomplishment. Mr. Dale Jarrett
is also referred to as Gentlemen Ned and that is the title that is well
deserved and was earned but his son Dale also earned that title and that
is a fact I can verify personally. As we progress through life at times
we don’t realize the impact we make on people but several years ago in a
grocery store in the town of Claremont Mr. Jarrett was in the checkout
line there was a gentleman that was behind him pulling two buggies of
groceries and this person tell me that he did not wanna, he knew who Mr.
Jarrett was but he did not wanna interfere with his time, they spoke Mr.
Jarrett left he paid his groceries and left and when this other shopper
who is finally checking out Mr. Jarrett has groceries left a generous
amount of money for that person’s groceries. Now, that is a Christmas
gift that was a conduct and one that was not supposed to be advertised
in this form or any other. But the reason I know the story very well we
discuss it quite a lot in my family is the person that was in the…We
have the two cars it was my brother and he was very touched by that and
you have also in my heart are also Gentlemen Dale. At home…

have you hear. We appreciate your patience as we go through our
processes. I know that they may seem a little tedious and they seem

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Most of you know I reside in Davie County and we
don't have a famous race car driver in Davie, so we just go across the
river and we take claim to Davidson County and so today I would like to
speak about a gentleman that I've had the privilege of working with on
many occasions, Richard Childress, and I believe that's the number 3
car, if that's correct. Many years I sat in seat 3 and you know we have
the license tags that have our seat number on the back and I was at a
stoplight in Winston-Salem and this young man was motioning to me to
roll down my window and I did and he said, &quot;you must be Richard
Childress, my,&quot; &quot;no sir, but thank you for the
compliment.&quot; I've got to know Richard and his wife Judy and they
are very generous people with their time and their talents and their
resources. I know for a fact that they established a pediatric center
over at Wake Forest Baptist Hospital. He works endlessly with many other
wineries in the state of North Carolina. He's very generous with his
time and talent coming here to promote the wine caucus. There's just so
many positive things that I could say about all of these drivers. It's
such a honor to be sitting here on the floor of the House and know that
these people can really drive. We think we can but we can't. It's
absolutely frightening to see how fast they go and how well they do but
Richard Childress from the, member from Davie County and we'd like to
thank you for all the many things that you have done to promote the
great state of North Carolina, many of them that we don't even know
about but we're very proud and it's an honor to have each of you here
today but I'm still the number 3 car, thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, distinguished
guests, it's a real honor to be able to stand here and bring forward a
constituent of mine and speak about this constituent as constituents
refer to me back home. Long before, or decades before Robert Downey Jr.
dawned the metallic gold and red Iron Man uniform that everyone is
familiar with today, Asheville, that sleepy little hamlet up in the
mountains of west North Carolina, had it's own, very own Iron Man, Mr.
Jack Ingram. Jack Ingram is someone that is a legend in our area. He is
a legend in NASCAR, and in 1998 he was named one of NASCAR's fifiest
greatest drivers, and if you asked us from up in the Asheville area, we
consider him the best driver of all time. For those of you that are not
familiar with NASCAR, that means that your more familiar with moonshine
or drinking moonshine and that's quite alright because those of us that
enjoy NASCAR enjoy all of those things. But in regards to Mr. Ingram, he
won the late model sportsman division three years in a row, from 1972 to
1974 and when NASCAR formed the Busch series officially in 1982 he won
the inaugural title then and he also won again in 1985. Now, he was on
his way to reclaiming that title in 1986</p>

…And he was suspended for driving rough. Now, for those of you that are
familiar with NASCAR if you are not driving rough you are not in NASCAR.
So, up to this day it’s been quite the mystery as to why that happened
but yeah the distinguish career and the Bush Series and between the
tender young ages of 45 and 50 he won 31 times which was a record on ??
so Martin beat that in 1997. So, it is a distinct honor for me to stand
here on the floor of the general assembly and recognize Mr. Jack ??,
thank you very much for the honor and thank you for being here and
congratulations to your induction.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker I’m very proud to recognize one of our inductees
today Bobby Allison lives in Iredell County and we are proud to say
that. I would just like to side a few of his accomplishments over his
career, it’s been very distinguished. He started out as a Mechanic and
an Engine Tester and then he eventually became a driver. So, he learned
his way around, he moved to the Grand National Circuit in 1965 and in
1966 his first victory was in Oxford Plains Speedway. Now, some of these
names might not be familiar because Mr. Allison was not born in North
Carolina but he had the good sense to come here. He accumulated at least
84 victories there are some discussion or might have been a few more and
making him the fourth all time including three victories in the Daytona
500 in 1978, 1982 and 1988 where he finished one-and-two with his son
Davey Allison, congratulations. In 1972 he was voted the National Driver
of the Year for wining ten races and taking 11 Poles. In 1983 his NSACAR
Winston Cup Champion, in 1982 he was the fourth driver to sweep both the
Sprint Cup point races at Daytona and after he accomplished that no
driver repeated it until 2013 with Jimmy Johnson. So, he had that title
for quite a while. He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame in
America in 1992 and 2011 into the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Allison was one
of eight drivers to have won what was considered a career grand slam by
winning the sports four major Daytona 500, the Winston 500 Talladega,
the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte, and the Southern 500 at Darlington. And
off course we are most proud of his accomplishment in ?? was when he
located to Iredell County so congratulations Mr. Allison and thank you
for being with us as well your cohorts.

I would love to say a few words about Wills County native Junior
Johnson. When I first came down here to the legislator one of the former
members and I’m not gonna name his name, he said, “You are the new ref
from Wills County we see the place where they grown corn and ??” And
that tradition has really shakes my community and what it is today and
it surely shaped Junior Johnson.
When Junior Johnson was growing out the depression and poverty was
unbelievable, I remember asking my grandmother, “Do you remember the
depression?” She didn’t even know what I was talking about because
people in our area were so poor and all values in our community of hard
work and doing whatever we needed to do to provide for our families
prevail during that time period. For those days ?? outside of Cleveland
Community Junior developed his driving skills such as the power slide
that was featured  on top gear a few years ago with when they tried
mimicking what he ?? on the dirt roads. In NASCAR, Junior was considered
innovative with his driving skills, he created the technique called
‘Drafting’ and he won 50 races. As success came to him he invested back
in our community with things such as Hall of Fames. Now, Tyson which is
our county’s largest employer, after being a driver he became an owner
and his teams wracked up 132 wins including six series championships. He
has been named one of the NASCAR’s 50 greatest drivers and he is now in
the NASCAR Hall of Fame. I thank Esquire Magazine they did the best,
they called Junior ‘The last American Hero’…

Representative Samuelson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank your Mr. Speaker.  I didn’t expect me to be a Nascar fan, but like
Representative Lewis, I will never forget the first time I ever saw a
race on TV. I was hooked within seconds. And in fact, this May, I’m
looking forward to going to my 14th consecutive 600. And while
Representative Carney spoke about the economics, you have all made a
huge economic impact, not only on me. I pay for my own race car ring
time.  I have my annual pass to the Hall of Fame.  I have various Tony
Stewart’s past -  I haven’t gotten his new stuff as much -
paraphernalia that I spend a lot of money on.  From an economic
standpoint, you’ve made a huge economic impact.  But the part we don’t
talk about much is the science of Nascar.  You guys take it hard.  You
are exhausted because you are science in motion. There is a wonderful
book written by a woman named &quot;The Physics of Nascar”.  I would
encourage many of you to read it because it answered my quest.  One of
things I love about this sport is not just the competition, but watching
all the adjustments, all the things you do to accommodate the science.
And in fact, for my 40th birthday party, my best friend, whose husband
was the chaplain for Joe Gibbs, says, “ What do you want to do for your
40th? You want to go out?”  I said, “No.  I want to take a tour of the
Joe Gibbs Racing Shop because I want to watch someone do a track bar
adjustment up close. She looked at me and said, “You’re crazy.” But I
got on the floor and I rolled up under the car and I watched a track bar
adjustment.  And so, there really is a science to it.  And when you go
to the Hall of Fame, one of the things you will see is the science of
pitch on the tracks.  When you do the simulators, it’s a whole lot
harder than it looks.  There really is a science to it. I would
encourage the teachers, I think there was a bunch of teachers here
earlier, to consider going to the Hall of Fame.  We’re actually using
Nascar as a way to teach physics and teach certain parts of science.
What I wanted to close with is simply to say to you gentlemen that while
I appreciate your economic impact, and I appreciate your philanthropic
impact- I’ve been to a number of your fundraising events you all have
sponsored.  I appreciate your science impact.  I mostly appreciate the
legacy and the fun, the fact that you’ve have given us something call
North Carolina home. So when we go other places in the world, the know
North Carolina partly because of the wonderful sport that you have given
us. I appreciate your dedication and encourage you to continue it for
multiple generations. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Arden, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. First off, if you’re concerned about
the length of the 600, we can always send Representative Moore to move
the previous question about the mile 400. But I’m proud to support this
resolution because of the impact that Nascar has had on North Carolina.
It has made our state the center of the racing universe. In much the
same way that North Carolina is also the center of the military universe
because of the presence of Fort Bragg, Camp Lucerne, Seymour Johnson,
and a whole host of other installations.  And as the resolution talks
about, Nascar and our military have partnered up because if you’ve got
the technology to keep a car gripped on the track on the banking  at
Charlotte Motor Speedway, you can also adjust the suspension to
accommodate the extra armor on an up-armored vehicle to take it over the
rocky mountains in Afghanistan.  Both those things are not only good for
our soldiers, they are also great for our state’s economy in creating a
lot of jobs. The technology of Nascar is absolutely appropriate for a
high-tech state like North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this high-tech aspect
of Nascar was highlighted to me when October of last year, we hosted a
group of British wounded warriors involved in a program to find jobs in
the motor sports industry over there for wounded warriors. And taking a
look over here, Mr. Speaker, you were instrumental in helping make that
happen. And these folks’ image of Nascar I think was last formed when
they watched Days of Thunder.  They still think that build race cars
back in barns.  Well, we took them to Joe Gibbs Racing where
Representative Samuelson had been and it was superior to anything they
have seen in Formula One or sports car racing right here in North
Carolina. We then took them to the Nascar Hall of Fame and the ended up
going to the Bank of America race in Charlotte where we had a British
Royal Engineer and a South Carolina National Guardsman, both wounded
warriors who were the co-marshals…</p>

<p id="60:00">
…the beginning of the race.  So they went back to Europe with a
completely different understanding of exactly what high-tech is, and
they learned that here in North Carolina. So I talked about two of North
Carolina’s core competencies – racing technology and also military
technology.  There’s another thing that we really do right here in our
state and that’s our community college and university education.  We
also took some of those wounded warriors over here in October to the
University of North Carolina at Charlotte to their motor sports program
where in one part of the campus, you have a traditional race shop.  You
go in there and you will see the same tools they have been using for
decades to work on cars. Then in the room just next over, you got a
really high-tech laser plasma cutter.  You then cross the street and
students involved in the program doing some of the high tech aerodynamic
simulations on computers. It highlights that racing still has its roots
in old school technology, but you are not going to be able to win unless
you understand how to use a computer to model the flow of air over a
race car. We have responded in North Carolina to the need to train
students to work in this high-tech industry that has been created here.
If you go to ?? State University, they have got a program on motor
sports management there. I have had the honor to go to Forsyth Tech to
see the motor sports technology program there named after Mr. Childress
and they are doing some amazing things there just like ?? Community
College and a host of other community colleges and universities
throughout our state. I’ve talked a lot about high-tech and I’ve talked
a lot about educational programs, but at the end what made Nascar great
in the beginning and what’s going to keep it great going forward is the
people.  That’s why it’s a delight to be here to honor these gentlemen
here going to the Nascar Hall of Fame.  Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Growing up in ??, Minnesota, we all knew the
Earnhardts. I was an Earnhardt fan from the dirt track days in Concord
and seeing Ralph Earnhardt race and then of course following Dale and
Dale Jr.  I have finally forgiven Dale Jarrett for beating Dale
Earnhardt twice in the Daytona 500. I wanted him to know that.  It took
a while, but I did. And then I remember Rusty Wallace winning 11 races
that one year and didn’t win the championship. Just think Rusty, today
you would win the championship going away with that many wins.
Everybody’s looking for a win now and you had 11. So Nascar is in my
blood.  It’s in my veins and always has been. I was listening to a
sports talk show they did a while back and they were talking about North
Carolina only has one national sports championship and that was the
Carolina Hurricanes. So naturally, I had to call them and correct them.
I said, “Have you heard of Nascar? We’ve got a bunch of champions in the
state of North Carolina, including the 7 from Dale Earnhardt and the 7
from Richard Petty, the Jarretts and on down the line.”  So it is a
great sport and I appreciate the folks.  And by the way, talk about our
seat numbers.  Representative Johnson sits in seat 8 and she’s also from
??, North Carolina.  When she comes by you on I-85, you cannot see the
8. You can see a red blur. I’m tell you, she whip all you guys. I’m
convinced of it.  She has a lead foot. That foot is in the carburetor
from the time she leaves the parking lot.  I’m impressed with
Representative Johnson.  She is a true, true race car driver. It is so
good to be here today and to honor these guys and Nascar and thank you
for all that you do for our sport.

Let me tell you Jarrett family story from a personal prospective, most
of you who served would know that I was a newspaper writer for 30 years
what you probably don’t know is that I left the newspaper business for
four years and during those four years I manage to NASCAR Short tracks,
Orange consistent tracks, Orange Country Speedway and South Boston
Speedway. And during that time Dale Jarrett won his first Bush race ever
and won it at Orange County and I remember telling him that night and he
I talked about this earlier today, I don’t remember telling him, we
probably have 10,000 to 12,000 folks there and everybody wants an
autograph and he said, “They will get it.” He stayed until 3 o’clock in
the morning signing autographs. So, NASCAR is about families and NASCAR
is about having its stars being available to the public and that’s one
thing, two things that have made the sport great and I just really
appreciate the fact that we have this great group of headliners with us
here today, thank you for coming and recommend the resolution too.

Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen you have heard a lot of talk
about the big problems that were in…First of all with NASCAR and then
how it blossomed into the major sport that it is today. My first
experience with racing was not the NASCAR there was no NASCAR at that
time. It was in the middle 50s and racing as I knew it considered your
brother, your cousin or some of what Miss. Johnson going out into the
local lake road or the black top and challenging each other that was
racing to me. Then I found out in the middle 50s that there were
actually organized races but they were all of short tracks and they
would on tracks like North Woodsboro, resident in Charlotte etcetera
primarily in North Carolina, in the beginning it’s right here in North
Carolina. And the process was real small, very small and you couldn’t
watch it unless you were fortunate enough to get there because there was
no television, you have to listen to it and stretch your imagination as
they talked about how close the rack was or how close the engagement
was? And you really, really, I got intrigued about that as I listen to
one of my neighbors who live by up the road that’s what we call up the
road and ?? Thomas who actually won a couple of races back there in the
mid 50s and that really bring my appetite into the racing genre, it grew
and grew and grew and to what it is today. So, I’m really proud to say
that I learned to appreciate that as I listen to that radio and listen
to the ??  and listen to Nick Jarrett and the Flock Brothers and many of
the folk back in that day and it was such a safe time because you listen
and then gosh you find out that there were certain fatalities and that
really, really bothered me quite a bit. But races come so far now, you
still occasionally may hear of fatality but that’s primarily not on
very, very short tracks, it’s on the super speedways that we have now ??
or Talladega, Daytona etcetera and even those tracks are real safe
except when someone makes an unsafe movement. So, we have come along way
in terms of racing and racing back in that day really a lot of folks
don’t recognize that and don’t realize that but you had your first
diversity issues in racing I had a good friend by the name of Windi
Scott who and in that time he didn’t have a Pit Cruiser, the Pit Cruiser
were your family and friends. So, he didn’t have any family friend…

I rise today to welcome Mr. Dale ?? from Randolph County.  We're very
proud of Mr. Edmond and the fact that he is from Randolph County. If
you've ever heard of Richard Petty, you're obviously going to know who
Dale Edmond is, because behind every legendary driver there is a
legendary wrench man.  And he was that legendary wrench man.  He was
Richard Petty's crew chief for nearly three decades and set records for
most wins and championships by a crew chief.  Dale was from ??
(Levelcross?) North Carolina.  He was a man with a plan as a crew chief
and enjoyed one of the most successful careers in history of NASCAR as a
crew chief for the king, Richard Petty.  He set records for the most
wins and 193 championships, and 8 championships by a crew chief.  We are
proud to have NSACAR hall of fame inductee Dale Edmond with us today,
and we're proud of you and Randolph County is proud of you.  Thank you.

Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, first I'd like to thank all of our
racers.  I am from Mooresville and as you may know, in 1980 Dale
Earnhardt moved to Moorseville and we've been growing ever since.  We
appreciate it, appreciate the racing industry, NASCAR tech, and all the
things it's meant there.  As I listen to the stories I'm gonna have to
tell one on Richard Petty.  He is a gentleman, and I spoke at his
induction in the Racing Hall of Fame, and you may remember when he ran
for Secretary of State, he had a little episode- you talk about driving
fast where he bumped the car in front of him.  Anybody remember that?
And the newspapers had a hey day out of that.  Well, it was embarrassing
for me.  It was embarrassing because, as we were.... we went down, my
wife went with me to induct him into the hall of fame.  And we were
standing back in the motel hotel, and he came in- the hallway was empty-
he came in at the other end.  I said &quot;I'm going to be speaking on
his behalf in a little bit, could I go down and speak to him?&quot;
They said yes.  My wife went with me, and I shook his hand, I said
&quot;Mr. Petty, I'd like to introduce you to my wife.&quot;  Cute
little thing said &quot;Oh Mr Petty 'm so glad to meet you,&quot; now,
you all don't get offended, &quot;you're my favorite race car driver.
You are the best.  I tell my children to look up to you and follow the
example that you set.  And Mr Petty, don't you let those newspaper
people get onto you, you can bump my bumper anytime you want to.&quot;
The gentleman that he is, he turned red and said &quot;Thank you
ma'am&quot; and walked off.  We do appreciate, we appreciate the ?? you
brought to North Carolina, the entertainment, and the good humor.  Thank
you.

We've been in here for an hour and I haven't talked yet and that's about
my limit.  In 1986 I was in the hospital. t might have been 87.  And I
was in the hospital, the hospital only had three channels, and my dad
came by to sit with me in the hospital.  And we watched the Daytona 500.
  That's the only thing we could get and I wasn't well enough to argue
with my dad.  Darrell Waltrip won, got out of the car, and tried to do
his version of the Icky Shuffle, if you remember that. And it was one of
those moments in my life that I remember dramatically.  It's one of
those moments in my life that I remember about my father.  And I think
that</p>

What makes NASCAR the Jarrett, Rusty Wallace and his son Steven and all
these other families, Richard Childress and Austin Dillon, it’s about
family. And my son went down to speech a week down at Charlotte and I
represent hundreds and so have Joe Gibbs racing, they race Toyota so
it’s kind of like NASCAR but not exactly the same. And my son went
downtown and he wait into car bush and apparently car was side to be
nice that day and now my son is now car bush fan, you have no idea how
frustrated to have a seven year old son watching every race going and
how well is car bush doing. But we watch the races together and it’s me
and my son just like me and my dad did and I think that’s what makes
this so special and I think what’s makes it uniquely North Carolina and
I really can’t tell how much I appreciate it because there is lot of
families like me whose fathers and sons grew up watching all and
allowing us to bind by watching what you all do so well, I come in the
resolution team.

Well, I’m very honored to be here today and Representative Moore and I
sponsored this and I wanna thank the speaker for allowing us to do this
on the first day of our session. It always is wonderful to be first and
I also want to say I apologize to those who are behind me that cannot
turnaround to speak to you but sometimes it just is really nice to be on
the front row isn’t I guess? [Chuckle]
[Laughter]
Well, as I stay to speak on this resolution because for 14 years I have
represented Catawba County and as you know that’s the in Concord, North
Carolina and that’s compared as County and I have also had the pleasure
it. I had five districts so I have had the pleasure of representing a
lot of your teams and your fans and it’s just been an honor to cheer the
NASCAR along with the Senator ??. I did want to say a few things today,
I opened my paper the other day and I look at the advertise on the page
and it says before the Need for Speed it was the need for Shaun, this is
their promotional words and they are advertising but this is the
history, this is our history. However, it is our history and it is the
history that has grown us the industry of NASCAR. And to you we will
always be grateful for what you have done for our state. Those that are
to see that like at this time to call out their names so that all of our
members will remember them and that’s Dale Emhart, Bill France Senior,
Bill France Junior, Lee Paddy, Richie Evans, Beth Baker, Cotton Owens,
Herb Thomas, Tim Flock and Fireball Roberts. We thank them for the
legend they have left us but just like everybody else here today I have
got a little story to tell also. I just happened to live three-four
houses from Ralph ?? I remember who Ralph is, well Ralph went on bike
with break, I have take it up to the shop and he stop and he fix my bike
and young people think they are just grown up. So, I would say, “How
much do I ??” And he would say, “Just bring your mom and daddy and come
to the dirt track Saturday night.” Because he was planning on wining
part of that money. [Chuckle] And he is bigger and he will get paid.
That’s the kind of real and representation our North Carolina you bring
to show what the spirit of…

state, you love this for it shows the people of North Carolina live the
sport and it shows, we are so familiar with things that we see everyday
and sometimes it just way too casual because we all say NASCAR and we
think of the emblem there on your jacket, but NASCAR is a 20B in our
business and industry that brings way off to our state, it brings jobs,
it also brings the fans ask the other day and I found out we had fans
coming from all 50 states and I believe it was 11 foreign countries, I’m
not really sure. And we love them to come here and with their pockets

[Speaker Changes]
Ladies and gentleman, I think representative Moore may cover this, but
for your planning purposes we have a time-sensitive bill that we will
take up tomorrow. It's largely technical corrections on some of the tax
reform. I do not believe it to be controversial, but we need to come in
so we can read it in at 8 am and then refer it to finance. It will be
reported out of finance and we will have that one vote on the floor
tomorrow. I apologize, just so we can actually vote on it as quickly as
possible next week. So there will not be a vote tomorrow, but we will
have something added to the calendar and carried over to next week. So 8
am for a brief session. Representative Moore did you confirm with
representative Howard on when we would come back?
[Speaker Changes]
The consensus is to come back at 11am.
[Speaker Changes]
So we'll come back at 11am.

is house finance. Representative Howard tells me she needs only about an
hour for that bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you.
[Speaker Changes]
Again ladies and gentleman just for your planning purposes we'll be
convening at 8 simply to refer the bill. So that if your time
constraints in the morning make it difficult for you to be here you need
not worry about anything else being taken up on the Agenda.
Representative Louki please state your purpose.

Thank you very much.
