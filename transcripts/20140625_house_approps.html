We have two bills that we will take up today the first bill is Senate
Bill proposed committee substitute for Senate Bill 3, I hear motion for
the PCS to be properly before the committee. So, I move by
Representative ___[00:20] all those in favor say aye, all who oppose no,
the aye’s have it and Chairman Berg come up and recite and I will
present the bill.
[Pause]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, the proposed house committee substitute for
Senate Bill 3 is in front of you and when we came to this general
assembly this year coming into this session the general assembly
everyone had made teacher compensation, teacher pay raises their top
priority. We also made significant priority out of a commitment to raise
starting teacher salaries up to $35,000 a year by the end of the next
year and two year effort to do that. We also talk in terms of our
priorities of making sure that we gave a raise to our state employees to
restore master pay and also to do some things to improve professional
development to allow us to demonstrate and some very substantial ways
how we value teachers and how we value education in the state of North
Carolina. I’m very pleased and proud that we had bipartisan support for
the house’s overall budget and that budget is going forward and is now
in conference. The bill before you today allows us with the other issues
that are out there, this bill allows us to highlight and focus on
education and those educational priorities that I just discussed. We
know that these are the priorities that all chamber support, these are
the priorities that the Governor supports and I believe that we should
pass this bill today and take this effort to the for the house and to
essentially allow us to proceed this general assembly to proceed and
vote and insure for the school years that are upcoming for the school
systems as they start the years are coming that we will preserve all of
our teaching assistance that teachers will have the first substantial
ways in five years since their salaries were frozen. The state employees
will receive a raise that we will within the commitments that we have
made in education fund or Master’s degree settlement that we had said we
were going to provide that policy also provide funds for the Yellow
Ribbon Campaign for our veterans and their educational needs ensure that
we have clarified tenure as we did in the house budget and to provide
those funds for the Career Pathways Pilot Program so that North Carolina
can move and modernize move to a reform system with compensation
modernize, our compensation system for teachers in North Carolina such
that we may will be a model for the country. With that Mr. Chairman let
me mention a few other items that are in this bill as you note the
original budget bill was somewhere in the range of maybe 280 pages, the
bill before you is probably roughly 40 pages I believe, 39 to 40 pages.
This bill does not use additional funds from the lottery except is those
funds were being swept up from accounts that were available or otherwise
revised upward…

<p id="05:00">
in physical research's analysis of the consensus analysis for the
lottery. I wish it was about 32 million additional dollars. This bill
provides for the same thousand dollar across the board raises for our
state employees, it provides for the 1.44 percent cost of living
adjustment for retirees, of course the 5 percent raise as we discussed,
all of the other raises and adjustments with respect to assistant
clerks, deputy clerks, magistrates, the UNC raises as well as those for
the highway patrol. So it is the same compensation package in size and
scope that we passed in our House budget. This budget also provides 1.8
million dollars to [??] for coal ash, we anticipate that bill coming to
the House shortly, and these are the funds to pay for that. We also have
in this budget 134 million dollars in a medicaid risk reserve that the
governor and the office of state budget would be able to utilize to
ensure against any contingencies in the upcoming medicaid budget. I
would just note that as things stand today, the cash position in
medicaid is 127 million state dollars to the good. I would also point
out that we have the 11.8 million dollars that needed to be provided
through DPI to address the opportunity scholarship issue as well.
There are other provisions in this budget that are principally
technical, we may change this for example, in the grading system for our
schools that everyone agreed needed to be made, again, an education
priority, also with the community colleges we provide the mechanism by
which the closing the schools gap will be able to be addressed with the
savings that the community colleges had worked so diligently to achieve,
and that both the House and the Senate had agreed needed to be purposed
for that. Other technical matters that were necessary for the
adjustments to the second year of the budget are also in here. Mr.
Chairman, I'll be glad to go over - there are a number of individual
provisions, I believe I have the latest sheet on that, but I'll be happy
to go over those individual provisions or to answer any questions. Our
anticipation is that this bill would be on the floor of the House on
Thursday, to also make sure that members have sufficient time between
the committee meeting and action on the floor.
So Mr. Chairman, I'll be happy to answer any questions, or of the
members wish me to go through each individual provision I'll be happy to
do that as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before we move into questions, I would point out for those folks in the
back of the room, and if you're listening online, you can find the
documents, the summary, and the PCS on the committee website, in case
you don't have a copy. At this time we'll take questions from committee
members.  Rep. Jackson, do you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Chairman Dollar, I had a question on the revenue
that is used in this bill. It appears from my reading of Senate bill 744
that we passed a few weeks ago that there was a general fund
appropriation of 21,111, 480,828. However the bill that's been passed
out before us has a total general fund availability of 21,251,000,000,
which seems to be a total of 140 million additional dollars in this
document, and I'm wondering if you could explain the difference.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The difference is primarily come out of how you treat the reserves and
what's quote-unquote &quot;at the top&quot;, above the line in terms of
your savings reserves</p>

...your repairs and renovations. And there's also certain differences
between some movements of funds from pots into availability that are not
otherwise there in this version.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Are we using non-reoccurring money
to fund re-occurring expenses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you anticipate the money from the reserves to be available the next
year as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What I was saying, in answer to your question previously, is that the
part of the differences are the amounts that balance out in the reserve
accounts when you just approach this from the standpoint of a budget
that is...I don't want to say, well...modifications to the existing
underlying budget. The minimum modifications to that existing underlying
budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Representative Dollar. And I know you
all maybe have gone over this in more detail in your caucus, but since
we're just getting it, I really would ask that we go through a section
by section analysis since this is going to be our major time to look at
it before the floor. But when you do, my particular early questions deal
with sections 1.2 and 1.3A. I'd like explanation of exactly what's
occurring what the limitations are on those two sections which seem to
be pretty important to the concept here. But I would ask for a section
by section analysis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd be happy to go through the section by section and if I can staff
just briefly respond to the question with respect to 1.2 and 1.3A.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Phyllis [??] division. Looking here at the 1.2 has indicated that
section says that matters that might have been prohibited for
expenditure under GS143C6-5 are not going to be prohibited for the rest
of the 2014-2015 bi-annual. The purpose of this is because in your two
budget bills, there are provisions that were considered and if neither
of those bills pass, GS143C6-5 will prevent agencies from being able to
do some of those things. This change here in 1.2 allows flexibility for
the next fiscal year on matters that might have been in both budgets and
in agreement in both budgets in some way that might be able to be done
are the provisions of this act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate the explanation on 1.2, although I need to think through
that, I think I understand. But the $361 million, can you explain, when
you say they are not in controversy, am I to read that as, in the two
budgets that passed, that's the amount that was agreed upon in cuts in
both budgets and that's what that number reflects?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Just to get it through...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I have a procedural question. I think it's procedural.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When will we be able to get the money report? The other half of the
budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We really wouldn't have a money report, per se, with this bill. If staff
want to comment on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The way this is drafted, all the instructions necessary are within this
bill, and an additional money report is not needed. You see in the
front, there are modifications of the appropriations, as far as
availability goes, there are some reserves that are created, and some
other details that are included here so as not having to necessitate
having the money report in the short bill. Now I defer to [??] if she
wants to add to that explanation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 1.1A Sets for the adjustments to the general
fund including estimates for the unreserved funds, you can see that very
plainly. 1.1B directs the controller to reserve the amounts for the
savings...</p>

…Budget that was passed at those same levels and in the same manner in
which we set those out 2.7 is the career pathways in public program as
was in the bill, as was in the Budget Bill. If you flip over to page 4,
the first couple of items as it say there are those are board played
items we also have the five days of leave provision with regard to the
35 mile radius for jobs for someone who is an SPA position and moves to
an EPA position and then there is subsequently reassign back to SPA. The
standard provision we have had in the lottery commission for sometime
comments with or increases obviously cost of living is there
contributions to the state health plan, some authority for the state
treasure that was in there, the national guard pension which was in the
budget, the non-permanent temporary employees under the ACA get that
provision with the State Health Plan as before, the contribution rates
for the Separate Insurance Benefit Plan, these are all compensation
issues. If you go to the bottom at the revenue this involves the temp
system those adjustments that run the budget that we feel have to be
made, 4.1A gets into the Masters Pay, 4.1B also fixes a number of
technical issues and like with those education programs with the LEAs,
the formula changes, 4.1C the allowance for the community college system
is mentioned earlier, the provision for the veterans in the Yellow
Ribbon for community colleges. 4.2 gets into some HHS matters where we
were repealing the ___[02:25] Savings Program that was not implemented
but maintained the 3% rate reduction had been passed last year and it
would be in place, work first adjustments, funds from the employment
security reserve pay interest on the  insurance that the veterans homes
that were addressed in Black Mountain in Kingston, the lest front, the
underground storage tanks, there you get repealing some technical
matters that have been taking care in the highway US tax adjustments,
___[03:12] some terms in 4.8 is to what those mean and then on the final
page the adjustments that were being made with the state revenues
community confided program there repealing the language with DPS
allowing them to fix the kitchen and make some other needed facility
adjustments that really need to be done. And 4.11 that direct physical
research issue for a legislative budget actions and provide records to
the Director of the Budget who facilitate the 14-15 budget. I will be
happy to respond to any other, to any further questions or to Mr.
Chairman direct those to the staff as needed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I’m over here for the bill sponsor. If we don’t
see it on the list is that mean that it doesn’t exist anymore for
example, childcare subsidy formula and eligibility scale for,
eligibility for childcare subsidy, is that no longer a consideration for
this budget if it doesn’t appear here?

Those changes would not be in this bill.

Representataive Michaux
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 11, that action dealing with clarifying
changes to teacher contracts, could you explain that to me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would...Just to make sure that we have a perfectly clear answer, Mr.
Chairman, I would refer that to staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chris Nordstram from the fiscal research team. Basically this is just
clarifing the performance based contracts that were funded in the 2013
budget. It clarifies in lines 40 through 46. Just clarifying that the
$500 increase is a A. it's a pay raise and that it goes from $500 in the
first year to $1000 in the second year, $1500 in the third year to $2000
in the fourth year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm still not...because what I'm looking at here, on line 36 through
line 39, it looks like we're doing something with tenure in that
situation, is that not correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To clarify, Chirs Nordstram again, fiscal research. These were the
contracts that, if signed, the teachers had to give up their career
status. There are no additional changes to the career status statutes in
this bill before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I need to get clarification on something else also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell, for you I think he may be able to...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had a follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A follow-up on that issue? Or would you like...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No I got a follow-up on another issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK on another issue? Representative Michaux, go right ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Am I to understand that this document, this 45 page document or however
number of pages it is that we received today, replaces the 245 page
document that we passed out of here? Is that my understanding?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir. It does not replace that bill that has passed. What this does is
allow both chambers to move forward on the most important set of
promises that we have made in this general assembly. We want to make
sure that as schools begin their process for starting out the next year,
that they're going to know that they're going to have those teaching
assistants there. They're going to know what the compensation is for
those teachers. State employees are going to know, in those basic
adjustments that are absolutely necessary, are made with respect to the
budget. If other negotiations need to go longer on the broader bill,
that will not, in any way, impede the moving forward with what we have
said all along is our highest priority.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess, Representative Dollar, what I'm getting is, if we pass this
bill out, then is there...I guess what I'm getting at is if we pass this
out and assure this, what happens to the rest of the bill we pass in
that big bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That bill is the subject of work by the conferees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If nothing is ever reached on that bill, we can go home with nothing in
that bill and have this in tact. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct sir.

so the funding, the only funding impacting...</p>

… DENR and this appears to be the extra funding for the coal ash
positions, but as far as clean water funding, it will be whatever was in
the… unless something changes with the negation on senate Bill 744. The
funding level for clean water will be whatever was authorized in last
year’s budget. Is that right? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And just to add, if you’re looking at follow-up on
Representative Insko’s question earlier, if you’re trying to find a
comparison, on the front page of the General Assembly, if you’ll look
down in the lower left hand corner, there is a comparison document that
will show you the items that are in controversy, items that aren’t, and
the items that are not shaded are the items that would be affected by
this budget here in front of you now. Representative Insko? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, and you may have just answered this,
but I would like a list of the budget reductions as set out in Senate
Bill 744 third edition and Senate Bill 744 seventh edition that are not
in controversy, and I understand I could go through it and do that item
by item if I went online, but if we could get a list it would be very,
very helpful. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That document exists and can be provided
to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] On line 42 – 41
and 42 – it says state agencies shall not make grant awards with –
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What page, Representative? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry,
page 3. Same section. “State agencies shall not make grant awards with
funds that are subject to proposed budget reductions.” So I think what
you’re saying here is that if you are a state agency and you still have
money left over in this year’s budget that’s due to be cut next year,
you should not spend any more money this year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would
defer to staff to make sure that… I think I’ve got the right answer but
I want to be 100 percent. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko, Karen
Hammonds-Blanks with Fiscal Research. That language actually refers to
the fiscal year of 14-15 and not to the current fiscal year, so there
would be no impact on what the agencies have done already during this
fiscal year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m
just, I’m going to try to limit it to three questions, and one’s a
technical questions. If you could turn to the front page Representative
Dollar, I think this is just a typo but maybe I don’t understand. So
when you take the beginning unreserved balance of 167.7 and the
revenue’s – [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you give me the line, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, line 19. And then you take line 21, 19.9 on
line 21, and then you take line 31, 990 million. That should add up to
21.25. It doesn’t. It’s about 110 million, 20 million short. I think
what’s happened, and correct me if I’m wrong, if you turn to the next
page, if you add in the subtotal adjustments of 120 million, it gets you
to the 21.25, but that number shouldn’t be the number on the front page.
That should be the 21 something and then the adjustments. I think it
probably is incorrect on the front page. Would you agree? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Let me refer to staff on that one. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, you’re correct. That is the final total number
and that number should be less, that amount you just indicated. It will
be a technical correction. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Then my second
question Representative Dollar, I think I understand but well let me get
the second easy one out of the way and then the last one. There’s no
provisions in here that deal with the Read to Achieve fixes, right?
That’s left for another day. The Read to Achieve fixes that were in the
budget, that’s not in here. Is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To my
knowledge no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And then my last question would be going
back to the career status, just so I’m clear, what I think I understand,
we attempted to fix that in the bigger budget bill which is at issue
with the Senate. In here, there’s not an attempt to repeal the repeal.
There’s simply an attempt to deal with what contract issues might be for
people who accepted it, but right now the old law from last year’s
budget as to career status is in effect except as enjoined by the court.
Would that be right? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would prefer to refer to staff,
since that’s partly a legal…</p>

I want to make sure I don't get it wrong. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Chris ??
from fiscal research as it's partly a legal issue I will defer to legal
on this one. But there is as I stated earlier there is nothing in this
bill related to related to career status. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. I
appreciate Chris' great answer, which I would give if I was him too. But
I just want to make sure that I understand the legal implications of
where we are. One's a fairly big matter even though, I understand what
you're trying to do here. So if we could just get some clarification at
some point, before we leave, that would be great. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll work on getting that clarification for you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Wilkins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I'm
going to try and follow along. I'm on your left, Representative Dollar.
I'm going to try and follow along after Representative Michaux.
Representative Dollar, does this or how could this affect the conference
process? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it could help the conference process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To qualify that would it help the House position moreso?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I think that what you're trying to arrive at is a
mutually agreed upon budget. I believe this would be very helpful to the
process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Goodman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Representative Dollar,
if I understand this, we're still planning to use, to transfer $116
million in lottery money for teacher pay and you've revised your lottery
forecast to $57.4 million increase. That leaves about $58 million in
lottery money that you're going to transfer out of what we currently
use. Where are you going to take that from? Do you have an answer to
that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those monies can only be spent for educational
purposes so they would go into education purposes based on existing law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well, some of that money's for scholarships. Some's for school
construction. Do you have an idea where you're going to move it from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe the allocation and I will defer to staff on
this. I believe the allocation would be in line with what would be in
effect for 14 15. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Additional comments from staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Brian Madison, fiscal research. Just looking at
section 1.1D. The clarifying language there appears to be lines 45 and
46 on page 2, which reads these funds shall be used to support public
schools, teachers, compensation increases, and implement the career
pathways pilot program in part 2 of this act. Those would be the two
purposes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Michaux. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah. I'm trying to ?? What happens if this,
you've got a $12 billion budget figure here. What is the total cost of
this bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill appropriates $21,251,115,466.00.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does it appropriate it for what's in this bill? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, sir, under the stipulations this bill and as I might add,
and staff may be able to say it more eloquently or more technically
accurate than I can. But as you know, we are modifying an existing
underlying budget that is in force and effect and it will be in force
and effect July 1. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, yes sir. You've got,
you're reallocating, you've got the total availability of general fund
provisions in here at $21,251,000,000.00 which is about $140 million
more than was appropriated under the bill.</p>

and left here a hundred twenty hundred forty million more than was
appropriated when the bill left here. Now, what I'm trying to find out
is how much this bill cost and where the rest of the money is being
spent if we have to go home with just this in effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux I think the question answers itself. If the bill
appropriates those funds, you have differing levels of funds. As you
know you have some that are taken out above the line because they're in
savings reserve and R&amp;R. When those funds aren't there it makes
other adjustments in those bottom line figures but the funds
appropriated are the funds appropriated for those purposes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm just a little dense right now because what I'm seeing is what you
have done is you have taken care of the teachers and the state employees
in this and a few other little items in here that's not going to cost
twenty one billion dollars. Now if we pass this bill and shut down and
go home with just this budget bill passed, what happens to the rest of
the money because what's in here is not going to take up twenty one
billion dollars?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We already have an existing budget. You have operations of state
government. You have Medicaid. You have teachers, the rest of their
salaries, the rest of a state employee's salary. You have all of the
things that have budgeted for already in the appropriations act for the
biennium that was passed last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That, Mr. Chairman, that's my point. In other words, we are not making,
we will not be making any adjustments to the budget that we passed last
year, the two year budget. We'll go home with what's left out of here to
pay out what was appropriated in that budget that we passed last year,
is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
These are the adjustments in this document here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson? Representative Insko?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm beating the same dead horse. So, my question has to do with the
provisions in both the House and Senate version that we passed this year
that were alike in the House and Senate but did not appear in last
year's budget. And what I heard you say was that that Senate bill seven
forty four is still in negotiation, we still have a final vote to take
on that and if we don't take it on that then the version that we passed
last year is in effect. But my question has to do with any new
provisions that appeared both in the House and the Senate budget in
those bills and this year are any of them in this budget, covered with
the amount of money you have spent here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They would be covered to the extent that they're in here, to the extent
that they're not in this bill they would not otherwise be covered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Harrison?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, just a quick clarification. Representative Dollar,
the provision relating to UNC System employees section three point six,
do I understand that the state personnel act covered employees have
their salaries increased by a thousand dollars except for the UNC, the
School of Math and Science. The UNC gets flexibility in determining the
exempt employees, is that accurate and is this what the House's position
was on this issue?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could I catch that question again? The short answer is this is the same
language from the bill we passed in the House.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One last question, thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you for indulging. Just
again, and I know we'll have to spend a night to go back and look, but
as I understand it, because of the limits of what the budget's trying to
do and to focus on the issues that it's attempting to just focus on to
the exclusion of the others. For example, in areas that aren't in here,
like the University budget. The University's budget that was in the two
year biennium budget showed I believe that there would be another fairly
significant cut or hit to the discretionary cut this year, were we not
to do anything about that? Since this bu</p>

<p id="45:00">
doesn't do anything about that. Am I right that, and assume we don't
anything else, that the two-year, or the second-year budgets would take
place, whether it's the university or something else, but in the
university's case, they would be hit with the additional discretionary
cuts if there were no other agreement?
[Speaker Changes] That would be correct as I understand your question.
An item that would have been cut in the second year or continued
reduction in the second year of the biennium would be in force and in
effect.
[Speaker Changes] Further? Rep. Reeves [sp?].
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman [xx], I was trying to
make sure that I understood one point. All of this now is done. If this
bill passes out, these issues are not be re-taken up by the conferees.
These won’t be addressed any more.
[Speaker Changes] If this bill passes the House, when this bill passes
the House, if this bill passes the Senate and is signed by the Governor,
then those provisions would go into effect at that time.
[Speaker Changes] Follow-up?
[Speaker Changes] Follow-up. So that make sure I’m clear, that means
that if everybody passes on this, this isn’t going to come back in a
budget bill to us after we pass this, unless it just flat doesn’t pass
Senate. Right?
[Speaker Changes] As I understand your question, yes, that’s correct.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Chairman?
[Speaker Changes] Rep. Shaw?
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Chairman, we passed this to go to the Senate. It
comes back to us for concurrence because it’s a Senate bill.
[Speaker Changes] Rep. Shaw, it’s going –
[Speaker Changes] It goes to the Senate for concurrence. It goes to the
Senate for concurrence, right?
[Speaker Changes] Correct. It would go to the Senate for concurrence,
not the House. Further discussion? Further debate? If not, Rep. Holloway
[sp?] is recognized for a motion.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Chairman Burr [sp?].  I make a motion to
move for unfavorable report to Senate Bill 3, second edition, with a
favorable report as to the proposed House Committee substitute for
Senate Bill 3, with staff being authorized to make corrections to the
availability statement as required  and other technical corrections
only.
[Speaker Changes] You’ve heard the motion from Rep. Holloway, Chairman
Holloway. Those in favor of the proposed House Committee substitute to
Senate Bill 3 will say aye.
[Speaker Changes] Aye.
[Speaker Changes]  Those opposed say no.
[Speaker Changes] No.
[Speaker Changes] The ayes have it. Senate Bill 3 is passed.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you.
[Pause]
[Speaker Changes] Members, we have another bill. If you’ll take your
seat, we’re not, we’re not  through. We have another bill. Please take
your seats. This time we’ll move to House Bill 1224. Rep. Hager [sp?] is
recognized to explain the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the time. This
bill, Rep. Presnell [sp?] is out of the county today. She’s with, I
think, she’s her grandson or her granddaughter today, so I’ll be
bringing this bill forward. We’ve got some folks, Mr. Chairman, we’ve
got some folks from Commerce who can probably answer some questions for
her, but the genesis of this bill is Evergreen Manufacturing around the
Asheville [sp?] area has issues with the EPA, more issues, this bill
appropriates, I think if you look at it, $2 million per year to help
them with those issues. It’s about 1,200 jobs for the area. And, Mr.
Chairman, I would defer questions to the Commerce Dept., if that’s okay
with you.
[Speaker Changes] Rep. Ramsey [sp?]?
[Speaker Changes] Motion at the appropriate time.
[Speaker Changes] Gentleman, hold the motion. Let’s see if we have any
additional questions from members. If not – Rep. I’m sorry. Rep.
McQueen?
[Speaker Changes] I’d just like to say that this bill protects about
2,000 jobs in western North Carolina. I’m very much in favor of it and
glad to see it before us here today.
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion or debate? If not, Rep. Ramsey,
you’re recognized for your motion.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move for a favorable report
of House Bill 1224, and is a referral needed, Mr. Chairman?
[Speaker Changes] No sir.
[Speaker Changes] Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[Speaker Changes] All right, you’ve heard the motion. Those in favor in
House Bill 1224 say aye.
[Speaker Changes] Aye.
[Speaker Changes] Those opposed no.
[Speaker Changes] No.
[Speaker Changes] The ayes have it. The bill is passed. At this time we
stand adjourned.</p>
