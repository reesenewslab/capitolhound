The house will come to order.  Senate bill 683, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To the president of the senate, and the speaker of the house of
representatives, the conferees appoint to resolve the differences
between the senate and house of representatives on senate bill 683, a
bill ?? to create a safe harbor for victims of human trafficking, and
for prostituted minors, modify the membership of the North Carolina
human trafficking commission, and provide for parole consideration for
certain inmates sentence under the fair sentencing act.  Conferees
recommend the senate and house of representatives adopt this report.
Conferees for the senate, Senator Goolsby, chair, Senators Barringer and
Kinniard.  Conferees for the house of representatives, Representative
Glazier, chair, Representative Conrad, Davis and McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  And this is for a motion to adopt the
conference report and to speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  Members, this is a large bill, that
we talked about on the floor, that there was only several differences
between the house and the senate on the human trafficking bill.  This is
a great work by Representative Hamilton, and Representative Davis, and
their bill.  And let me explain the two changes.  The first change is
that we had included some larger investigative grand jury capacity
beyond human trafficking to look at other offenses.  The senate wanted
to limit it to human trafficking, and the current law of drug offenses.
The house agreed with that, and so that provision was changed.  The
major change was with regard to those boys and girls ages 16 to 17, who
are engaged in acts of what we used to call prostitution.  The question
became how to handle those, whether to defer prosecution on those minors
or to grant them immunity and put them into treatment, and truly safe
harbor.  The majority of the house conferees and all the senate
conferees agreed to the senate language, which is to grant immunity for
16 and 17 year olds, to refer their cases to DSS and to the juvenile
court for treatment and for assistance.  But to recognize the 95% of
those women and boys are victims, and we don't criminally prosecute
victims.  And, I I will say that other language with deferred
prosecution occurs at age 18, but if the prostitution acts continue,
then the 18-year-old may be prosecuted as an adult.  So, that is to
change, I would ask Mr. Speaker if you might recognize Representative
Davis or Representative Hamilton if they have anything to add, and I
recommend the conference report to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate?  Representative Davis is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Comment on the bill.  This is a great bill.
Something that we've really need to address, a very serious problem, and
I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hamilton is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Just to reiterate the same and to just
acknowledge that's night is a very historic moment for North Carolina,
and we're finally moving forward with some very important legislation to
protect our children for decades to come.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate?  If not, the motion is to adopt the
conference report.  All those in favor will vote aye, all those opposed
will vote no.  The clerk will open the vote.  The clerk will lock the
machine, and record the vote.  The aye are 103, the no's are zero.  The
motion is passed, and the senate will be so notified.  Representative
Hardister, are you ready for the conference report on senate bill 337?
The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To the president of the senate, and the speaker the house of
representatives the conferees appoint to resolve the difference between
the senate and house of representatives on senate bill 337, a bill to
entitle anact to create the North Carolina charter schools advisory
board, and to make other changes to charter school laws.  The conferees
recommend the senate and house of representatives adopt this report.
Conferees for the senate, Senator Tillman, chair, senators Wade and
Clark, conferees for the house of representatives, Representative Stam,
chair, Representative Hardister, Glazier and Bryan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hardister is recognized to make a motion, and to debate
the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I'd like to move that we do adopt this
conference report</p>

<p id="005:00">
Members, you may have noticed this bill’s been on and off the calendar
the last few days. The reason for that is because we adopted a
conference report then we decided to go back and renegotiate and then we
adopted an alternate conference report, got the signatures today. All
the conferees have signed off on it. I’ll briefly go through the changes
that we made to the bill. Most of those changes are technical. As you
can see in the title, the bill will establish a charter school advisory
board and make certain changes to laws governing charter schools. In the
conference committee we decided that it would be best to allow the
governor to appoint the charity advisory board, but the board would
appoint the vice chair internally. The bill would require the state
board of education to establish charter application fees of no less that
$500, no more that $1000. Required charter schools to comply with a
criminal background check policies of the LEA in which they are located.
Require that 50% of teachers in grades K-12 be certified. Allow real
estate where charter schools are located to be tax exempt, but the
property must be used exclusively for educational purposes. There may
have been some other technical changes, but those are the highlights.
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to see if Representative Glazier might be
recognized for a moment to speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I did sign the conference report and
do recommend it to you and just want to highlight the 50% rule that’s in
there. Those of you may remember when the Senate passed this bill it had
0% requirement for certified teachers. The House put it at 50%. The
House provision has prevailed with the help of Representative Hardister
and those on the conference committee on the House side. And the
governor’s office. Because of that, I really do recommend that we adopt
the conference report. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate? If not, the question before the House…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. I have a question for Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative. Did I understand you to say only 50%, does
that mean that 50% will not be certified?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do not have to be. There’s a minimum requirement of the 50% The charter
school could have 100%, but when the Senate passed this bill they had
zero. We put in, on the House side, 50%, they tried to compromise it
down to 25%, we got it back to 50% and I think, given the circumstances,
I felt like that was absolutely the best that we could do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate. If not the question before the House is
the passage of the motion to adopt the conference report. All in favor
vote aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will unlock the machine and
open the vote.
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.
88 voted aye and 22 voting no, the motion passed. The Senate will be so
notified.
Representative Schaffer are you ready? House Bill 937. The clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of
Representatives, the conferees ?? the difference between the Senate and
the House of the Representatives on House Bill 937. The bill has been
entitled to increase penalties on certain crimes in which a firearm is
used. The conferees recommend that the Senate and House of
Representatives adopt this report. Conferees of the Senate, Senator
Newton, chair, Senators Harrington, Brock and Randleman. Conferees for
the House of Representatives, Representative Schaffer, chair,
Representative Burr, Faircloth, and Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Schaffer is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise to make a motion that we do adopt this
conference report and also to speak to that motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, as you know House Bill 937,
from its inception, has been an effort to protect the rights of
individuals who abide by our gun laws and to increase the criminal
penalties for those who do not. When we entered the drafting process of
House Bill 937, we wanted a bill that had the support of both sides of
this issue. We wanted support from law enforcement, wanted support from
our second amendment advocates. In the House version of that, we were
able to achieve that. We had a formal endorsement from the Sheriff’s
Association. When the bill went back to the Senate, there were a few
additions that the Senate had made. When it returned to us, there was
one particular sticking point, that has been the pistol permit issue.</p>

<p id="010:00">
What that has done is that our sheriffs have given us some pause. It's
given pause to a few of our members, that we need to take some time to
consider what it is that we needed to do. That we needed to repeal this
Pistol-Permit situation, or not. Given our desire to have a consensus
bill, we did want to take that time, and we were able to do that in our
conference committee.
Before I get to the conference ?? specifically I do want to speak to the
proposal for the repeal of the Pistol-Permit system. That proposal is
not without merit. I believe there is wide spread agreement that the
Pistol-Permit system in North Carolina is flawed. We have agreement from
folks from all sides of the issue, including our sheriffs' organization.
What we do not have agreement on is exactly how to remedy those flaws.
Whether a full repeal is appropriate or whether to make fixes to the
Pistol-Permit system.
A few of those flaws I want to speak to briefly. One of them concerns
arbitrary enforcement of some of the laws. There is really no uniformity
of practices going on. So you can have a difference of outcomes, for
example in ?? county versus ?? county for the same kind of applicant.
That's something that needs to be fixed so that we have a more uniform
system.
The most notable flaw however, and I'm sure that many of you have heard
about it the last couple of weeks, is what has been dubbed the armed
felons loophole. As many of you know, the pistol-permit is good for five
years, so what we have under our current system is that an individual
can be granted a pistol permit and in year one they can go out and
commit a felony and in year two or year three they can use their
pistol-permit to purchase a gun. We have some concerns with that. It's
something that we would like to fix.
One proposal to solve these issues has been to eliminate the
Pistol-Permit system all together and require that there be instead of a
background check with the pistol-permit system that there be a
background check at the point of sale using the NICS[??] database. One
point of concern that has been raised by a few folks within our own
chamber as well as our sheriffs is that the current NICS[??] database
does not have all of the information that we need to make an appropriate
background check at that point of sale.
So that's a little bit of background from the things we considered in
our conference committee discussion. So, the outcome of that conference
committee, what we have done, what we have decided, is to forgo the
repeal at this time, once we got into the ?? of these issues. We
realized there were a lot of moving parts, things that needed to be
considered, infrastructural needs that needed to be addressed, and in
short, we needed more time to study them. So what we will do, we will
study them in the interim, and if there is something that comes out of
that study that determines we need to repeal the system or make more
permanent fixes then we'll do that. In the meantime, some of these flaws
need to be fixed. Most notably this felon loophole.
So in the conference report there are a few important fixes to close
that loophole. The first one concerns the sheriffs revocation of pistol
permits. Right now, the sheriffs are not required, and are not really
set up for when a pistol permit holder commits a felony or some other
disqualifying offense. They have no system for going out and revoking
that permit. So what we've done in the conference report is we've put
language in there that would require the sheriffs to do this. It's
language that tracks[??] with the current system for revoking a
concealed-carry permit. So upon a disqualifying offense, something that
would have originally disqualified the permittee from receiving the
permit, then the're going to have to revoke that permit.
What we've also done, for the interim, we've added some clarifying
language to be filled during our next reporting. That's one of our major
concerns about the NICS database at this time. So we're going to go
ahead and require that there be better reporting in that respect.
The last thing concerns that arbitrary enforcement. We've added some
clarifying and technical changes throughout our current laws, to the
pistol-permit system, to ensure that there is more uniform enforcement
of those laws, to really decrease the incidence of the arbitrary
enforcement.
In sum, as I said at the beginning, we entered this bill seeking
consensus from both sides of the issue. We have continued working
through these issues with stakeholders. We've continued working with
sheriffs. We've addressed their concerns in this bill. We've addressed
the concerns of members in this bill. And in the end I believe we have a
conference report that appropriately protects the Second Amendment
rights of individuals and properly cracks down on gun crime. With that I
strongly support this conference report, and ask you to join me.

granted. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Grier Martin is recognized to

Ladies and gentleman the gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis,
drew me what on paper what is one ugly district. But I found as I
represented it for a few months and ?? about it, on the ground it's
actually very beautiful. And one of the things I enjoy most about
representing it is that it has a high percentage of institutions of
higher learning. It's got William Peace University, Meredith College and
portions of North Carolina State. It doesn't have St. Augs in it but I
do think there's some parts of my district that picks up students from
St. Augs in it. In my previous district I also represented The President
of St. Augs and The President of Peace University. In addition my
grandfather was The President of the College of North Carolina, my
father was involved in university administration. A trend which you'll
note because my lack of brain power will stop at my generation. But my
point being I have an affinity for institutions of higher learning and
many of my bosses are directly involved in that endeavor. And I haven't
heard from a single one of them thinking that this bill is a good idea.
That the introduction, further introduction of guns on campus is in
anyway gonna further their educational mission, in any way going to make
their campuses safer. Now, what this bill does is not the end of the
world. I'm not gonna predict dire consequences in and of the bill
itself. I do have some serious concerns though about what the future
will bring. We talk a little bit too much, take this moment to remember
former Representative Phil Hare and his ?? under the nose of the tin
argument. And I worry that that's what's happening here. That if guns
get a foothold on our college campuses that a lot scarier things await.
So let's let this be the end of it. I'm voting against it. But those of
you that are voting for it, let it stop here and go no further on our
campuses. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke could you
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Schaffer
yield for question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Schaffer does the
lady yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Schaffer I just wanna ask you,
when you talked about all the parties were at the table but I didn't
hear you make any mention of gun safety advocates. Were in fact those
who argue on behalf of gun safety or have those concerns, were they.</p>

further debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me answer that in two parts.  The first thing is that I mentioned
that the people who are usually on the opposite sides of these issues
were at the table, and I called them stakeholders, and we have discussed
those things.  But this bill has been fully vetted in committee,
debated, lots of public comment, we did have advocates from gun violence
organizations there giving their opinion.  The same thing happened on
the senate side.  So there opinions have been heard.  They have been
considered.  We have drafted and crafted a very narrow bill.  One that
attends to appropriately protect the rights of second amendment folks,
and cracked down on gun crime, and really increase the penalties for
that.  A major portion of this bill that has to do with concealed
handgun permits.  So we're talking about a very specific subset of the
citizenry, folks who have gone through the background checks, the
training, 21 years and older. So it is limited in that respect. So we
have taken those issues into consideration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak briefly on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all, thank you, Representative Schaffer.  Appreciate it.
Members of the house, this is a bill that if you read through it, and
representative Martin made reference to in terms of the access to the
college campuses.  This is a bill that is in fact not balanced.  It does
not represent the kinds of concerns that gun safety groups have.  Those
perspectives were perhaps listened to, but they're not included in the
bill.  And for that reason alone, besides the content actually what's in
the bill, I would encourage you to vote against the conference report.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Asked Representative Luebke a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentlemen yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lupe, wouldn't you agree with me that gun owners are gun
safety advocates?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, the way I would put it is this.  A gun safety
group is a group which is concerned about just that, gun safety, and
doesn't in and of itself mean necessarily gun owners.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the house, you've heard me argue
article one section 30 of the constitution on the matter of concealed
weapons.  But what concerns me here is that under this bill, the
concealed weapons records are kept confidential.  Well, if I were to
stand up here and tell you that I agree that you have a constitutional
right to carry that weapon under the United States constitution, then
probably voting registration lists should be kept confidential also,
because they are open and can be subject to some of the same things that
you claim would happen if these people were identified by opening their
lists.  For instance, you say that if we don't keep it confidential then
people know who have guns around, and will try to steal them or try to
do some harm to them or something like that.  I'd say that that has been
done with those persons who were on voter registration rolls.  They have
been threatened, and everything else.  So if you're going to make these
records confidential, I would assume that you would want to make voting
records, the voting registration records confidential.  And when we do
that, then I'll vote for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Schaffer will yield for question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representatives Schaffer, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Thank you, representative.  If you could
explain, and I apologize, I'm just trying to locate, does this bill have
any provisions, or the conference report have any provisions as relates
to the carrying of firearms, concealed or otherwise, on K-12 campuses?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes it does.  It is contained in section two.  Bear with me for a
moment.  That is on page three of section two, subsection K.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And could you follow that, Mr. Speaker.</p>

The lady yields SPEAKER CHANGES Thank you Mr. Speaker thank you Mr.
Representative. Could you explain exactly what it does for purposes of
K12 campuses thank you SPEAKER CHANGES Sure. What it does is that is
permits someone who has a concealed handgun permit to keep their
concealed weapon in their car in a closed container in their car they
cannot take it out. It allows them to have that on a campus of a K12.
You know the very classic situation of the individual who is taking

SPEAKER CHANGES The gentleman is recognized to to debate the motion.
SPEAKER CHANGES Thank you Mr. Speaker. I have two things. To say to the
representative one is for the resolution and I think an appropriate one.
On the permit issue that came up in the senate and second for the
portions of the bill the really do and I think are important. My
disagreement on the bill is what it was when I first heard it and
Representative Martin being kinder than I am I am more of a gentleman I
think I am going to go a bit further. The bill as I remember was opposed
by all of the police chiefs and all of the chancellors all of the
institutional campuses that are in charge of student safety. And while
there are arguments on both sides of this and I. Only time will tell on
this and which way works. I really feel we ought to have differed to all
of the people who are in charge of all of the students and did not
differ and so that ix my first problem and as it protects in as senator
shaffer said it protects people who believe in second I fear and I
question whether it protects the public safety on the end that is where
she and I disagree and i hope i am wrong but I fear that I am not. In
terms of college campuses and the variety of people who are on college
campuses. My second problem with the bill is the restaurant provision
that was in it and there I just have a real problem with the mixture of
alcohol and guns. And while I do believe and actually do agree with
representative Raleigh's point of view. While a vast majority of
concealed gun owners really are some of the safest gun users that there
are. and I do not disagree with that at all we have a lot in my neck of
the woods I also know someone drinks regardless of how safe they are in
their personal lives regardless of how conscious and good they are in
their personal lives. Bad things happen when people get drunk. And now
we have thrown weapon into the mix. having been at a number of Friday
night dinners and events at restaurants in fayetteville on payday
weekend with the population they have and seeing the alcohol there and
standing on the side I hope I am wrong but I fear I am right because I
think this does not support public safety and I fear the reverse
consequence I will be voting no SPEAKER CHANGES Representative Floyd
please state your purpose SPEAKER CHANGES Mr. Speaker at the conclusion
of this vote I have an inquiry to the chair. SPEAKER CHANGES The chair
will return at the appropriate time. SPEAKER CHANGES Representative
Fairclaw Please state your purpose. SPEAKER CHANGES To debate the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
SPEAKER CHANGES Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the house. We
talked about this bill early on, we were considering it before and some
of these issues have came up some things have changed during the
discussion of this bill and during the hearing of the Senate. and in all
of the emails and in all of the personal conflicts that many of us have
had in discussing this. Some of the questions that come up are exactly
the ones that have been raised here. by my fellow legislators. What
about somebody with a concealed carry permit being being allowed to
carry a gun onto a campus under conditions requiring it to be locked up
etcetera. I have talked to chancellors I have talked to Police chiefs on
the campuses about this and my first question to them is. How many guns
do you think have been on their campus in the last month? And their
answer is I hope none. Now do you think that is true? particularly when
for instance you have a main street running though your campus and
someone is coming to visit the chancellor and the happen to have a
concealed carry a permit.</p>

stopping and having someone keep their guns for them until they get back
from theyre visit. or remember to leave it at home which they probably
didnt do because they happen just to put it in their car park it and
leave it somewhere. Probably what they do is drive to the campus visit
the chancellor and leave, and no body ever knew that gun was there.
Lets not fool ourselves there are guns on our campus. We don't like the
idea, but they are there. The difference that comes about with this bill
is that the police chiefs of those campuses who are very much interested
in this issue will have access to the concealed carry permits. So that
they can at least now know wether or not someone is coming on their
campus and wether or not they have a concealed carry permit. What would
raise their reason to inquire about that could be one of many things,
but at least they have more information available to them under this
bill than they presently have. Also the concern about concealed carry
enrushment. I had to thing along time about this one. I had been in a
lot of enrushment in my time some of them in pretty rowdy places, I've
seen some really good bar fights. But then I had to ask myself how many
times have I picked up the headlines of our main newspapers here in the
states. Wether it be the triad, the triangle, or Charlotte what ever the
case maybe and read in that headline &quot;concealed carrier commits
crime.&quot; Can u remember how many times you've seen that. You dont
see it much, responsible people generally are the ones who have
concealed carry. They dont want to get in trouble, they don't want to
ruin what they know is a good constitutional right. Can an accident
happen your dog gone right it can, but the provisions of this bill IF
we're going to have concealed carry puts us in the right direction. We
still got some work to do, but its in the right direction, and I urge
you to support it.
Representman Pittman, please state your purpose.
To debate the bill
The ?? right now is to debate the motion
I want to say how much I appreciate those who have worked on improving
this bill  it was pretty good last year, and they worked on it made an
even better bill since it went to the senate. I've said before it
doesn't goes as far as I'd like too, but it does make some good
progress, and I appreciate that very much. I appreciate the addition of
assisted district attorneys, and investigators employed by the office of
district attorney, and added to this list because specifically asked to
do that by assited district attorney in my district.
As far as guns on campus something was said about it being scary about
having guns on campus you know locked up in a car. To me its a lot more
scary to think that a child ????. A lot more scary to me to think of a
Virginia Tech situation in which a criminal comes on campus. He doesn't
care what the gun laws are, and start shooting up the place, and there
is no body, no professor, no student, no staff person, that could stop
that, and put that criminal down before he kills 32 people. Thats a lot
more scary to me than having a gun locked up on campus. Anyways this
bill does some good things. Its moved us in the right direction. I do
hope we eventually get to a point of constitutional carry, but this is
good progress and I appreciate it and hope you'll vote for it. Thank
you.
Representative Cunningham, please state your purpose

Representative Chayford does the lady yield? I yield. The Lady yields.
Thank You. On page 10 line 26 it talks about people that are on
narcotics or marijuana. Are we planning to do screening for drugs for
everyone that is going to buy a gun. Thank you.
Thank you for the question. The question here concerns the disqualifying
offenses for individuals for people already that was referred as to what
was already in the current law. This is what already disqualifies an
individual from receiving a pistol permit.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just wanna make sure one point is clarified.  A lot of straw enemies are
built sometimes when we discuss these bills.  And one is the guy who's
going in the bar, getting drunk and carrying his concealed weapon with
him.  This bill does not allow a person consuming alcohol to carry a
concealed weapon.  Just want to make sure that's clear.  On the other
hand, my wife and I are both concealed carry permit holders, and we go
in restaurants that serve alcohol at least once a week.  Probably 100
times a year.  Without ever consuming alcohol.  So, why should I be told
that I can't carry my concealed weapon in there just because other
people are drinking alcohol?  If they're drinking alcohol and carrying a
weapon, then they're violating the law.  So I wanna make sure that's
clear.  This law in no way gives people the excuse to carry concealed
weapons while they're consuming alcohol.  It does not do that.  And I
support this bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a process or
procedure that is going to become law or process or procedures for the
state of North Carolina, whether or not we pass this bill.  The reason
for that is, the reason for this bill, which is a lawsuit.  Our
children, who because of mental illness, who have been placed in PRTS,
these psychiatric treatment facilities, are as entitled to their
education under the law of the state of North Carolina as a child
sitting in your local LEA.  What has happened, unfortunately, is that
through however the process developed, no direct funding for education
has been directed to the majority of these PRTS, and they've been
funding the education with their own private dollars.  Those that want
to.  We've had a lawsuit filed where a child is not getting the
education that they are entitled to.  And in order to take care of this
issue, what we're doing through a lot of heavy duty negotiations with
DPI and DHHS, the providers and all parties concerned, is to establish
process and procedure through those departments in order to be able to
take care of the educational needs for these children.  And I would very
much like your support for this, and if you have any questions, I will
try to answer them to the best of my ability.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House. Now, this is a bill
that simply makes it unlawful for a permittee, or his employee or agent,
to allow the consumption of malt beverages or unfortified wine on the
premises of his business, or to consume them himself, or his employees
consume them, during the period of time when there has been a revocation
or a suspension of an ABC permit on the premises. If that does occur
while they're under suspension, that is a separate violation.
It does, however, protect the property owner. If the owner is a
different person, in that, if the first business owner were to move out
of the business after losing their license, then that does not fall to
the building. The building can then be rented to someone else who has
not committed a crime, and it can be used and get an ABC license.
I urge you to consider this favorably. I also like to send forth an
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Faircloth moves to amend a bill by deleting the short

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is a pretty simple amendment. It comes
about, because back in 2003, there was a statute that spoke to
Convention Center facilities. There are publicly owned Convention
Centers and there are privately owned Convention Centers, and for some
reason this bill was passed back then. It said for a privately owned
facility, that one of the requirements for it is that it has to be
located in an urban redevelopment area.
Well, what has occurred is that there are some business folks who want
to start a privately owned facility that doesn't happen to be in an
urban redevelopment area. One particular one that I know of is at the,
where three urban redevelopment areas come together, but it sits across
the street, therefore it's not on any one of them.
So, what this amendment would do is simply read that the facility shall
be certified by the appropriate local official as being consistent with
their rules on redevelopment area. And I urge your support of the
amendment.

House committee substitute for Senate bill 558, a bill to be entitled
&quot;An Act to Amend the Law Governing the State Treasurer's Investment
Authority With Regard to Special Funds Held by the Treasurer&quot;, the
General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I left a word out there that I always use, you'll notice, because I
believe in truth in advertising, didn't use the word &quot;briefly&quot;
because I'll probably exceed myself and impose a three minute limit this
time because of the nature of the bill. The background of the bill is
this: as the General Assembly, we have charged the investment of the
state's retirement plan monies to the State Treasurer. We've also told
the State Treasurer what we expect that person to earn for an investment
return, an annual return of 7.25 percent a year. At the same time, we
have passed legislations to tell that Treasurer what to invest in. I
hope you get the irony of putting those three things together. We've
told the Treasurer, &quot;You do the investment, you're responsible for
it, here's the return you're responsible for making, but, by the way,
we're gonna tell you how to invest the money. We're gonna put certain
restrictions on it.&quot; Senate bill 558 makes some small, but
significant, changes in the allocations formula that we have mandated on
the State Treasurer. And those changes are primarily three, and I can
point you to them in the bill. Number one, currently, the State
Treasurer is able to allocate up to 34% of the total assets into a whole
classification of assets known as alternative investments. This
particular bill would raise that percentage by 1%, from 34% to 35%,
which is not extremely significant; more significantly is the second
change. The second change is in the subcategories. There are a number of
categories classified under alternative investments, and you'll find
this beginning on page two of the bill. Under the subclassifications,
for instance, one of those classifications is credit, we're investing
some of our money in credit assets. That current limit is 5% of the
total assets. Senate bill 558 would raise that to 7-1/2%. That's line 25
of page two. Hedge funds is another, which is not really an asset class,
because hedge funds can invest in a lot of different things, but
currently, the portfolio, 6.5% is the limit of the amount of the
portfolio that can be invested in that. Page three, line 27 would raise
that to 8.5%. A broad class known as alternatives, which includes
private equity and several other things, the current limit is 7-1/2%,
that would be raised to 8.75%, page three, line 42. And another broad
class of assets called inflation protection assets, which can be
anything from commodities to tips, bonds, the current limit is 5%, this
would raise the cap to 7-1/2%, page four, line 19. Now, those are not
huge increases, but they do allow the Treasurer a little bit more
flexibility than they have right now. Currently -- oh, by the way, there
is one other change, too, and the other change that's made, the third
change this bill would make is to require some extra reporting from the
State Treasurer. The State Treasurer would have to report some
additional information about any management fees and other fees that are
being charged to the plan, and also would be required to give a
rationale why any asset class has increased in its percentage of the
total assets by more than three percent. So, if the State Treasurer has
gone from six percent to nine and a half percent in real estate, she,
he, whoever it happened to be at the time, would have to explain that in
a report and how it fits into the total investment philosophy of the
assets itself. Now critics of the plan will tell you this: number one,
the critics of this bill will say, &quot;This is just too risky, you
know, alternative investments are kind of a spooky, esoteric type of
investment that nobody really understands, and so to even allow it one
more percent is gonna devastate our state retirement plan.&quot; Well,
that's kind of a broad brush. Alternative investments do include things
like private equity, which you better have some understanding in order
to invest in real estate. Some people consider real estate risky. Some
people consider real estate safer than stocks. But it even includes
inflation protected bonds, which I don't think anybody would call that
an extremely risky investment, unless we're never gonna have inflation.

<p id="055:00">
What critics try to paint is a picture in which they say the risk of a
portfolio is equal to the sum of the risk of its individual parts and if
you know anything about investing, while I won't say anything, you know
very much deeply about investing you know that that's just not true. I
do this for a living so I understand this. The classic, I won't say the
classic, but the ideal portfolio that we try to get people to put into
when you include all your assets is what we call a 7-Twelve strategy
that uses seven asset classes and twelve sub-classes and among those
classes are at least five things that our legislation considers
alternative investments. So my clients, if they listen to me, will have
about 40% of their assets in alternative investments. And believe it or
not, that lowers the overall volatility of the portfolio over just
having, for instance, a straight stock portfolio even though eight of
the twelve sub-assets I'm getting them to invest in would be considered
more volatile on their own than large cap stocks. But the reason for
that is very simple. There are two reasons. When you're investing you
need to do at least two basics. You need to invest for diversification,
which everybody understands, the more asset class you're using the
better. And number two, for non-correlation and that's something people
don't understand. Correlation means everything's going up and down at
the same time. The temperature is correlated to how much clothes you
wear, directly correlated. Correlation is something that used to be easy
to do in the investment world. It's gotten harder and harder over the
last 20 years. I'll give you an example every one of you will
understand. 21 years ago when I got in the investment business foreign
stocks were considered non-correlated to US stocks. They didn't go up
and down at the same time. Now, if you're interested in your stock
portfolio, if you're one of these people that follows it compulsively
what do you do? You watch the Nikkei Index in Japan tonight to figure
out what the Dow is going to do tomorrow. That's not an example of
non-correlation. They're running together now. That has gotten harder
and harder and harder to do. I can't predict the future but I can say
one thing, I don't know what the risk of certain investments is going to
be going forward but I do know this, the risk of being very, very
heavily invested in bonds is a very strong risk right now because I can
tell you this, interest rates have been going down for the last 30
years, we've had a 30 year bull market in bonds that's unprecedented in
our nation's history but about a month ago interest rates started going
up. And I can tell you one thing for sure, as interest rates go up bond
values go down. Since we were passed this bill over from the Senate and
have been debating this bill our state retirement plan has lost 1.5
billion dollars in their bond portfolio, what we would consider the
least risky, safest part of the portfolio. Now critics of that statement
will tell you, &quot;yeah, but if you hold a bond to maturity you really
don't lose anything.&quot; Well that's true and not true. It is true if
you hold a ten year bond for ten years and that you paid $10,000 for it
you'll get $10,000 back. But if you pay attention to some of these
handouts I gave you, for every quarter of a point that we don't meet
that 7.25% bogey it requires us to pony up an additional 280 million
dollars. Now, I looked at my cell phone today and the ten year treasury
bond, right now, is yielding 2.5%. So if we're buying 2.5% treasury
bonds we are under-performing our bogey if we hold it to maturity by
4.75% every year. That means 5.3 billion dollars in extra appropriations
by you and I if we're willing to do that. If we're willing to just buy
bonds and under-perform by 4.75% it's going to take an additional 5.3
billion dollars of appropriations every year. So if you think that's
safe I think you need to think again. Second thing that critics of this
bill will say is that the fees are too high. These fees of these
alternative investments are just too high. Well again, there's
information on one of the sheets I gave you. The fees on our retirement
plan for the whole portfolio are 40 basis points, 0.40%. It's peers
average is 0.55% so our pension plan is running on lower fees than the
average pension plan of its size. Now it is true that sometimes you do
have to pay more for actively managed portfolios where it takes a higher
knowledge base to do. It doesn't take a huge knowledge base to go out
and buy treasury bonds but some of these things do require more but our
state treasurer has even had this plan audited by an outside firm to see
if they were paying too much fees and the outside office said, &quot;no,
you're in line.&quot; A third criticism I've heard is that, &quot;well
the alternatives just haven't done that well. They're just not doing all
that well.&quot; Well again, I don't know where they're getting that
from. I look at, one of the alternative categories is credit and that's
made an 11% average for the last three years which is pretty good. I've
had hedge funds point and say, &quot;look the hedge funds are only
making, they've only made 6% average the last three years.&quot;</p>

<p id="060:00">
Well do you know what the word hedge means, if you hedge your bets that
means you are betting against the rest of your portfolio. How about
this? How's stocks and bonds doing over the last three years, quite
well. I would have expected any hedged investments to have done very
poorly over the last three years because that is one of those things we
are using in case the main bets don't do well. So making 6 percent on
somthing on hedging on something where your prices are going up The
forth criticism I have heard is that well the treasury The treasurer
already has 34 percent of viability and is only using 20 so why is this
bill even necessary. And I think that's a legitimate question until you
understand how the current limit is stated. The treasurer right now can
only bring that alternative up to 34 percent and I am going to call her
she because our current treasurer is a she. if she invests to the max of
every sub category we frankly don't have one big over all limit on
investments right now we have 5 limits and you would have to be maxed
out on all 5 of those to get the 34 percent well just because she
believe real estate is a good investment right now doesn't mean. doesn't
necessarily mean she believes inflation protected assets are good. She
is not going to max out in a all 5 of them if you take the 5 sub
categories I just gave youa nd add them together you will realize that
it adds up to more than 35 percent it adds upt o something like 45
percent but we won't get into that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
SPeaker[SPEAKER CHANGES] it is not going to max out in all of them, I'll
be glad to answer his questions.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd
please state your purpose[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry to chair [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman may speak his inquiry [SPEAKER CHANGES] Time
allegation please [SPEAKER CHANGES] By rule there is 15 minutes for the
first debate and 10 minutes for the seconds representative collins has
11 minutes left no 4 thank you[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd I
am like you and I want to get out of here as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have heard all four of these criticisms levels and
in fact you have probably gotten three of these in an email. I will be
surprised if yo haven't so I feel like they deserve an answer. Anyway I
hope you'll support this bill. We're trying to give our treasurer the
flexibility she needs in order to do her job and if you understand
investing we are not adding to the risk involved in this portfolio. What
we are doing is giving her some flexibility with this bill so for
instance if she's got an asset that is performing well she doesn't have
to sell off some of it just because it's performing well and goes
outside that 5 percent I ask that you support this measure [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Jones please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Sent forth an amendment the general article sent forth an
amendment the gentleman will read. Representative jones moves to rewrite
the bill on page 6 line 8 by rewriting the line to read[] the gentleman
is recognized to read the amendment I know that everyone in here has
probably been lobbied pretty hard by this bill on both sides. In the
finance committee it passed by one vote There were a couple of different
concerns that were raised. we felt that This amendment might address to
put in the study. What this amendment would do would direct this to a
study of two particular issues that were debated in the finance
committee that led to concern one was the issue that sole fiduciary
structure of the straight of the state treasurer part of the discussion
was that North Carolina was one of only four states in the country That
has this particular structure that it might be helpful to just study and
see the other alternatives for administering the pension fund. The
second is the adequacy of the assumed rate of the return of 7 1/4%
percent directing the treasurer towards 7 1/4% may incur too much risk
and so we thought the way to deal with this would be to at least create
a study presented through to both side and both sides support this and
it seems very amenable and I Think it is a good amendment and I
recommend that both side support .</p>

<p id="065:00">
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I have no qualms whatsoever with the two items
that are in this amendment.  In fact I had spoken with Representative
Setzer after the Finance Committee meeting about perhaps the need to
include this in a study bill because I think it is a good question.  Do
we really need to place this kind of burden, fiduciary responsibility,
on one person and really an advisory board that that same person
appoints.  That's putting a lot of responsibility on one person.  I
frankly wouldn't want to have the responsibility that Treasurer Cowell
has right now and also it's a good question whether 7.25% is any kind of
magic number that's really based on any rationale.  So I'm going to
hesitatingly support this amendment and the only reason I hesitate is
that I hope this doesn't gum things up in the Senate and we don't wind
up killing the bill by adding something to it that's got to go back to
the Senate. That's my only hesitation on this whatsoever. I think these
are two great topics for us to study and for that reason I am not going
to offer any opposition to this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further debate on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, can you please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins. Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gladly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins, you just at the end said you
had some concerns that this might keep the bill from passing the Senate
so my question is this:  would you not want to take these two items, you
and Representative Jones take these two items that are in the amendment
and just put them in the studies bill as opposed to weighting down this
bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Frankly I would prefer that. Absolutely.  That would
be my preference.  Because I just can't predict what the Senate's going
to do about anything. I really can't.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.  Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It seems to me you're suggesting then that actually we
ought to vote against the amendment and be sure the bill is going to be
passed in the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may respond to the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have mixed feelings about this for two reasons.
Number one, if this amendment makes it easier for anybody  to vote for
this bill which was I believe unnecessarily contentious in the Finance
Committee then I hate to say vote against the amendment. On the other
hand, if the passage of the amendment gums things up in the Senate then
I'm going to rue the fact that we passed the amendment.  So I really
don't  know how to advise you, vote your conscience on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The word of the day is conundrum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke is recognized to debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.  Members, if you heard what
Representative Collins just told us, he said that he would prefer that
this be separate as part of the studies bill and I would be concerned
that if this amendment passes we could well end up with the bill not
getting through the Senate.  So with using your own reasoning
Representative Collins, I think I'm going to vote no and I would urge
other members as well to vote no on this amendment.  I think we do run
the risk of the bill not passing, getting into law, because of the time
factor right now. So I'm encouraging you to vote no.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Boles, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could ask Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ??? rumored with the Senate and everything I'm hearing
are we even going to have a studies bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That I have no inside information on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Boles, it is highly unlikely that there
will be a studies bill but as was the practice in the last session if
this were something that the body wanted to do then the House would take
the position that it would be commissioned through the LRC.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and I really appreciate the
Speaker's comment just now because it strikes me I agree very much with
the bill and I agree as well with the amendment but if it is a potential
block and I think it could be or a possibility I would hope
Representative Jones and wonder if you wouldn't be able to get a
commitment I'm sure from the leadership that this is an issue that ought
to be explored and can be done strictly by the leadership's commitment
even now to studying it and that would take away the problem of the
amendment.  I wonder if you would be willing with a commitment on the
floor, it would seem a consensus commitment, to withdraw the amendment.
Under those circumstances I don't think you'd find much opposition to
wanting to study this on our side.  I can't speak for everybody but it
certainly seems on your side that that would be available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm either yielding to a question or I'm debating for
a second time. Was that a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Speaker.</p>

Mr. Speaker, may I have the question re-directed to Rep. Jones? And I
apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields, and the gentleman will respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Glazier, I would put it this way: I believe that
this amendment makes some of our members here more comfortable in
perhaps voting for this bill. I don't if this bill is going to pass or
not. I know it passed the Finance Committee by one vote. The
representatives from the Treasurer's Office told me that they felt like
that this actually strengthened their bill. Now, again, as Rep. Collins
said, vote your conscience. My feeling is that if senators sponsored
this bill,l and they want this thing to pass, and it comes back to them,
and they've got the people that are for the bill telling them that they
would like to have it pass, I believe that it will. I can't guarantee
that, but I believe there are people on both sides of the issue that
thinks that this is a good amendment, and I'm gonna vote for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, if you do not intend to vote on the
amendment, if you'll turn off your light. I'm trying to sort out if
there members who have their lights on for the bill. So Rep. Robet
Brawley is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, I, too, work in the investment business and was
very much in favor of this bill when it first came up because I think
that a person should be allowed if they're responsible for managing
investments. Then I started research. I think all of us have heard of
the name Harlan? Bowles?, and the great job he did with our pension
plan. Under his watch, he could only invest in cash, bonds and stock. He
did in the late 80s get real estate added, and then in 2000 we added
private equity investments, hedge funds, credit strategies and inflation
protection. Ever since 2000 we've been concerned about the results of
our portfolio in the Treasurer's Dept. As far as this last year’s
return, the categories we're expanding, private equity investments did
6.55%. Hedge funds did minus 6.52%. Credit strategies .37%, and the
inflation protection investments -- inflation protection investments --
did minus 10.67%. I think this thing definitely needs some study. We
need to review it again, and I really do question expanding this
authority, but I really do thing this amendment is very much needed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Pittman, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To inquire to the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In trying to figure out how to vote on this amendment.
I wonder if we were to pass this bill without this amendment, I wanting
to clear on what the likelihood is that we could still get this studied
without having passed the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think, too, Rep. Robert Brawley's points, there are
some very legitimate questions to be asked. The Chair would be very much
supportive of study through the LRC.
[PAUSE]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In other words, it's gonna get studied one way or the
other. Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I feel that you just convinced us all to
vote No on the amendment because, and I appreciate what you said, that
we all agree here, on both sides that it ought to be studied, and you
indicated that you wanted to study, and we run the risk, as Rep. Collins
has said, that it gets mocked? up in the Senate. So I think it's a safer
way to go to vote No on the amendment because we know, we have the word
of our Speaker, that we're gonna get a study. So I feel more comfortable
voting No on it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair may have observed Rep. Luebke channeling his
inner Tillis. The Chair would defer to the members, but the members will
know that this matter will get studied should this amendment not pass.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further debate on the amendment? If not, the question
before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by Rep.
Jones for the House committee substitute of Senate Bill 558. All in
favor vote Aye, all opposed No. The Clerk will open the vote. [PAUSE]
The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. Forty-nine having
voted in the affirmative, 61 in the negative, the amendment fails. Now

We're back on the bill. Who ever represented state Ross please state
your purpose.
[Speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members
[Speaker changes]
Members recognizes to abate the bill.
[Speaker changes]
Couple of things I'd like to point out. In addition to what
Representative Collins has talked about. What we have...one of the
reasons why it's critical that we make these changes at this point in
time is because over the years, and I've been in this business for 34
years, trading these exact investments that we're talking about here,
one of the reasons why it's so important we do this now is because, we
have what I typically call created, we haven't created it, but the
perfect storm in investments right now, the interest rate market if you
look at interest rates over, let's look at treasury bonds over a 150
year history, interest rates are at the lowest levels that they've been,
really in history. And the one thing that we know for certain, in fixed
income investments, it's very mathematical. Fixed income investments
move in direct correlation with interest rates. The one thing we also
know for certain is, that they are, that they have no place to from this
point, but up. I did a couple of calculations earlier and we're
approximately at around 46% I think it is, in bonds. If we have a 1%
rise, in a 30 year bond, that's a negative rate of return for that bond
at 17.38%. That means that bond is gonna fall at 17%. Now it gets worse
if you go further out in duration ?? 30 year bonds and there are 30 year
bonds in the portfolio. If we get a 3% rise in interest rates, that's a
52% decline in the value of those bonds. Now you multiply that times the
amount of bond, the number of bonds that are in the portfolio and we're
talking about some serious money. Now with that in mind over the years,
alternative investments have come on the scene and I know that there was
something mentioned just a few minutes ago, about its certain points in
time, different investments were added to the strategy. When I started
in the business back in 1980, with Merrill Lynch some of these
investments weren't even available. In fact when I started in the
business back in 1980, some of these investments weren't even on the
drawing board. What we traded back then were stocks and and bonds and
that was it. Now as time has gone on and with technology, investments
have become more sophisticated. Someone mentioned earlier about
international investments. Well they were very hard to do back in 1980
but with technology we can now trade international investments just as
if they were domestic. So it's critical that we understand the
correlation of what's going to happen if we have, not if, but when have
a rise in interest rates. It was mentioned earlier that we had a little
bit of a signal, about 3 or 4 weeks ago, you may remember it, the Fed
said ?? chairman said we may draw back a little bit on what we're, what
we're doing as far as our activity on the bond market. We think it may
be time to start pulling back because we think the, economy may be able
to stand on its own, it didn't work. You saw the Stock Market fall and
you saw the Bond Market take a huge hit. And it was mentioned earlier
that the, ten, what happened with the 10 year treasury bond was about a
1.2 billion dollar hit in the bond portfolio pension plan. Now what's
going to happen when all of this, as I call it the Perfect Storm, takes
place is they're going to come back to us and want us to fund the
difference which we, the billions are going to be so large, we're not
going to be able to do it. That they're going to be looking to us, to
fund the difference in this plan when it falls. ?? Reason for the
flexibility, in the alternative bracket, and I like to call it buckets,
because if you take the, the, different, strategies that they have
listed, credit strategies, real estate, ?? funds, alternatives in
inflation protection, the reason for the flexibility or the need for
flexibility there is again, if you look at what's going on with credit
strategies right now and that's another area that's pretty mathematical,
if the ?? curve or if the credit spread widens to a certain point ??</p>

<p id="080:00">
know mathematically exactly what it's going to do to the underlying
bonds in the credit strategy. Right now that's doing well. But they're
capped out, they can't put any more money in it. So you've got an
investment there that's doing well, you're capped out, you can't put any
more money into it, and then you've got one, inflation protection,
that's not doing well. And all of these things move at different times.
So we need to look at granting flexibility to be able to
outright--frankly, I think that they need even more flexibility than
we're talking about here. Because if I were working in credit strategies
for example right now, I would want to more than 7.5% in credit
strategies. But I know there are limits. So I think that what we need to
do here is take a real serious look at guarding the future of the
pension plan. A lot of institutions put alternatives into their
portfolios as an insurance, sort of an insurance play. Because they know
that if stocks and bonds fall, typically within the alternative
strategy, there is something that's going up. They don't necessarily buy
these for the return as much as they do to protect the portfolio on the
down side. So that when you take the big hit in bonds, you've got
something that's going to factor back into the number and level it out
and the hit will not be as bad. So I urge you to support the bill. I
think it's critical, I think it's timely. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hurley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm one of these people that's called the
critic, according to our bill sponsor. I, as a state employee, having 20
years invested in the retirement system, and you all are retirement
investors, too, because your money is invested in here in the retirement
system. We have 800,000 that are invested in the system. They are
Teachers and State Employees Retirement System, the Consolidated
Judicial Retirement System, the Firemens and Rescue Workers Pension
Fund, the Local Governmental Employees Retirement System, the
Legislative Retirement System, and the North Carolina National Guard
Pension Fund, and the Retiree Health Benefit Fund. All of those are
included in our retirement system. Now I mean no disrespect for the
treasurer or her office, but she already has the authority to invest 34%
of the $81 billion in this fund in alternative investments. Some of
these investments have large transaction and investment fees that we
have been told about and they do cost hundreds of millions of dollars,
and understand that she spent 300,000 last time--300 million last time,
excuse me, in fees, but supposedly return was 5 billion. So that was
really, really good. But I don't have a crystal ball. I don't what the
economy's going to do. And yes, the bonds are going down. I understand
the interest rates are going up, the dollar's going down. We don't know
what's going to happen with this. The 34% that she has the authority to
invest right now is only--right now she only is investing 22% of it. If
this bill passes, the credit strategies portfolio will go--right now she
can invest 5% and supposedly has 5 or 4%--but it would go to 7.5%. The
real estate portfolio would stay at 10% that she can invest in, because
that couldn't go any higher, for whatever reason. That happened in the
committee. I was not in the committee meeting. The hedge funds--we're
not sure how much is invested in that, maybe 1%, maybe 2%, we don't have
a total. But it would go to 8.5%. The alternatives portfolio is 7.5% now
and she only has 4.5% invested in it right now and it would go to 8.75.
The inflation protection portfolio, she has 5% that she can do; she's
only invested 4, and then she could go to 7.5%. Please join me in voting
against this bill. Thank you.</p>

Representative Blust, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of
the House. I don’t consider myself a critic. I just consider myself
what’s called an investment somewhat risk-averse. And in investments,
the investment advisors usually try to get an idea from the client how
much risk they’re willing to take on because that’s the ?? of this bill.
It is in essence are we willing with the 80 billion or so invested, are
we willing to up that risk? Are we willing to go into more risky
investments? Now, there is in investing, one of the first fundamental
rules is the risk return. If you are willing to take more risk with the
same amount of money, you can potentially earn a greater return if you
can sleep at night, knowing there is more of a chance that that 10,000 I
just invested could go to 5,000 tomorrow. I’m happy with my financial
situation to know I can afford to lose that 5,000. So I might put it in
more risky investments, knowing I’ve also got a greater chance with that
10,000 to make it 20,000. So all investors have this different capacity
for risk. In our situation, we’re dealing with the state pension plan,
this 80-some billion. I think it’s incumbent upon us to like Harlon
Boyles, to be very risk-averse. Now that can hurt us in the long run in
a sense in that the problem here that the treasury’s seeking to solve is
the fact that we are on the hock. It is a promise. It’s a legal
obligation of this state to pay certain benefits over the coming year
and years and decades and on into perpetuity, what we’ve promised
retirees. That’s the obligation. Right now we have 80 billion saved up
against that obligation, and we’re saying my goodness, if we can return
7.2%, then we don’t have to put in as much money each year in our
budget. We don’t have to put it in like we did today. We don’t have to
put in this much on our annual budget if we can assume that fund is
going to earn a higher rate of return. Now in the last year or so,
that’s been fairly easy because we’ve had a federal reserve that has
seemingly without believing there could be a negative consequence,
decide they are going to pump 85 billion of new money into the economy
every month. They are buying I think it’s 40 million in, 40 billion in
treasury debt each month. They are buying 45 billion of mortgage-backed
securities each month in an attempt to stimulate the economy. That’s why
we’re at this interest rate turning point, is that people are starting
to think there are going to be negative consequences to that in interest
rates at some point. Now what we have in essence is we’ve got this
unfunded liability. We don’t have to put up as much cash, so let’s if we
earn more, so let’s take a higher risk. We’re behind in the early third
quarter, so let’s start throwing long. We might connect. But the problem
is, the chances are you won’t connect. And that’s going to have enormous
consequences if we take this bet and it doesn’t pay off, if it pays off
then the people pushing this are geniuses. But here’s the chance it
won’t, there’s a bigger chance it won’t. And that means even more money
has to be anted up annually to meet these obligations. And I think those
who oppose it are just saying whoa, whoa, it might be best to take a
look at this and go easy on the risk. We’re already at 34, as
Representative Brawley said, it wasn’t long ago these were zero. And we
seem to be rushing into this, it is not that long into this that</p>

<p id="090:00">
That we’ve gone. And it, it is higher risk. The portfolio risk can be
managed through your, through your stocks and your bonds. Now let me
explain the bonds if I can. Yes there’s a paper loss as interests go up
because if you have say a thousand dollar bond that pays 10% you have a,
a ten, say it’s ten years, you have in essence a contract that in ten
years that company, say it’s IBM whatever, is gonna pay you back that
ten thousand. And in the meantime every year they’re gonna give you a
thousand. Those are less risky because they stand in, there is a risk of
bankruptcy. And different bond categories bear different risks. You,
you’ve all heard junk bonds. But your high grade corporates, your
government debt is, is known as very, very light risk. So you, you are
gonna get, the thing to remember is even if interest rates go up and you
say right now we’ve lost X amount on our bond portfolio. If you keep
those, those are gonna go back up to face value when they mature and you
still get that annual income from the bond. So you don’t necessarily
have to lose a dime. That’s not true of equities because the equities
might not go back up. But bonds are known as, as low risk because you’ve
got that payment guarantee unless there’s a bankruptcy. And they’re less
risk because the bond gets paid first in a bankruptcy over any equity.
So we are seeming to be taking on additional risk here and we need to be
careful about it. And I wish there was a way that those who are so eager
to go in this route could be personally guaranteeing this debt because
if it’s not paid there’s a lot of people who are gonna be coming to us
with IOUs wanting, wanting their money back. I would say this to you.
One thing does need to be, does need to be said here. Well folks you can
take this as a joke if you’d like. [SOUND] You can take this bill as
some kind of joke. But this is deadly serious what we’re doing here.
These and I wonder if this isn’t the reason for the bill, these
investments that we’re wanting to go into pay a lot more to the money
managers. They pay higher fees. And if you’ll look at the fees. One
thing I’ve learned and I no investment expert but over the years is I
have read several times the average, the markets themselves outperform
85% of the professionals. And there are index funds, there are things
you can do for very low fees that are going to pay you a pretty good
return. And you can take those fees you don’t pay and you can add them
to principal and invest those too. And we oughta take a look at doing
some of that because one of these handouts says that five billion was
gained for three hundred million in fees. That I notice that’s for one
year. I used to listen to the great John Templeton on Wall Street Week
when they had him on. And he said you have got to look at the long term
and see how people perform under various scenarios. And it is true we’re
in an interest rate hike. It’s changed a 30 year bull market is gone.
And, and Mr. Andy Silton/g who was the, the richer/g treasurer Moore’s/g
investment officer who first got us into these type of investments is
now warning us about them. And he’s pointing out that nobody in money
management today came up in an interest rate rising environment. And
there’s a lot of rules and a lot of conventions that people are gonna
find out no longer hold true in this type of environment. And all of
that adds to that risk. So we need to be careful. We probably need to
take a look at not mandating quite so high a return from the treasurer
cuz I don’t blame her for wanting to throw long. But we have to sit here
and work calmly and rationally as fiduciaries of these peoples’ money
that Representative Hurley talked about. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will come into session at noon. For
your planning purposes right now, the Chair and the leadership are
working hard not to have session on Friday. We're hopeful that we'll be
able to clean things up. To this point, there are no bills that would
require us to carry over. We'll consult with the Members if something
does come to us that requires a second reading. We'll gauge ? the caucus
as to whether or not we would have to do that as a midnight session with
concurrence of the minority, or an early-morning session. But at this
time, there are no such bills. Just that would be the only reason at
this point that we may have to have a Friday session. Rep. Larry Hall,
please state your purpose. Notices and announcements.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I've left at your
desk a brochure for an exciting exhibit that's coming to my district to
the North Carolina Museum of Art. It's in my district, but it's the
entire state's museum. It starts in October, but I wanted to make you
aware of it now in hopes that we won't be gathered here together any
time before October. But some of the most significant Porsches in the
entire world are coming to North Carolina at the Museum of Art. This is
the museum's first ever design exhibit. It's focusing on design as
opposed to art. So it's a big step forward for them, but it's generating
a lot of attention. They've got cars coming in from the Porsche factory
collection over in Germany, Jerry Seinfeld's collection, Ralph Lauren's
collection. No word on if any from the Moore or Hager collection are
coming, however.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Tolson, please state your purpose.
