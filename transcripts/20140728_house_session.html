The House will come to order. Members please take your seat. Visitors
retire from the chamber. Sargent at Arms please close the doors. Please

Representative Marilyn Avila. Please stand. Please remain standing for
the Pledge of Allegiance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let us pray. Our Father God
as we come to you now in the waning days of this session, we just ask
that you keep our patience under control, that you keep our hearts
soften still, and our minds open to suggestions even at the last minute
that might work. We ask that in the decisions that we make knowing that
not everyone will be happy, that we have at least done our best to
minimize the damage or the setbacks or however those who are being
governed view it that they would understand that it has been a struggle
and that at all times those involved have kept the best interest of our
state in mind. We have different ideas and different beliefs in how that
can be best achieved by getting together and discussing it and
recussing/g it, we hope we have reached a decision that will renown to
your honor and glory as we have been placed by you here in the General
Assembly to govern over your people in North Carolina. We ask your
blessing on those who defend our liberties and give us the opportunity
to gather here in open debate that these freedoms would always be
protected and those in our military who put their lives on the line for
that will be recognized and honored by us always for their sacrifices
and the sacrifices of their family. We just ask your guidance and wisdom
and love and mercy as we move forward to finish up this session, to
study the things that need to be looked at for the sessions coming up
and always into the future you’re our guidance and our hope. And all
these things we ask in Jesus name. Amen.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Amen.
