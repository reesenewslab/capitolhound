[Speaker Change]
The gentleman for Stanly Representative Burr is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Member for those of you who didn't have an
opportunity to know Bobby Harold Barbie Sr. you really missed an
opportunity to know a man who was a good hearted Christian servant. As
pastor Ronny Russell rightly stated, Bobby Harold established himself as
an iconic figure in a small town of locusts. Pastor Russell’s right
about that, Bobby Harold was also an iconic and well respected man
throughout all of the areas of Stanley Union and Cabarrus Counties that
he served during his 18 years in this house. Bobby Harold was well
respected in our community and in this legislative body. He served our
community with honor and integrity. Many of the General Assembly staff
as a matter of fact some today as we've taken the family around have
commented about how kind Bobby Harold was and about how they still
receive the family Christmas card that Bobby Harold and his family send
out. And what a great and wonderful family man and family that he has.
Without a doubt in my mind and nothing was more important to Bobby
Harold on this earth than his family. Jackie his five children and a
pile of grandchildren, and even great grandchildren that he has. And I
can tell you that even during his time in this body at the end of the
day when many of us are worn out and, and just ready to, to go back to
our hotel rooms, or apartments and, and lay out for the night. Bobby
Harold was often getting into his car and driving back home, an over two
hour drive so that he could go to his sons baseball games, and any other
family functions that he had. Bobby Harold had has priorities in the
right place, and at the end of the night after those functions were
over, he'd get in his car and drive back to Raleigh so he could be here
to do his job the next morning. He knew what was important to him, and
that was Bobby Harold Barbie's family. And I wanna say as I mentioned
his family to thank those who are in the gallery, his family for
sacrificing their time away from their father, and allowing him to serve
this body for 18 years to serve our community for 18 years. It's not
easy to, as we all know to, to see a family member, for us to leave
this, to leave our homes at the beginning of the week and to come to
Raleigh and to serve. And it especially wasn't easy for Bobby Harold
having the family back home with five kids, and all of his grandkids and
the many opportunities he missed out back home. But he did it because he
loved our community and he loved this state. And he was certainly
willing to serve this place, and he did it every day for 18 years, and
we're grateful for that. I can tell you that I am, for those of you who
knew Bobby Harold, you'll know what I'm talking about. I'm gonna miss
that smile. If you ever saw Bobby Harold when he smiled his whole face
lit up, I mean you just, you knew this smile. I, I can tell you the many
times that driving up he lived on Main ST., and locust. Fixed up an old
house there it, if any of you've ever been through ?? side of the fresh
house, the little restaurant it's our local Cracker Barrel. And you'd
never miss seeing Bobby Harold usually sitting out in the front lawn,
and always really was great for to go over there and to see him. And
just certainly as I say I'm gonna, gonna miss seeing that, seeing that
face, and seeing that smile. But Bobby Harold really saw beyond the
outside appearance of people. He didn't care about your looks, or your
age, or your wealth. That wasn't what mattered to Bobby Harold, that
wasn't what was important to him. It was about what was on the inside,
and I can tell you that I know directly about that because you know, why
would a distinguished man with 18 years of service in the legislature,
who was well respected in our community, a business owner wanna support
a 22 year old kid to come to Raleigh to replace him. You know he really
was about serving our community, and he didn't care what you looked
like, he was all about serving our, serving our community and standing
up for what he thought was best.</p>

<p id="15:00">
And I am forever grateful for that, as a young person he inspired me to,
to serve in this body. And I can remember going around and spending some
time with him, campaigning and we had good times doing that. His family
has got a while slew of other stories they could tell about putting up
signs and everything else that he had them do. It's the benefit of
having a large family, makes it a little bit easier to get volunteers
when you need them. But as a legislator, I can tell you, as a
legislator, I can tell you I'm really gonna miss Bobby Harold and being
able to turn to him for advice. Eighteen years in this chamber, you
learn a lot and you have a lot of experience behind you. And I certainly
have relied and have leaned on him over the time. And I remember, as I
can tell you, I am truly going to miss Bobby Harold Barbee. He was a
statesman, a great man, a Christian man, who certainly loved his family,
loved the Lord and loved this state. And I thank God for Bobby Harold
Barbee and his time that he had here, and I commend the resolution to
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Johnston, Representative
Daughtry, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The member has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Speaker. Members of the House, you can always know when
you're getting older because you think more about the past than you
think about the future. And I'm not old, but I am beginning to think
more about the past than I have in recent years. And one of the things
about the past that stands out is Bobby Harold Barbee Sr. I really think
that times were different back when he was first here. Because the
unique situations that we found ourselves in, young legislators, back in
the late 80's and early 90's. One time, we had just taken over the
House,  and Barbee and I, Bobby and I were talking, and Bobby said,
&quot;We've got two real problems to confront.&quot; And I said,
&quot;What are they, Bob?&quot; He said, &quot;The two real problems we
have facing us are the Democrats and the Senate. If we can avoid those
two problems, we can be very successful.&quot; But the thing I remember
the most about Bobby was where he lived. And I've talked to his wife
Jackie earlier today and she agrees, that it was a pigsty. He lived with
Jerry Dockham, Ed McMahon, ???, Tim Talent, and I think he had one more,
I think he lived with Steve Wood, in a two bedroom apartment. This is
the truth. And they had mattresses all over the floor, they had long
chairs. You walk in and I said, &quot;How do all of you use the
bathroom? There's five of you, there's only two bathrooms.&quot; And
they never did explain that to me. And then they decided to go buy some
furniture, and they went out and they bought a sofa and two chairs, I
think for 28 dollars. It was the worst looking place I've ever seen. But
they managed to live there, and they lived there for a number of years.
And there were never a closer bunch of men than those guys were. And
Bobby was so devoted to his family. He was devoted to this House. It's a
real honor for me to look back and see Bobby in this building and
remember the good times we had. I certainly, with all seriousness,
recommend this resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Davidson, Representative
Dockham, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Speaker and members of the House. Representative Daughtry
is just jealous. But on September the 26th, 2013, I lost a good friend.
This is a bittersweet day for me. It is bitter in the fact I lost a
friend, but it's sweet that we remember his memory and think about the
good times. Stanley county never had a better Representative that
thought more about the constituents and what he could do for his friends
and for his constituents. Mr Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the
House, the two times that I have been away from home, one was at
college, and one was when I came down here, I have really had the good
fortune to be thrown with good people. Representative Daughtry doesn't
have his facts quite right. It was Representative Brubaker originally,
Representative Cole, Tim Talent, Bobby Harold Barbee, we filtered a few
through, in and out, occasionally, and then Ed McMahon joined our group.
And I don't mean this in any disrespect to anyone at all, but we were
affectionately known as the homeless shelter.</p>

<p id="20:00">
There were five of us there, I was the landlord. I had the master
bathroom, and the master bedroom and bathroom. Representative Talent
[SP] and McMahon were in the front bedroom. Representative Barbie was
domiciled in the dining room area and Representative Cole had the sun
porch. So we had plenty of room and we had it made. We brought lawn
chairs from home, that was our furniture, and representative Cole
brought a black and white TV which we put on a coca-cola tray and
watched TV with. One night I got a call, one Saturday night I got a call
from the Raleigh police saying we had been broken into and he said I
don't think anything was taken. I said, well, if you can lock everything
up I'll be there Monday. And all weekend I could only think about the
expression on the fellas face that broke into our apartment. When he
kicked down the door and went charging in and turned out the light he
said, my gosh, these guys are worse off than I am!
But Representative Barbie and I being the tightest of the republicans in
the group were dispatched to buy furniture after that and we went to the
wholesale place here in Raleigh and I'll never forget this. we got a
couch, a loveseat a chair, two end tables, two lamps and a coffee table
for $147.00. and when we got up to check out Representative Barbie being
the good republican he was said, is this the best you can do on that
price? I thought the guy was gonna kick us out, I really did. But those
were just a couple of the stories I could tell. we were roommates for
over ten years and he always looked after his constituents, he always
loved his family. And as representative Daughtry said many an evening we
would wonder where Bobby Harold was and he had headed back to locust to
see a ballgame or do something with his family. And I kind of took up
that habit myself and made many a trip back to Denton.
Even though he was old enough really to be my dad he was more of a big
brother and many times we would just sit out on the stoop and just talk.
 Talk about politics, talk about family. He would talk about going back
and running his business, mowing someone's yard or when it snowed
clearing the snow off of their steps our out of their driveway. He was
just a good man. and Mr. Speaker I miss him and this House was better
for him having served and he loved his family and I commend the
resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Caldwell,
Representative Starnes rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the
house I too served with Bobby Harold, Barbie, we were freshmen together
in 1987 having both been elected in '86. And if you know Bobby Harold
Barbie, it's already been said, you couldn't help but be warmed by the
most infectious smile you had ever seen. I don't know that I ever saw
him when he wasn't smiling. And he loved people, and that was I guess
the genius of his success as a legislator is that he just loved people
and he knew how to connect with the people at home and if they had a
problem it became his problem. And he worked to solve a problem for
anybody that came to him with whatever their concern was. I know after
that first session ended and we had adjourned [??], I saw Bobby Harold
out in the courtyard and he let out a big sigh, he said, woo, we finally
got through that. He said, it took two years but I was able to get by
these first two years and I never had to say a thing on the floor of the
house.
He wasn't one that stood up and did a lot of talking but he did a lot of
listening, and that's what people appreciated about him. He would listen
and he heard what you had to say. I know he was always going back for
the ballgames or for the family occasions that he had and I know at one
time there was a vote coming up on the floor, of course it didn't matter
if he were here or not, there weren't enough republicans to make a
difference. But he had gone home to see the ballgame, then he came back
and one of our...</p>

colleagues, another legislator said &quot;You should have been here for
that vote last night, you've got to get your priorities in the right
order.&quot; And he said, &quot;I've got my priorities in the right
order, and if you had your priorities in the right order, you'd have
something besides a cat to go home to at night.&quot;
Bobby Harold had  5 wonderful children and a wife to go home to at
night. He could always tell the funniest stories, and everyone just
migrated to Bobby Harold because he always had something to say, he was
always very encouraging. He would lift your spirits if you were down and
out. I know one time I had a bill in a local government committee, and
this was back during the time when Steve Wood used to live with you
folks til he got kicked out, and because he had tried to make a maneuver
where he could be the Speaker pro Temp and it wasn't successful. So
anyway, Rep. Decker had asked Steve Wood to chair temporarily while he
presented a bill in the local government  committee and I had a bill
that came up after that. Well then Steve Wood got up to preside,
unbeknownst to me, the other Republicans, they boycotted the meeting and
they got up and talked out. So then they called me to present my bill,
and I was standing there and me against all the Democrats over there,
and I thought I couldn't stand a chance, I couldn't find it. So I went
looking for him, and I couldn't find Bobby Harold about anywhere. So
finally I went into his office, and I saw Rosa, and I said &quot;Rosa,
where is Rep. Barbee?&quot; And she wouldn't say much, and I went into
his office and he and Arlie Culper are hiding behind the door and he
says, &quot;We're hiding,&quot; so I called him cockroach after that
because he would come out and hide.
But anyway, really when you needed him, Bobby Harold Barbee was there.
He was there for his family, he was there for his church, and he loved
to sing. He always had a song on his lips, so Mr. Speaker and ladies and
gentlemen of the House, I can't say enough good things about Rep.
Barbee. He was a friend to all. If you didn't know him, you missed
knowing a wonderful person, but had he been here today, you would all
say &quot;He was my friend&quot; as well. And I commend the resolution
to you.

The gentleman may state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I make a motion to that we suspend the
Rules to the end that we may modify this conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion would be out of order. This not a
conference report. This is simply a motion to -- it is a motion to
concur on third reading. Does the gentleman . . .  ? It's just a motion
to concur or not concur. It is  not a conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The only --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The House would have to not concur in order for a
conference to be enacted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, then, to be heard on the motion, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Before us today we have an
opportunity as we deal with these employment issues and the unemployment
and technical changes that are done. We have an opportunity to address
an issue that is coming up that's going to affect 70,000 North
Carolinians at the end of this month. That is the extension of the
Federal Unemployment Benefits till the end of this year. It's something
we just decided to do, to cut off these 70,000 North Carolinians, and we
have an opportunity right now at this time to vote against concurring
and make changes as necessary on this bill as it pertains to that area
of the law and insure that those 70,000 North Carolinians at least have
that little bit of support until the end of the year. Again, it's a
decision we made after seeing the economy continue stagnant as it is.
After seeing the unemployment rate going down very little if at all, we
have an opportunity now to say we need to give these people that relief
and let them continue to have it until the end of the year. Again these
extended Federal Unemployment Benefits, so I'd ask that you'd vote
against concurrence.

before the House is the motion for concurrence to House Bill 743 on its

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the house. What this bill does, this
bill is a continuing resolution, what you would commonly hear as a cr
and what it allows the state to do is continue the operation of state
government past the end of this month. This particular CR is effect
until the end of July, hopefully it will not be needed for that length
of time. This allows us to complete our, conferencing and negotiating on
the budget, and get that budget enacted. There are several sections in
this particular CR, it funds state government at 95% of the current
funding levels, of course programs for which someone is required some
payment, that payment is made at full. But this does allow us at the 95%
level to insure that agencies would otherwise not spend beyond what they
may be appropriated in the final budget. There are several other
sections, most of this is boilerplate(???) or fairly standard language
that we have in the bill, we've made a couple contingencies for schools
to the tune of about ten million dollars, because they have year-round
schools that open up, a couple other areas like that have been addressed
in the bill, I think it's fairly straightforward. I would be happy to
attempt to answer any questions and I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Larry Hall please state your purpose

Thank you Mr. Speaker, and Rep. Doller, just for those of us who are not
really involved in it and have some question about the time it's going
to take, do you have any estimated time you think the budget negotiation
will be completed by?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just as soon as we can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Gentleman Yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is for 30 days additional time is that correct?

later than July 31st.</p>

all you are you. you indicated there was the special consistent gone or
indication of as this continuing resolution&quot; is there any provision
that allows for other state entities who will have budget decisions that
have to be made to have a contingency fund will be addressed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
well this is shy if you looking here, there are provisions that address
the community college address that task funding all of those items that
would normally need to be addressed either either held for variety of
reasons, or where funds have to be authorized in order to operate all of
those normal standard provisions are in this continuing resolution. I
would also point out that it does have units in
toward the end. an additional section thirteen does provide some
additional money for Medicaid issue that came up Monday of this week,
and this allows the will allow the administration to take reversions
with in the Department of Health and Human Services to pay for some
additional Medicaid expenditures that are occurring before the into the
month and that doesn't affect our art budget reversion numbers, but it's
money there that we need authorized for that purpose,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
that is  purpose for living pleasurably take a purpose to see verbs of

you expect to speak
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
think you're presented out of this is really just trying to find out
what provision needs on section hi, since it's not clear. can you tell
me what's being revealed
by sections in one segment. there. this was a provision in this was a
provision was in the budget. the last couple years that was going to be
repealed with and the budgets and buys the house in an Senate version
and what it has to deal with is the refund income tax refunds. there was
a provision for some reason got in the budget year last year for last.
that actually appropriated refunds and that was, upon further
reflection, thought to not be the best idea so this is just taking out
that impediment, effective the first thank your much
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
present of a shopping centre purpose and I guess the gentleman in
question arose and dollar. this gentleman you are you the gym and yield
spread, and now I'm looking at section thirteen only dealing with the
Medicaid program is there's an additional hundred and forty five million
dollars and we talk what it should be actually an additional needs
additional than that of it should be about forty five in dollars with a
that I found you from start to write init, or it could be boarded by me
write an additional forty five me. yes, it's best to try the find out
exactly where comes from that part of it is again an under estimation by
the Department of federal receipts and there also appears to be somewhat
of an acceleration of claims that come in this last week and I think
there's been some speculation that with the new system. the new MMI
system coming on July first. maybe addition function wanted to get dear
claims in an ever ready to go into their claims in ahead of that new
system covenant was not a question, the general yields can you tell me
where the forty five million coming from his right is coming from her
versions identified reversions with in the department and it does not
affect the reversion reversions that we have in our in our budget
documents that the budget was based on this is additional dollars with
Anderson Chan of money there. for example, Anderson, other reversion
dollars are being used to cover this expenditure. they just need
authorization to do it. I'm not a question and a gentleman outside. I
guess I'm genuinely confused because we've got an additional forty five
million and we're talking aboutit and you use it. it is not</p>
