<p id="00:00">
Representative Larry Hall, Democratic Leader in the House of
Representatives. Appreciate you coming to hear from us this morning on
the fantasy budget that we have out here, or it might be a mystery, I'm
sure you want to know and of course, the rest of us in the legislature
want to know what's in this budget. You know, we know why we're here
today; it's because of the giveaways we did, we gave them to
out-of-state corporations, we gave tax breaks to millionaires, and we
knew that we didn't have the revenue to elevate our teachers from 46th
in the nation, yet and still, we made those decisions. And now, of
course, the out-of-state corporations and the millionaires are happy,
but our teachers and our public education, and the future of our state
is still in doubt. Now, everyone agrees we need to raise pay to the
national average to stay competitive and to move our state forward, and
everybody's willing to give lip service to that concept, but again
remember where we are and how we got here, we're giving lip service to
that, we're giving tax breaks to the out-of-state corporations and the
millionaires, lip service to moving our teachers to the national
average. So what is real, and what is not? We went through this process,
we know that we've used disingenuous and misleading information
throughout this process, and that's why we've demanded that we have
these discussions regarding the budget in public. And so we had a few
discussions, but now we've gone back to the same old backroom deals, a
couple people know what's going on, no one else knows, and if we recall,
before we forced there to be public discussions, there were bogus
lottery numbers being used, that people subsequently had to admit, yes,
they weren't true, they knew they weren't true, and they were being used
in the process. Then we went through the discussion of Medicaid dollars,
what were the real costs, what were the legitimate expectations and the
estimates, who was using them, and, if you recall, we ended up settling
on an agreed-upon number, not based on a fact, not based on projections,
that was an agreed-upon number just based on negotiations, so again how
valid is that number? If both of the parties were sincere about what
they said the Medicaid costs were, we ended up with a number that was
negotiated not based on fact, not based on agreement that this is what
it's going to really cost, but just let's move this process along, which
is fine, when you are charge, you have the ability to do that. Well, we
had to have these public negotiations because we found out about those
misleading statements. They weren't just misleading, they were
misstated, and they were miscalculated. Most recently we know we got
projections of additional losses of revenue, but now here we are. After
all  of this, the backroom deals are back, and we've seen this before,
we started off that way, and we said we need to have public discussions.
So now we started of with the Speaker and the Governor saying &quot;this
is going to be our budget, this is what we're going to do, and the
Senate needs to get on board&quot;. We weren't even invited. Now we have
the Speaker and the Senate President saying, President Pro Tempore,
saying &quot;this is going to be the budget, we're going to get in a
room together, the two of us, and decide what it's going to be, and the
Governor's not invited&quot;. Now we've seen this movie before, it
doesn't end well, who's going to get the shaft in this deal. Now they've
created this sense of urgency, oh it's got to be done, someone said, by
the end of this week, but no one knows what's in the budget. We're going
to do it through a conference report, where you have to vote it up or
down, but no one knows what's in the budget. We've heard someone say,
&quot;well, just have faith in us.&quot; These are the same guys that
misstated what the calculations would be from the lottery, disagreed
widely and wildly on what the Medicaid costs would be, these are the
same guys now saying &quot;just trust us, and you'll probably like what
we do, and then we're going to go home.&quot; Well, not only did they do
that, but they put it in a form now, in this conference report,   that
when they bring it out, you're going to have to vote on it, and you're
not going to have a chance to really review it, to amend it, to do any
of those things, they're just going to bring it out, pass it, and then
you can figure out, members of the Legislature, the public, even the
press...</p>

<p id="05:00">
Y’all are gonna have to figure it out after it’s done. That’s the track
that we’re on right now. That’s not the track anyone wanted to be on.
The public doesn’t want a budget that they don’t know anything about. So
they created this urgency. They put it in conference report now. They
tell you we can’t tell you what it is. We can’t tell you how we came up
with the figures and the numbers in it. Well, I would submit after the
record of this session, that Speaker Tillis, and Senate President Pro
Tempore Burger can be credible, credible on this issue now. All we can
depend on is what they’ve done and their record says. And that is we’re
going to give the tax breaks to the out of state corporations and the
millionaires, and then whatever crumbs are left we may give toward
teacher raises and to state employee raises. And then, whatever else is
needed as far as Medicaid etc, who knows? We may do reform. We may put
it in the budget, we may not. We may not even discuss it. Once again,
out of state corporations and millionaires, they get the gold mine.
Citizens of North Carolina regarding education and health care, they’re
getting the shaft. Now, we need to see what’s gonna be in this budget
before it comes in the form of a conference report. So I’m gonna
challenge once again, as we did before, that they put this conference
report out for a 72 hour review. We were assured that they were gonna
have these negotiations in public, and we made a big spectacle of it,
but now they’re going back behind closed doors. So we’re gonna request
that it be put out for a minimum of 72 hours, so citizens can know
what’s in this budget. So interest groups and professionals who
understand the impact of it can tell us what it is going to do, and what
the impact is going to be. Not just us, meaning not just Democratic
legislators, but Speaker Tellis, and President Pro Tempore Burger as
well, what effect this will have. I wanna just reference finance
co-chair David Lewis and his observations. He said the decisions we made
were based on those estimates. Unfortunately, note that word
unfortunately, some of those estimates have proven not to be right. Well
now we know some of those estimates were known not to be right when they
were told to us, especially regarding the lottery and then the dispute
that was made on Medicaid. But he says, if there’s additional indication
that revenue’s going to be down, we already got the report last week,
there’s no question of an indication. The projections are that the
revenue is going to be down. If there’s additional indication that
revenue is going to be down, we’re probably going to have to take a look
at it. Is it a short term thing? Is it a long term thing? What the
possible fixes will do. Well that’s what we’re here for. Now I don’t
know who the “we” is that are going to look at it, but I think the
citizens of North Carolina who are affected by it should have a chance
to look at it. And I want to call David Lewis to account for his word.
We know there’s a problem with the revenues, the numbers are down. We
need to have an opportunity to look at this, and this is just
unsatisfactory to say we’re going to budget in this manner after we were
assured that this would be done publicly and the public would have an
opportunity to be involved and see what was going to happen with the
negotiations. So I’m a-go ahead and ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you. Thank you all for being here and for your interest in
this topic. We’re all, we’ve all been interested in seeing how it will
end up. A couple of things- And by the way, I’m Susan Fisher. I’m one of
the House Minority Whips, from Buncombe County. I’ve been here for five
terms, getting ready to run for a sixth, and I have never seen – I have
never seen so much dealings done in private behind closed doors as we
have seen during this session. Just wanted to highlight a couple of
things that leader Hall mentioned, and they are that as the article in
the N&amp;O suggested yesterday, the smoke is on Jenns Street. The smoke
appears on Jenns Street, well that in itself implies that everything was
done in private. We don’t know what’s in the budget. We were asked do we
know? Well, no, we don’t know specifics. We know what we’re getting from
our constituents. I’m hearing already from folks at home, teachers in
particular, who are saying, you know</p>

<p id="10:00">
The raise sounds good. But how stable is that? Will we be able to count
on that next year, or the next year? We know that this is all been done
between a few people and among a few people, it has not engaged the
whole citizenry. The other thing that happened the last time they went
behind closed doors, as Leader Hall mentioned, their figures, their
numbers sort of disintegrated when the public got see what was actually
was being proposed, and I refer to the lottery numbers when I’m talking
there. Now though, this goes back to another thing mentioned, the stakes
are even higher because what we’re going to see after they open the door
is a conference report. Conference reports can not be amended, what we
see, is what we get. Nobody gets a chance to have any input, and they’ll
run that through both chambers, and then they’ll go home and say look
what a great job we did. And, that’s what they’re going to do before the
public even knows what’s in the bill. So, I challenge them to back to
the democratic process, to allow the public, the people they represent,
to have a say in what happens to their livelihood. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I want to take questions, but I do want to be clear, that even
the press has a responsibility here. Certainly unless, you know a lot
more than I know, you don’t know enough to report to the public what
their representatives are doing on this budget and what it means to them
and what it’s going to cost them. And so, at this point, for us to be
able to say the budget is good, the budget is bad, someone should trust
someone, this institution and this state is not built on trust, it’s
built on a democratic process. And again, I will continue to be an
advocate for; I want to emphasis, no matter what else happens, the tax
give-a-ways have happened and another is going to come starting in
January. We already know these 788 positions that we talked about before
and you seen this before, are not in controversy. That means, those 788
teachers positions, no matter what scenario they bring out, now, unless
they change the procedure, those positions that were promised are gone.
They are not gong to be fulfilled as they were supposed to in this
budget. Tax give-a-ways for the out of state corporations and
millionaires, the promised teachers that would have been in the
classrooms to help our children and their future, already have been
agreed to be eliminated. Now, what are we talking about now? Are talking
about pay raises for the teachers that are left? Are they sustainable?
Are they onetime money? As some people have suggested part of the
funding would be? I almost would challenge you. This might be your press
conference now, for you to answer the questions. You’re informing the
public. Do you know? We don’t know. We’ll take questions if we can
answer them. Yes Ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I understand what you are
saying and what Roseann Fisher are saying, but for a long time pledge
negotiations have gone on behind closed doors, and this is not exactly a
new development in the way budgets get written. Why is it more
[egregious] now then when the democrats did it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well,
a couple of things. First of all, supposedly the republicans said there
was going to be a change, there was going to be 72 hours to read deals,
etcetera,  remember all the poppy-cot that went out. So, now the time
has come to come forward and live up your word, that’s the first thing.
Second thing is, you claimed, the republicans claimed that the reason
there was a change is because there was not enough transparency in
government. So, show us by your example. What is your example? The only
reason they started the transparency in process during this cycle was
because we demanded it, and it was so obvious and clear to the public,
after we caught them in lie after lie on the figures, that they had to
do it. Now we have gone back behind the closed doors. They have a super
majority, so we can’t stop them from doing anything they want to do.
Even, the governor is going to get overridden by the veto, they've
already made that threat to him. So, they didn't even bring him in the
room when they said we’re going to do the final round, we’re not going
to have 3 guys in the room, we’re having 2, we can veto whatever you got
to say, so you’re just out of the picture, you’re the governor but who
cares, we’re in charge, we got a super majority. So, if you have a super
majority, you’re going to do what you want to do anyway, at least let
the public know what they’re going to be in for.</p>

<p id="15:00">
Do we have some type of transparency. Again, we’re going to get...well,
let me make sure I phrase this properly, we’re on the air. They’re going
to be consequences as a result of what they do and they have the votes
to do whatever they want to do unless they hear from the people. We’re
just calling them to come forward on their word, on their promises to
the people. They said they were going to do it differently. As you
referenced, it seems like they’ve gone even further in the past.
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have have any indication when you’re going to see a conference
report? I know there’s a press conference for this afternoon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We know there’s a press conference called for this afternoon. That’s all
we know. We haven’t been given any information about exactly what will
be in it or what the time table of it will be. And again, we’ve heard
like you’ve heard, that some folks say we’ll be out of here this week.
By using this conference report methodology without disclosing it and
giving the review period that they had so loudly promised about 72
hours, theoretically, we could be out of here this week and we still
won’t know what’s in that conference report. We could vote it Thursday
and Friday. By next Monday we still won’t know what’s in that conference
report. Any further questions? All right, well, I look forward to
talking to you tomorrow. I’m sure we’ll be back here. Take care.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you know, is the House session tomorrow planned to be a vote session?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It will be a vote session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok.</p>
