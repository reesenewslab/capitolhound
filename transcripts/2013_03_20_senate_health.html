The proposed Committee substitute to Senate Bill 140. Senator Bingham
you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Is this mike
working?  Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Loud and clear.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a little history about this bill:  In the 2011-12
session I introduced the bill Senate bill 449 which is now session law
211-189 which created the task force on fraud and abuse against older
adults, and myself and Hugh Blackwell from the House got together and we
created this task force, and we recruited representatives from the
Department of Justice and maybe some of these folks here I hope, and the
Commission of Banks, Social Service and others.  What inspired this, I
had a lady from my district who was scammed over a million dollars in
which she wired funds out of the country, and of course you know by that
happening... and this lady unfortunately and sad to say, I'm not going
to tell you who she is but, at any rate she worked with the banking
system.  But, this gentleman that was involved in this was out of
Charlotte and I don't have anything against Charlotte, but they had
some, a very clever and well- spoken gentleman who was obviously in the
securities and exchange and knew a lot about it and he was very
persuasive. At any rate we got together and divided up into four groups,
the task force.  There was recommendations made from those task force.
So this was a year’s work in the interim.  The National Council on Aging
indicates that this is one of the worst problems and they gave a report
that came out sometime the year following and it named Lexington and
Thomasville as two of the top ten cities in the country of fraud and
abuse, and of course both those towns were from the county in which I
represent and live.  Also 90% of all reported elder abuse is committed
by the persons' family; grandchildren, nieces, nephews and others.  So
what this bill does, it fights the growing problem on fraud and it
describes, because there was no description.  These laws hadn't been
updated since the early seventies, so it’s been close to forty years
since these laws have been updated.  A lot of this nowadays is with
computers etc. because you can imagine the computers in the seventies
were about like the computer I used today but, because I don't use one.
But anyway none of the financial records have been...  Anyway, I'm not
going to get into any of the details of this.  It's in the bill.  I
don't know of anyone that is opposed to this.  I hope you'll... If you
have any questions I've got several folks here to help me answer some of
these questions but this has been an extensive and long going process
and I know all of you are aware locally of a lot of the elderly who have
been...  It's just been certainly a tremendously growing problem and I
appreciate your support.  Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Are there any questions from the members of the
committee?  Senator Allran.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Senator Bingham thank you so
much for putting this bill forward, its...  This is such a problem and
it's so evil that these people victimize the elderly.  It's terrible.
Thank you so much for the bill and I know you don't like to go through
bills too much in detail but could we have someone who would at least
give us the highlights of what we're doing?  Even though I know that you
don't like to do this Mr. Bingham, which is fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.  Sorry Mr. Chairman may I have...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes.  Go ahead Senator Bingham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is Representative, oh I'm sorry, is Ms. Farmer here
from the Attorney General's office?  Oh great.  Would you mind because
she has been wonderful from the Attorney General's office and she helped
a lot.  She is a very clever attorney and she helped considerably with
this bill.  She and several others from the Attorney General's office
and at least I hope I'm not imposing on you but.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Farmer please state your name for the record</p>

<p id="05:00">
Please before your remarks, [SPEAKER CHANGES] Caroline Farmer, I’m
Deputy Director at North Carolina Attorney General’s office. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Please go ahead with you remarks. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I wasn't
necessarily prepared to make remarks but basically in going through this
bill the first section of has to do with including people who have not
been, they are not disabled. They are not incapacitated, but yet they
are being taken advantage of, and based on the current state of the law
we were excluding them from being able to be protected. Another portion
of it has to do with ease of access. Allowing people to investigate more
readily. The cases by getting information from financial institutions
and alerting people that we are close to the older adult, to make sure
that they know about the fraud that was going, being perpetrated against
the older adult. That has to with general… I would recommend we probably
have people who were in the committee discussing specific ones. If
there’s questions about specific ones. We could discuss those. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thanks you Miss Farmer. Let’s have.. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman, [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think there’s been
Ms. Mitoula wants to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just going to ask her to
comment further Ms Mitoula from our staff. Ms. Farmer isn't she?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let Ms. Mitoula if we will.
She’s prepared to go item by item through the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
I promise I won’t take too long but I’ll go sought of section by
section. First of all the proposed committee substitute makes only
technical changes to the bill. It doesn't make anything substantial. If
you really want me to tell you what those are I can. But section 1
changes amends criminal law on false pretenses and cheats. It changes
older law, and it broadens the definition consistent with what the Ms.
Farmer was saying. The amended definition keeps the requirement for 60
years of age or older in place but removes the language requiring
diminished capacity. General statue 14 112.2c is amended to make it
unlawful for a person to knowingly by deception or intimidation endeavor
to, conspire to obtain or use an older disabled adult’s funds, assets or
properties with the intent to temporarily or permanently deprive the
individual of use benefit or possession depending on the money involved
it’s punishable by Class G, H or I felony. Sections 2A and B amend the
financial privacy act. General statue 53B4 is amended to allow
government access to a financial record held by a financial institution
when it’s described with reasonable specificity and access is sought as
a result of an investigation to a suspected financial exploitation
involving an adult. The written notice must be delivered to the
financial institution either by and it depends on whether the adult is
disabled or meets the definition of older. So it’s delivered by county
department of social services, if it’s a disabled adult and that
pursuant to 108A 106.1 or a law enforcement agency for a financial
exploitation of an older adult and that’s pursuant to 108A 116.1 Section
2B is just a conforming change and requires the financial institution to
make those records available. However if they receive a notice from a
customer challenging the notice of investigation, then the financial
institution will suspend their efforts. Section 3 pertains to disabled
adults on the whole and section 4 mostly pertains to older adults. So
back to section 3 it requires the financial institution to provide
financial records of a disabled adult customer if Director of the County
Department of Social Services delivers to the financial institution a
signed written notice on department letterhead under the following
conditions: that they are investigating a credible report, and the adult
has been financially exploited, is being or has been, that the disabled
adult’s financial records are needed to substantiate or evaluate the
report and three that time is of the essence in order to prevent further
exploitation of that adult. 106A, I mean 108A 106.1B requires that
copies of the adult’s financial records to be kept confidential
subsection C removes liability for those who provide secret ??</p>

<p id="10:00">
financial records or other information or provide testimony, as long as
they are acting in good faith.  Subsection D prohibits a customer from
indictment or criminal prosecution, punishment or penalty due to
anything disclosed by the financial institution, however, following up
on what Senator Bingham said about family members, the immunity does not
apply to criminal or civil proceedings against a joint account owner
accused of financial exploitation of disabled adult, a joint account
holder.  Section 4 enacts a new Article 6A to ?? 108A, Chapter 108A,
entitled Protection of Older Adults from Financial Exploitation. 108A114
?? encourages but does not require a financial institution to offer
older adult customers the opportunity to submit and periodically update
a list of persons the bank should contact in case of suspected
exploitation of the older adult.  108A115 provides that the financial
institution,officer or employee with reasonable cause to believe an
older adult is a victim or target of financial exploitation must report
to the persons on the list, if they elected to have a list, and to the
proper law enforcement agency.  Again, the liability is removed from the
financial institution if they act in good faith and all those similar
things for disabled adults are in place for older adults in 108A116 A,
B, and C.  Section 5 of the PCS extends the task force on fraud against
older adults to allow it to report to the Joint Legislative Oversight
Committee on Health and Human Services prior to the 2014 regular
session.  The task force will terminate May 1, 2015 or upon filing its
final report, whichever comes first.  It also requires the North
Carolina Credit Union League and an association representing
non-depository financial institutions to be added to the task force.
Sections 1, 2 3, and 4 become effective on the first day of the month,
that's six months after the act becomes law and the rest is effective
when it becomes law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ms. Matoula and thank you, Ms. Farmer, for the explanation of
the bill.  Do you have anything else to add at this time, Senator
Bingham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I just hope we'll pass it and that will please me very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I note from the language that I am no longer an elderly adult, I am an
oldery adult.  I'm grateful for that change. Senator Kennard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Wonderful bill.  I just commend you for doing
this because it is an increasing problem.  I have a question that might
or might not be able to be answered.  I have a constituent whose mother
is in a retirement community and they think the brother who is on the
checking account is taking the money.  Would this be any help for
someone who is a close relative who supposedly has the confidence of the
victim?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Yes m'am.  If Teresa, this is one portion of the bill, there was a
lot of discussion on because it is relatives and close, and this will
definitely help but Teresa, do you mind helping me with this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. There was one thing that I mentioned and one that I didn't
mention.  In the voluntary list that the financial institution can ask
the customer if they would like to have them keep, they would notify a
family member of some suspected activity, if they do have a list in
place.  Of course, if the person who was suspected was the family
member, they would not notify the family member.  The one thing I did
point out is, with regard to the liability for, and I'm sorry, I am
trying to find the section, it removes the liability, I'm sorry,
financial, let's see
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it's ?? financial records against the account ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it's on page 3, beginning on Line 17.  This is for the disabled
adult but there is similar provision for the older adult.  And if you
look at Line 20, it says not withstanding the foregoing information
obtained may be used against a person who is a joint account owner
accused of financial exploitation if the disabled adult and again there
is a similar one for the older adult, but soley for criminal and civil
proceedings directly related to the alleged financial exploitation so I
think if they are a joint account holder, it does not give</p>

them immunity if they are the one suspected.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, I just have one quick follow-up. Who prosecutes this, the
district attorney and the local district where the crime occurs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Counselor, I can't answer that but I'm sure there's somebody here that
can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Barbara seems to think it's the district attorney but perhaps Ms. Farmer
will be able to give us a little more insight on who does that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, it's the district attorney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does that answer your question, Senator Kinnaird? Senator Tucker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll yield to my peer here to my left, he was the one that had his hand
raised, but I will make one comment. Since most of us on the committee
are older than 60 I would imagine this bill will pass.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we can remember what we're voting for. Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A couple of technical questions, maybe for
staff, and first, Senator Bingham, thank you for bringing this bill. It
is important and upon reading it looks quite good. My question for staff
is are there substantive protections in section 4 for older adults that
are not in section 3 for disabled adults or are they co-extensive?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know that there are protections that are different. There are
differences, of course, in the definition of the disabled adult which
usually involve some diminished capacity and that's one of the things
that this bill is changing for the definition of an older adult is that
it's removing the diminished capacity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand that there's a definitional difference between disabled and
older adult and I just haven't sat and done a crosscheck to see, if you
just read section 4 it's substantially longer than section 3 and I just,
if there are protections in section 4 that are not in section 3 we could
just rename article 6a &quot;protection of older adults and disabled
adults from financial exploitation&quot; and then just insert disabled
adults into that section and give them the same protection that we're
giving older adults. But we don't want disabled adults to have lesser
protections. But if what you're saying is that everything that's in
section 4 is also in section 3 then maybe that isn't necessary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't believe that there is substantially anything different in the
two except that section 4 does provide the language in there with regard
to the financial institution allowing the older adult customers to
maintain the list of contacts for them. And that's in 108a 114. I don't
know exactly why it was set out the way it was except that we did have
existing statutes that it was amending for the disabled adults and we
were putting new protections in place for older adults.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Senator Stein, this bill, if it gets a favorable report here, is
going to be referred to a judiciary committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One other technical question, if I may, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In section 3, this 108a-106.1, is that, I don't know where that sits int
he general statutes. Is that in a disabled adult section so that we
don't need to define disabled adult in this section? Because we define,
in subsection e, a whole bunch of terms but we don't define disabled
adult there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm pretty certain that it is and I'll look while I'm talking to you.
The definition for disabled adult, I provide it in my summary, is set
out in 108a 101. It is putting it in article 6 of 108a and, hang on just
a second and I'll tell you what, article 6 is on disabled adults.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does that answer your question? Senator McKissick?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I too, Senator Bingham, would like to commend you on bringing this
bill forward. I think it's an excellent bill and I</p>

<p id="20:00">
Some cases dealing with this sort of exploitation including one in
Pearson County fairly recently involving about $1.8 million. The thing
that I do have some questions about and they're sort of technical
questions, it allows the person who is Director of Social Services in a
county to go out and get financial records that relate to a particular
individual. The thing it does not state is if those financial records
are requested or obtained, who pays for it. Now you have somebody who's
going to have to originate the original request and it's probably going
to be a family member, somebody who knows that person who's a close
confidant. Sometimes these records go back 5-10 years. Most financial
institutions don't have a problem producing them, but they're going to
want somebody to pay for it. So has that been considered and do you need
to put in here that it's going to be produced by the institution at no
charge to the Department of Social Services because it could get pretty
costly if there are a number of accounts, particularly if you're looking
at accounts with institutions outside the state of North Carolina,
brokerage accounts, all types of accounts that can be involved. I've
seen situations where you've had 5 different accounts that you've had to
go back and get records for years, so it doesn't really state that and
so it's more of a technical question and perhaps staff can state what
was anticipated because there's a practical matter that will be a true
concern if this is utilized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly, Senator
McKissick I understand your question, but I'll have to rely on either,
whoever you wish Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Miss O'Toole is
ready to answer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, I don't know
exactly who's paying for them now. What I will tell you is that it's
amending 53b-4, access to financial records, and there are currently 12
other instances and when financial records need to be provided so
there's a possibility at least that by adding the 13th it may be treated
in a like manner, I just don't know how those other 12 circumstances are
treated now. I apologize. I don't know if there's anybody here from a
financial institution or perhaps someone from the task force looked at
this. I don't know. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Recognize anyone from the task
force who worked on this legislation who might have the answer to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I think they're discussing among
themselves. We'll see if we can get someone to answer that for you. Miss
Farmer, do you have someone that could help us with this cause I'm sure
it was discussed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, identify yourself, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is David Kirkman, I'm
a special deputy attorney general in the consumer protection division
and I had the honor of serving on this legislative task force on the
committee that helped bring forth the language that's on this bill, and
our subcommittee was comprised of law enforcement, state and local, as
well as the whole array of financial institutions and when we discussed
this particular provision about the production of the documents, the
question of the cost really never came up and again it was because of
the point that was just made. The financial institutions already have to
produce this information in other contexts. The only point at which
anything close to that was brought up was the fact that sometimes there
are older documents that are kept in paper form. More recent documents
are kept electronically and the bank indicated they could be produced
fairly quickly and cheaply but they needed more time when it came to the
older documents, but no discussion was actually had on the cost of them,
so that's as far as it got on that issue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What I
would suggest, let's go ahead and move the bill out of committee today
but let's sit down and talk about how we might address this in a way
that we don't want the Department of Social Services paying for it. If
the person originating complaint really thinks there's substance to it,
maybe they could be looked to. The banks should not necessarily have to
just absorb that cost, but when a bank calls you up and says it's
$1,500-2,000 to reproduce certain groups of records, it's a real concern
that we need to try to somehow make certain is passed onto the
appropriate party, particularly because we want this to be utilized and
if the goal is to make sure that the banks absorb the cost then we just
need</p>

Be clear about that in the Infinium your questions just a quick
follow-up on the way we're handing liability today interims these joint

what are we doing today about this issue so that I can declare my mind

someone 21 324 and capacity with the issue of if the joint account

they would be treated under criminal and civil proceedings I feel I

Answer is yes, we've prosecuted for these scams going through the mail.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Say the word before the mail again. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
We've prosecuted for scams going through. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I
have a follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Woodard, excuse me. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Question for the chair. You said this was
going to K2 after this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Probably J1. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
J1, sorry. Then it seems to me a lot of the legal questions that have
been raised, and it's been a very rich dialogue with the number of
attorneys here, I think a lot of those will be hammered out in a PCS
there I suspect, and Senator Bingham I just want to say to you thank you
for this bill. I just wrapped up a case with a family in Castle County
just yesterday and if we had had this legislation that would have made
my job as a senator a lot easier to get this done so I commend you and
the members of the task force for bringing this forward and with that,
Mr. Chair, I'll move that we favorably report the PCS out. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Hold on on that just one second. Senator Rabin. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Can the lady from the attorney general. The answer that you
gave was yes you do prosecute for using the mails for scam, my question
was is it included in this bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't believe that
that specific thing is included as all crimes are, phone, mail, other
means. It's a matter of means, of access. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a quick
thing for staff to look into as well. It looks like to get these records
you're typically serving a local branch manager or somebody who's a
registered agent for service of process in North Carolina. There are
lots of financial institutions that somebody might transact business
with that are outside the state of North Carolina and do not have agents
to serve process in this state. Look at what can be done to try to fix
that and maybe a bank out in California, Chicago, anyplace, they can
just look in the Wall Street Journal, find a high yielding place for an
account, so think about how you're going to serve these people who don't
have registered process agents or a branch here in North Carolina to get
that same information. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Woodard has moved for a
favorable report to this PCS, however Senator Allran has an amendment
that I'm going to allow him to process his amendment and then we'll roll
the whole thing into a new PCS before it goes to J1. Senator Allran.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's simply to change elder to older to make the whole
thing consistent, what we already talked about. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
anyone need copies of this amendment? If not, all those in favor of the
amendment presented by Senator Allran, please say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no. The amendment carries and now we
have before us the original PCS with this amendment which will be rolled
into a new PCS. Senator Woodard, is that your motion? Any further
discussion? And this is going to a J1 committee with the new PCS rolling
in this amendment. All those in favor please say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, say no. And the motion carries,
thank you very much. Senator Bingham, I don't know if we have time for
your second one or not, are you willing to take a stab at it? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Absolutely. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, and I
thought this just went through the J committee, but anyway we'll try
another one. Senate Bill 83. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This bill has been. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me just a second, we have a
PCS to Senate Bill 83, is there a motion to, Senator Wade recommends
that we consider the PCS. Go ahead Senator Bingham. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Actually this bill, I have been working on
several years and what has happened in the North Carolina free clinics,
there are a lot of doctors who are willing to volunteer their time and
nurses for one and a half million uninsured citizens in the state and
these clinics provide 172 million dollars in free services each year and
medical professionals are concerned about volunteering. I had, because
of the malpractice liability, and what this does, it addresses that
issue and Nick Taylor from the trial lawyers association</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]: And John Carl who is with the free clinics, we worked
on this and they are both in the audience, and I was ?? to see them
stand together and agree on this bill. So, it's made up happy day for
makers, we have been a long time in term and so be happy to try to
answering questions. If not both issues ?? they can help me with this
and also with directors of the free clinics in North Carolina. So, I
would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chairman, senator Bingham thanks for
bringing this forward. I have participated in some of these free
clinics, so to give health care providers that are donating their time,
some immunity from being prosecuted for doing that is very grateful. So
much determined, had an appropriate time, I will move for a favorable
report to the PCS, is that correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, so if there are any other questions, yes
our Senator Curtis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I too support the bill. I had an experience on this
issue when Katrina devastated Mississippi. I went down and did a clinic
for a week, and the governor of Mississippi by executive order made all
?? State health care providers, employees of the State for that week,
and so they would have defended us if we have been sued regarding that
free care. So, I certainly come in this bill, thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: For the questions from members of the committee
hearing non Senator Davis has recommended favorable report, as to the
committee substitute for Senate bill 83, unfavorable as to the original
bill, all those in favor say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: All oppose me say no, and Senator Bingham
congratulations, you have got out of here ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you sir, I have ??. Thanks all of you for your
help on this bill and see you again soon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Committee is adjourned.</p>
