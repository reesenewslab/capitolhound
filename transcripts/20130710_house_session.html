[Speaker Changes]To speak to the resolution, Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes]The lady has the floor to debate the resolution.
[Speaker Changes]Thank you. And thank you ladies and gentlemen of the
House. I wanted to tell you maybe a few things that you might not know
about the Grove Park Inn as a part of this tribute today. Many of you
may have already visited the Grove Park Inn and I would suggest to you
that after the hard session we've had you might want to make a visit
there when session ends, it will be a great place to go once you're done
with your work here, it wouldn't hurt our economy either. As you may or
may not know F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald visited the Grove
Park Inn in 1935 for their health and actually the Grove Park was touted
as a health resort in its very early days more than just a tourist
attraction. While they were visiting, the Fitsgeralds, while they were
visiting in 1936, Zelda was hospitalized and F. Scott took suites 441
through 443, the Grove Park has continued throughout history to be a
showcase for architecture, for antiques, for the arts and crafts
movement, but especially the Grove Park Inn has been a wonderful benefit
for the City of Asheville</p>

How many visitors have come because of the cache of the Grove Park and
fallen in love with Asheville over the years? How many have returned to
visit or become residents of our great city in the mountains because
they were first guests of this magnificent hotel? My daughter happens to
work for the gentleman who puts on the arts and crafts conference every
year at the Grove Park Inn. And if you're familiar with the arts and
crafts movement, it's the movement that showcases mission furniture. And
that is one of the largest conferences to be held at the Grove Park Inn
each year in February. And I would invite you to come to that, as well.
The director of that conference, Bruce Johnson, has written...he's an
historian and the director of the conference. And he wrote a recent
novel titled, &quot;An Unexpected Guest.&quot; And it tells an
historical fiction about a murder in the inn. It's protagonist is
convinced that the Grove Park Inn is haunted by a beautiful young woman.
And I'm sure that you, maybe some of you, maybe not, have heard of the
Pink Lady at the Grove Park Inn.
And finally, I want to give you a quote from the author of this book
himself. Bruce Johnson said in his book, &quot;While today Edwin Wiley
Grove is best remembered for his contribution to the architectural
fabric of Asheville, most notably the Grove Park Inn, the Battery Park
Hotel, and the Grove Arcade, he also led the fight in the first quarter
of the Twentieth Century against those who wanted to transform Asheville
into a national center for the treatment of tuberculosis. Fearing
Asheville would become known as a leper colony of victims of the highly
contagious and often fatal disease, Grove inserted bans against boarding
houses and sanitariums into the deeds for any of his 1,200 acres of
residential real estate. His argument to promote tourism over
tuberculosis eventually found favor among Asheville's political leaders
and helped to cast the character of what has since become one of the
country's most popular tourist destinations.&quot;
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I commend this resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ramsey is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I rise, too, with
my colleague, Representative Fisher, to commend this resolution to you.
Grove Park is truly one of the icons of this State. Mr. Grove gave many
things to the people of Asheville and Buncombe County. Much of the, he
is known as the father of modern Asheville because as Representative
Fisher stated, the Grove Arcade, Battery Park Hotel, the Grove Park
area, the Grovemont Community in Swannanoa, are all the legacy of Mr.
Grove.
But Mr. Grove, two days from now, the Grove Park will celebrate its
100th anniversary. This hotel was built in just less than a year. This
was before modern construction equipment and techniques. And you see the
large boulders that were taken from Sunset Mountain to construct this
hotel. That was a very impression feat at the time. But Mr. Grove, on
July 12th, 1913, stated, &quot;After a long mountain walk one evening at
the sunset hour, scarcely more than a year ago, I sat down here to rest.
And while almost entranced by the panorama of these encircling mountains
and a restful outlook upon green fields, the dream of an old time inn
came to me. An inn whose exterior, and interior as well, should present
a home-like and wholesome simplicity. Whose hospitable doors should ever
be open wide, inviting the traveler to rest awhile, shut in from the
busy world outside.&quot;
Well today, that's what the Grove Park Inn offers to you and to so many
others that come there each and every year. Grove Park has hosted 10
presidents, most recently President Obama who stayed on multiple
occasions at the Grove Park. If you sit on the sunset terrace, you can
see the beautiful downtown Asheville and off in the distance you see the
Pisgah National Forest and the mountain range of the Blue Ridge
Mountains. And in the distance you will see Mount Pisgah. And we often
say that I know whatever part of North Carolina you come from is your
home and your promise land, but God in the Book of Exodus told Moses
that he could not enter into the promise land but see the promise land.
So God took Moses upon Mount Pisgah and Moses got to see the...</p>

if you come to Buncombe county, come to Asheville, you can see the
promised land, you can see Mt. Pisgah. We hope you come and attend and
spend some money. There  are over 1000 families that owe their
livelihood to the Grove Park. And for them, it's more than just a
respite and a vaction for folks, it's the way they support their family,
and the Grove Park has been a wonderful asset to our community, it's one
of our top taxpayers in the county that helps support our basic services
that the city and the county provide, and it is truly one of the special
parts of North Carolina. Most of the things that we do a hundred years
from now will long be forgotten, but what Mr. Grove did in 1913 still
pays dividends for the people of this state and for the city of
Asheville. And I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. McGrady is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will only add this to what Rep. Fisher said. This is a treasure not
just for the city of Asheville, but for all of western North Carolina.
My parents had their honeymoon there, and I'm proud to say that my son
is now a manager at the Grove Park Inn, and is one of those thousand
families that are supporting himself on the salary he earns there. I
commend the resolution to you.

black bear management et cetera.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. House Bill 296, the
Omnibus Wildlife Commission Act, I'll go through it real quickly for
you. They pick on me because I can't say that word but anyway, we'll
move on. The bill will make the following changes as requested by the
Wildlife Resource Commission. One, it would adjust the fees of certain
hunting and fishing license beginning in August, 2014. These fees have
not been increased since 1997 and are below the other states and we
continue to be below the states and under the rate of inflation. Number
two, it would allow the Wildlife Resources Commission, starting in 2015,
to adjust hunting and fishing license through rule-making to set license
fees by rule-making using a five year moving average of the Consumer
Price Index cap. Number three, it would limit the percentage of the
operating budget the commission may keep in reserve. And number four, it
would provide an annual target for utilization for the annual expendable
interest of the Wildlife Endowment Fund. These moves would make the
Wildlife Resources Commission from closer to self sufficiency, which is
the goal of this bill. The other part of the bill, and the last part,
would allow the Wildlife Resources Commission to manage North Carolina's
expanding black bear population. It provides flexibility tools in
recognition that regional differences in the management approaches may
be necessary. What this mean is what's good for Hyde County may not be
good for Haywood County and we will allow the Wildlife Commission to use
those tools to do that. This new provision does not change the statute
allowing the use of bait when hunting bear with dogs. I have resolutions
from numerous counties and the Wildlife Commission is in full support of
this bill and I ask for your support concurrence today. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Steinburg, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, to speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you. Very briefly, I have been in contact with a lot of the bear
hunters in my district and beyond and they just asked me to express
their displeasure at the way this bill evolved from the Senate to where
it is today. So I have done that. They asked me to do it and let the
record reflect it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

to listen to me. Just vote yes. This bill simply, this bill is really,
in all seriousness, is a bill that comes about as a result of the
illegal use, possession, or discharge of firearm in the commission of a
crime. What it says is there is a rebuttable presumption that no bond
will be set if that, if it can be shown that the person is not, is a
danger to the community or will not appeal for trial. That presumption
is rebuttable before a district court judge or superior court judge. The
second part of the bill simply states that if you don't appear after
bond has been set or no bond was ever said or the bond amount was $500,
if you didn't appear it would cost you an extra $500 or $1,000 for
failure to appear. I'd be happy to answer any questions. By the way, for
those who may have a question about the rebuttable presumption, we used
this same thing in drug cases and in gang-related cases. I'll be happy
to answer any questions.

Members of the House, what we’re doing here is trying to move along a
bill that has been bogged down in the senate commerce committee, which I
understand may not be meeting again this session, and this is the
foreign trade ?? bill that many of you remember that breezed through all
of the committees over here in the House without any dissenting vote as
well as no dissenting votes on the House floor. It is imperative that
this bill be enacted. It’s part of the Governor’s economic expansion
program for the state of North Carolina, northeastern North Carolina in
particular and I would mention to you that in the business North
Carolina magazine there’s a cover story this month on the forgotten
corner of our state which is northeastern North Carolina, so this is a
bill that, this is an amendment rather, that reflects the language of a
bill to produce jobs in northeastern North Carolina by creating foreign
trade zones using the port of Norfolk, so I’m glad to answer any
questions but again I would remind all the members that this did pass
unanimously through each committee and also on the House floor, thank
you.

act to increase the recognition, reporting, and prosecution of those who

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. I had the opportunity along with Senator Stan
Bingham to chair a task force that met during this past interim to look
into concerns about fraud and abuse being committed against seniors. And
as a result of that task force meetings over the interim, there was
legislation that was recommended and this bill that is before the House
is a product of that
recommendation.
This actually represents a change in a couple of respects from the
Senate bill that was adopted unanimously. But in essence what this bill
does, in an effort to deal with concerns about increasing reports of
fraud and abuse, is it increases penalties associated with such
instances. It eliminates one of the stumbling blocks that prosecution
has had of having previously to prove that a person was limited in their
ability to manage their own affairs and that the person taking advantage
of them knew that.
So that basically this deals with people who take advantage of folks if
they are above a certain age or if they are, in fact, disabled. Beyond
that, the primary change change that was made in the PCS that is before
us, as compared to the Senate bill: In the Senate bill originally there
was provision that would allow the Department of Social Services, in the
case of a disabled adult, and the District Attorney</p>

<p id="55:00">
Attorney's office in the case of individuals who were sixty or older
simply write a letter and deliver it to financial institutions and
without notice to the account holder who was being protected presumably
be able to get access to those records by having a financial institution
produce those records. There was a provision in the Senate bill as it
came over that allowed that this could be done and for up to a hundred
and eighty days no notice of that need be given to the account holder.
In an effort to introduce a greater balance between the efforts to
protect those over sixty or disabled and those property rights that they
would have to know what's being accessed of theirs and protect their
property rights. The PCS that's before you requires that rather than
simply a letter being written from DSS or the district attorney that
they would have to go with what they would consider to be a next parkay
proceeding before a superior or district court judge or a magistrate.
Justify why they wanted to have a look at medical record not medical
records rather financial records and if they felt that it was important
that notice not be given promptly or immediately to the account holder
to satisfy that judicial official as to the length of time that was
necessary to keep the notice from being given so that the investigation
could be in presumably not also of accidently. Giving notice to the
individual which could be a family member or a friend. Who might be
thought of taking advantage of the senior. The provision that was added
also retains the ability for the judicial official to make a finding
that safety or health considerations on the part of the senior required
that notice be delayed for up to a hundred and eighty days. But the
judicial official would have to make that determination. Beyond that
there are a few other technical changes such as the definition of
accounts, changing the effective date. But I believe that's the gist of
the bill with the final comment that this would extend the life of the
task force. And would allow them to provide that the task force would
also add to it's membership. A representative from the state bar. With
the specialty in the area of privacy rights and property rights so that
we would have somebody to help again to provide that balance between the
property rights of the account holder and efforts through such agencies
such as DSS and the attorney general's office or the district attorney's
office to protect seniors from fraud and abuse. This passed the Senate
as I said unanimously Senator Bingham was in agreement with the PCS that
was presented in committee this morning, judiciary committee. I did not
hear any audible objections in committee this morning and I would ask
that the House to give it support to this new legislation. Thank you
mister speaker.

SPEAKER CHANGES:
Mister speaker members of the House I'm conflicted about this I know
that Representative Blackwell has done a lot of work on I'm thinkin' of
objecting the third reading till I figure out on my page one line
fourteen till seventeen what the significance is of the definitional
changes of older adults because it used to be to be an older adult you
had to be not of a certain age but sixty years of age or older who is
not able to provide for social medical psychiatric psychological
financial or legal services necessary to safeguard their rights. But all
of that is taken over taken out and it's now older adults are everybody
over sixty years of age. So if we could have a audio visual
demonstration everybody here raise your hand if you're over sixty. There
you go. You might want to study this overnight and see if you want
you're bank account subpenaed without notice to you. There must be a
better...some way to...I'm vote for it today but there must be a better
way to safeguard over...</p>

…Then just by this way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate, Representative Blackwell, please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanna respond quickly to Representative…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, the concern that Representative Stam raises is one that I had but
it’s dealt with as it is in this way and I offer two comments in
response at this point. One is one of the problems with getting
prosecutions by the District Attorney is proving the element that’s
being delighted here about the lack of capacity of a senior and getting
the conviction against somebody for taking advantage of such a person by
proving that a person who has not been determined legally incompetent
was in fact limited in capacity was basically causing District Attorneys
to say, “These cases are not worth taking, we really can’t do anything
with them.” So, we were struggling to deal with that and decided that
taking out that provision that concerns Representative Stam was the
appropriate step. The second response was the amendment that we did in
the PCS to require the supine rather than the provision that came over
from the Senate that would have allowed DSS and the DA simply by writing
a letter and saying, “Blackwell over 60 we might take look at his
account because we heard his wife is taking advantage of his financial.”
[Laughter]
So, we put in the requirement for this supine there are requirements
related to the judicial official determining that they are satisfied and
we hope that this is striking that balance that I mentioned and that the
continuation of the task force will continue to look at these very
issues that I agree are important.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Since I wasn't paying
attention in Finance this morning, I get to run this bill on the floor.
This is Senate Bill 248. Very straight forward. Section 1 essentially
adds a duly licensed hearing aid specialist to the list of health care
providers from which an insured may choose under a policy. So it amends
general statute to do so. Section 2 of the bill allows the board to
increase their assessment. It is a may assessment, not a forced
assessment, from $250 to $500. And Section 3 makes conforming changes to
general statutes regarding the State health plan. I'd appreciate your
support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may be disadvantaged, but what changes were made
as far as the State health plan is concerned, do you know of?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux, I appreciate the question.
Essentially, all I can tell you without, these were conforming changes
to basically allow that duly licensed hearing aid specialists to be
added to the list, within the provider list.

Thank your Mr. Speaker. I think Rep. Collins is probably up on this bill
and would like to refer to him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 378 i	s a bill that passed the Senate in a bipartisan
fashion in fact, I think it's sponsored bipartisanly by Senators Rabin
and Walters. It's something  that's been requested by the propane gas
association, it's a self-assessment on their members according to the
association 95% of their members have asked for it, it's 2/10ths of 1
cent per gallon assessment that basically goes from the dealers to their
association's foundation and it's basically for educating them, and for
educating hte public, and for advertising the propane business as a
whole. We do this for 19 commoditites already here in North Carolina.
It's illegal for them to actually tack this on to the price of consumers
at the end, and they really shouldn't have to because part of the money,
I said, does go to adverise their business so it should actually help
them. If a dealer decides they don't want to be a part of it, or decides
the only way they could be a part of it is to add to the cost, to the
2/10ths of a cent or whatever, they can actually request in writing and
get their assessment back if they don't agree with their industry's
association. So it has safeguards built into it. The reason they're
asking us to do this, becausae they used to have a similar assessment
from the feds, the national level, and that was cut in half, and they're
getting to the point I think in their treasury where they're in danger
of some federal things kicking in to where they'll no longer be able to
advertise their industry and all that type of thing. So we're trying to
help them to make up themselves by an assessment on the state level what
they've been cut on the federal level. I don't know of any opposition to
this. Like I say if any individual propane dealers are opposed to it,
they can basically opt out of it by written request, so I would
encourage your support of this, thank you.

Representative Pittman please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Speaker it might be more appropriate if I did this it would have
actually gotten a Bill that was going to do it instead of doing a study
bill but I'm not sure I'll be here when this ever comes out so I feel
like I need to say this now. I'm an old Tarheel and I know they don't
teach history in our schools today quite the way they did when I was
coming along but this issue strikes to me something about the history of
our state that I think need to be aware of.  You may or may not be aware
of a traditional weariness of Tarheel citizens of being wary of the
Government and being reluctant to give to much power in to many places
we were the twelfth state to ratify the US Constitution cause we had
some problems about that and wanted to be sure about some things and as
I recall we were either last or near the last state to give the Governor
a veto because of that kind of reluctance about to much power. I believe
that it is wisdom of our predecessors in this state to make a Lieutenant
Governor an office with some independence from the Governor
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman the gentleman I think acknowledged that at the
point and time when he began the discussion the Chair is going to
encourage you to confine your comments because the gentleman would
really be talking about the outcome of the study rather then the
substance of the bill before us which is to simply study the matter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Speaker.  I'd just say since I'm against doing it I'm even
against studying it. Thank You

Representative Moore please state your purpose

To debate the Bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Speaker members of the House what this bill would very simply do is
to repeal any ordinances, resolutions, acts or any kind of laws that
were denied pre-clearance by the Federal Government prior to June 25th
2013. As many of you may know there was a Supreme Court case that came
down striking section 5 but we have and there were a number of</p>

<p id="80:00">
provisions that have been acted on by various municipalities, counties,
and states that were denied pre-clearance.  Those things are just sort
of still floating around out there, and what this would very simply do
is would repeal any of those, so that they are declared void, they are
repealed, and that Section 5 isn't an issue because whether it was a
state, municipality, or county, whatever entity, would not be asking to
do it.  Things that would be pre-clearance issues would be things that
affect the Voting Rights Act.  Anything that would limit access to the
ballot box, the would oppose and un-deburden, we won't get involved in
that, but the point of it is, is that what this does is cleans up a lot
of bad laws that the Feds said were not appropriate.  That's all this
bill does, and I would urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Shaw, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'd like to ask the gentleman a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Moore, you indicated in your comments
that the decision to repeal Section 5.  It did not repeal Section 5, it
was Section 4 that was repealed.  Section 5 is still in effect, isn't it
not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Actually it's the coverage formula of Section 4b.
That's correct, and that's what this bill goes to.  That's correct.

committee chairs with having session at 11:00 tomorrow? Trying to move
it up. We anticipate a lengthy debate tomorrow on at least one bill.
Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The House Rules Committee will meet
15 minutes after session today in 12281327. Representative Pittman
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you. I'd would
like to change my vote on Senate Bill 378 to a no.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman ?? is voting no on 378. The House will come to order.
Ladies and gentleman we're about to finish up business here.
Representative Hall the chair understands that on Senate Bill 353 the
debate tomorrow will be time limited to three hours, two hours to be
allotted to minority, one hour allotted to the majority. And that on
that basis we would not have an objection to third reading, and
therefore be able to continue, or complete the business tomorrow rather
than carry it over to Friday. Is that understanding correct? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That is correct Mr. Speaker. Democratic Caucus will only take
two hours in debate and will not object to third. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further notices and announcements. Representative Moore is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First of all for a motion for re-referral Mr. Speaker.
 [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker House Bill 695 which was the Faith, Family and Freedom Act. That
bill was countered for ?? rule 36B. Move that the bill be removed from
the calendar, refer to the committee on rules. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without
objection, so ordered. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lou could you please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Could Representative Moore just repeat, there was a lot of
noise here, repeat what he said about House Bill 695. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will and I'd actually like to withdraw that motion and restate that
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may restate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] House Bill 695 which was the Faith, Family and Freedom Act I
believe is the short title. I move that bill be referred to the
Committee on Ways and Means. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, so
ordered. The House will come to order. Representative Moore is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I move that the House do now
adjourn, to reconvene on Thursday, June the 11th, 2013 at 11:00 AM
subject to ratification of bills, receipt of messages from the Senate,
receipt of committee reports, receipt of conference reports, re-referral
of bills and resolutions, appointment of conferees, and modifications to
the calendar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore moves. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And introductions of bills and resolutions. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore moves seconded by Representative Cleveland.</p>
