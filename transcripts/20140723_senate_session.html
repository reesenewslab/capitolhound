purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. A point of personal privilege out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.
At this time, I'd like to send forth a Senatorial statement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth your statement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.
Colleagues, I would like to draw your attention to something, a
remarkable accomplishment by a group of young men from my home town of
Wilson. We are privileged to have here today the state champions for
little league for the, I believe it's the U 11, let me get my reading
glasses on, make sure I'm not reading that wrong, but what's remarkable
about this team is that this is the second year in a row that they've
done it, which is quite an accomplishment. They were undefeated for 2
years, and they're going to represent the state of North Carolina coming
up August 1st through the 6th  over in Greenbull in the tournament of
the state champions. And I just thought you folks would want to know
about that. I'm particularly impressed in coach, Sen. Tillman, I wasn't
much of a baseball player when I was young. I did some other things, but
I was not much of a baseball player. I couldn't hit the ball very well,
I didn't throw it very well, and I had a lot of fun but I didn't go very
far and certainly never rose to the ranks of a state champion. I never
did that in any of the sports that I did, and so the fact that these
young men, ten of them are returning from last year's championship team,
I just think that's quite a remarkable accomplishment, and I think
congratulations are deserved to them and the coaches and their parents
for their dedication and I believe this point in time in their lives I
hope they'll remember forever and learn. I think they've learned that
hard work and discipline can carry you far in life, and I just thought
that you all should know about that. Thank you Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, upon the motion of Sen. Buck Newton of Johnston, Nash, and
Wilson counties, the Chair is happy to extend courtesies  to the 10 and
11 year old all-star team from the Wilson city little league and their
head coaches. The head coach is Chris Bass, assistant coach is Wes Pope
and Greg Waddell, and as Sen. Newton indicated, they won the State
Championship in Curtisville last week, and has a 2 year tournament
record of 14-0 which as has been indicated is quite an accomplishment.
They're accompanied by the City of Wilson Parks and Recreation athletic
supervisor, Braxton Patterson, and they're in the gallery here. If you
would please stand and be recognized by the Senate.
Congratulations guys, and good luck.
Members, we're about to go to the calendar. On the first page, there are
three local bills. Is there any objection to us voting those three bills
jointly?
Sen. Apodaca, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, House bill 1054, we need to place if we may at the end of
the calendar. Sen. McKissick says he has a little amendment he would
like to rune, so. And I know we're all anxiously looking forward to
that, so thank you. I move that we would place it on the end of the
calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, House bill 1054 will be moved to the end of the
calendar. Is there any objection
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Harrington, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To request that HB 1059 be separated out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well so much for my suggestion. Without objection.
House bill 1044, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 1044, Averasboro township TDA changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Rabin, recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. This is a local bill. It's not a new tax, it simply
rearranges the Averasboro authority for tourism. I urge your support,
there's nothing wrong with the bill, all the stakeholders have agreed
that are involved, thank you.

the department of revenue. Clarify that it's the personal income taxes
that income of a partnership that is apportionable to certain states is
allocated, of course in accordance with the statue. Allocation and
apportion of it, section 9 clarifies that a person who is not eligible

The last one I'll mention is section 19, establishes a procedure for
central assessment of mobile telecommunication property by department of
revenue and this section insures that there is no shifting of value
amongst the counties as a result of this change. Ladies and gentlemen of

finance.

Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for Senator ??.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
House bill 1224, local sales tax options economic development changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Gunn is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President. It's great to be here today. It's great to
have this opportunity to put a major job development bill in front of
you today. By the action that we take today, we have the potential to
improve North Carolina's growth and their economic development
initiatives. We are going to be able to increase our toolbox to allow
the Secretary of Commerce, four provisions of the bill that I'll explain
in a minute, to give her better tools to make us more competitive so we
can bring more jobs to all parts of North Carolina using various tools.
Also, part of this bill, we're going to be able to give local
communities something that they haven't had relative to their sales tax
and that's far more flexibility to invest in public education. We all
know and we've talked about it, two of the biggest things that we are
trying to accomplish down here, and I think we're doing a great job, is
job growth and economic development, and making sure we have an educated
public education. We educate these folks and get kids and people reading
for their education needs to attract these critical jobs. I am going to
make sure that I do not get the auximater. I'm sorry, Senator Barringer,
you will be holding onto that, but at the same time I am going to take
just a few moments to go over and highlight what I think are very
important. I'm going to start with sections two through five, these are
four economic development initiatives, two of them I'll spend a little
more time on, two of them I'm going to highlight quickly. We are going
to make a J-Mack modification. As you know, J-Mack was done back in 2007
and its sole purpose was to make sure that we keep employers and keep
jobs in our state. It's going to do four things, it's going to allow the
eligibility of large manufacturer employers to.</p>

the orange and uncounted if they impose a tax on them agree to do it at

elegant, making the decision just the punishment County without any
justification for it. send this item is working that reason, but nobody
is a reason that having the name of arms and armed counties now that is

about the County should be able to do that other than justified the
other thing that we did last year in the county. we passed the biggest
nine referendum issue in history, becoming the approved Requiem is not
about an issue to build new schools in this county. so if we impose the
additional tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
it would be for two reasons. number one live up to the commitment with
orange and drum counties to fund a public transportation system, which
includes buses, at least in the short term, as well as to improve
teacher pay. so what you do in this video is temporally actualize as
whether we would impose a one quarter cent sales tax, not necessarily
for general purposes, but for the purpose of the program teacher pay,
since again competing cities, much better than we are all over the

<p id="040:00">
Debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s ironic y’all take a pretty straightforward economic development
bill and in the process incorporate a provision that will probably do
more long term economic damage to the state of North Carolina that all
the other little provisions y’all have in here, combined. Two things
that this bill is going to end up doing, in a practical effect. One,
it’s going to raise sales taxes on people in small counties all across
the state. And let me tell you how it does that. Right now, in most
counties, you’re at 2% and you can either do a quarter cent general or
you can do a quarter cent of transportation. Well Senator Gunn just said
in his introductory comments that transit is not used. That quarter cent
which exists on the books is not used and cannot be used. So it isn’t
real. Right now, the typical rural county therefore has a capacity of 2
1/4 % for sales tax. And what y’all have been outdone is make it up to 2
1/2% and let it go for transit, education, general purpose, whatever
folks want to do. At the same time that y’all are cramming down more
services and more obligations on local governments, at the same time you
are cutting per capita student spending on public schools, thereby
forcing local governments to do everything they can to staunch the flow
of teachers out of their school systems to neighboring states. So what
this bill does is it will, a couple years from now, result in higher
sales taxes all across the state that wouldn’t have otherwise existed.
The second thing you do is you are trying to kill or no, you’re not
trying to kill. You’re just trying to slow it down. Try to slow down the
economic engines of North Carolina. When you look at where the economic
growth has happened in North Carolina, it is overwhelmingly focused on
Mecklenberg, Wake and the triad. And when I say Wake, I actually mean
the triangle and that includes eight counties around it. Because as
Senator Blue rightfully noted, there are plenty of people in Franklin
County who come into Wake County to work. There are plenty of people in
Johnson County who come in to RTP to work. Plenty of people in Alamance
who go to Guilford. Whereby taking away tools in the toolbox for those
communities to figure out how to move those millions of people around in
their areas, you are making it so that they are less likely to succeed
five years, ten years, fifteen years from now. Leveling the playing
field? Do you all think that an employer is deciding whether to locate
an RTP or some rural eastern North Carolina county? That’s not the
choice. The choice is do we go to RTP or do we go to San Jose, or to
Austin, Texas, northern Virginia, to Boston, just as Senator Blue said.
So what you are doing is un-leveling the playing field between North
Carolina and these other communities that have public transportation
systems that we are behind the curve on, and they’re trying to get ahead
of, so that we remain an attractive destination for companies and their
employees to work. As relates to leveling economic development in North
Carolina, I absolutely want us to do everything we can to help rural
areas to grow. I know that many of you represent counties that are
struggling, stagnating, some of you are even losing population. The
programs that we have, that give extra incentives, the economic
incentives to have companies located in your counties, I am 100% for.
I’m for paying teachers a supplement to work in rural counties because I
know it’s oftentimes harder to get high quality teachers to come to
rural areas when they want to come live in the cities, where there’s
more dynamic stuff going on. Whatever we can do as a state to help your
areas grow, I am for. We do that through our general fund. The irony is
our general fund is overwhelmingly filled by economic activity from the
triangle, from the triad, and from Mecklenberg. Y’all are cutting off
your own noses to spite your face. An economic development bill</p>

rural counties and hurts the long-term economic prospects of the
economic engines of North Carolina.  This is an economic development
bill that I will be voting against.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know, we listened to the amendment that Senator Stein put forward,
rather long, and then a speech on the negatives of the bill.  What I
can't understand is how can anyone think of making it easier for some of
the low-wealth, smaller counties to have an opportunity to take part in
the prosperity in North Carolina is wrong.  It makes absolutely no sense
to make that statement.  And to call it a tax increase so that they, the
small counties and the low-wealth counties, will have a chance to meet
some of their needs in education, on water and sewer, a lot of other
economic development tools by having the flexibility to increase that
sales tax, which they were prohibited from doing the way it was
originally established, again, makes no sense.  How can anyone even
begin to talk about economic growth and jobs and this bill stopping it
when the results of many years that Senator Stein's party has been
involved in running this state, and what are the results.  A decline in
income, both on a personal and a per capita basis and household income.
An increase in government dependency and poverty.  We're talking about
an increase in job loss, unemployment rates that were double digit, why
would anybody want to continue in the direction he offers and his party
offers rather than taking steps forward where we see in the past three
years 220,000 plus new jobs offered to the state of North Carolina,
which puts North Carolinians back to work.  That was the goal of this
General Assembly and that's what it remains to be with this bill.  We're
also looking at the ?? in unemployment, which is another landmark that
you measure.  Ladies and gentlemen, we've made great strides in this
state to move forward this economic model.  And this is just another
step in the direction that we're trying to move this state so that, you
know what, all hundred counties are going to be prosperous.  Not just
six urban areas.  An economic value today...viable state is one where a
hundred counties and all the citizens can participate.  Senator Stein
thinks it should just be this urban six.  We disagree with that, and
that's why this bill is sent forward.  And I hope you'll join me in
supporting House Bill 1224.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Graham, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, for the last week and a half, I've
been quietly watching and listening to this debate both at home and here
at the General Assembly, and I come to the conclusion of this:  If North
Carolina is a body, then certainly the urban areas is the heart.  And if
the heart stops beating, the body dies.  Now, it's a good bill until you
get down to the last section of it where it becomes hard to separate the
policy from the politics of the bill.
And today, the governor is in Charlotte announcing a major job
initiative, a new company relocated to Charlotte, the largest in the
city's history.  Yesterday, he made another job announcement.  And all
that has to do with the infrastructure that we have in place that not
only supports Charlotte and Mecklenburg County but the region.  We are
all in this together.  And for the last year and a half or two, this
body has consistently weakened the heart.  Whether it's Mecklenburg or
Guilford or Forsyth or Wake.  And that does not make a strong North
Carolina.  I think Senator Blue and Senator Stein have been very
articulate this afternoon in stating that case.  I am for economic
development for all one-hundred counties.  I'm going to support the
thumb and the pinky toe.  I'm going to support the left leg and the
right leg because we're all in this together.  But what pumps the blood,
which empowers all of us, is our economic engines.

And I think that the board of public commissioners in Mecklenberg and
Wake and Guilford, both Democrats and Republican, can make decisions
based on the needs of the local people. And they don’t need us to tell
them what they can and they can’t do. Great bill. Great policy it
institutes. Bad politics. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or
debate. Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak briefly on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You know I guess those that are fortunate enough to
live in Mecklenberg or Wake and some of the counties that are really
thriving, you know I guess you can make these arguments and I can
understand maybe some of the arguments. But for those of us who live in
rural North Carolina, sometimes these arguments are tough to take I
guess for us. You know as you look at the piece we’re debating the most
on this bill, a lot of the counties that we represent have some of the
highest property tax rates in the state. And the reason they do is they
really have very few revenue sources to generate revenue, and they have
the needs just like everyone else. They have to build schools, and they
have to you know provide a jail and they have to do other things that
are required, but they have so few revenue sources to do it with other
than property tax that they continuously raise property tax, which
continuously puts them less competitive throughout the state. And that’s
what you have. If you look at rural North Carolina, you have a bunch of
counties with the highest property taxes in the state, which makes them
less competitive which gives Wake and Mecklenberg and Orange and
Guilford and others more advantage over them as we move forward. And
that’s what’s happened. So you’ve got two North Carolinas is what you’ve
got really. You’ve got the outlining counties that just can’t be
competitive because they don’t have ways to be competitive. They
continue to raise property tax. No business wants to go there because of
it. And then you have the rich counties that have other options, and can
compete on a better playing field I guess. Some of these transit pieces
that we’re talking about. Look at Mecklenberg County. They’ve got
transit piece they passed. But what does that mean to rural North
Carolina? What it means is that Mecklenberg County gets an additional 80
million dollars out of the transportation pot, it goes to them and it
cuts all the dollars that go to the other counties because they’ve got
this transit system in place. Now that’s great for Mecklenberg County,
if you live there that’s wonderful. I’d be all for it. But for rural
North Carolina, that means 80 million dollars out of the pot that
doesn’t go to your counties. That’s what happens. So again, it takes a
small county, makes them less competitive, puts them further behind, and
just makes it more difficult to compete. So what you’re trying to do
here, is you got to look at the big picture. We can talk about how you
support other counties and try to do things to help them, but we can
talk about it but we don’t do anything. I think everybody in this body
will agree, small counties get further and further behind, rich counties
get better and better. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do
you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, I want to make sure I heard you
correctly when you say that Wake County  in trying to recruit
pharmaceutical companies, high tech companies or even the filmmakers, is
competing with Onslo County. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In some cases, I would
say so. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Another question, Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, you understand that
in representing an urban county, Wake County, that I was a major sponsor
of the low wealth school formula, which is distributing hundreds of
millions of dollars to counties other than Wake County, other than
Mecklenberg County, other than Guilford and Forsythe County and the way
that we can distribute those hundreds of millions of dollars is because
of the pharmaceutical companies in the research triangle park, the
digital companies around Raleigh and the other mega-employers who are
looking at Raleigh and Austin and Boston and San Francisco and the DC
suburbs and the Atlanta suburbs. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, I think
this body is doing everything we can with tax policy, with what this
bill does in recruitment efforts to make sure</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Reading this bill and listening to the debate
on it this week reminded me a little of Mary Poppins. A spoonful of
sugar to help the medicine go down. Well the longer this bill moved
around committee it seemed to me that the spoon got bigger and the pile
of sugar got bigger. But the fact is, the medicine in this bill got no
less bitter for those to swallow. Now we can find good things in this
bill, there are things about it I like. But unfortunately it is set up
as a false construct, there are parts of it that are beneficial for
places in North Carolina, and there are parts that are not beneficial
for our larger counties. I represent one of those urban counties. I also
represent a county of 22,000 people that are struggling financially. So
there are 3 problems that I see with this flawed piece of legislation,
one, now we've heard the debate on this and I will continue that
discussion, is that it focuses on fault choices that it gives local
governments and voters. Secondly, it substitutes good policy with bad
politics, just because somebody got their nose bent out of shape about a
certain Board of County Commissioner's moving on an action in their
district, is no reason to take a good bill and start throwing bad public
policy into, bad politics into this bill. These, as Senator Brown
correctly pointed out, these sales tax questions go to referendum,
referendum, let the voters decide. In my 7 years on the city council, I
worked on 2 sales tax referenda, one was the very transit tax we're
talking about and as I look around this room I see some of you who
worked with me on that bill. I was here lobbying for that as chairman of
my NPO, and was very proud when we passed that transit sales tax in
Durham. But we also had a sales tax a few years before that, that failed
miserably, because it was not well-conceived, and the voters had the
good sense to see through it and defeat it. What you all are doing by
setting this cap for those urban counties, is you're taking away the
ability of those voters to decide what is best for their region. Senator
Brown said that you're giving these counties a tool for economic
development, you're handing them a tool, but you're limiting the use of
that tool. It's like giving them a hammer that has the hammery part, but
doesn't have the backside of it to pull the nail out if they need to.
You have limited the ability of the tool that you've given here. The
third flaw in this bill, is that this is a proxy fight about  transit,
you like it or you don't, you think it benefits your county or it
doesn't. You've heard my colleagues from Wake and Mecklenburg talk about
how transit is the important part that drives economic development in
our communities, and by limiting our ability to do that you're going to
be choking off that economic development. One of the best stories about
transit in this region as I heard from an executive in RTP, he relocated
his firm from a northeastern state to the Wake County portion of RTP,
Senator Barringer, Senator Stein's district, and the reason he- and I
have heard him say this many times and I had him explain it to me, his
decision to relocate from the northeast he told me was made in the
backseat of a taxi cab in Atlanta, Georgia, because he was stuck in
rush-hour traffic. That's why he came here, and not Atlanta, for his
firm. You all are going to continue to choke off those companies who
wanna come here and do that. We can talk about Texas, Senator Apodaca
talked about his home state and talked about cities there, but one he
didn't mention was Dallas, Fort Worth</p>

Representative: Probably the best comparisons that we have to the
triangle, triad, maybe even the McClemburgh area, because you have two
cities in the middle almost identical to what we have. Their light rail
system is working and that is where you see a lot of growth. We are
competing against the Dallas Fort Worth area as well. You’ve seen
economic development in the triangle, triad, McClemburgh area transfer
those jobs and facilities to other parts of the state. Look at the Merck
plant that moved its facility after starting down to Durham. Look at
Glaxosmithkline’s expansion into some of our counties as well. We
incubate them in the urban areas and then they spread out to the rural
areas. This does not have to be an urban rural fight, it can be…

Representative: I know a lot about those two plants. The plant was in
Wilson well before it was in Durham. Wasn’t the one in Durham here on
late night session gave the company a $20 million bonus to move here,
even though Merck pharmaceuticals did not like incentives?
Representative: Similar to the incentives in this bill? Is that right?
Representative: No, I was just making sure we had.. you may have been on

Representative: On that policy, Terry Sanford Jr. bought that land at
$1700 an acre, which, is pretty land anywhere you find in NC, but that
was in the [xx] park, and I think he was standing at about $10 million

Sanford Jr. was allowed to buy the land at $1700 an acre?
Representative: I cannot speak on the details of that sir.
Representative: Okay, it was in your district, so I was just thinking…
Speaker: Senator Water continues to be recognized to speak on the bill.
Representative:  Thank you Mr. President. We just saw… we are often
accused of only reading NPR, and not the Wall Street Journal, but if you
look in the Triangle Business Journal today, you will see the job losses
that NC is leading the Southeast in planned job cuts this year. That is
from challenger Gray Christmas, one of the states largest job placement
companies. Our figures are second only to FL in the Southeast. Yet, if
you look at the figures of Gray Christmas, you will see that job
expansion is continuing in the triangle. You are going to continue to
choke those things off. Ladies and gentleman, it continues to be a
flawed bill that we have here. For reasons I have outlined, I would hope
that you vote against this legislation. It does set up that kind of
false construct. We do not need to have these fights. We do not need a
substitute: good policy for bad politics.
Speaker: Senator Hunt, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative :To speak on the bill.
Speaker: You have the floor.
Representative: Ladies and gentleman, when I walked into the chamber
today, being from Wade county, I planned on voting against this bill. I
wanted to protect that ¼ of 1% that Wade County was going to lose in
this proposition, but after listening to all this rhetoric from the
opposition, it is becoming very difficult for me to do that. To make the
statement that we are cutting education spending is an incorrect
statement. We are actually increasing education spending since we took
over. To say that we are slowing economic growth by our efforts, is
absolutely incorrect. The fact is that the unemployment rate in NC has
gone from worst in the Southeast to second best. We have had the third
fastest drop</p>

This is technically Amendment 3 because there was as an amendment
yesterday when the bill was on second amendment. Senator Jackson offered
and then withdrew an amendment today, and this same amendment has now
been offered and is now Amendment 3. So for those keeping score this is
actually Amendment 3. Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?

To ask Senator Brock a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.

He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, Senator Jackson’s amendment takes the piece on the gravel
out, can you explain to me exactly what that was in the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
During the interim committee, originally when we looked at impervious
services, especially with gravel, it got into an ERC Subcommittee , of
something we worked on and it got into a, this is more getting into the
different types of ways, the different types of aggregate that we have.
Once washed, twice washed and it got into a huge issue that we frankly
need a little more time studying, make sure we have right. And we should
have everything hopefully taken care of and we’ll start again next long
session.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, there’s been a lot of debate on the piece on impervious
services as it relates to gravel.  If you live in coastal North
Carolina, it really effects what you can do with property.  We’ve
debated this for the last 2 years, and to be quite honest Representative
Samuelson has ?? this office over and over.  And I just have concerns
about this I think the original bills a good bill as it dealt with
gravel and I’m going to ask that you vote against this amendment.

Make sure they don’t have any unintended consequences.  I think senator

was no justification for potentially causing the Raleigh waste water

Thank you, Mr. President.  Members of the Senate, the part of this bill
that I'm focused on working on deals with the town of Spindale in
Rutherford County.  This allows them to have their sewer fees... have a
collection on their sewer fees that exist for non-users.  The question
came up in committee yesterday.  The fee on this is twelve dollars a
month, but this allows them to reach collections similar to how they
collect delinquent taxes.  And I think Senator McKissick may have an
amendment regarding the rest of the bill.
