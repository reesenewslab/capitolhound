<p id="00:00">
Good afternoon and welcome to the House committee meeting on government.
From Monday June the thirtieth June fourteen. Ladies and gentlemen I
want to start out introducing our Sergeant arms Young Bay, Bob Rossi,
here we go, Doug Harris and Ward Hawkins. And because the North Carolina
of General Assembly is so great we have no pages this week. We kept
y'all and sent them home. (laughter)
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Chair. We actually got pages, we just don't have them.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
The Senate...
SPEAKER CHANGES:
No. No we have 'em ??
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Welcome well this committee doesn't have pages for today so we'll move
forward ladies and gentlemen we have two bills on the calendar today.
First bill up short titled are Senate bill one Oh five.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
And PCS.. ??
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Balls moves with a PCS forest. Representative Ball you
have the floor.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you mister chairmen, this bill started in the Senate as a bill to
tighten up regulations of political science and it was amended to add
two towns to the state health plan. That being Matthews and Elizabeth
town, the sign thing had become so controversial that Senator Tillman
graciously allowed us to strip all of the sign provisions out so the
bill before you today does two things. It adds the current employees for
the town of Elizabeth town to the State health plan and it allows the
current employees to the town of Matthews to the state health plan.
Because retiree coverage is not going to be provided by either town
there is no impact on potential state debt. The terms under which they
are added is the towns will be responsible for making all of the
payments to the state health plan in a timely manner collecting any
employee portions from the employees and in any month that the towns are
late they accrue late payment penalties of one and a half percent per
month or portion of month for being late on their payments. An actuarial
note has been provided and mister chairmen I think David...how does one
pronounce your last name? You told me twice and I apologize.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Yeah.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you there. Representative Ballwood we're gon' go to the committee
now for some comments I think first we have up is Representative
Cleveland.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you mister chairmen. This is probably for staff. I thought we did
something about four years ago. To stop towns and cities from coming
into the state health plan. Did we not?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Staff?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Yes David Van Wine from the fiscal research division. That was roughly I
believe two thousand seven was the last time the General Assembly passed
a bill allowing a local goverment to come into the state health plan.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Follow up my question was. In the back of my mind I believe we actually
did something in law to stop cities and towns from coming into the state
health plan.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Staff?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Previously you were allowing them on one at a time or you were allowing
them with legislation specifically named the local governments that
would come in. So there wasn't anything...as long as you didn't pass any
further legislation allowing additional one's on there wasn't any need
to stop anything.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
So what I'm hearing is everybody just agreed not to put anybody on the
state health plan? That's not what I remember but fine thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you. Representative Fisher.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you mister Fisher this might be for staff as well. How many cities
or towns currently are enrolled in the state health plan?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Staff
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Is it in the summary oh it's in the summary which I have now.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Floyd?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
A test question for ?? didn't we do something as it relates to Smith??
hospital last year? ??
SPEAKER CHANGES:
You might be referring to Johnston Candid memorial hospital. That was a
different system the local governmental employees retirement system and
they were allowed to leave the retirement system as opposed to joining
the state health plan which is what this is.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Follow up. At the appropriate time mister chair...</p>

<p id="05:00">
Any other questions from the committee? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Fisher. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, just for my own
edification, clarification, what are the advantages/disadvantages for
the state for adding towns to the state health plan? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly where there's a group that might have
a lower cost, so it's possible Elizabethtown will have a lower cost
because their premiums are being forced higher by the provisions of the
Affordable Care Act. So in that case, that might represent a savings,
that could potentially represent a savings to the state but we don't
really know until they come in. Otherwise, it's just helping out local
governments, there's not really a ?? to the state. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Representative Pittman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. I want to go back to staff on Representative Cleveland's
question because I would like a little more definitive answer to what he
was asking. I don't think I'm necessarily against this but I'd like to
be more certain that we don't have something in statute against it
before we move forward with it, so I would appreciate a little more
definitive answer if we could get it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Maybe if you were more detailed in your question,
Representative Pittman, they will answer. So I guess clarify remarks,
what you exactly want. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, Representative Cleveland
was suggesting that he thought a few years ago we had done something in
law to make this illegal, basically. To say you couldn't do this. And
I'd like. to know for sure if we did that or not, or whether you all did
it before I got here. Because if there is such, then this is a problem.
If not, it may not be. But I'd just like to have a better idea on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pittman, I think we can all say that we
do things every year, not expecting someone to come back in the
following term, but no one General Assembly combined, another General
Assembly coming in, so the rules change every year. And also every
Committee. So it's the land of zombies. Everything comes back here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions for the committee? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I have one question. I want to know, there's no physical impact
for these two, is that correct or not? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That is not correct. You have an actuary note in front of you.
You should have it now. And it shows that there, both of the actuaries
estimate an impact due to Mathews. So Mathews would pay a premium that
is equal to the fully contributory premium for state employees in the
state health plan. And it's estimated that their actual costs would be
higher than that so that premium would not cover the full cost. So there
would be a small net cost to the state. Relative to the total inflow and
outflow of the plan of 3 billion dollars a year, it's very small. But
there would be some net cost. The actuaries differed on their assessment
of Elizabethtown. One said there would be no material cost. The other
said there would be a cost. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Adams. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair.
I wanted to ask staff in the event I think someone raised the question
about other counties may want to come in, so that would be, would that
be an increase as well? Should that happen? Based on what you just said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would potentially have a cost, but that would
require additional legislation to allow those to come in and that cost
could be considered at the time that legislation was considered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And I understand that. But just say it did happen, I guess my
question is is there a point where we would have too many? I mean, then
it would seriously impact the state? Is there any kind of cut-off
anywhere, in your mind? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
don't know that there's a hard cut-off but yes, it could certainly
become a noticeable number if almost all of the local governments in
North Carolina joined the plan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I've got a question,
and I'm making sure I'm not losing track here. The cost for this program
is fully funded by these cities and towns, correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Premiums. Right. So for example if the premium for coverage is $448 a
month, but the actual claims on average for a certain town's employees
are $500 a month, then the premium does not cover the real costs of
having that town in the plan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Who pays? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It is up to the town to decide whether the town or the
employee, what portion the town will pay and what portion the employee
will pay of the</p>

<p id="10:00">
$448 in my example. But in total, the state health plan has to collect
that $448 from either the town or the employees or a mix of the two. But
in some cases, that might not cover all of the true cost of claims if
that is in my example $500. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So that would leave the
state health plan paying the difference? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ramsey, question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman, can I ask a question of the staff? Based on the fiscal
analysis, we really can't tell whether this group will have higher cost,
or they may actually have lower costs than the state average, so the
actuarial number is just the best guess, is that correct? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It is the best guess. The numbers are positive, particularly on
the line so it seems more likely that it would have a cost than a
savings but it is just a best guess, correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No follow up. Representative McNeill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I think this would be for staff also. The state health plan
overall, is it losing money? Gaining money? Is it okay? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You have in the appendices to the note, you have some financial
statistics. It is generally in very good financial shape right now. I
guess on page six of the actuarial note, the beginning cash balance for
calendar year 2014 was 838 million dollars. Much higher than it's been
in the past. It is projecting losses, small losses according to this
projection, for those years. Just because experience has been so good so
premium increases haven't been as rapid. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I
guess this is a question for staff, but should this bill take a dip in
finance? I noticed there was no referral to finance, but just ?? wonder
whyit didn't go to finance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It did go to finance. It
passed finance. It went to state personnel. And state personnel and some
members of this committee wanted it to take a dip in this committee
which was not required because they were concerned about the signs and
we agreed to take a dip in this committee so you could script the signs
out. Without the signs, you wouldn't have seen this bill at all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So it's taken a dip in all the appropriate dipping places,
correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes it has. It's  passed everywhere it needed
to go for state health plans. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Cleveland. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Wilkins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Bell asked my question. But for clarity, we from looking at this, the
state health plan is going to have an operating loss for calendar year
14 and calendar year 15. And the reason we stopped having cities and
towns put on the state health plan was because of the condition of the
state health plan, and the monies it was bleeding and taking out of the
general fund. I think we're setting a bad precedent here. I don't like
to be the guy throwing cold water, but I think this is going to open the
flood gates and we're going to see a whole lot of cities and towns
coming back, wanting to get on the state health plan. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to
get something straight. These two towns had no health care benefits, no
plan for their employees, is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is not
correct. They both currently offer coverage to their employees. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
said something about as a result of the national health care law, that
they are seeking to become part of the state health plan. Can you just
elaborate on that just a little bit? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I would say
that is a relevant factor for Elizabethtown only. So Elizabethtown is a
small employer under the Affordable Care Act. They have less than 50
employees. Small employers can no longer have their premiums based on
their actual experience. Their experience based on the premiums they're
paying seems to be very good. The premiums that they're paying for 13,
14 year are quite a bit less than what they would be under the state
health plan. But because of the Affordable Care Act for 14, 15 they
would have to be charged a premium based purely on the age distribution
of their employees, not based on the health status of their employees.
So that premium would be a lot higher since they seem to have some very
healthy employees. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You're saying</p>

<p id="15:00">
[0:00:00.0]
The majority of the employees are older is that what you are saying and
they are younger?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Healthier, healthy but older.
[Laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Only Chair can clarify the staff. You are saying the employees are older
and healthier but on the current plan it had to pay more because they
have 50 or less and if they do in the state there is chance that the
health become down possibly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The premium they would pay would be lower than if they went to and
insure for the 14-15 year because that insure what have to charge them
right they are based purely on the age distribution of their employees
which is non-unusual, I mean they have some young employees and some old
employees, they could not base their premium on their health status. So,
it would be I believe the premium would be more like $500 or $600 a
month rather than $450 a month under the State Health Plan or 300
something that they are paying now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up recognized Bell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, so just let me be real clear, it’s more advantageous for them
fiscally speaking to join a State Health Plan but the natural
consequences this national law is that their premiums would have gone
up, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it’s very similar to any other individual for instance if
individual buying coverage on exchange who is very healthy generally
they saw higher premium because the premium could no longer be based on
their health.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, as to recognized Cleveland’s point is that there is gonna be a
stampede to the State Health Plan I will bet you. Do you do anticipate
that or do you think I’m off base? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair can ask one of those questions, we currently have a building
committee for the many reasons to the state I think. Representative
Collins…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanna to point out that according to what we just heard, there is
a couple of things we might wanna think about, number for those
municipalities that are less, that are fewer than 50 employees like
Elizabeth ___[02:07], if we have a stampede to those people to the State
Health Plan it will be for the reason Mr. Wando just stated because they
are healthy. And therefore, we want those people in the State Health
Plan and also kind of does a way with the logic that this company used
where they were taken Elizabeth Fund premium and plan design and put 50%
of ___[02:31] for adverse selection because normally in the insurance
when you would think that if people will run away from their plan and
that was because they are un-healthy but because of the strange
ramifications of the ICA that Mr. Wando just mentioned for small
employees not only for those with fewer than 50 but for the ones like
Elizabeth Fund we may see a stampede to the State Health Plan because
the people are healthy and don’t want to pay the premiums they will have
to pay under ICA which will be a good thing for the State Health Plan.
So, you got two different situations between Mathews and Elizabeth Fund
here in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Gill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I gotta a question for staff, one example you
gave earlier that said the state may have some cause because if a
premium of $448 does not cover $500 in claim, this is not some vehicle
for rate adjustment when claims are higher than premiums?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In theory, I mean the State Health Plan, I can speak to this I think
they would have extreme administrative difficulty in handling such a
plan, they may have some legal concerns I don’t know if they want to
address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold on for a second. Chair like __[03:41] for State Health Plans,
please introduce yourself and let me hear your thoughts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Account for even if the State Health Plan, there really isn’t a
mechanism to adjust through that. So, what we do with the premium is we
figure out what the average cost is for everyone? So, it would be the
universities, state employees, retirees, the community colleges that
becomes an average of $448.12 is what the state pays each month. I would
guess that very, very few people exactly hit that total. So, we would
have to, in the example you brought up manually adjust for 675,000
people that would be fairly complex administratively and I think there
would be some legal concerns about charging people different amounts.
So, what we do is we take the average premium cost and determine that
would be and that’s what we charge each local unit and that’s what you
kicking for state employees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Also the committee we have got another person, if you ask questions too
if you need to. I will go back to Representative Gilman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But if the entire State Health Plan has claims exceeding premiums then
you adjust the whole plan…

<p id="20:00">
It seems like that would take care of the issue on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, for the whole state.
Yes, you would adjust the premiums but you would be losing money
potentially on that one local government relative to if they had not
joined the plan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One more
follow up. So ultimately what happens in a case like that is all the
other people in the pool cover the additional costs if there is a
situation like that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, that's correct. And the
general fund puts in about 2 billion of the 3 billion that goes into the
state health plan every year. So mostly it would be the general fund
covering that shortfall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, I have two questions. My first
question is, I was in finance and I don't recall seeing this actuary
note that we were passed out here. Does anyone know was that presented
in finance and I just overlooked it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair will go
to the bill sponsor, Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It was
not presented in finance because the preparation of it had not been
completed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.  My
second question is for the state employees health plan gentlemen. I'd
like to know how they feel about these counties, cities, and
municipalities coming into the state health plan and does, if an influx
started coming in do they foresee a problem with it? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks for the question. It's a complicated question. We think that
there's language written into this specific proposal that significantly
improved upon what other municipalities and charter schools have had in
the past in terms of giving us flexibility to collect if folks don't
pay, or take some action if folks don't pay so from that perspective
there's some definite good things in the language included in this bill.
The more entities that join, obviously there's some administrative
complexity that comes with it. We'd need to prepare an actuarial note
each time to determine the impact of the plan. I think there are
opportunities where there is good risk that's coming on and there's
opportunities where there's bad risk coming on, where things would cost
more. And that would have to be a case to case basis to determine when
that tipping point is, to really make an impact. So we don't have a
broad opinion about this, but there are some advantages to the way this
bill is drafted, versus previously. We had some exclamation points in
the positive direction, for how it was written from that perspective.
But this definitely would be more administrative work, the more accounts
that would come on, particularly on the billing side of things. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Follow up, Representative? All right. Representative
Wilkins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, a couple of exchanges have
answered my questions, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Adams. Representative Earle. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Have we allowed local municipalities to come into the state health plan
before? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Those are the
ones listed in the bill summary. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. So I guess my
question is if we have allowed this in the past, which I do recall that
we had, then I don't see what the issue is with allowing these small
towns to come into the plan. It's not like it's the first time it's
every been done and I don't think that it's had that kind of a negative
impact on the state health plan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions
from the committee? Representative Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think
Representative Earle brings up a good point and so does Representative
Cleveland and I'm just curious. If we've done this in the past and
apparently we've done it 19 times, why do we pass legislation
prohibiting it or restraining it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff? According to
Representative Cleveland we did. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a follow up to
Representative Cleveland's original question, I do believe there was an
informal policy decision not to have any more local governments come on.
So I think for instance the state health plan at the time might have
told legislators that wanted their local governments to come on that the
financial situation was not good, and so they should not introduce a
bill or the state health plan was going to speak against the bill, or
something along those lines. Prior to the previous administration of the
state health plan. So I think there was a policy decision made. I don't
believe there was a bill passed that prevented it but I think there was
a conscious policy decision made not to pass any new legislation letting
any new local governments on after 2007. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Any other questions from the committee? Any closing remarks from the
bill sponsor? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we're prepared to</p>
