Speaker: It&#39;s not gonna be so often. William, I know you&#39;re a
fast talker and we&#39;re just gonna take questions as we go. William,
you wanna begin? Oh, one point of business. Mr. Boles, our Chairman,
wanted to introduce someone.
Speaker: Yeah, I&#39;d like to introduce Reverend David Fry &lt;??&gt;
from &lt;00:21&gt;&lt;??&gt; Baptist Church in &lt;??&gt; Widford Pines.
Here&#39;s here as a guest today and just thank you for being here.
Speaker: Thank you.
Speaker: Yeah, I appreciate you coming and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll
probably have some questions after this meeting, but anyway.
Speaker: Thank you, Mr. Chair. &lt;??: Disappeared the click&gt;
We&#39;ve lost our clicker. Good morning. I&#39;m William Childs from
Fiscal Research Division. Last week we talked, we did an inter-, we did
an overview. [sil] Is that better? Can everybody hear me? [sil] Okay, I
just need to talk loud? Ooh, wow. Okay. I like that. See if you all can
hear me now. I think it was last week we did an overview of the
administrative office of the courts. We are starting in with the
presentations on the judicial branch. Today I wanna talk about workload
and personnel at the administrative office of the courts and please do
interrupt me if you have questions. We&#39;ll start with a little bit of
background. As you recall, we&#39;re talking about the administrative
office of the courts which is 469 million in general fund budget for
this year. That&#39;s 18 percent of the JPS budget. You&#39;ll see this
slide a few times, but the major points here are that 92-to-93 percent
of AOC&#39;s general fund budget is made of personal services,
that&#39;s people, and there are 533 elected officials, 548 judicial
officials total, that are under AOC&#39;s umbrella. This is another way
of looking at this umbrella. The trial courts take up the vast majority
of AOC&#39;s budget. You can even include the specialty programs and
District Attorney&#39;s and see that trial courts are mainly what AOC
does. Here&#39;s another way of looking at personnel and again the
clerks are a big part of what AOC does.  And we saw, this slide and the
next slide are the current trends in dispositions throughout the State
of North Carolina. As you can see, they are going down in district
courts and in superior courts, although if you look at the numbers
underneath . . . the criminal non-traffic cases, there is some
fluctuation there, but they are mostly stable. So, workload:
traditionally from the point of unification basically until a few years
ago the allocation of court resources were, were to take place in that
AOC would come up with a list of how resources, personnel resources had
to be allocated in the upcoming year. There was really not much in the
way of an objective measure. People were going by well we need this, we
need that and then the General Assembly would allocate these resources
and there was a statutory minimum of certain types of personnel that are
still in statue. However, starting in 2007 AOC worked with the National
Center for State Courts which is kind of the national clearinghouse for
court knowledge to create some kind of objective workload formulas. Now
the idea here is that the workload formulas are . . . they take the
subjective side out of the hands of AOC and they say here are some real
ways to figure out where we need people and how to use these scant
resources. These are currently considered a national standard for
workload formulas and I do have a list of the personnel we are talking
about. It is not everybody, but it is pretty close to it. This is how
these work. So, the National Center for State Courts . . . [end

  And came in and did time studies in various court houses around the
state, basically estimating how much time is spent on cases, how much
time is spent on administration for different type of workers, and they
use these to determine case weights by the type of offense. So for
instance, I&#39;ve got up here that the average time an ADA would spend
on a traffic case is six and a half minutes. Average time an ADA spends
on a first degree murder is 10,173 minutes. So the workload need for
each district is based on the number of cases that have come into that
district, the type of cases, which are then weighed by the amount of
time that the personnel spends on those types of cases divided by the
amount of casework that a person could do in a year, basically. These
workload assessments are still in place with the National Center for
State Courts. This references a 2013 report that the NCSC put out which
has, it outlines the way the workload assessments process should be an,
an ideal assessment, which is more, which is more or less what happened
here in North Carolina. There was an advisory committee, there were time
studies, there were quality adjustments that were built into the
workload study. I mention this because on bench time for judges is
something that is talked about a lot around here, and that is included
in the time studies that, that the NCSC performed on, when, when they
did their studies of judges. So this is the type of work, the NCSC
workload formula is used in 25 states, has done assessments in 38
states, two territories, and they have had some results in other states
for changes in the way that they allocate personnel. This is a short
analysis of the clerk of court workload for the current year. There are
20, 2,629.6 authorized positions. There is a workload determined need of
2754, and essentially what&#39;s below that, and I&#39;ve tried to do
this for the different personnel we&#39;re gonna go through, because it
shows where the most need is and where the least need is. And so as you
can see I pulled, and then there are a couple of different ways of
cutting that. So you could say that by pure numbers, Wake county needs
the most clerks. They 38.2 according to the workload formula. That means
they are short that number of clerks. And then by percentages, they have
the, the, the lowest ratio there of workload to need, so they have 6
number of clerks to the x number of need and that is at 76.8%. Which as
you can see, Mecklenburg would be second by number, Onslow would be
second by their workload, need ratio, and then the table at the bottom
shows the least need. The ones that, the counties and districts that are
the most over in terms of clerks to what the workload formula would
have. As you can see on the left, it would be Vance by number. They have
4 clerks over their workload formula determined need, and on the right
it would be Northampton which is at 131% of their workload to need
ratio. There are 18 counties that need at least two clerks. There are
only four that have more than two over the workload formula, and that is
taking into account those with minimums, so there is a minimum number of
six clerks per county. This chart shows clerk personnel excluding the
elected clerks from 2008 to the present. This is in response to a
question that Representative McNeill had last time we met. He wanted to
see how personnel breaks down over time. We can go back to 2008 because
it was the data and ?? only goes back to 2008. I could have pulled a
couple more years, but I&#39;d probably still be working on that now. As
you can see the numbers have been fairly stable. The number now is very
close to the number in 2008. There was a bump in 2009 in the number of
clerks. I don&#39;t know why right now. I&#39;ve put out a question
asking why this is, but I do not know why there were three years where
there were about 100 more clerks than there are now. This is average
compensation back to 2008 for three levels of clerks, assistant clerk,
deputy clerk, and deputy clerk bookkeeper. This is again, fairly stable.
?? the magistrate workload, there are 674.6 authorized. There&#39;s a
current need, including a minimum of three per county

  Of 692.5. Without that minimum, there would, we would have enough
magistrates employed for the court system. We would be over workload
formula recommendation, but many counties feel like they need three,
sometimes four, because of geographic concerns. You can see the greatest
negatives in Mecklenburg, both by number and percentage and the least
negatives in Gaston by number which is two over, and Wilks by
percentage, which is at 145%. There are 12 counties that need at least
one magistrate. This is a combination of the number and the average
compensation, so the red bars follow the axis on the left. That is the
number of magistrates employed by the North Carolina court system or the
FDE. The line follows the axis on the right and that shows average
compensation over the last eight, eight years, which went up last year
because of some changes that y&#39;all put into the step plans, and
I&#39;ll go into that in just a second. I think most people in this room
are aware of the clerk and magistrate step plans and how they work. Just
to provide a little bit of basic information here, the clerks, increases
provided annually based on job performance. Magistrates are just
provided on the anniversary date. This shows the minimums and maximums
for both assistant clerks, who are the lieutenants of the clerk court
and the deputy clerks who are the worker bees and for the magistrates.
So the reason these step plans are of concern is that there were no
experience based steps provided in the budget from fiscal year 09, 10
until the last year. There was a 1.2% across the board increase in pay
provided to everybody in 12, 13 and, and the 2013 budget, there was
funding for a step for the clerks, ?? 3.6 million, and there was funding
for a step for the magistrates and an increase in their base pay, base
rate of pay and that was at 3.7 million. These decisions will be made by
the full chairs of appropriations. I just bring this up to provide the,
the information for this committee. And then finally, clerk and
magistrate turnover. For the deputy clerks, there is a 12% total
turnover in the last year. Of that, 10% was voluntary. That means 10%
were clerks that chose to leave instead of being forced out, and of
those, 3% were retired. So that is a 7% voluntary turnover rate. For
assistant clerks, it&#39;s much lower. There&#39;s a much higher
retirement rate. And for magistrates it&#39;s lower too. Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Do we ever do a comparison of personnel
turnover ?? private sector ?? like jobs with the private sector?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. I&#39;d have to go to the salary and benefits
team for that and they unfortunately could not be here today. But we can
get that answer and get it back to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question I have ?? increase in the small claims court. Has that done
any, has that increased the workload of small claims ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right here, so in the civil cases, district work civil cases have
actually gone down, and it&#39;s hard to extract from that. I&#39;m
sorry, thank you mister chair. It&#39;s, it&#39;s hard to extract from
that how much. Well, I&#39;m sorry, the small claims cases here have
been basically standard, have been stable over the last two years, and
here, the civil cases are kind of all wrapped all together in the
superior court. So it&#39;s hard to say how much of a, I&#39;m sorry,
it&#39;s hard to say how much of a shift has been evolved from that. I
actually, I don&#39;t know the answer to that. Can, can AOC provide, can
we ask AOC for a date?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely. ?? I don&#39;t know if you have

Speaker: . . . someone that can ask for this.
Speaker: Give us just a few minutes Mr. Chair.
Speaker: Alright we&#39;ll come back to you in just a sec.
[sil.] [muffled speech; inaudible]
Speaker: Oh, okay. Representative Graham?
Speaker: Which one?
Speaker: C before G.
Speaker: Age before beauty.
Speaker: I don&#39;t know, but that might be available. But go ahead.
Speaker: I don&#39;t think I need to &lt;??&gt; [00:34].
Speaker: My question . . . thank you, Mr. Chair . . . my question was
what&#39;s the minimum requirements for the clerks? The positions?
What&#39;s the minimum requirements for those positions?
Speaker: Thank you Mr. Chair. I think the minimum requirements are a
high school diploma. Is that correct? The clerks are nodding yes.
Speaker: So, okay. I&#39;ll return the same thing for the deputy as
well? A minimum? A high school diploma?
Speaker: For the deputy clerks, yes sir, and that&#39;s generally where
clerks will start. Assistant clerks may have, just depending on the
people applying, but there may be law degrees involved there. There is
usually more experience and more training involved in being an assistant
clerk.
Speaker: And clerks have to have a PhD in astrophysics. Judge?
Speaker: John Smith, Director of Administrative Office of the Courts,
the change in magistrate jurisdiction was October 2013. Their case loads
have been dropping fairly consistently over time and when that went into
effect we stabilized.
Speaker: Okay. Any? Yeah, it would have to. Thank you. Thank you,
Representative Jackson.
Speaker: A follow-up for Judge Smith. I was just wondering . . . my
understanding is that, that change of jurisdiction is actually optional
. . . to the Chief District Court Judge. So do we know how many have
chosen to increase the threshold and have how many have left it? And
what the previous &lt;?? : [02:17&gt;&gt;
Speaker: John Smith, Director of Administrative Office of the Courts.
Initially when I met with the Chief District Court Judges it was about
50-50, but now up it&#39;s about two-thirds. Most of the Chief District
Court Judges are finding that . . .  &lt;?? 02:37&gt; . . . across the
state is a compelling reason to . . . &lt;?? 02:40&gt;&gt;.
Speaker: Okay. Follow-up.
Speaker: Thank, thank you.
Speaker: Certainly.
Speaker: And would there be any analysis of how the trends and filings
compares to county&#39;s who have increased the jurisdictional level
versus the county&#39;s that haven&#39;t?
Speaker: John Smith, Director of Administrative Office of the Courts, we
have not done that analysis. We could do that analysis if we could work
the. . . &lt;??&gt;.
Speaker: Any follow up?
Speaker: No.
Speaker: Okay. Representative Graham, George.
Speaker: [?? Inaudible]
Speaker: Thank you, Mr. Chair. The turnover for the clerks . . .
yah&#39;l passed a special provision last year that allows clerks to
keep their salary reserve and use that for, for raises within the clerks
offices up to the point of a step. They can&#39;t actually get a full
step, but they can approach a full step. So the salary reserve is
actually kept within the clerk&#39;s offices right now and in terms of
left salary that is used by AOC to help with operating budget concerns.
Speaker: [?? Inaudible]
Speaker: That is . . . the salary reserve . . . the new provision is
limiting the amount that AOC can use for their operating budget in the
current year. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s creating a fund balance; I
believe it&#39;s being used.
Speaker: [?? Inaudible]
Speaker: In &lt;??&gt; lap salary &lt;??&gt; . . . I was talking about,
about . . . yeah.
Speaker: Does that complete your . . . ?
Speaker: Sorry, sorry.

Randleman.

  Speaker: Can I get the workload assessment? I may be getting ahead of
where we are but a few years ago we had the &lt;&lt;?? risk&gt;&gt;. So,
how was &lt;??&gt;risk considered in the workloads assessment?
Speaker: I-, I&#39;m sorry. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think
that these, I think the risk came after the workload assessment, so
I&#39;m not sure if-, I&#39;m not sure exactly how AOC allocated that
risk. I think I have to turn to AOC for that.
Speaker: &lt;&lt;??&gt;&gt; . . .  Chauncey. The Director of the
Administrative Office of the Courts. Until the budget cuts required us
to eliminate people the workload formula had always been used as a tool
for need. That is how many positions do you need? When the budget cut
came, we needed some tool to determine where the elimination of
positions would do the least damage. So using the workload formula in
reverse was a new thing and in fact violated some promises and
representations that had been made about how the workload formula would
be used when they agreed to do the work studies to develop them. When
the compelling cuts came and we began negotiating with the conferences
and looking at how to address the cuts, it appeared that the workload
formula was the best tool to determine where the position loses would
have the least impact. Nobody wanted to lose positions; there&#39;s some
skepticism about how accurate the workload formula is. It&#39;s a good
tool for determining the relevant need, the relative needs, but whether
it can determine your absolute need is an open question. So what the
tool that we chose to use was the workload formulas for each group, so.
In, before 2008 the General Assembly had given us 500 positions, new
positions based on our needs using the workload formulas to some degree,
but all of those added positions were lost and that&#39;s the
explanation for that sudden drop in positions. When we did that, we
identified where the cuts would have the least impact. Those that were
over one-hundred percent on the workload formula all lost positions.
I&#39;m sure the Clerks can tell you about the impact of that. The
workload formula showed they were over one-hundred percent; their
perceptions were that they were not over one-hundred percent. So, after
we eliminated close to 600 positions using the workload formulas, we
recomputed. So the present workload formula charts show the revised
numbers based on the positions, the new number of positions after
subtracting out the ones that were lost.
Speaker: Senator Randleman, does that answer you?
Speaker: Yes.
Speaker: Good. Okay, let&#39;s see. We had . . . Representative Harley,
do you have a question?
Speaker: Yes.
Speaker: Go ahead.
Speaker: ?? [3:23 -- Can&#39;t hear; someone is talking over her in the
foreground].
Speaker: Yes, ma&#39;am. I&#39;m sorry. Thank you Mr. Chair. Yes,
ma&#39;am. Again. I&#39;d have to go back to my salaries and benefits
team to do that, but yes ma&#39;am there is a way to break that down.
Speaker: Did you have a follow-up? Is that . . . ? Okay, any other
questions before we move on? Okay. &lt;&lt;?? 3:44&gt;&gt; See and done
&lt;&lt;??&gt;
Speaker: Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, this is . . . I&#39;m using this map
as a guidepost that we are returning to the district court districts
from the county level positions. This is a breakdown of the current
district judge workload. It shows the most need being in Gilford County
by number and Cabbarus by ratio. This also shows the least need by
number at 1.1. There is only one district that is more than one FDE over
the workload formula over one hundred percent and that is district 9,
9B. Out of 41 district court districts there are 14 that have a need of
at least one judge when rounded. And . . . district court staff
workload, this shows need. There is, there is no, no district court
district staff, district where staff has at least one FTE, one full FTE
of need over the . . . [end transcript].

  <p id="25:00">
  I work with a formula. According you going to Superior Court, the
Superior Court Judge workload was based on a report called the Judicial
Workload Assessment from 2011. At the time we found the need for 11
Superior Court Judges. Key points from the quality adjustment, which is
one of the essential measures that NCSC found during judicial workload
assessments. Judges, one more time for administrative work,
drafting/reviewing orders, they felt that pre-trial conferences led to
deficiencies. Calendar practices in North Carolina do effect judicial
time and the time study, as I said, did include the bench time similar
to other states that did this type of assessment. Current Superior Judge
workload finds a need of 102.7 or 103 Superior Court Judges. However, if
you add in the districts that are slightly over tend to discounted, or
the divisions that are slightly over tend to get discounted. So, the
full need right now is 106.3, this has dropped a lot since 2011 when it
was 112, so the number of judges predicted by the Superior Judge
Workload need is following the number of dispositions going down,
basically. Superior staff workload typically you&#39;re talking about a
one to two ration of two judges to one staff. So, there were a lot of
districts that needed 1 FT, and there are about 14 that needed 1 FT and
10 that had at least .5 over the workload formula. I can get you those
numbers if you need them, or actually they&#39;re also available online.
I put the workload formulas on the folder for this committee. Turning to
proprietorial districts, current district attorney staff need, by number
then by percentage, filtered needs people. This is measuring ADA&#39;s
and victim, witness legal assistance only. So, not investigators, not
the elected DA, not any other staff that work for district attorney
offices. You&#39;ll not on the number over at the bottom that
Mecklenburg is very high, that is because these are not state position,
Mecklenburg has a lot of grant funded positions that are paid for by the
local government, and so this shows a breakdown of state funded versus
grant funded positions, and who of the ADA&#39;s and that grant funded
47 positions are in Mecklenburg, and are funded by the local government
there. This is a chart of DA personnel to the present. This is only
ADA&#39;s and victim, witness legal assistance going back to 2008. This
is the corresponding compensation chart, and that&#39;s what I have on
the workload. I do have a presentation on the administration of
technology that I wasn&#39;t sure we&#39;d be able to get to.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay, lets see first off if we have any questions on what we&#39;ve gone
over up to now. Okay, Representative Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess this is due to my ?? course. Senator
Jackson could respond as well, what particular areas are those, that
extra DA&#39;s in Mecklenburg County funded to do? I mean, are there
special courts or things like of that nature?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I don&#39;t know the particulars. I know that, generally, I do know the
locals have kicked in a lot so that they&#39;ll have a lot of ADA&#39;s
there, but I don&#39;t know the specifics of what they do in
Mecklenburg.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. They tend to be entry level positions but they also have
special positions for some special fields like DV, domestic violence.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay. Representative Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
And, is the fact that they have so many DA&#39;s that the workload is
that ?? in the workload formula&#39;s on the magistrates and the clerks
shortage that they show? I mean, can we address one part of it and not
the other two, and the state maybe needs to step in and address that?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Let me see who can answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay, we&#39;ll have to kick that back to [?]

  ?? by the… is that the county or the state? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chair. That would be by the county. That would be by the local
government. They would be giving money to AOC in terms of receipts
designated for that employee, so it would not be appearing as a general
fund personnel, essentially. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Certainly. Go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think the Superior Court judge is not involved
in this. This wouldn’t be Superior Court judge. There might be some
judicial staff, so the judge would… probably I think in Mecklenburg, the
judge would delegate that authority to the Trial Court administrator who
then receives that staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Graham, does
that answer your question? [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Not really. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Do you want to try again, or do you want me to get somebody
else to…? What suits you? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? I’m seeing the
relationship between the Superior Court and the ?? come into being and
who makes ?? who allocates the money, who does the ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? sitting in the gallery. Can she speak to this? [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Absolutely. ??, stand up and help yourself. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
District Attorney. Is the question the relationship between the Superior
Court judges and the District Attorney? I’m not sure I understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The locally funded. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The locally
funded. The Superior Court judges don’t have any responsibility to the
District Attorney. This is DA’s office, so no judge will be presiding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator… [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? The first district to do
this was Mecklenburg County, and that was started by Peter Gilchrist
back when he was the District Attorney, and as I understand it,
Mecklenburg County decided to address the underfunding of the court
system, and therefore they wanted to make sure that Mecklenburg County
had what they felt was an appropriate number, and that’s when that
started. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Graham, does that…?
Representative McNeill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does Mecklenburg County have
any locally-funded clerks’ positions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Judge Smith.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Administrative Office of the Courts, yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Do you have a follow-up, Representative? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do
we know how many? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If we don’t, we will, so anyway…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Six. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Six. [SPEAKER CHANGES] any
further questions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I’m
sorry, Representative Graham. I misunderstood your question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Could we hear from someone…? I know in some cases, the
locally-funded positions arise not out of a concern by local government
for the budget situation, but out of concern for a specific program,
like a drug program or a domestic violence. I wonder if that’s true for
any of these positions thatr you have added by local government,
specifically ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t know. Let’s see if we can get
an answer. William, is that something…? You tell me. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that is correct because that’s the
origin of the new positions, is the… I think Senator Jackson testified
they generally came in as domestic violence or specifically focused on a
particular program when the first grant-funded positions came in, but I
believe that their role has expanded as the need has expanded too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you think we could talk about those treatment
courts? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The drug treatment courts. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The drug treatment court and veterans’ court and that kind of thing?
William’s going to cover the specialty courts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Jackson, did you want to add to this?

I will cover the specialty courts in the future. A lot, some of the
smaller specialty courts they are covered by the elected DA will
generally sit in on those courts or they&#39;ll send somebody, or
he&#39;ll send his top ADA&#39;s down to cover that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The second presentation in your packet is on administration and
technology.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Because, we went through the AOC budget by program we ?? off
administration before, and so we&#39;ll get into that a little bit. Its
$42.2 million in the current year with 9% of the AOC budget. Almost $3
million of that is a negative reserve, or was at least as of December
31st, so that is money that has yet to be distributed around it. Again,
it appears as a positive on my pie chart and yet it is a negative
number. The other point I want to bring here is that technology services
make up a very large part of AOC administration at 64%, between the
technology services division and the infrastructure fund. The chart of
AOC&#39;s organization, or chart for current year, from the previous pie
chart the purely administrative functions make up 34 FTE and about $4.4
million in the general fund budget in the current year. That is before
the negative reserve, so all the numbers have to take in account that $3
million will be taken from somewhere. This includes the AOC director,
and senior deputy director, communications, budget management, legal
services, and the organizational development who do most of the
excellent analysis that we use on fiscal notes and on workload formulas.
AOC court programs and AOC court services, these are two separate
programs oversees, basically specialty courts and specialty programs out
in the field the total budget of $740 thousand in the current year.
Court services is mostly about record keeping and judicial forms, 27 FTE
and $2.4 million in the current year. AOC financial services and human
resources. Financial services conduct financial services for the entire
judicial branch that&#39;s payroll, collections, invoicing they are 29
FTE, $2.9 million in the current year. Human resources does a chart for
the entire branch, so 27 FTE, $1.8 million. Purchasing services
don&#39;t just . . .  They do purchasing for the entire judicial branch
and they also run the AOC print shop, the AOC warehouse and the online
supply store, it is a huge operation. They administer the two
infrastructure funds that were one single purchasing fund until the
beginning of last year when it was split into two parts to show the
technology and the non-technology expenditures is $2.5 million to run
the purchasing services, and as you can see how the different purchasing
funds work. Technology services, this is the big bite, they&#39;re
responsible for the technology needs of the entire court system, they
have 13 teams and this is how the FTE and that split up. Application and
development basically does software with 83 FTE. Infrastructure and
operations court, that&#39;s your help desk, that&#39;s the people that
come out and fix your computers, like the guy that came and turned on
our monitor earlier, it would be that type of role, 61 FTE for the
entire judicial branch. Then, project management, these are the people
doing the planning for the technology, that&#39;s 3 FTE, $15.9 million
in the current year. Turning to some of the details here. There are two
legacy systems that are the backbone of AOC technology, there&#39;s
ACIS, which is the automated criminal

  Speaker: &lt;??&gt; fraction system. Most people in this room probably
have some experience with ASIS. It is a green screen system. It is a
mainframe system. There&#39;s also FMS, the financial management
software, this is a legacy system that all of the bookkeepers in the
court system use to maintain all of the money that flows through the
court system. It is also ancient technology. Let&#39;s see. There we go.
That is the clerk&#39;s main menu right there in ASIS.
Speaker: ??
Speaker: When was this implimented?
Speaker: I&#39;m glad you asked that sir. Turning to the next page if we
can, there we go. Oh, actually. There we go. First implimented in 1982
to track in fractions.
Speaker: Do we have anybody who can . . . ??
Speaker: He didn&#39;t; he didn&#39;t create the program.
Speaker: oh god.
Speaker: Did you create the program?
Speaker: I was born in 1982.
Speaker: And their point is.
Speaker: Well for you to be able to work on it you is awfully smart, but
anyway.
Speaker: Mr. Chair can I speak to it?
Speaker: Absolutely, go ahead.
Speaker: It is a true nightmare and as a prosecutor I had to spend hours
on this thing every single day and you hit one wrong key and you get
locked out of the whole thing. You gotta start over from the beginning
and it is the very definition of bottleneck when it comes to
efficiencies in the courthouse. And all criminal records run through
that. Any time a prosecutor is trying to check up on anybody you have to
use this program and it is just the worst.
Speaker: Well, thank you so much Senator Jackson. That&#39;s a testament
to the appropriate&#39;s chair.
Speaker: &lt;??&gt; When I started six years ago, I heard this was being
worked on. In true government form, how much longer? How much money have
we already invested in trying to fix this?
Speaker: Judge Smith, are you . . . ? Now I&#39;m starting to get a
taste of what headaches you do have.
Speaker: John Smith, Director of the Administrative Office of the
Courts. I came six years ago as well and of course ever since I&#39;ve
been here it has been budget cuts rather than investments. I hired John
Williams as my Senior Deputy Director with instructions to work on
technology; try to get this. Then I hired Jeff Meresik. Both of them are
here; if you&#39;d like any detail I will turn it over to them.
Speaker: I would like to know how much money we&#39;ve already invested
into a system that has not come through.
Speaker: The maintenance . . . ?
Speaker: I&#39;m talking about research and development not maintenance.
Speaker: We can provide details . . .
Speaker I&#39;m talking about research and development not maintenance.
Speaker: We can provide details about what it&#39;s cost and what
it&#39;s current maintenance is. The problem is that it costs more than
the appropriated amount to maintain this system, with no cushion, to do
much development. However, that being said, I think Jeff Merisik has
come up with a number of plans that if put into place, that we are
working on, the clerk&#39;s system is already a bit more advanced. The
learning curve is high on these things, but it&#39;s much more graphical
and it&#39;s much more of a type of interface that you&#39;d expect out
of the web but that&#39;s just limited to a very narrow part of the
clerk&#39;s program. If you&#39;d permit me, I&#39;d like for Jeff to
speak on this because it&#39;s been his primary goal to get us out of
green screen technology and into web based graphic interfaces. If the
chair would be willing to do that, I&#39;d rather he speak rather than
me try to summarize his words.
Speaker: Okay, listen. William is gonna have something a little later on
this, but let&#39;s just go ahead and while you&#39;re here and this is
fresh on everybody&#39;s mind and what Senator Jackson has just
mentioned let&#39;s see, if you don&#39;t mind, and give us a prediction
of what&#39;s in store for us.

  <p id="50:00">
  Let me get you a microphone, because I&#39;m sure everybody wants to
hear you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Again, my name is Jeff Marecic, chief information
officer for the administrative office for the courts. In a few slides,
Mr. Childs will demonstrate some of the technology that is replacing
ACIS, so ACIS, as we all know, is, is a very old system, and we&#39;ve
been in the process of replacing it over the last eight or so years. The
systems that are replacing it are called CCIS CC for the clerk&#39;s
component, and CCIS DA for the district attorney&#39;s component, and
we&#39;re beginning to launch yet another system to replace public
offenders component of it as well. All of them are newer technology. All
of them are built with graphical user interfaces as judge smith has
pointed out. One of the issues I, I don&#39;t have at the top of my head
how much we&#39;ve invested so far in replacing ACIS. However, I do know
that one of the challenges that we&#39;ve had is that most of our
technology budget, 85 or more percent of it has, is allocated to
maintaining the current systems, the networks that we have, the systems
that we have, the PCs that we have in the field. As a matter of fact, we
have approximately 25,000 components, computers, PCs, routers,
telephones, all those sorts of things in field. And that takes up a
substantial portion of our budget, so in the 14 months now that I&#39;ve
been chief information officer for the courts, we have moved toward a
strategy of integrating the technologies that we have, meaning we are
selectively replacing components of ACIS so we can remove the green
screens. Many, some of the clerks in the room can talk about the recent
release that we did last year. We called it, we dubbed it CCIS release
5.5, which added a lot of new functionality to CCIS CC. It also allows
us to collect a lot more information. It allows us to navigate using a
better user interface, and it allows us to provide a lot more rapport.
Coming in next couple months, within the next two months or so, three
perhaps, we will be replacing another component of it that is our public
access terminals in our courthouses, so we&#39;ll have a better way for
the public to search and retrieve information. So the, the strategy that
we&#39;re using now is to identify through our, our governance process,
our planning process, the, the processes within the court system that
are slowing us down. That are inefficient, that are hampered by some of
this new technology and doing targeted replacements of those. We, we
projected last year or so that if we were to drop everything and begin
to replace ACIS, just focused on that, that would probably be a project
that was in the $15 million range, five or six years, which at the time
we didn&#39;t think feasible. So our approach now is to use technology
that we have, integrate it, replace important components of it as we
move along.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now, let&#39;s see if we have any questions for Jeff. Jeff, before,
before you get down. Okay. Senator McInnis. Okay, Representative
Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m not whether ?? we saw earlier in the DA offices. If we had, in
the next six months, we could replace the antiquated systems ?? what we
need, would that have an effect on the personnel need of the DA offices?
In other words, in case of an antiquated system ?? before staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My, my thought on that is yes. It is, it is having that, and

  <p id="55:00">
  There are a number of ways that we&#39;re beginning to approach
technology at the courts now. Instead of saying - and we&#39;re changing
the way we think about using technology. So instead of saying,
&quot;Let&#39;s replace Asus,&quot; we&#39;re asking the question,
&quot;What&#39;s causing lines in a courthouse? What&#39;s causing the
inefficiency?&quot; and then aligning our systems to fix those problems.
For example, we&#39;re currently doing some analysis on a project that
is designed to reduce lines in a courthouse due to traffic citations. So
we have a lot of folks coming to the traffic - coming to the courthouse
to dispose of their traffic citations. And many of those are dismissible
offenses, compliance-related offenses, that, once a proof of compliance
has been had, it can be handled electronically. And we&#39;re currently
looking at ways of adding that type of functionality into our systems so
that people can do that either online or from their homes. So once we do
that, the lines begin to go down, and then the VAs are positively
affected for - positively affected. And so we have a number of projects
just like that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you want to ask any other questions
along those lines? Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m
getting to you, okay? Representative Stevens. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. Are you aware that Forsythe County&#39;s on their implement of
assistance with that? And what does it take to - what does it cost them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know offhand. It was
very minimal cost. And that&#39;s actually the model that we&#39;ll be
using. We - we&#39;ll be using - we&#39;ll be taking the Forsythe model
and make it an enterprise-level solution so that we could pull that to
100 counties. It&#39;s one thing to do it on a one-county basis. My job
is to make sure that we can do it on a 100-county basis. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stevens, did you want to explain the Forsythe
County kind of overview of what we - or are you familiar with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I didn&#39;t believe it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] On our ?? Commission meeting. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Forsythe
County model is essentially - sorry, William Childs, fiscal research.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it was your chair, sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Forsythe County model, to my recollection, and Representative
Stevens can tell me if I&#39;m wrong, is a online system that was set up
by the court using the court&#39;s own funds outside of the system,
where she had agreement with the D.A. to - so that waivable offenses
could be entered online. The D.A. would have staff to review the
waivable offenses and waive them if they were indeed necessary. So there
is - I believe it is a fairly inexpensive system because she set it up
as an online database. But I think that Mr. ?? is correct in that
expanding that is going to take a little bit of thought because there
are so many different issues involved with getting different courts and
different D.A.s involved in that system. So [SPEAKER CHANGES] We just
tell them the big county ?? that ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sign with the big
county? Yes ma&#39;am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ve got several of the
questions. Look at - we&#39;ll start with Representative Boles. I think
I saw you first. You had a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] My question&#39;s
in the ?? I know that North Carolina&#39;s a unique state, but surely
we&#39;re not the only ones that had the problem ?? And our wait is very
systematic here ?? in our own or what other state ??. These states
develop their own ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, Representative Boles,
Jeff ??, Chief of Commission Officer, AOC. There are a lot of different
models out there. There are vendors that provide case management
systems. There are vendors that provide e-filing systems, and there are
vendors that create custom-developed code as well. And I think it&#39;s,
if we were to survey all the states and all the various court systems,
there&#39;s a even mix of all those type of solutions. We&#39;re unique
in

  <p id="60:00">
  ...somewhat unique in the sense that uh we are a unified system with a
hundred counties and our goal is to provide systems that will be
effective in the largest counties, the Wakes, the Mecklenburgs, those,
as well as the smallest counties and everything in between.  As you can
imagine, when you have such diverse populations and resources pools,
there’s a lot of different skill sets involved.
So our uniqueness or our, one of our challenges is that we develop
systems that could be used in any one of them, and there’s also
variations sometimes in some of the processes.  Therefore, our strategy
has been up until now to build our own systems because we could take
care of the various, local variations that we have, so we try to keep
that to a minimum, but nevertheless we recognize that it exists.
A lot of the off the shelf vendor-provided processes implement not only
the technology, but also a lot of the process that goes along with it,
which are very good for single jurisdictions or even several
jurisdictions, but we have many different ones.
And so our approach so far has been to have a mixture of off the shelf
capabilities, but we do a lot of custom development on our own.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Boles, you have the followup.
Okay, just one second.  I’ve got Representative McNeill and then William
wants to make a comment and I’ll come back to you, Representative ??,
okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to say, and maybe this is a shameless plug, but I’ve got a
bill that’s almost finished that I’ll be filing hopefully this week that
will deal with the online compliance ?? taking about today that I think
?? has done, and I think also Hugh Hanover has just started it, if
that’s not correct.  And I believe that the number I heard was $120 a
month, but if the clerk wants to speak to that, maybe you’ll allow her
to speak to that.  She has, I think, just just started doing that and
Hugh Hanover also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, if you would, give us your name for the record, etc.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jane Kennedy, ooh, Jane Kennedy, Superior Court of Hanover County.  I
have, I am very close to starting that, give credit to Susan Frye, who’s
the Clerk of Court in Forsyth County.  He started it and it’s a
compliance dismissal online to clarify what it is.  She has a gentleman
who works for her who is assistant clerk in her county by the name of
Bert Barber, who spearheaded this.  And what it is is she pays $12 a
month, $120, I believe, a year, and she has a website that the public
can go to.
The compliance dismissals are by statute something that the DA would
have to dismiss.  Your no, no operators license, no registration, your
inspections, those kind of matters, so when somebody, when John Q Public
gets stopped and he or she gets charged with these matters, then they
can go to a website, to a link the officer gives them a copy of the
ticket and copy of the website, says you can go to this once you get it
fixed.  They take a picture of the compliance that they’ve done, the
inspection, the registration.
They send it in to a DA, to a person in the district attorney’s office,
and that link, that request goes to that person’s district attorney’s
office.  The district attorney gets that link and that picture and they
either approve or it or deny it.  They send it to another email that is
in the clerk’s office that says that it’s been approved and it’s been
dismissed.  And the clerk prints it out, puts it into the shut, keys in
the dismissal and the public never has to come to the courthouse.  And
it’s dismissed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very, thank you very much for coming and testifying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
 Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want, I want to followup by saying I hope you’ll support the bill
once I file it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it’s certainly, I don’t see anybody not supporting that bill, but
anyway, let’s see what Senator Jackson says.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we passed that bill it would have saved me several hours every week.
Multiply that across the entire state, that’s a huge cost savings.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well that’s pleasing to hear.  Let’s see, let’s get the rest of our
questions in.  Representative Dobson, you have a question?

[speaker Changes] Thank you Representative [??] Let’s see, William , do
you have a comment, then we will go back to Geoff.
[speaker Changes] yes sir. I just to want to mention, Mr . Moricik was
talking about other unified systems, unified  court systems out there.
There are about 25 other states that have unified systems. But there is
a lot of  variation in what they mean by that. And very few have the
systems that is quite like ours where they have put together in quite
the  same way  especially with regards to the court’s office. The other
point I want to make was that in the south, Alabama, Virginia, North
Carolina in the United states with unified system. So I just want to
provide a little bit of outside context to the question about how [??]
[Speaker Changes] Okay, Geoff, Just one minute . Senator Randleman, do
you have
[Speaker Changes] [??]
[Speaker Changes] Let me finish here, then we will get you in. And
unfortunately, we are going to reside the committee. And so we are going
to have to shut it down in a couple of minutes. We don’t try to between
these questions and it has been very encouraging to hear about things
that have been brought forward . Representative Evelyn, we appreciate
what you have been doing and all the comments with the people. And so we
have got , it looks like we are moving in a wonderful direction. So,
Geoff, we are going to take your questions and got one another from
Senator Randleman and then we are done with our job.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Chair. Geoff Moricik CIO AFC. I just
wanted to follow up just a little bit  on the online complaints issue in
that sense as I have described, it is a very good system. The defendant
logs on to the system with a citation and enters their information
online. Takes a picture of their complaint document and emails  it in.
The difference between doing it that way and the way we contemplate
doing it for the enterprise is since all of that information is already
on the systems, so antiquated as this may be. We have the citation
number and all the information about the offence is there already. So
our version of this would allow us to, would allow the person to edit
their citation number bring up all the information about the offence
without even typing anything else and then with an agreement with DNV
for example, do a record check to say, Hey your driving license is
valid, your registration are valid, without passing or taking pictures
of documents, we would  know that and then we would send that
information to DAV’s office. So, one of the things for doing it for the
Huntington counties that’s the type of thing that we will be able to add
to it.

  Thank you, Mr. Chair. We can pick back up here with technology tomorrow.
I also plan to go through a presentation on how the court system is
financed, including court costs and where they go. That&#39;s what I
have in mind for tomorrow.
