The House will come to order. Members, please take your seats. Visitors,
please retire from the chamber. Members and visitors in the gallery,
please silence all cellular phones and electronic devices. The Sergeant
at Arms will close the doors. The prayer will be offered by
Representative Holley. Members and visitors in the gallery, please

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. First of all, I’d like to thank you, Lord. Thank you for
allowing all of us to wake up today and to be here, a day that you have
given us. I want to pray for our families, people that are very close to
each one of us individually. Pray for the soldiers that they continue to
protect us during hard times. Pray for our constituents as they are the
reason that we are here. And pray for each other that we live healthy
and are strong in this process. I want to offer a special prayer for
someone that I think highly of. One of your gifts that you gave to, to
us. No, not a minister. No, not a politician. But a woman, a normal
woman, a everyday woman, everybody’s woman, Maya Angelou. Pray for her
family and thank you, Lord, for bringing her into our lives to expound
your wisdom, virtue, civility, and grace that she has given us all. We
are here because we’ve been elected by our districts. But we are here to
represent all the people of North Carolina. Help us keep this in mind as
we make these decisions. Open our ears, mind, and hearts as we debate
the issues to make sure that first we do no harm. We have been given the
responsibility of being stewards of your Planet Earth, something that we
love, and we cherish, and we try to protect at all cost. As we make
decisions and decisions that will be made today, dear Lord, please, make
sure that we do it with a pure heart and with you in mind. Dear Lord,
let all our decisions be clean and made with civility, and love, and in
your spirit. In Jesus we pray. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag, of the United States of America.
And to the republic, for which it stands. One nation, under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

<p id="010:00">
This is a time sensitive matter, it affects a number of the things. One
of the things it also affects has to do with Moore County and the tax
issue there and with the US Open only days away it is indeed a time
sensitive bill. The bill has been thoroughly vetted, I think Chairman
Howard is prepared to present it on behalf of the finance committee and
Mr. Speaker I would ask the members to vote green on the motion to add
to today’s calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ladies and gentlemen just to call your attention, the
motion Representative Luebke objected to having this added to today’s
calendar without objection at some point we will take a vote on the
motion which requires a simple majority. Representative Luebke please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] First Mr. Speaker would Representative Moore yield for
a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Moore does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Moore you just said there was something
in the bill that was time sensitive for the US Open and my understanding
was that’s why we took up the bill last week that we did. The senate
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The bill is back from the senate with two unengrossed
amendments that need to be adopted as well as then a vote on a
concurrence at that point.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Luebke if you would indulge the Chair
that your question may be better directed to Representative Howard if
that’s okay. I think Representative Howard is prepared to provide an
explanation.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes, Representative Howard would you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir. Your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] My question is Representative Moore indicated that one
of the reasons we had to take up House Bill 1050 immediately, this is a
bill that was changed, and the senate members should know, was changed
in the senate and we’re having no opportunity whatsoever to hear the
bill. Typically on a bill like this it would go back to the finance
committee for a review and we in fact have no opportunity to know what
the senate has put in this bill that has changed it from what it was
when it left the house. Representative Howard has indicated to us that
she thought there would be some changes that could be then negotiated.
Now, today we are being asked to vote immediately on the bill so my
question Representative Howard is why today are we being asked to vote
on this bill when previously the discussion had indicated we would have
a chance to see the senate changes and debate the senate changes?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Luebke, give the opportunity I intend to fully
explain the three changes that the senate made to 1050 and you are
correct, we did use senate bill 241 as a backup provision for the
occupancy tax which does actually affect every event in the state in
North Carolina. The one that is the most time sensitive today as
Representative Moore explained is the US Open event which is right on us
and we do need to get that provision passed if we could today so the
governor can sign the bill hopefully this afternoon, but given the
opportunity Mr. Luebke I intend to give full explanation of the changes
that the senate made, of which they are not material changes so
therefore the bill does not really need to go back to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker too, speak on my objection?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Members of the house, we have bad procedure. We have a
bill coming over with no opportunity for us to read the bill, to study
the bill. The fact that we get an explanation right now is not
sufficient, it is not the same thing as having the bill come back,
giving us the opportunity to read the bill, to have some questions about
the bill. Having a bill come back without any consideration for us
members to participate is just wrong and members I would urge you to
vote against the motion to hear the bill today.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion, further debate? If not the question
before the house is the motion by Representative Moore to add the Senate
Committee Substitute to House Bill 1050 and its unengrossed amendments
to today’s calendar. All those in favor will vote aye. All those opposed
vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will let the machine
record the vote. Eighty having voted in the affirmative, thirty-five in
the negative. The motion passes, the Senate Committee Substitute for
House Bill 1050..</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill 1050,
Amendment to.
Senator Rucho moves to amend the bill on page 7, lines 9 through 25, by
rewriting the lines to read Amendment 6.
Senator Rucho moves to amend Amendment No. 2 on page 1, line 1, through
page 3, line 4, of the amendment by rewriting the lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard. Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To make a motion and debate that motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized for a motion and to debate the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, I would move
that we do concur to the Senate Committee Substitute with the
unengrossed movements number 2 and number 6 and to debate that motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. When the bill was sent over to
the Senate, I thought we had a good bill. As often happens, the Senate
put some touches on it and this pretty much what they do. It doesn't do
anything really harmful to the bill and doesn't really have a grave
impact.
There were three things that made some changes. The first being they
removed Section 8.4 and this is the section that would have exempted
from sales and use tax the 50% of the sales price of manufactured and
modular homes.
Secondly, it substantially changes part 12 under the Senate Substitute.
The local privilege tax authorized is repealed effective July 1, 2015
and the local privilege license tax authorized for 2014 is limited to
those businesses that have a physical location with that city's
jurisdiction.
And third, it removes part 11. That part would have reinstated the
ability of any school of medicine affiliated with the University of
North Carolina and the University of North Carolina Healthcare System to
be able use the set-off debt collection to collect unpaid bids.
Those are the three changes that the Senate made. Actually, the
amendment that was added, there were two amendments and the second
amendment is purely technical and it was just simply the way that the
second amendment was drafted.
That amendment number 6 was passed today. Number 6 provides that first
time farmers would have an opportunity to become certified and get a
sales tax exemption when they are starting into business for the first
time. And that's a good thing.
But again, none of the amendments are material. There is no reason that
the bill should go back to Finance because if I did believe it needed to
go back to Finance, I wouldn't ask you to concur without making that
move.
So I would ask that we vote to concur. I'll be glad to answer any
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Holly, please state your business.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to be counted as having voted no on the last
thing. I made...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady be recorded as having voted no on the motion.
Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] See if Representative Howard will yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For question, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, first of all. You talk about
these being minor changes but let's take just the one about modular
homes, which is not minor to people who are buying modular homes.
What we did in the House...</p>

<p id="020:00">
Bill is to cut that tax in half. Is that not true?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So the Senate restored it to a full tax. In other words, the Senate
increased taxes on modular homes compared to our bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well actually the original bill was 998 and that bill did not have this
provision in that bill. We were trying to get the exception which we
sent over to the Senate and they did not accept in this bill. However, I
believe given the time you will see that provision in the budget bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard we had a long debate in this chamber and a
considerable amount in the House Finance Committee over the fact that
local government cities were losing revenue as a consequence of this
bill. One of the things that the house did in its bill as a way of
helping the cities was to put a cap of $100 on each business.  Is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield? Lady yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is it also correct that the Senate changed that from $100 to 0?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s what they chose to do Representative ? and in looking at the
cities that choose to do an occupancy tax, it’s a very limited number of
cities that even implement the occupancy tax. The Senate just felt that
that was not anything that was going to be advantageous  to the
municipalities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, it is true that in defense of the House Bill 1050
when it was on this floor, that you and others indicated that the $100
privilege tax was a good idea. Is that not correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will felt that it was a good option. Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mrs. Speaker to speak on the.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman recognize to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the house just look at the two items that I mentioned. The
modular home tax, sales tax, cut in half by us restored to its full
amount by the Senate. No opportunity for us to debate. No opportunity
for us for the bill to go to conference so that it could be debated in
the conference. Secondly and more importantly, we had the debate over
the privilege tax. Along with a loss to revenue to local governments
because of the cutting of the privilege tax to $100. Now as
Representative Howard has acknowledged, the Senate has cut that out
altogether. So that in terms of the revenue coming from the $100 per
business, there’s now 0 revenue coming. So our cities are losing even
more and more importantly, we are about to adopt a bill that takes away
the revenue that was a part of our bill. We handed in our bill and there
was a consensus in this body that we should keep the $100 there. It is
wrong to have a bill come back not go to a conference committee where we
can debate the question of whether the cities should be able to have
$100 per business or nothing per business as the Senate did. It’s wrong
not to go to conference committee. It’s wrong to take it up right now. I
focused on just two changes in the bill that were important to us and I
urge you to vote no on the motion. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ? please state your.</p>

See if Representative Howard will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Howard does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Howard I want to be perfectly clear
about something on the Privilege License Tax, if we do not vote yes to
concur then the tax is done this year? If we vote yes to concur then the
municipalities  that do institute this tax have at least one more year
so isn’t the choice here cutting it off now or extending it for at least
another year?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To see if Representative Howard will yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you Representative
Howard. I thought I understood this provision and now after the two
dialogues I find myself maybe not so I know you can clarify again back
to the Privilege Tax. My first question, so I understand that what the
Senate did was repeal the unintended repeal from last time and said
we’re not going to deal with capping it until this year so whatever a
city’s Privilege Tax is for 2014 is going to be allowed and then we’re
going to end it all 2015 absent discussions and agreement in between
with one major change and that is the physical location limitation that
they’re putting on the cities. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] That is correct, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] So then absent an agreement later the zeroed out as
Representative Luebke says would happen in 2015 but would it be correct
to say there’s a hope that there will be negotiations between now and
2015 on some tier or other system that might come to fruition? Is that
at least the Chair’s goal?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] That would be an option, absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, one final question Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Can you tell us though with the, and thank you Mr.
Speaker, with the change the Senate made where they did place the
physical location limitation, what amount of revenue cities are losing
as an amount of that restriction?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] That would be rather hard to instantly calculate
Representative Glazier but I did just put a hand out on your desk and
that’s about the best calculation we could make on a short notion but we
did find, and many people have heard this discussed, and I don’t want to
call any particular city in mind, but I wills ay that there was one city
that has used this provision egregiously and we found that over nine
hundred Privilege License will be taxed in even foreign countries by
this particular city so when they begin to operate legally as they
should have been in all of the years gone by or under these new
guidelines, that will have some impact on the amount of tax that they
have been collecting, but in the opinion of everyone they should not be
reaching in to Vancouver British Columbia and taxing entities there.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. May I ask one last question Mr. Speaker on
the chart?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you Representative.
Looking at the chart in the last two columns I understand the second
from the right column that says fiscal year ’15-’16 repeal, that’s what
the cities’ would lose come that year if we don’t do anything and it
zeroed out. The column to the right, the far right that’s labeled
’15-’16 with HB998 and Amazon local impact, is the difference between
those two columns the 62 million and the 48 million approximately what
the cities will lose on the change the senate made on the change on
physical location?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Not exactly. Not exactly. Actually the far right column
’15-’16 998 and Amazon those are enhancements..</p>

<p id="030:00">
That the cities will receive under the Amazon Settlement and 998. Those
are new monies, legal monies that go to the cities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So my last question then, on the chart, and I'll... Truly the last
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Thank you, Representative. So the chart has a
number of pieces of information on it but one it doesn't have, there's
nothing that I can read that will tell me the change the Senate made on
physical location, exactly what the cities will lose. That's, that's not
on the chart.  Would that be accurate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. And we absolutely don't have all of those numbers. We know a
lot of the numbers that a lot of entities that are being taxed that
should not be.  But we do not have a calculated number on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Thank you, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stamm, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, I plan to vote to concur.  I would
like to express some thoughts about the third change that the Senate
made.  That is the leading a provision that this House has passed twice,
I believe unanimously. It's a, I believe, a $15 million dollar issue of
additional revenue to the State's institutions. Which means, of course
we have to give 'em less money if they have that $15 million. And it's
not taxes.  It's for money that is already determined to be owed by
people. And unlike other money, it's already collected. It's already in
our coffers.  It's already with the Department of Revenue and all we
need is just the authorization to get the money.  So the reason I
mention this, is that when the budget, the House budget comes back, I am
certainly hoping that we will capture that $15 million dollars for
whatever needs have the highest priority. And I would ask for anybody
who can fin--, I have asked a dozen senators myself, the rationale for
throwing that money away. And I have not gotten an answer at all much
less a coherent answer.  So if any of you can find the answer to that
question, I will give you a dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, does the Lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Representative Howard, thank you for yielding to
the question. And I heard you respond that you thought the Modular Home
Exemption that was taken out would be able to be put back in the Budget
Bill.  Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Lady yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And so you're asking us to vote for this or to concur with this on the
presumption that something that we considered in the House that got
removed
will have some percentage of possibility of being in the Budget Bill.
Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there some reason why if the Modular Home Exemption is expected to be
in the Budget Bill why we could not vote against this motion to concur
and push for the Local Privilege Tax Solution to be in the Budget Bill
and not vote on that today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, again I'm gonna go back to a very time-sensitive
provision that's in this bill. And each and every day, it was not the
fault of the members of Moore County and what happened down there. And
without being testy on the floor, I'm gonna tell a little bit of history
here. When the National Democrat Convention was coming to Charlotte
someone who did not have authority to do so posted a memo on the
Department of Revenue's website saying that folks did not have to
collect the source tax which is tied to the Occupancy Tax. And that was
in 2012.  Again we are trying to fix a mistake that was made over at the
Department of Revenue. And you can't hold that person accountable
because they are no longer there.</p>

<p id="035:00">
And how you would them accountable, I’m not even sure. But that’s what
happened and that’s what has brought the issue of the occupancy tax to
the front burner. We are just trying to repair that damage and this bill
is the vehicle that is designated to do that. And we’re trying to get it
passed as quickly as we can and get it sent over to the Governor to sign
this afternoon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaker on the motion Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman without objection rule 12D is suspended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentlemen ?? to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House.  It appears we’re
kind of being pushed up against the wall by the Senate again and we know
we tried to deal with the Moore county occupancy tax issue in a separate
stand-alone bill so this would not happen. So all of the work that the
House Finance Committee did in getting this matter straight; and the
work we did on the bill, is now being short circuited and we are not
being given an opportunity to really respond and provide the issues in
this bill that we talked about. The hope that’s laid out there is that
we’re going to rely on the Senate to treat us with respect. This time,
in the budget overall, since they put us in a vice on this bill. And I
don’t know, I’m not sure that confidence is justified. I don’t have any
percentage of success. We do know what happened with the Moore County
bill and I’d ask you to really think about whether or not we are just,
in fact, given away. The mobile home issue regarding that tax reduction
for them and whether or not we’re really giving away the privilege tax
issue as well because we find ourselves back in the same position. When
the budget comes and we’ll be asking this question again. So I would
recommend that you vote against the motion to concur. Let’s go ahead and
deal with this issue. If we have to have a finance committee meeting and
do that, let’s do that. And draw on the experience and intelligence of
all the members here. They’re on the finance committee and send this
back or not concur with it today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Howard a question. [LAUGHS]Friendly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and Representative Howard. Just for clarification
for myself and others. I was trying to scroll quickly. Did the Senate
keep in there on the vapor products Representative Fulghums amendment
that classified it as a tobacco product?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ?? please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would ask members please to vote no on this motion. The other day when
we had the debate on the impact on UNC hospitals and ECU hospitals. We
had a consensus I thought in this chamber. It’s a 15 million dollar loss
to UNC hospitals. We don’t need to be putting that kind of loss on any
health facility now with the Affordable Care Act rolling out. And so
many unanswered questions and additional expenses that are coming our
way as well as additional savings. So we need time to reconsider this
point especially. Also I had understood that there was some discussions
about replacing options or expanding options for local governments so
that they would have some other options in addition to the sales tax and
property tax to raise money for the local government. Our local
governments have very few revenue options. There are some that are
available to a few counties and a few cities. We could expand that list
and help offset the loss to our cities and counties. But this is not the
time. Passing this bill now will prevent us from doing that. So I hope
you vote no on this bill. It gives us an opportunity to fix this right
now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not the question before the House
is the motion to concur and the Senate Committee Substitute House Bill
1050 has amended. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The cleric
will open the vote.</p>

  <h3><audio src="audio/chunks/20140529_house_session.040.00.mp3" preload="none" controls></audio></h3>

<p> that that’s evident. So if we would prescreen I 'm not saying we not going to frack because I know that there’s enough numbers here to pass this bill but we can get it right for the communities that its going to impact. We can get it right by putting in some health assessments prior to the companies coming in that way we would have  a base line to look at if water contamination occurs, if air pollution occurs after the fracking and after the companies leave the site. I ask for your support on the amendment for the people of the state of NC in these communities because there are already several water leaks and water wells that people are drinking water from in at least five other states where fracking has taken place and these people have huge, huge health risks that go along with being within that thousnad feet. Water contamination has been found within less than 600 ft I put in the amendment the 1000ft. Please consider the amendment. Thank you.
[speaker change]
Rep. Hager please state your purpose.
[speaker change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Debate the amendment.
{speaker change}
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[speaker change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ms. Cunningham appreciate the amendment sent forward and I’d love to work with you on this. We got formative health and public house working on this also and I’d love to include some of your issues in to this. This goes far beyond some of the things we see or potentials that we see on the energy exploration issue. Right now with in the bill we’ve got presumptive liability for well testing before they drill then 6 month, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months would go within the bill. So this does, the bill as is in front of you, does deal with water issues. What i’d like to propose, I’d like to vote this bill down but work with Representative Cunningham and get her involved in the MEC and the division of public health and see if we can include some of the issues she has with in our MEC rules. 
[speaker change]
The chair believes the gentleman meant to say to vote the amendment down not the bill.
[speaker change]
I did sir. And I think I said energy exploration.
[speaker change]
Representative Cunningham please state your purpose.
[speaker change]
To speak a second time
[speaker change]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
[speaker change]
First of all I wanna  thank Representative Hager for those comments they were very kind and I’d love to work with you on that cuz I know that after they come in and drill or whatever they do to the land even after they leave and the gas is all gone then 50 to 100 years there's going to be an impact on that water on that environment and if we don’t have something in place for the next generation we don’t know what their capabilities for living a very quality of life in those environments and I appreciate that but I still ask for support on the amendment. Thank you
[speaker change]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?

[speaker change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of the house I’m asking that you support this amendment. The amendment basically is following the light and engine commission in last year’s set up the local government regulation study group that group came back with recommendations Oct 2013. What I’ve done is, what i hope is just streamline section 14 which is streamlined to the point that allows local ordinances to still be written and still be produced in their normal course of business. It allows them that opportunity. At this point in time with the way I read section 14

simply is putting language for savings banks, savings associations and
credit unions to comply with the same language that we did for banks,

when there's a joint account. Any one of the joint owners can pledge
that account as collateral for a loan and each of the other joint owners
are bound by that unless there is an agreement in writing prior to the
loan, prior to the pledge. Such a pledge binds those other joint owners
and survives the death of the one joint owner who pledged the
collateral. I know of no opposition, I'd be happy to answer any
questions, I appreciate your vote. Thank you.

to substantially increase their rates, 10 people, general members of the
public filed an objection.  As we reviewed it in the Administrative
Procedures Oversight Committee many of us decided we didn't like it and
we have proposed to disallow that rule, I would ask for your support in
that. I did hear from the Funeral Board Commission today, through their
lobbyist and he indicated they had no position because they were in the
process of switching  leadership anyway.  So I would ask for your
support to disallow fees to be increased. And I would certainly welcome

I must admit, when the representative stood up I was hoping that he would go ahead and call the question
******laughter*******
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and we had a good debate yesterday there’s a couple of things that I want to outline that we may have glossed over yesterday. Guys this bill sets up the next step it doesn’t make the next step it doesn’t determine the rules it doesn’t do the mining and energy commission’s job for them. It allows the folks who have studied this for two years going on three years by the time we get the rules- it allows them to do their job. It gives them some parameters to work on. Now, Representative Jordan this bill, you know, has some good things in it. I agree with you. The one is the exempt from the hardison amendment. We can have rules in here that are stricter than the federal government for energy exploration in north carolina. it has noticed to subservice owners, mineral owners rights. It says that you go from a felony to a misdemeanor if you knowingly and willingly divulge trade secrets. There are a lot of things in here, much has been made about when we’re going to approve the rules. For you guys, some of that clicked with me, makes me wonder why we didn’t put a rule approval out there. The reason is because the general assembly doesn’t approve rules from the executive branch and we have a process for disapproving the rules and that’s the process that is outlined in the bill. So all in all, this is a great bill, guys. Last night, representative Warren and some of the folks that were here last night, and it was about eleven o’ clock, and I happened to be looking through the internet, you know you can find anything on the internet, called great devil website Haliburton, and I looked at it and I’m sure Representative Harrison has been to that site several times, went on there and clicked on the map. Its a point and click, easy for us engineers to understand, and you click on pennsylvania, it pulls up and it says pennsylvania and here are the types of fluid that we use for energy, and one was water based so I just clicked on that. And I’ve got copies, I haven’t passed them out to you guys yet, but I will before this is overwith. It showed all the chemicals that are used and fluids and their percentages. Even further, you can click on the adobe symbol and you can get the msd sheet that I was telling you guys about yesterday. So I just searched MSDs. So david lewis should appreciate this, I’ve come up on Lillington North Carolina and the prison, and they have chrome cleaner there and guess what, they had a MSD sheet on it. It’s federal law to have your chemicals to know what’s on site and first responder roles on site. OSHA mandates that. So this issue with chemicals is a non-starter, it is not an issue. So with that Mr Speaker, I as for the forward passage of this bill.

[Speaker Change]

Ladies and gentlemen, it’s the intent of the chair to go to the amendments before we get back to debating the bill and I do have one question, I did have the deadline I think of 12:30 which we extended somewhat because I know we had some problems with staff. I think representative Harrison may have had an amendment she was working on. I’m aware of one that was also tied up that I think Representative Arp has asked to have sent forth but only with out objection because it came in.. but oh I’m sorry it was Representative Moffitt but it came in about 10 minutes after the deadline, if there’s not objection I will have that amendment heard.

[Speaker Change]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. What this bill is
simply doing is giving us the opportunity to keep our promise that was
made two years ago in this chamber. I know there are lots of things
people have passed out and people have talked about, but I for one was
here on that floor that night of that fatal vote for me. I've learned a
lot from that mistake and I hope that a lot of other people in here have
to. But, one thing about what we promised was that we would keep a
moratorium in place until the Mining Commission went through and
developed their roles and brought them back in October 2014, and its
only May of 2014. Then, at that point the legislator would look at those
roles and vote on them. What we are doing here today with sections 2 and
3 is that we are not honoring that commitment. We are bypassing, we are
diluting some of the language, but when we overturn that veto, we lifted
the ban on fracturing, we established the commission, we asked them to
set the roles. And, I'm repeating myself on purpose to come back in
October 2014, so that we could at that point, as a legislative body go
through those roles, so far 120, and vote on them. I know you have on
your desk where Governor Perdue supported fracking for the state. While
there was also what she said when she came out with her veto, and I
quote she said, &quot;Fracking can be done safely if you put in place
and have inspectors on the ground.&quot; That is what she had said in
her veto, she expressed that the bill quote, &quot;does not do enough to
ensure that adequate protections for our drinking water landowners,
county and municipal government, and health and safety of our families
will be in place before fracking begins. She has for, stated that she
thought this was something our state should look into and explore. We
had the study committee who was looking into that and then we came
along, in July, and lifted that ban and imposed a moratorium to continue
studying and going to appoint a commission. Some of you in here bought
into that. As Ben Franklin said, well done is better than well said.
There's been a lot of things said we're going to do even if we vote
today, but I will tell you what we will be doing if we don't support
this amendment. We are taking ourselves out of the equation of the final
approval. We are taking the administrative procedure act and we are
changing it just for this particular mining commission that will soon
become the Gas and Oil Commission for North Carolina. Are we ready to
move forward with this as a state? I don't think so. I don't think all
of the safeguards are in place and I know we're going to hear a lot
today, but I'm asking you today if you will vote for this amendment can
keep the promise we made to the citizens of this state and indeed to
members in this chamber, and myself being one. That vote was heard
around the world, I have the email saved for the step we took forward
and we made a promise, now lets stand up and stand for that promise that
we made, because the legislature-- I don't like to use members names on
the floor and I'm not today, but I'll tell you there are some websites
for members in here that have on there and they're members from a

Please stakes that no apartments will be issued until and unless the
general assembly takes additional legislative action to allow it. One of
the bill sponsors and that was in 2012 that was after the vote. One of
the bill sponsors also was quite are the same no gas drilling can take
place for at least two years until a safety provisions are in place and
approved by the State Legislator. So, what you are doing today by
allowing this bill to move forward without taking out the Section 2 and
3 and you are going back on what we all said and all sides of all we
will vote on the final rules. We just had an example of a disapproval
and that’s what you are gonna defend and say we have done and I know
that one of our representatives try to make that lift in the moratorium
a little easier but what we heard today on a disapproval role was
wonderful come by Parson support but what we have done now with the ADA
changes and that is, “We are not gonna have that opportunity. It’s quick
moving. It shortens the time for us to approve or disapproval rule.” So,
I’m asking you today and I will say further comments Mr. Speaker for
debating the bill but I ask for your support of this amendment.

Glazier is recognized to send forth a committee report. The amendment.
The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier moves amendment bill on page
18, line 47 by deleting the word “for” and substituting the following.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. Members, this is an amendment
and I hope it actually has got some consensus. Very briefly, toxic air
emissions have been our recurring problem for neighbors and fracking
operations in other states and the house recognized that back in 2012
and then Senate 820 EMC and later as well the Mining and Energy
Commission. Now, we’re asked to explore this area and based on
presentations from the state division of air quality, I believe that the
new federal rule will prohibit venting of gas to the atmosphere from any
wells. However, the federal rule doesn’t explicitly cover [wild cater]
exploratory and delineation wells. And so, there’s this gap that may
exist, we’re not completely sure in what EMC and MEC were trying to do
which is to make sure that the federal regulations applied to all of our
wells. What this does, is simply use the language of both EMC and MEC,
variance provisions and the federal rule to make sure that all the wells
are covered which was the intent back in 2012, but also the intent of
the MEC and EMC. I’ve talked to Representative Hager, I don’t think, but
I don’t know for sure that there’s opposition but I’ve also indicated if
there are any concerns, that we can certainly review the language on the
Senate side or do a technical correction but I think this is just
attempting to do whatever one thought was happening but there is this
potential gap language in the rule and I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, since last we talked, I’ve
done a little research on this and right now, I’m a big fan of ?? as I
said earlier ?? did have these rules or are completing these rules, have
draft rules in place and will come forth on January 1st 2015, these
rules. The MEC right now has draft rules that they’re looking at in
trying to determine this exact rule. So, therefore I would ask to vote
No on this amendment and one of the other issues that bothers me a
little bit and I’d have to talk to the ?? commission is the last
sentence about a ?? [fracturing] treatment is if a reduced emission
completion is not technically feasible then you don’t issue a permit.
That’s the thing we’ve got to deal with a little bit more [into] and
look at the technical side and, again, the MEC has draft rules. They’re
working on this now. So, again, I’d ask you to vote No on this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen, did the gentleman intend to
speak on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker and Thank You, Representative
??. I wasn’t going in as much detail because I thought that we were
headed a different way but since we aren’t and I think it’s important
for folks to know. So, all the wells whether you call them exploratory
or [wild cater] delineation wells or regular wells, all pose a threat
because they can vent directly to the air, using a flare which produces
the toxic emissions. The definitions that you see in this amendment are
taken straight from the federal rule. The EMC and MEC, I believe,
concluded that they wanted the federal rule to apply. I don’t think it
was clear that the federal rule exempted the [wild cater] exploratory
wells. The problem here is if we don’t fix the gap right now, the end
result is, the vast majority of the early wells will be designated those
specific types of wells and that creates a gap. So, if you are in favor
of control of toxic air emissions then you need to vote for this
amendment. If you think there are wells we ought to have that ought not
have toxic air emissions standards and limitations then you’d vote
against the amendment. There is nothing, obviously, if we pass this that
prohibits or the changes any language that was already in the variance
rule nor in the rules that everyone thought applied. So, if we have a
gap, it’s our own fault. If we don’t need this, then it’s obviously
amendable. There are certainly vehicles after discussion, like technical
corrections if it’s unneeded. But, at least from a numbers perspective,
it appears to make sure that we are not passing something that does not
have full control.</p>

<p id="075:00">
For the toxic air emissions, we need to this. Otherwise just understand
that we may be creating the 1st couple of wells or types of wells that
are open, would be specifically examed and I don't think anyone of us
want that. So there is no underhanded attempt to do anything or to
create any obstacle, it is simply to prevent the venting of toxic air
emission and make sure we have all of the wells. Whatever we are going
to call them, covered. EMC and MEC, I think, tried to do that and
hopefully they did but it seems pretty obvious there may be a gap and we
need to close it and we ought to vote for this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the amendment second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Guys you will see a lot of
amendments today that attempt to set the rules for the MEC. I was in the
impression that minority party wanted to slow this down not speak it up
and establish the rules now. I was under the impression that we needed
to let the experts handle this and not folks on this floor that are not
experts in it. So we have rules that are being drafted today, tomorrow,
for the next six months, next eight months that will come forward on
this issue. I'll tell you let the folks that handle it, handle it and
let's not do their job for them and not think we are the technical
people this fora calls engineers  ?? know that we don't know this stuff.
Rick knows more than probably most of the debaters on this floor.
Representative Caitlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So voters may be down again let the mining and energy
commission do their job and let's not predispose what their outcome will

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Member of the house, this is a
very straight forward amendment. It just adds a fifth point to what is
previously there in terms of things for the commission to take a look
at. This simply says that workers are the first to encounter the
chemicals in the fracking process. And it asks this that where they
live, their residence is be at least five hundred feet from any fracking
activity. It is straight forward, no tricks to it. It simply says,
protect the workers by making sure how the housing is 500 feet from any
activity. Urge the adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. To debate an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. This one, guys, it seems to be
a little innocuous but please don't fall into that trap. What this does
is it expands the footprint of which you have a drilling site. Sometimes
great ?? drill site looks like. If you want a house, folks now this
normally wouldn't happen but in this case it does, it would expand the
site you’d have to have more setbacks, you'd have to have more trees
cut, more dirt turned over and we get in some landowner issues and even
potentially some issues of how much land can you use to frack on or
excuse me to energy explore on. Old habits die hard don't you guess. So
be careful on what you read on this, it seems innocuous but it isn't
because it does expand the area which you need to do this energy
exploration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd please state your purpose.

Hager in terms of whether there is anything tricky about this amendment.
It may require as he indicated the cutdown of a few trees. Moving things
back a little bit. But imagine yourself working this kind of job with
the exposure to the chemicals that’s involved. All this says is that put
it back 500 feet. Put their housing back at least 500 feet from the
fracking activity. If it requires a few trees to be cut down, so be it.
But imagine yourself one of those workers. And I truly ask you, put
yourself in workers’ shoes, and support this amendment. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you for accommodating
my late catch. Members of the House, this amendment does two things. As
I acknowledged yesterday, it's a good thing that the bill affirmatively
disapproves of any disposal of waste water injecting into our
groundwater, but it still allows for the possibility of storage in open
waste pits and also into our surface water - discharging into our
surface water. So this amendment does two things: it prohibits the
disposal of treated waste into our surface waters, and also bans the
waste pits. With regard to the latter, our experience with the coal ash
ponds and their toxic soup should have taught us a lesson that we
probably don't want to have this toxic collection of fracking fluids
that contaminates and possibly contains radiation. In other states that
have had this open pit experience there have been dead animals and
illnesses associated with the open waste pits that's associated with
fracking. Our wastewater treatment plants as I understand it are not
equipped to handle the contaminants and toxins that come from fracking
wastewater. And I appreciate Representative Hager's comment about the
disclosure of the chemicals, Halliburton or other of these fracking
industries might be disclosing voluntarily, there is no requirement that
they do. So we don't know what these chemicals are in this fracking
fluid that the wastewater treatment plants are supposed to be cleaning
before they discharge that into our surface waters. I also would like to
respond to Representative Hager's comment about the fact that we ought
to let the MEC do this: I think the MEC...</p>

educated on this particular issue, and if this body feels that it's
important that we not allow waste water to be kept in open waste pits,
then we ought to make that policy directive to the EMC and just decide
here as a chamber that we don't think that's going to be a good
practice. There are public health consequences associated with this
highly contaminated water, so I urge your support.

following.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, this amendment seeks to give the House members, the people who
were elected here, the responsibility for really recognizing what is
being used in the fracking process. And one of the things that we are
concerned about are prohibited substances. Things that may prove to be
radioactive. Things like asbestos. Materials that are used to increase
the viscosity of the pumping process for this fracking process. So
really all this amendment seeks to do is to be clear about the materials
that should not be allowed in this process, or to at least account for
those materials that will be used by the companies who are engaged in
fracking in North Caroline. One of the interesting things to note about
some of the brands of drilling muds that are used in this process, one
who's brand name is Flurisol and then another one called Visbestos.
Those are two materials that are frequently used that are really, that
have the potential for harming not only the people who are working in
the process, but then has the potential for harming their families. Some
oilfield workers, for example, in the Pennsylvania mining were heard to
have said that they remember using a     flaky white additive that came
in 50 pound bags, and they mixed this asbestos into the drilling mud
without any breathing or safety equipment. And they then in turn could
also expose their spouses, their children, their families, to the same
material. And I guess what I'm saying to the body is that we, as elected
representatives, ought to take responsibility for protecting our
citizens from things that we know already to be harmful. Things like
radiation. Things like asbestos. And so I really urge your support of
this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman's recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is another one of those issues, if you look at
number one on the prohibited substance activities, MEC ??? already has
this list. They are already working on it and has a draft rule already.
Number 2 is clearly an issue that DHHS already has rules and regulations
again. Yet we see this body trying to do things that the experts need to
be doing. DHHS</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Similar to the concerns that
Representative Carney had about the administrative procedure act. I had
a number of those concerns yesterday as well and prepare this amendment
to remove those changes but after looking further into this issue in
great detail, I am satisfied that we are not trying to fast-track, we
are trying to prevent flip dragging which could come up next year in the
session. Based on when these rules come out and at this point I would
like to withdraw this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment is hereby withdrawn. Representative
Martin, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative G Martin moves to amend the bill on
page 13, lines 31 and 32 by rewriting those lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. Members, this is one
of those amendment when you look at the text. It’s not really apparent
what it deals with. So, I’ll tell you upfront, this deals with the issue
which is called forced pooling. And to explain to you briefly what that
is, when you go into frack, you establish what are called drilling
units. That's a collection of property which I'd gonna feed in
essentially to a well to drill. We've got a North Carolina law of
provision that deals with this and let me read to you what it's says.
When two or more separately owned tracks of land are embraced within an
established drilling unit. The owners, they may agree ?? to integrate
the interest and develop their lands as a drilling unit. Sounds good so
far. Landowners break out on a shared verse of Kum ba yah, but that law
continues where however such owners have not agreed to integrate their
interest. The commission shall for the ?? of waste or to avoid drilling
of unnecessary wells require such owners to do so and to develop their
land as a drilling unit. That's what force pooling is, ladies and
gentlemen. Now most States actually do have some provision for forced
pooling but it is something that is absolutely not necessary to engage
in fracking. So even if you are a fracking supporter, North Carolina can
move ahead with fracking even if we don't have forced pooling. In fact,
in Pennsylvania and West Virginia believe that they don't have force
pooling for fracking. Now some folks will say when we do our rules or if
we were to even do something crazy like put it in the statute, that you
can set a half threshold, say 90%. Owners of 90% of the land have to
agree before you can actually force the owners that remaining 10% into a
force pool. That sounds like it's almost fair, unless you’re one of the
10% that's gonna have the government tell you that you’ve gotta engage
in this. But when you apply that 90% threshold say, I actually owned to
a map on the ground in place like Lee County. You find that it's
possible that up to 55% of land owners there may actually be forced into
a drilling unit and I would like to think that's not a result that
anyone of us would like to see in North Carolina. So in the end this
amendment here is not whether you support or oppose fracking. I think
I’ve made my opposition to it clear. This amendment though is about
whether or not you think the government should be able to come in and
force North Carolina land owners into a forced pool and participate in
fracking. I’d urge you to support this amendment.</p>

Representative Hager please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Guys, Representative Martin was
exactly right. This does remove the law on the books from the 1940s of
compulsory pooling. That may sound all great but I’m going to tell you
the end with that is a due process in how you ??? in that 1940s law.
That 1940s law is decent but it will be changed greatly and that is
going to be the basis of which we work. There’s a due process in there,
there’s a way to go about how you do it, and it’s an insurance policy.
Many of you and I have talked about this. When this law was built,
energy exploration, horizontal drilling, those things weren’t thought
of, it didn’t come until about 1947, 1949 in Texas. Two and a half
million wells across the world have been done this way and what this
does is this assures that if you’re in that area and when they frack,
they basically break the rock and the gas comes out, that you’re assured
that you’ll get paid for the gas if you’re the mineral rights owner
which most folks who are surface rights owners are mineral rights
owners. So again and DENR has said ‘listen we need to study this’. You
look at the end of the bill, there’s a study for forced pooling in
determining what we want to do with the law we have now, how do we want
to modify it, what do we want to do with it. All this amendment does is
reset DENR on those issues so that we have to start over. We have to say
okay we don’t have anything to build from, we don’t have anything to
look at, we don’t have any history here. So because of that this would
greatly set back, the bill we’re talking about today, has got a study
involved in it. DENR’s ahead of it, they’re looking at it right now and
we’re looking at what’s happening in other states so I would urge you to
vote no on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Jackson please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, every
session that I have been here we always hear an imminent domain bill and
it’s in a response to a decision in the United State Supreme Court
called KILO. This bill forced pooling does exactly what most of you sign
up every year and say you’re against. We are allowing a private owner of
a drilling company to come in and forcibly take someone else’s property.
That’s what forced pooling is. If there’s someone who has property and
they think gas is too cheap now, it’s $2 per cubic foot or whatever, in
ten years from now it might be $20 per cubit foot and they want to hold
out and wait. This bill says no, we’re going to let that gas company as
long as 90% of your neighbors, or whatever percentage we decide, around
you. We’re going to let them take your private property rights. That’s
what would be allowed to do under forced pooling. To me it’s just
imminent domain, it’s just another type of condemnation except this
isn’t even for the public use, this is for a private company. I’d ask
you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stam please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I would refute the argument that this is akin to what
Representative Jackson said. Think of this as a river. We had the same
discussion three years ago if you’ll recall. You may own the river but
if that water goes off your land, you don’t own the water that went off
your land. What forced pooling does is allows because of the pressure
from the extraction of gas on person A’s property, the gas moves to
person A’s property from person B. That is no longer the property of the
owner of B because it’s not under the land anymore, but what forced
pooling does is to give B some of the money from it so it’s an advantage
to the person who is force pooled.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Torbett please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. For an inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Would it be an appropriate time to record a vote at

[Speaker Change]
Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Change]
Yes, sir.
[Speaker Change]
To change my vote, I mean, to speak a second time on it.
[Speaker Change]
Did you also mean to debate the second time.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The gentleman from Rutherford talked
about the due process thats built into the process to force people into
pools. Ladies and gentlemen what sort of process would be acceptable to
you, to have an out of state corporation come in and ask the North
Carolina state government to force you to participate in that. I can't
think of anything that would be appropriate, that I would feel like I
had gotten due process and had been treated fairly by the government and
by the corporation. So, if that offends you like it does me, I hope you
will in fact support this amendment. The gentlemen from State
Representative Stan, talked about how this is necessary, because of the
nature of fracking. Of course when I asked him how he did fracking back
in the time of the Norman invasion and the Magna Carta, a few centuries
later. But, again let me point out that whether you think what's going
on in Pennsylvania is an absolute disaster or you think its been an
economic boom, the point is those states are doing it without forced
pulling. If you want to move forward with fracking I think North
Carolina can move forward without doing forced pulling also, just like
Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Indiana, what it boils down to is if you
don't want out of state corporations to be able to come in and get the
North Carolina government to force you to participate in this, you'll
vote for this amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Stone state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
Speak on the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
The gentlemen is recognized to speak on the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, we realize how
controversial this issue really is. If you look back at what happened
with the mining distribution in [inaudible], they've came forward with
several recommendations. At one time they were looking at 95%
participation, or 90% participation and that was only 50% of the land
owners. Look at what happened in Pennsylvania, which you spoke of where
there's no forced pulling, but if you look at other states where they do
a grid system. So, it is not one size fits all. Over the last three
years, we looked at it and tried to come up with something where we
could get everyone to the table to agree on. What we did agree with is
that it needs to be studied more, it needs to come back with a
recommendation that one size will work and that we can do drilling in a
safe way. So, I would recommend that we do support this amendment and
move forward. Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
To debate the amendment, please.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The definition has been said, but I think a good
definition of compulsory pooling is that it simply allows a company once
it is signed a number of landowners to leases, to force neighboring
landowners against their wishes to be on board as well. As good a
definition as I have seen. Although we have heard on the floor that we
are going to study this, we all know it is impossible for both the
company and for the landowners to set appropriate values on any leases
if we don't know what the rules about forced pulling are. So, to say
that we're creating a study on this issue, multiple years into this I
think is unfair. No one should leave this floor without a doubt that as
a result of a failure of this amendment that there will be forced
pulling in the state, property rights will have changed, and in fact we
will end up with landowners being forced, to give away, effectively
their right to control their property, as they have historically had in
this state since its conception, as a result of this. We so only, as a
result of the greed of a few companies in this regard, and that is the
end of it. If it were not true, the one possible good thing out of the
Pennsylvania experience is that we don't have to have forced pulling.
But, we have clearly by the temporary rule that we have we have clearly
decided that we are not going that way. So, no one should leave here
without a shadow of a doubt that we are transferring and changing the
property rights of the citizens of this state that we are adopting
forced pulling and that will henceforth be the law of the land. Thank
you.

[Speaker Change]
Representative Glazier, I'm trying to understand this myself, I don't
think I fully do, because like most people I think, in terms of the
surface and what we've got here is gas deep, deep below the surface. My
question is how, if you've got.</p>

<p id="110:00">
Say a neighborhood with several locks and there's gas deep enough
beneath the surface. How do you tell who specific piece of property that
gas came from once its piped up thousands of feet to the surface. How
can you even determine that.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Representative [Bless] for the question. It's a matter of all
you go home, you turn on your hose. Hose pipe as we like to call it and
it flows from where your pressure is to where the pressures not. Right,
you got waterfowl. That's the same as natural gas will do. It'll
flow to where you have the lowest pressure. What we can determine is by
the geology and Doctor Warren can espouse for days on this. If you know
the Geology you can tell within a certain area  of where you think the
gas you think will flow from. You're pretty careful with
that. And what we want to do by studying this force pulling is
determining what that geology looks like. How far do we think it will
go, we may not need it in North Carolina but we may need it. It all
depends on what the geology tells us, what the pressures look like, how
much
flow you can get from [??] this floor that says you know what, I would
love to see the data. So I think that's why the study is needed. That's
why we need to leave things as they are. Let the study become effective.
[Speaker Changes]
Follow up Mr. Speaker
[Speaker Changes]
The gentlemen [??]
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Hager, are there states that do have fracking that do
have the force pulling.
[Speaker Changes]
There's thirty eight states that do have compulsory unionization as it's
called. Thirty eight states other than us. We make.
[Speaker Changes]
One final question Mr. Speaker
[Speaker Changes]
The gentlemen yields.
[Speaker Changes]
Where there's been force pulling and you had an owner of surface that
did not participate but was forced to by force pulling. Has there ever
been such an owner that turned down a check for the gas that came, that
was determined to have come from his property.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative [Bless] in the times and places we have talked to and
I've been to Pennsylvania. Representative Stone has been to Arkansas.
Some other folks have been to Texas, I'm not sure where all they've
been. There we have not talked to any, the problems that we
have seen are the ones that didn't, did not get involved, didn't get a
check. That's been the biggest issue we've seen so far. And all that
data we need to take in. I mean all that data we need to absorb with the
Geology to determine what is the right answer for this. So thank you
for your questions.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes]
To speak on the amendment
[Speaker Changes]
The gentlemen has recognized to debate the amendment a second time,
[Speaker Changes]
A second time and I encourage you to vote no on the amendment.
Representative Greer Martin inspired me to Google things there and
actually Representative Martin there is a president a couple hundred of
years after the Norman conquest and I'm ganna make this about
a two minute expiation but you inspire me to much it might be the full
fifteen minutes. So don't inspire me. Okay we've always had joint
ownership of property. And in merry old England if the daddy died it all
went to his oldest son. You all know about that right.
Primogeniture. But if all he had was daughters then they took equally.
They were called co-parseners. Co-parseners, and they could have a
division of the land and that's in our statutes today. Chapter forty
one, but then there's a problem. What if you divide the property
but by dividing it you make it less valuable and so we have partion by
sale. It if can be shown for example a dwelling house is owned by a
family. Obviously you can't assign one bedroom to one daughter and the
son gets another bedroom so there's a petition for
partition by sale. And we actually had five years ago, an effort in this
house that failed thank goodness to make that almost impossible to do.
There was currently a states Senator who was really pushing this that
you should never be allowed to sell joint property because
someone has more emotional ties to it than somebody else does but our
law has been for hundreds of years that to prevent loss to everybody,
there is a procedure for a force sale even if there is co-ownership of
property, Even if it's private property, Chapter forty one.
And that's the situation here, you have individual lots perhaps from the
surface but down deep below the all gas is mixed up and nobody knows
where that molecule of gas comes from so as long as you're not.</p>

Touching the individual owner’s property from the surface of the earth
to the center of the earth to the heavens. As long as you’re not
touching that property but you’re just sucking it out by differential
pressure, same as water, it’s not their property, but to be fair to them
we’re going to pay them for it anyway whether they like it or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stone please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker, to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen I want to
try and make this a little bit simpler for you so we can really bring it
down to what I experienced when I traveled. The reason the forced
pooling is so important because what we realized was they could actually
drill around your property and never drill under your property and
sometimes they could get the seepage of the gas. So why is that
important? Because the wealthy people always had the means to get the
help they need. It was the poor people that was taken advantage of in
some form or fashion even though the law was never broken. So if we care
about the people in the state of North Carolina we will make sure we do
extensive studies to make sure we take care of the ones that don’t
understand the law, that don’t understand how this is going to impact
them. This stands up because we don’t want anyone on our land or under
our land. It has far reaching effects, farther than we can realize,
after we traveled to many states we have seen that did it and you know
that there are many different ways to do it in every state so I would
suggest that we vote against this amendment and let’s make sure that
whatever we come back with with the study protects the people then they
make a rational decision that will affect them the rest of their life. I
can tell you when I was in Pennsylvania, there was a gentleman that said
“you’re not drilling on my land”, they drilled all the way around his
land, they got the gas, all his neighbors got rich, he got nothing. He
came back years later and wanted them to go drill under his land and
guess what? They didn’t. He was left with nothing because he didn’t
understand what he was about to do and we have a lot of people in rural
sections of Lee County and the state of North Carolina that we need  to
make sure that we fully understand what we’re about to put forward. So
there again please let this be studied, come back with a recommendation
so we can protect the weakest ones in our community to make sure that
they make a good decision and I ask you not to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Jackson please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. With all due respect to my
colleague Representative Stam I really don’t see the difference. In KILO
we were talking about redevelopment, I don’t know whether it was on the
waterfront or just a particular part of town. One lady didn’t want to
sell her property and the government came in and said ‘well all your
other neighbors they want to sell their property to build this fancy new
development and you’re holding this up so we’re going to take your
property, for the good of all your neighbors and the good of our
community and so we can get a larger tax base.’ That’s what KILO is all
about, that’s what all you have signed onto and said you’re against and
then you’re doing the exact same thing to these people in Lee County who
all their neighbors around them might want it but they don’t want to
sell, for whatever reason. I believe in them, I believe that they will
consider that and consider the amount of money they’d get and make that
decision. I don’t think the government should force them to sell if
they’re unwilling to sell.

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker, colleagues, I’m pretty well recognized as
not supporting this bill but I join with those that oppose this
amendment. I note that I am the primary sponsor of the eminent domain
bill and I do not see this as a question of eminent domain. It’s really
as Representative Stam and Representative Stone have pointed out, you’re
talking about water or you’re talking about gas, you’re not talking
about property in the same sense here. Forced pooling is intended to
protect a person who has a lot of drilling done around them. The gas
being taken moving to that point, and them suddenly not getting
anything, it’s an equity matter and I think the way the bill has handled
this in terms of studying is the appropriate way to handle it and
therefore I urge that we do not accept this amendment.

Distant information from people. I don't know. I keep hearing about
forced pooling and I'm under the impression that what it means is I own
the property, I want fracking done on my property, I drill straight down
and because I drill and suck up the gas so much that it just pulls from
everybody elses properties. Is that the case? Or, can somebody come and
drill on my property and then turn horizontally and drill on the
property next door to me, or even more doors down?
[Speaker Change]
Senator ??, I'll refers to experts who know more about it. I don't see
anything that would prohibit that form this also. But, in the end it's
irrelevant whether we're talking about real property, land, or personal
property as Representative McGrady was talking about, whether there's
gas that flows from here to here or the land stays. While the law treats
those differently in many respects, in the end what this boils down to
is that it is the government coming in and taking your property from
you. Whether its real or personal.

MSDS stuff will take care of it. That companies do this all the time.
They do not have to by the way this bill, 786 is currently laid out. It

Representative Queen, does the gentleman yield?
[Speaker Change]
I do, Representative Stone.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Representative Queen. Do you know if the MSDS is a
requirement of the state or federal government?
[Speaker Change]
Federal, I think. Is that right?
[Speaker Change]
That's correct.
[Speaker Change]
Approximately, I believe, just about half of the chemicals are even
required to be published, so it's by no means a complete list. But, the
public, in my opinion have a right to know what's being pumped into
their groundwater. Local government should know what's being pumped into
their groundwater. If we have a spill from one of these fracking
operations, of these fluids, the clean up should be known. We should be
prepared in advance, because we will have them, over time. So, the
publics right to know is essential, and then going along with that the
bill also decriminalizes the releasing of any of these chemicals. It
does try to protect the trade secrets, but it does give the public the
proper information. I think this is a good bill to help North Carolina
get closer to doing fracking right and I ask for your support.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
Debate the amendment, Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill, just to kind of clarify a few things
that I'm not sure folks may know. In the initial outlay of trade secrets
emergency management in those areas will know what they have on sight.
So, they will know how to do their planning. If an emergency happens,
the local first responders will have the data, as an emergency is needed
to do that. The other thing though, the thing that's most grievous about
this amendment is the last line on the first page. If you read it,
penalties for unlawful disclosure of confidential information
established by this subsection shall not apply, going onto the next
page, disclosure of confidential information that concerns chemicals
used in hydraulic fracturing processes. Again, this is an issue that
applies for trade secrets everywhere else. We have rules and penalties
for trade secrets in North Carolina, but now you want to exempt this
industry because they don't like this industry. This is actually being
worked on. I'm trying to find my set of rules I was just given. This is
in the Mind Energy Commission's rules right now. These things are in
there, its in our bill on who gets to trade secrets, who doesn't get to
trade secrets, how will first responders know, the MSDS is, as
Representative Stone says, out on site. We've talked about that several
times, but this amendment wants to say, no we don't want to do that, we
just need to give them to everybody. That really is a bill killer for
us, if you have a software company, if you have another company that you
want to trade secrets, you don't come to North Carolina and say, you
come locate in North Carolina, you create jobs, you spend some money, it
doesn't matter we're going to let your competition know what you're
doing. It doesn't make sense to me, guys and there's no penalty for it
so, I urge you to vote no on the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Grier Martin, please state your purpose.

To debate the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members this is an excellent
amendment. The gentleman from Rutherford, I agree with a bunch of what
he said on trade secrets. I think the essential function of government
is to protect businesses and protect their trade secrets. Without a
doubt, it is fundamental to ensuring that we are a friendly place to do
business. When your trade secret enters my daughters drinking water, it
becomes my right to know. Support this amendment.

To speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Again, this is the people’s right to know and I will
ask my fellow members to not abdicate their constitutional
responsibility so I am going to quote two sections of the North Carolina
constitution. The first one is article 1, section 2: “All political
power is invested in and derives from the people. All government of
right originates from the people. It’s founded upon their will only and
is instituted solely for the good of the whole. The people have a right
to know.” The second section, from article 14 section 5, conservation of
natural resources: “It shall be the policy of this state to conserve and
protect its lands and waters for the benefit of all its citizens and to
this end it shall be a proper function of the state of North Carolina
and its political subdivisions to require and preserve parks,
recreation, and scenic areas and to control and limit pollution of our
air and water.” This is our constitutional obligation. We do not need to
abdicate it, to any process that’s speeding this along. We do not need
to short change our local government in their constitutional obligations
as set forth here in this article. I urge you to support the amendment
and respect the people’s right to know.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stone please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Debate the amendment one more time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen this is
exactly what we have dealt with over the past several years of trying to
come up with good rules and regulations for the state of North Carolina.
We went through debate after debate of many times someone coming to my
door only to bring us in a new opportunity to shut down the process. You
look at last year’s chemical disclosure and I’ll challenge anyone in
this room to tell me this chemical disclosure is not a hundred times or
better. This is complete disclosure to our state emergency personnel,
our local emergency personnel, our hospital doctors. It gives detailed
information on the material data safety at every drilling pad of what’s
in there. We also have frack focus you can go to and look and see what
the chemicals are used in any well in the United States. So there’s been
a lot of work done, but for some of us there will never be an end until
we find a way to shut it down. We all understand how important sensitive
information is and we’re not trying to deny it, we’re just trying to
allow the operation to move forward so we can do it in the safest manner
possible protecting the people in the state of North Carolina and I
think this amendment hurts this process sand I think what we have in the
bill is a great way to go so I would ask you to vote against this
amendment and let’s move forward with drilling in North Carolina
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Harrison please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To briefly debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I think this is a really
important amendment. These fracking chemicals are making people sick all
over the country and to send a doctor to jail because he tells his
patient this is why his patient’s sick is unconscionable. These
chemicals are not publically disclosed. The trade secret language is
written in such a way that it can make a single constituent chemical a
trade secret so I urge you to support this amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Millis please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ladies and gentlemen, there’s been a lot of rhetoric
that’s gone back and forth about this but a wise man once said that
rhetoric is no substitute for reality. The reality is and the rules that
I hand to you right now is that the public does have the right to know
and they actually know what the ingredients are from all aspects.
Representative Stone actually spoke about that they would actually know
the ingredients by way of frack focus. These rules are actually in
multiple..</p>

places where the pulpit will know. It's just that the trade secret will
not be known until the other aspects, the deeper aspects of the rules,
they actually protect the industry. So again what is the rhetoric that
has been actually shown you here today actually is in line with what the
rules are. So again I hope that we all have a little bit of aspects for
the reality of the rules that are truly protecting the health of our
citizens, the water of this state and I urge you to vote against this
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion, further debate. If not,
the question before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth
by Representative Queen to the House committee substitute of Senate Bill
786. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 46 having voted in
the affirmative. 68 in the negative. The amendment fails. Representative
Jackson is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will read.

CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen, this amendment I
thought was very important to go after Representative Martin's amendment
that he offered and I think you heard in that debate where people said
well we weren't going to, these people who were being forced into it,
that we're not going to be bothering their property on the surface.
We're just going to be going to get the gas underneath and making sure
they see some of that benefit. What my amendment does, deals with what
is called a split estate. Approximately, 9,073 acres in Lee county
alone, the mineral rights have been severed from the property owners,
surface rights, and so what my amendment would say was that if you're
going to get that gas before you disturb the owner's property, the
surface owner's property, you have to get their written permission.
That's what it says. If you're going to come, bury a line in their yard,
put a well, do anything, run through their driveway, whatever you're
going to do that's going to disturb the surface area, which is what we
just talked about earlier, said we weren't going to disturb. My
amendment just clearly says, any disturbance to the surface area, you
have to get the owner's prior written consent and I ask for your
support. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Moore, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Briefly debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Thank you. Members, Mr. Speaker, this amendment appears really
has some constitutional problems based on  conferring with staff and
with the bill sponsors. It would actually change and abdicate many, many
years of common law with respect to property ownership and really goes
beyond the scope of this bill. So if I may be recognized for a motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, I move that the amendment do lie upon the
table. [SPEAKER CHANGES]The motion having been made by Representative
Moore and duly seconded by Representative Burr, the motion is not

CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This amendment simply allows the
citizens of North Carolina, that live within a perimeter of 1000 feet of
a well head site to have pre-environmental health risk assessments
performed at no cost to them, but to the company. And the reason I'm
putting forth the amendment is because there's no studies out there
where pre-assessment for health conditions that are caused by well
leaks. There are a couple of chemicals such as, benzine and methane, and
we know that benzine is linked to lymphatic cancer, leukemia, and
multiple</p>

<p id="140:00">
That’s evident so if we would ??? I’m not saying we’re not going to
frack because I know there’s enough numbers in here to pass this bill,
but we can get it right for the communities that it’s going to impact.
We can get it right by putting in some health assessments prior to the
companies coming in. That way we will have a baseline to look at if
water contamination occurs, if air pollution occurs after the fracking,
and after the companies leave the site. I ask for your support on the
amendment for the people of the state of North Carolina in these
communities because there are already several water leaks in water wells
that people are drinking water from in at least five other states where
fracking has taken place and these people have huge, huge health risks
that go along with being within that thousand feet. Water contamination
has been found within less than six hundred feet. I put in the amendment
the thousand feet. Please consider the amendment, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hager please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Representative Cunningham I
appreciate the amendment sent forward and I would love to work with you
on that. The department of public health is working on this also and I’d
love to include some of your issues into this. This goes far beyond some
of the things we see or potentials we see on the energy exploration
issue. Right now within the bill we’ve got presumptive liability for
well testing before they drill then six months, twelve months, eighteen
months, twenty-four months we built within the bill so this does, the
bill you have in front of you, does deal with water issues. What I’d
like to propose, I’d like to vote this bill down but work with
Representative Cunningham and get her involved in MEC and the division
of public health and see if we can include some of these issues that she
has within our MEC rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Chair believes the gentleman meant to say to vote the
amendment down, not the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I did sir, and I think I said energy exploration.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Cunningham please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment a second
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] First of all I want to thank Representative Hager for
those comments, they were very kind, and I would love to work with you
on that because I know that after they come in and drill or whatever
they do to the land, even if they leave after the gas is all gone in
fifty to a hundred years there’s going to be an impact on that water, on
that environment, and if we don’t have something in place for the next
generation we don’t know what their capabilities of living a very
quality life in those environments. So I appreciate that but I still ask
for support on the amendment. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies of gentlemen of the
house I’m asking that you support this amendment. The amendment
basically is following the mining and energy commission in last year’s
set up a local government regulation study group that group came back
with recommendations in October 2013. What I’ve done is, what I hope is
just streamline section 14 which will streamline it to the point where
it allows local ordinances to still be written and still be produced in
their normal course of business and it just allows them that
opportunity. At this point in time with the way I read section 14..</p>

. . . read I think. It takes a lot of that authority from them. As
you'll note from my amendment that it still keeps the important, main
purpose of Section 14. The main purpose of Section 14 is so that no
local authorities will then attempt to present any ordinances that would
directly stop fracking or anything of that sort. So, we're just asking
to streamline that process, to look at it. This is something that is
supported by the League of Municipalities; this is also something that
I've got, at least from my home counties, bipartisan support on. I'm
hoping you'll consider supporting this bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Speaker, and appreciate the indulgence
of all the members to listen to what amendments we were able to discuss.
One thing that is absolutely clear is that for some reason, in this Bill
we're afraid of the public having the right to know. And unfortunately,
I spoke yesterday about the fact that we didn't effectively deal with
the waste from power manufacturing and utilities here in North Carolina,
and of course our communities and citizens are paying the price. |And
now in this Bill, we're doing something that was already done. You know
the federal government made a specific determination at Camp Lejeune,
North Carolina that they would not disclose, and let the public know,
what was is the water. And for forty years, the darkest chapter in the
history of the Marine Corps happened as we continue to promote cancer
and cancerous deaths among marines and their families because we did not
disclose. And yes, there were regulations there; but they did not
disclose to the public. Yes, some people were well-meaning; but they did
not disclose to the public. Yes, some of the officials looked the other
way; but we did not have that ultimate safeguard of public review. And
so, we've already tried</p>

at this federal level and North Carolinians have already paid the price

Thank you, Representative Hager. Just a quick question, does anything in
this bill provide for the possibility of fracking offshore?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No ma'am, that is in federal lands and we have to have federal
acceptance to do that. As far as I know.

Thank you very much. If I may I would like to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Yesterday you were quick to mention the jobs that the
fracking industry would bring to our state, in the amount, I think, of
about 389 jobs. But so far this body has refused to consider the impact
of the 4,000 clean jobs are brought to North Carolina and are already
here in North Carolina that have a positive impact on the state and
local economies. Those jobs are associated with the film and television
production industry. Periods of great economic growth are ushered in by
industries that are perpetual, not finite. Industries that provide an
important outlet for innovation and profitability. Industries like film
production. America has seen economic expansion through innovation.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The House will come to order and the lady will be sure to limit her
discussion to the matter before us and the Chair has given some latitude
but the lady should be mindful of that as she proceeds forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly, Mr. Speaker. That's the intention. America has seen great
economic expansion through innovation and creating industries for the
future, not the past. Fracking will not move North Carolina into it's
next great economic period. New industries have taken America from great
depressions into prosperity. These new and innovative industries have
provided American families with jobs and incomes that allowed middle
class families to buy a home, a car, take vacations, and contribute to
America's economy. To oppose the film industry or any other 21st century
industry that has a proven track record for entrepreneurship and
innovation-

Is the lady following the instructions given to her previously by the
Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is treading into a grey area that may result in her debate
being ruled out of order. The lady may proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My intention, thank you, Mr. Speaker, is to compare 4,000 clean jobs in
North Carolina that are already here to the creation of 389 jobs
associated with an industry who very likely has the potential to pollute
our drinking water. South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana recognize
this. In this chamber we always talk about being competitive with
neighboring states in creating jobs. Why are we willing to give up our
competitive advantages in certain industries and our natural resources?
South Carolina and Georgia are watching us. They want our 4,000 jobs in
film, hoping that we make these regressive measures and decisions so
that they can continue to recruit industries away from North Carolina. I
urge my colleagues to vote against this extremely rushed, unproven, and
dangerous plan to create temporary jobs that will hinder our safe
drinking water. North Carolina citizens deserve better than that.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. First, I would like to express my appreciation
for how patient you all are with a nerd like me because I read one of
the amendments and as I went down through it I saw americum-241. Well I
had been around a facility that dealt with americium-241 and I consulted
with our resident chemist and we're not sure if americum-241 is a new
transuranide element artificially created or if it's just become a
common misspelling but it points out the problems you have when
legislatures are getting deep into science rather than turning it over
to the engineers. And I've noticed to</p>

Today, at least the way I understand things, there's alot of confusion
or maybe some spin. Forced pooling. The guys being forced are the guys
doing the drilling and they are forced to create a pool of the money and
give some of it to the people next door who aren't drilling because they
are getting some of their oil and gas from those non-participatory
owners and they're being forced to share. Public's right to know. There
is a requirement that anyone wanting to do drilling in North Carolina
disclose all of the chemicals and all of the recipes to the mining
commission, to the state geologist, to ?? They can apply to have some of
their information and recipes treated as trade secrets, but it doesn't
default to trade secret. They have to ask for it and receive it. If it
is classified as a trade secret, all of the components, all of the
information of that chemical will be released. The state geologist will
maintain all of the proprietary information as will the Department of
Environmental Natural Resources and the Emergency Management Commission.
And at the request, any hazardous materials responder, fire chief and
medical facility will be given the full information including the trade
secrets. Having been in technology, I've had situations of bidding on
contracts for governments and sometimes they will require that a vendor
deposit the source code for computer-based systems with the government.
And I have had several vendors who refuse to do this and we end up just
walking away from the business. It is not uncommon for people to want to
protect their intellectual property. We've heard talk about open waste
pits for the water such as coal ash. Well, I can certainly understand
the frustration with decades of regulation that didn't really protect
the coal ash, especially when a pipe that's rusted through  was laid
when I was a young person. Regulation didn't catch that. I know that I'm
concerned somewhat about the drinking water that my daughter drinks from
Lake Norman and Mountain Islandv where coal ash pits have laid as long
as I have been alive. Last but not least, we're talking about the
disposal of the water after it was used. We heard comments like,
&quot;We don't want to dispose of water by treatment.&quot; Do people
think we're pouring this down the drain and sending it to the waste
treatment plant? Disposal by treatment is the people doing the
construction will treat the water and then reuse 99% of it. That's
basically where we are. We're going to hear alot of frightening talk,
about things that aren't in this bill. We're going to hear a lot of
fear, about situations that don't exist in this. And I read the bill. It
ain't great, but it is what it is and I'm gonna support it.
[CHANGES SPEAKER]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose to debate the bill Mr.
Speaker.
[CHANGES SPEAKER]
The gentleman is recognized to make the bill as amended.
[CHANGES SPEAKER]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and I recognize that I suspect there will be a
time that technology will allow us to frack. I also recognize there is
no gain without some risk involved in any endeavour in life. The
question is always one of balance which is, in fact, precisely our role
as the government. In the protection of the health and welfare and
safety of the state as well as trying to propel it foreward in an
economic way. But what we do know, from the experience of other states
is that no state has done it particularly well yet or particularly
safely yet. So, I think in some respects, I disagree, I don't disagree
at all with Representative Brawley's comment just now.</p>

<p id="160:00">
Not the greatest bill, but it is what we have. Well, it is what we have,
but it doens't have to be, of course. There are a number of amendments
to try to make it better today and they were all, all defeated or tabled
because we didn't want to be on record voting one way or the other.
That's a shame, because some of the amendments would've made it a far
better regime, and might have given better confidence to the public
about what we're doing. You know, I live in an area of the state that at
least until a few weeks ago I didn't think was going to have any direct
fracking, but you never know. It is going to be part of the state that
could be effected if things go wrong. 24 percent of the state's
population's drinking water comes down the Cape Fear, and the biggest
fear in my community is what could happen if things go wrong. Is that an
unreasonable risk? Well, I've tried to associate and look at a risk
benefit analysis. Representative Hamilton had it right that there is
some benefit to be had here, but under any reasonable doctrine that
exists in scenario of economic data, it's not a lot, and it's not right
now, given the economics of the industry. Is there a risk? There's a big
risk, because if one thing goes wrong badly, it really goes wrong here.
I look at that and say, &quot;Whether the risk outweighs the
benefit,&quot; and I cannot for the life of me see that the benefit here
outweighs the risk. The risk is still great and we see it in
Pennsylvania, and we see it in Ohio, and we see it in Arkansas. There
are things to improve substantially, and we didn't do some of those
things today. If we care deeply, and I think the body does on either
side of this issue about toxic air emissions, the limitations on the use
of radioactive chemicals, the issues raised both by Representative Stone
and by this side on the issue of pulling. On the issue of local
government having some control over the infrastructure in costs and
safety and health of their communities. On basic worker safety, which we
know is an issue in other states. We punted on all of that. Then most
importantly on representative Carney's amendment. You know,
Representative Hagen I think is right on the minute and the details
about what should be done by the commission and what should be done on
the floor. When we say we're giving things to the commission and then
turn around and by the part of the statute that we're creating, abdicate
our ability to review those rules, that is wrong. We then give up the
final authority. How we can then turn safely and confidently to our
public, I think that's a sham. I think we cannot do that. It is one
thing to have done the argument today to defeat the ?? in saying,
&quot;It should be left to the MEC,&quot; but it is another thing to say
that and then turn around and say, &quot;Oh, and by the way, given the
rule making that we've just changed, you're not going to get a realistic
chance to do anything about it. That's perhaps the worst vote of what we
did today. You know, in the end as I suggested, there may be a time when
this technology is something for this state, but I'll tell you right
now, I'm going to vote against this bill because where we are with the
technology, where the shale is, where the aquifers are, what the
potential risk is scares the absolutely heck out of me. Thank you.

Thank you. I just rise once again, things have been said and been said
very eloquently about the cautions that we should all keep in mind. What
I would just say to each of you, you've heard the sort of risk
assessment. Most of you who were in business understand risk. This is a
big risk for a little gain, a really big risk. The water for our future
is at risk.</p>

Health of our citizens is at risk. There is no reason to rush. This
Shell gas has been there a
million years, it will be there in a few months. Lets try to get this
right before we put it on a fast
track. There is just no common sense to fast track something as
consequential as this bill.
We're asked to punt, to kick things down the road, to let em study it.
We don't know what these final rules will be. The public does not know
what the final rules will be. Our sponsors they're so vague because [??]
work. Well, lets let them finish their work. Lets give them
an opportunity to flush out all the necessary issues to get this right
for the people of North Carolina. You're [??] forward, lets go forward
right. We have a sayin in the mountains, that this is a pig and a poke.
We don't know what we're gettin. We're asked to kick it on down
the road but the follow up on that little metaphor is, when the pig gets
out the citizens of our state are ganna be left will a hole in the bag
and that's not a pretty picture. I ask you to take time.Lets do this
right. Lets make North Carolina proud and lets protect the future of our
citizens drinking water and health. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes]
For what purpose does the lady from Guilford, Representative Harrison
rise.
[Speaker Changes]
To briefly debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
The lady has recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house. I won't repeat
all the points I made yesterday but I do think it's really important to
think about this in the context of why we're rushing this bill. The
proponents of it have said it's about North Carolina needs the jobs
and America needs the energy. Three hundred eighty seven jobs and twelve
days of gas does not seem like it's worth the risk to our natural
resources and to our public health. There's so many problems associated
with this industry. We have plenty of time to get it right with
the cost of natural gas being what it is and the nature of our resources
being so limited it makes all kinds of sense to wait and not rush this
bill. I can't for the life of me fathom why we are breaking our promise
to the people of North Carolina that we were not going to
green-light fracking until after the rules have been adopted and
developed and brought before us for final review. Nothing about this
process makes any sense to me. There's so many problems associated. I
was doing some research last night and found even more that
I failed to mention yesterday that you can't, some places are not
offering mortgages to houses that do not have the mineral rights and
they're insurance companies that are not insuring its fracking damage.
There are all kinds of consequences to this industry that we can't
even contemplate and we are not a state that has a history of extracted
industries so we all have a track record to base these experiences on so
there's all kind of reasons to wait. I encorage us to vote no on this
bill and pursue this with a little more of a deliberative pace.
Thank you.
[Speaker Changes]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Henderson, Representative
McGrady rise.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. Speaker on the immediately previous to this discussion vote on the

Madam Clerk, does the clerk know which vote that is.

The gentleman will be recorded as having voted I on that last amendment.

[Speaker Changes]
Speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
The gentlemen has recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a been a long, long,
hard road. A lot of work as we have discussed many times. It's been over
three and a half years of getting to this point so when we here people
talk about rush and you can understand there has been
a whole lot of work over three and a half years. We don't know if we
feel rushed or just wore out. Today, we're about to take a historic
vote. We're about to decide if North Carolina is ganna get any energy
business or not. It's a twenty first century vote for North Carolina.
And we [??] jobs, indirect and direct. And it's very important because
it does a number of other things. It reminds us of the message we're
ganna see and not only to the industry but all our state agencies. It's
ganna tell  Deaner to start to prepare, to get ...</p>

It's gonna tell the industry to prepare to come to North Carolina and
look at our rolls so that they can make adjustments.  It's gonna tell
our cities and counties that the next year, or slightly after that,
we're gonna be prepared to drill in North Carolina, and you need to make
the necessary arrangements to be prepared.  So we've got a lot to do,
and this bill passed that sends a clear message to everyone for us all
to get prepared to do energy in North Carolina.  Now, I'll say again:
We worked hard, and there's been a lot of discussion today, some good
amendments, and some amendments that we're probably gonna discuss
further in energy oversight, but with saying that, I think, now more
than ever, we need to move forward to say North Carolina is in the
energy business, and with that I ask you to vote for this bill.

For what purpose does the lady from Mecklinburg, Representative Carny
Rice (Becky Carny on the list?)?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentleman.  I know we all want to
go home, but I just want to rise and just say this one thing just as a
reminder.  We broke a promise.  We broke a promise, and you get to go
home and say that, but I will tell you I am not convinced and the debate
was not allowed on the amendment to look at whether we really are going
to have that opportunity as a body elected by the people of this state
that are going to be impacted by this bill.  What is a shame to me is
that we didn't debate that issue on the floor.  Are we or are we not
going to get to approve these rules as they come out from this mining
commission?  It's been cut short, we didn't debate it, and I know a lot
of you in this chamber wanted to support that.  You want to go back home
and say, &quot;I'm gonna be able to vote for or against these rules as
they are developed for this state going forward.&quot;  And I leave you
with this:  It's done.  I know how the process works.  I've been here 12
years, and we'll all walk out of this chamber, we'll go home, and it'll
be a great weekend, I hope, for every one of us, and we'll come back,
and we'll deal with the next issue.  We have to do that, but I hope that
you will all take a look at this chamber on the wall.  I wasn't real
excited about all these paintings being here when they first were hung.
I was happy with the chamber the way it was.  We come in and do the
business, but I've sat in here yesterday and today, and I really looked
at these paintings, and I hope you'll look at them now because what we
are about to vote on today could potentially impact what you see here
with our water and our air.  It's a visual that speaks louder than the
words and louder about which vote, which number, which,  excuse me,
which color you vote here today.  I am astounded that we're all willing
to move forward and say, &quot;Let an industry, let a mining commission
comprised of the industry representative move forward and develop the
rules, put them out there.  We're moving forward, permits are being
issued.  It's our responsibility, and, basically, what we did today when
we shut down the debate was to say that the bill is all about refusing
our right as legislators to see the rules.  I ask you to vote
&quot;no.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate?  Allow a moment for the members to
enter the chamber.  If not, the question for the House is the passage of
the House Committee Substitute, Senate Bill 786, is amended on its third
reading.  All in favor vote aye.  All opposed vote no.  The clerk will
open the vote.  The clerk will let the machine record the vote.
Sixty-four have voted in the affirmative, 50 in the negative.  The House
Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 786 is amended.  It has passed its
third reading, the Bill being grossed and returned to the Senate by
special messenger.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we are about to go to notices and announcements,
