[SPEAKER CHANGES].
If representative Murry. If the comity will allow representative Murry,
will begin his explanation of the bill while this are being pass out.
Representative Murry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you Mr. chairman last time we presented house bill 70. For to, it
was a broad sweeping bill that went very, very far and so we had robust
public comment on that and several conversation with stake holders.
Including the  agency rules reviewing people. What we done is, created a
situation where we allow the agencies to identified rules into three
buckets rules that are necessary and non controversial. Controversial is
a loose term and is not in the exact term on the legislation. I'm trying
to give you some concepts here. Necessary and none controversial,
necessary or controversial, or something that has had substantial public
 interest, and we have unnecessary rules. We are asking the agency to
identify and help put rules into those three buckets. Those three
filters from that proses we start in to the rules review, and
re-adoption proses. I would ask that Caren Cocker Brown, detail the
legislation that we are going to go trough. Including the time frame.
But instead of having every rule review every ten years. We are asking
the agencies to help us identify rules in those three buckets and then
go trough a proses where they can be regularly reviewed and adopted. And
with that Mr. chairman if you would recognize Caren Cocker Brown to help
us walk trough the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, representative Murry.  Mrs. Cocker Brown you are recognized
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you Mr. chair, members of the comity as representative Murry
indicated this is a rewrite of the bill that you discussed several weeks
ago. That creates a new proses for the review of existing rules.  The
proses would basically required that agencies make an initial
determination. With  regards to the rules that they have already
adopted. That are existent in the code for that agency. And the initial
determination would sort their rules to three buckets, essentially. One
for rules that are necessary and with out any any substance of public
interest. Which basically that no one the agency has not receive public
comment objecting to the rule with in the pass two years. Essentially
this is a rule that, in other words is not particularly controversial.
That everybody sort of agrees with. The second bucket would be for rules
that are necessary and controversial. This are rules that the agency and
the term would be “rules that are necessary with substance to public
interest.” and that would be demonstrated by the fact that the public
would have commented to the bill with in the pass two years. The third
bucket is one for rules that are determined by the agency to be
unnecessary this are rules that are obsolete, redundant or other wise
not needed by the</p>

<p id="10:00">
Almost everything in here comes in threes.  It's a three phase process.
Divide the rules into three types of categories that will then be
reviewed by three different bodies and then will be disposed of in three
different ways.  So if you think about it that way, basically we took
the rules and we're gonna let the agencies look through and say either
they're necessary but some people might have some questions or concerns,
or they're unnecessary and nobody's really even had any complaints or
concerns, or they're necessary and no one has said that they had any
concerns.  So, necessary/concerns, necessary/no concerns, and we just
don't think they're very necessary.  And they'll make that
determination, they'll write up what they've determined, they send it to
the Rules Review Commission.  Then Rules Review Commission - and during
that time they also post it so the public can say either, &quot;we agree
with you&quot; or &quot;we don't agree with you&quot; - and so all of
that information will then go to the Rules Review Commission, and the
Rules Review Commission will look within their parameters at the public
comment, what the staff did, and they will either agree or disagree with
how the staff categorizes it.  So that's step two.  And then once they
do that, they'll send it to step three, which will come before the
legislative committee, who will then review what both of them did and
then either agree or disagree and make any kind of changes they think
needs to be made.  And then in the end, those three categories of rules,
as they have then been filtered out with all the public comment and all
the eyes looking at them.  If they view it as, &quot;you know, we all
agree this is a necessary rule and there are not any real problems with
it&quot;, it's automatically renewed for that next ten years.  If they
say, &quot;you know, this is a rule that we've all said is unnecessary
and nobody has said differently&quot;, it automatically is repealed.
And then if they say, &quot;it's a rule that we agree is necessary but
we don't agree on some other aspects of it and we think it needs to go
through the rules process&quot;, it will go all the way back through the
rules process.  So, three steps, three types of rules, three sets of
eyes, to end up with a way for us to review everything.  We'll be open
to questioning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Waddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a comment on the motion at an appropriate time.  My comment is that
it sounds mighty efficient to me, which is separate from the way
government ordinarily operates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that.  I will tell you it took us a while to get to it.
[laughs]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I got a couple of questions.  In the transition between the part of
150-B that's being repealed and the part that's replacing it, are there
any entities that are being exempted from the rule-making process that
currently today would be required to go through rule-making?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm gonna let Staff answer that.  My thought is we did not address
changing any of that, so I don't know that this does, but I'll let her
address it cuz I think that is being addressed in a different bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, there are no exemptions added in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right.  Second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the legislation - I may not have understood you correctly, I'm trying
to catch it in the language here - you're saying that all rules that
would be reviewed, either new or existing rules or rules being proposed
to be done away with or new rules proposing to be ??, would come back
through the General Assembly or a legislative committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What would come back through the legislative administrative procedure
oversight committee is the report on why the rules were dealt with the
way they were.  For instance, if the agency had said, &quot;we view this
as unnecessary&quot; - and we had the word noncontroversial and we
changed it - without substantive public comment.  In other words, if
they say that they'll at least report that, and then what we're
reviewing is what they're reporting.  It's not that we're going back and
looking through all the rules, but looking at the process, what they
did, and seeing if there's anything that jumps out as either having been
not according to the process or where we stridently disagree with what
they did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, and this may be for Staff, and you can follow it with a thought I
saw that you had - are we in any way, in the repeal and the replacement
of this, in any way taking away from the authority prerogative power of
the legislative branch to intercede in a rule and invalidate that
action?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, Miss Cochran-Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Just to clarify with your previous question, this
process only applies to existing rules, so it would not in any way
affect the process for [END TRANSCRIPT]</p>

Or am I gonna see the new rules were amended, existing rules that they
can only goes on any way a nifty agency S statutory authority to do that
they would continue to do that if they do right now is a new process for
review by wall of the existing with all the rules that are in the column
LN in many cases have been there for many years and then what this
process ladies replacing that he is an existing role process that was
actually created by the governor executive order 78, Purdue executive or
70 created an existing rule procedure that essentially went through the
office of state budget management and downs, five to settle 71 in 2011
that slips being repealed back process that was originally from
executive order seven because the repeal in this new process which now
includes the legislature in this process actually use or more Boston
that process and the bench in this process is that there's a consequence
to the agency for failing to do it on the back by (SPEAKER CHANGES) Eric
existing will process officially give the agency did not do it the
Allstate budget management had no recourse to compel them to do with the
couple's to stay in fact nothing happen under this process if the agency
failed to do with your goals expire and they will have a staffer in five
and finally with regard to question there's nothing in this building way
undermines the legislative branches authority to control agency will
Rosenberg they hear much into seven additional duties after my first
question the song in the second is so do love to building codes fall
under that the rulemaking, and making staff question of the stock and

in the process because their statute to 5 to 5 different process of

changed the therefore, the pole vault we cannot therefore for us to make

and more likely have that not only posted on their site but also on
rules review commission's site.
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, just a couple more. So, after the ADC makes a determination, it
goes to the rules review commission and the rules review commission is
the final arbiter of the appropriateness?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well they send what they decided to the legislative administrative
procedures over site committee who also then either agrees or disagrees
with what they said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And one more.-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Two more, yeah. So if it's deemed so it needs to, because it's necessary
with the session of public interest, that's weren't ?? after go back
through and then the rules review commission and over site committee,
that am I have to go back through the rules process that which amended
last year and two years ago, 781 and 810.
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess my concerns are one, ADC making determination about which of
these rules are obviously redundant or otherwise not needed. I
appreciate the public is gonna have comment and we all think how to get
the public engaged. I'd be interested to know how the ADC's impact might
be feeling about this process because it seems like it might be putting
a burden on the staff and we continue to cut the budget on ?? and other
state agencies and I am wondering last about the impact on delegated
programs like clean water act and clean air act and I think you got to
his a little bit, I think the agencies is going to have to make a
determination if it's a dedicated program from one of the federal laws
and implement it at state level. That is gonna be necessary but it's
gonna probably have substance of public interest  and I am just
wondering how that be impacted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We did discuss something with the federal ones and I let the staff
comment directly on that and we have got a little bit of feedback fro at
least one of the agencies concerned about the workloads which is also
why we asked the rules review commission to make sure that they keep
that kind of impact in mind and they scheduling out how fast this will
move. But if you want to answer the federal peeps.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With regard to two federally delegated programs there is nothing about
this that's any different for their rules except that probably many of
their rules are necessary and would have substance of public interest
until it have to go back through the process again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question for Staff. You use the acronym APA. What were you
referring to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am sorry representative Cunningham. That's the North Carolina
administrative procedure act, it's the law that we are amending here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Waddell, you are recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I move that we get this house bill 74 favorable
report for the PCS unfavorable for the original bill and is there serial
referral?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is no serial referral that ?? the floor from here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's my motion Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, we'll suspend that for this moment. Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I just have a question. Haven't been a state
employee that has seen over the years of rule change and flip from
administration. I am just wondering if this is being screened for
something that may be only of political interest. Out of guidelines in
place you just keep something from going through because some might
disagree with it politically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holley, that's why we have got the three phase process
with public input and everything else. I don't know if you are confused
or not but one thing we have heard about policies that change. This only
affects the actual rules so what you may be talking about that seems to
more of a policy guidelines that have not actually gone through the rule
making process and in some way we are hoping that this process might
bring out the problematic policies and hopefully encourage those
policies to get dealt with but this process will have a lot of public
input that should be balancing any type of political piece that might be
in there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just had one more question. When does this start? When does it kick
in? I guess it's effective when it becomes law but is the date
disclosed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The rules review commission will have to start putting in that schedule
for us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, the motion properly before the committee is for favorable
report on the PCS for house bill 74 unfavorable for original. This will
go to floor from here. All in favor say Aye. All opposed No.</p>

Motion passes. Next up is house bill 677. Representative Brawley you are
recognized to present your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This came out of some of the information
submitted to the local government regulatory reformed subcommittee and
it addresses two issues about which complaints were made. One is North
Carolina is a right to work state it is also a state where collective
bargaining by local governments both cities and counties is forbidden by
law. But in some counties, cities or counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
677, we don't have that here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does anybody have 677 before them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Over here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you could just raise your hand the Sargent of Arms will bring you a
copy. Thank you. We added it at the beginning. Representative Brawley
continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright. What it does is just cities and counties frequently will end up
deducting union dues from their employees to keep domestic peace, but at
a considerable expense. What this does is removes that requirement from
cities and counties that they can't deduct union dues with the modern
ability to set up drafts from one's checking account. I know that most
of my bills are paid automatically and we think that the, it would be
better if that were done for union dues rather than the city's acquiring
expense, cities and counties acquiring expense for that. The second part
is there are a couple of draft programs where cities who have a
heightened environmental consciousness want to implement programs
requiring large employers to take responsibility for the carbon
footprint of their employees with enrollment fees and fines if the city
determines or the county determines that the employer has not done
enough to reduce the carbon footprint of the employees. And a concern is
that that's probably beyond the purview of cities and counties. If the
state wants to implement such a program or the federal government that
that would be appropriate. But cities and counties should not. That's
all the bill does. Mr. Chairman I'd like to move for a favorable report
on the bill and it will be reported directly to the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions for members of the committee? Representative Adams
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Do we have, is there any opposition to the bill?
Who requested it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I got the request on the first part from some city councilmen who I
would prefer not to name if that's ok. Cuz I don't want their firemen
mad at em. The opposition I did get was from a firefighters union. I did
hear from people in Charlotte and from people in Asheville that seemed
to believe that if the cities didn't collect fire dues that people would
die. And I did not see that as a credible problem with this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So off to any other, I'm curious about my county, my city and it's ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I did not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Did not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No ma'am
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insco.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I see this as really just one more bill to
remove power from local governments. If citizens in a community want
their elected officials to implement these programs then they'll elect
officials who will do it. If they oppose it they will not elect
officials who will do it. If elected officials are doing something they
don't like they will defeat them in the next election, and that's the
way the process should work. So I oppose this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I think the fact that this was just added to the
calendar at the last minute also hasn't given people who might be
opposed to this bill an opportunity to come here and speak on it. And I
can think of a lot of folks, not just the firefighters who would have
problems with this. So in addition to being opposed to the bill, I'm
opposed to the process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Representative Brawley am I understating that an
employer includes private companies as well as governmental bodies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir. In this bill its cities and counties and local government
agencies only.

to vote for it.

Just one quick comment, Mr. Chair for the bill sponsor.   Has the League
of Municipalities weighed in on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They have not, neither for nor against.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Richardson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to think that if these entities have already set up this
system what’s the problem with them continuing with the system because
they been doing payroll deductions for a long period of time and I’m
definitely not in favor of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just to follow up Representative Brawley, I’m
not sure the bill goes far enough for me.  Can a city under the bill,
pass an ordinance to require a private employer or is it already in
statute they cannot do that? To collect dues?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir I believe we did address that in a previous bill on North Carolina’s
Right to Work. Although I will say the federal government does have the
right to override this. A specific example is federal legislation
requires that any transit system that receives federal funds to employ
union bus drivers so that in the Charlotte center area transit system
the bus drivers do not actually work for the city of Charlotte. The city
of Charlotte pays a third-party company to hire and supply bus drivers
who are then unionized. So those dues would still be collected and this
would not impair that which is forced by state law, excuse me federal
law.  But state law doesn’t allow collective bargaining so really what
we’re saying to cities and counties, since you can’t be involved in
collecting and bargaining activities why should you spend tax payer
money to collect dues for an organization that you are illegally barred
from negotiating. Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, did I understand, I found out cuz I was late??
Committee.  So this bill was just put on today?  So people have not had
an opportunity who might want to respond, because I would love to talk
to my county, my city and maybe some other organizations about it. And
because they don’t know about it that’s probably why they’re not here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, Mr. Chair for a question of the bill sponsor. My question was,
will this be mandatory if the city’s want to do this and the agencies
can they, or this require them or say to them they can’t do this
anymore?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It says they cannot do it.  It is mandatory that they not withhold union
dues and it is mandatory that they not implement programs to regulate
the carbon footprint of the major employees within their jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I don’t have a question, I have a comment on
process. If we haven’t heard screaming and hollering from the League of
Municipalities and county commissioners, it’s because, it’s not because
they don’t know about this.  They see them tie their ?? and if there
were issues, we’d know about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Time for two more questions.  Representative Cunningham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill, ?? to the recent change that was made to the Mecklenburg
county level for the firefighters am I correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ts not? Well I am aware that that it did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me.  Thank you Representative ??.  I am aware that that did just
take place the last couple of years so I would think that it was
something that wanted to be reversed because the county currently did
allow the firefighters to come back in and have their union dues
withdrawn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative. Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham I was not aware that the Charlotte, that
Mecklenburg county was withholding those union dues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Terry. Thank you, Mr. Chair, I am definitely wondering
about organizations like the League having an opportunity to weigh in
but moreover it appears to me that we simply just went through a process
about rules which  I thought was an absolute wonderful exercise but here
I see a little bit of a conflict and I’m not sure how input from the
publics, regarding this policy works at this current moment.  So
therefore I think we need  to, I think this is an absolute solution that
is really looking for a problem however that phrase goes. I can’t
support this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative.</p>

[Speaker changes.]...Bell.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. This would effect
Scenic??? and NCIE????? Am I right?   On the dues they collect...
[Speaker changes.] Probably would.
[Speaker changes.] Alright...ask the sponsor?
[Speaker changes.] Yeah...I didn't consider that but it probably would.
[Speaker changes.] I think it would because I know usually they have
payroll deduction at the Board of Education level and also some of the
Scenic workers have it where they work as well.
[Speaker changes.] Ok, members, the motion before us is for a favorable
report on House Bill 677.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chair?
[Speaker changes.] All in favor, say &quot;aye&quot;. (Ayes.) All
opposed. (NO) Division. All in favor, raise your right hand. You don't
know your right from your left, just raise a hand...(Laughter.) All
opposed, raise your hand. On the vote, 26 for and 15 against. The motion
passes. Next up is House Bill 480. Representative Millis, you are
recognized.
[Speaker changes.]Thank you, Mister Chair. Ladies and Gentlemen of the
committee, this bill that you have before you today is a bill that
really embodies what we're here for in regard to regulatory reform. In
regard to environmental regulations and our environmental regulatory
policy, this bill upholds the foundation to the protection to our
environment but actually looks to address the wavering regulatory
policies that provide regulatory uncertainly, a moving target, as well
as to provide regulatory efficiency for how that we address specifically
in regard to state storm water. I know that the committee is pressed for
time and there's other bills on the calendar so I ????? dive
specifically ?????????? but, one thing I would like to say and what this
bill does not do, this bill does not effect local governments. This is
specifically about state storm water. This is specifically about state
storm water requirements. The language that you see in regard to MDC,
which is Minimum Design Criteria; in addition, the language you see in
regard to fast track permitting is language that we took that was
already implemented by NCDiener?????? back in the early 90's in regard
to the permitting of sanitary sewer, gravity sewer and pump stations. So
we used language that was familiar to them.  There is nothing
significant in regard to those terms.  Currently, in regard to the
individual who is achieving or trying to achieve a regulatory storm
water permit, there's three pillars they hafta meet, whether they know
it or not.  That's statute, rules and policy.  This bill specifically
addresses regulatory policy. It does not further any statute authority.
It does not go into any aspect of any additional creation of rules.
It's specifically to address the policy.  In an effort to be brief,
Mister Chair, that concludes my comments and I'll be happy to dive into
the weeds and answer any questions.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you. Representative Dixon, we've got about
thirty seconds.
[Speaker changes.] For motion, proper time.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Harrison.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chair and thank you, Representative
Millis, for being so willing to work through concerns about this bill
and I guess I just have a coupla quick questions. You said it didn't
impact local storm water ordinances but to the extent that there's a
local storm water ordinance is stronger perhaps because of the
compliance with phase two. How does NDC interact with that?
[Speaker changes.] Currently in regard to local governments, you may
have some local governments that are delegated reviewers for the state
and they have delegated authority in order to review for state storm
water quality requirements. Currently they are reviewing to meet state
storm water requirements based on a BnP???????? manual...
