[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Graham, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen is recognized to speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you speaker Tillis, and thank you who is of general assembly for
allowing us to share. I want to tell you that I met Representative
Waynwright in the early 1990s. Both of us were considering it at that
time, seeking the seat of the house, which consisted of Lenoir, Craven,
and Pamlico County. A young man by the name of John Carman, who was an
attorney over at Craven County got in contact with an attorney in ?? by
the name of Harvard Beech, and stated that he had a free-in, someone
that he had met that he thought would be good for that particular job.
We set up a town hearing, a town meeting where Waynwright was brought
over and we would provide him an opportunity to speak and adjust the
crowd. Well, after about 10 or 15 minutes, everyone was standing up at
the top of the building. I was told, I don't know if Waynwright was
speaking or preaching, but I was asked to suspend my candidacy. Through
all those years, we all got behind him and we worked very hard for him,
and he had an opportunity to serve for some 22 years. I want to tell you
that he took care of Lenoir County, and Craven County, and Pamlico
County, and he was concerned about education, children, and medical
care. He was a man of God, and he just did the right thing. We're so
honored and please that he had an opportunity to represent East and
North Carolina in this ??. Thank you for sharing. Mr. Speaker, I commend
this resolution to the house. Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Szoka, please state your purpose. Representative Lucas,
please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen is recognized to speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen, Reverend Waynwright and I
share the same church in nomination. When I was first elected in '01,
Waynwright was one of the first persons to greet me on the floor and
say, &quot;Welcome, my Methodist brother.&quot; From then on, every day
that I greeted, or that I saw Representative Waynwright, it was always,
&quot;How are you, my Methodist brother?&quot; It's been on back and
forth each day of each session, so much so until Garland Pierce, I think
he got a little jealous and said, &quot;What is all this
Methodism?&quot;
Waynwright would always affectionately greet me, and I always called him
&quot;Bishop.&quot;</p>

[??] of his constituency and to the process and progress and greatness
of this community and state. His role as speaker pro temp, as deputy
minority leader, his leadership of the legislative black caucus and his
chairmanship of the finance committee. His commitment to education,
particularly the African-American male mentoring project in our
community college system, all the other benefits he received by those he
represented, a test to his unselfish character. His every action
indicates that the depth of the meaning of his life is unfathomable and
exhaustible and fertilizing from one generation to the next. Those of us
who survived must confront the power of his character and moral
presence. The force of his personality, the charisma of his being, the
creativity of his thought and the invincibility of his belief that God
called him and therefore he knew no fear in doing that which was right,
honorable and beneficial.
And when I talked to him on the last Thursday before he died, he
indicated to me that he knew what lay ahead, that he felt safe and
secure in the fact that he had indeed made a contribution. We did not go
into any detail but both of us knew that his life had not been lived in
vain. And I suspect on that Tuesday evening William looked towards
heaven and said precious lord take my hand, lead me on, let me stand. I
am tired, I am weak, I am worn. I've been through the storm, I've been
through the night, lead me on to the light. Precious lord take my hand,
lead me on. God took his hand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. There's an old saying that says
statesmanship is much harder than politics, because politics is the art
of getting along with people, statesmanship is the art of getting along
with politicians. And as I listen to the very eloquent remarks that were
put forth on this floor today it occurred to me that all of us in this
chamber share many things but one thing that we all serve is that each
one of us at one point or the other spent our first day on this floor.
And I can recall that for my first day on this floor that Representative
Wayne Wright was always a kind man, a man to whom you could turn for
advice. A man who would tell you the truth, sometimes he didn't give me
the answer that I had hoped he would give me but I knew the answer that
he gave was the truth. And as I look back and realize how truly
fortunate I am to have had the privilege and honor to serve with him for
ten years, I am truly thankful, and I commend this resolution to you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentleman of the
house I'm honored to support this resolution for a man who I cherished
as a genuinely good friend and loyal supporter. For more than two
decades I depended on Representative Wayne Wright as a source of
personal strength, and like most of you I was blessed by his wisdom his
guidance and his leadership. It really hasn't been the same for me since
his passing on July 17th, 2012, even though I occupy the seat that he
sat in. Wayne Wright and I spent a lot of time together and on most days
when we were in session, stayed in the same hotel, we ate breakfast
together, lunch and dinner. And like most good friends we didn't always
agree, didn't always see eye to eye but he always wanted me to see it
his way. He listened to me sometimes but he wanted me to listen to him
all the time. We worked together on many projects in the legislature and
the legislative black caucus and in the black caucus foundation. He was
our treasurer. He helped...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am one of those representatives who got appointed in
a short session in the interim so I have a little bit on the job
training before I had actually run for election and when I first came
into the chamber in 2004 I was to take the seat that was once held by ??
and he set up before the prime because he has been forever and ever and
I was petrified because I an gonna be sitting up in front and I didn't
know where I was who I was who any of these other people were but I had
the privilege though I didn't had the time to sit right in the
neighborhood I think it was either beside or behind representative Wayne
ride and you know how first impression really mean a lot to a person
when you are new. He would show me what I should be paying attention to
when it was time to push the button when we had those late late nights
where we didn't know when in the heck we are ever gonna get out of here.
He would make sure that we has an order coming up to us from the snack
bar. So I was always well fed always knew when it was time to vote and
he just made an incredible first impression on me and then he made a
lasting impression on me because when he prayed I knew that God was
listening. I remember so well one of the last prayers he prayed as
member of our carcass. He was invited to pray at one of our last carcass
gatherings before before the end of session outs last session. And I
just knew my first impressions will tell you that when he prayed God was
listening. I am going to miss and do miss representative Wayne Right and
I commend this resolution to body. Thank you.

years more than I am gonna speak to the freshman but freshman need to
pay attention. We sat here last year and we saw him wasting a what all

Wilson to myself travel to Wayne Right to polish North Carolina. He was
frail yet he took the mic to his school convention. I watched him held

the faith to hold on and that was so meanest to it's just encourage me
to be safe and I just believe they got to Wayne Right.</p>

Guilford had a bill the Town of Oakridge wanted in the Western part of
Guilford to have some ETJ to keep Turnersville from coming over, and
then we thought that was going to be enough, nothing, no opposition,
sail through the Senate, came over here, and Larry Brown fought that
think, and that's probably the maddest I've ever been in here over
Larry.  But it was all a fair fight, he just knew the issue better.  He
knew ETJ, he knew annexation, and he cause all kinds of headaches over
that.  And for few days I was so mad, but I learned one thing, and this
is very important for new members.  The wins come and go, the issues
change, and somebody who can be your biggest impediment, or your biggest
enemy one day, you might need them the next day, or the next week.  And
Larry was able to put that aside and we actually became good friends
after tangling so strenuously on an issue.  So that is something to
definitely learn, to put you battles behind you and move on, and don't
get permanently estranged from someone on a personal basis.  Larry also
could teach you that you've got to be careful what you put over an
email.  He did get in some trouble over an email one time.  But he was
very knowledgeable, he knew issues, he stood up for his people, he knew
issues, he studied issue, and he was tough.  And I can tell you he was
tough, because had he been back, he was going to do what 5 brave people
before him have just not been able to do.  He was going to go where
Representative West couldn't make it, tough Viet Nam veteran,
Representative Daughtry, veteran of the political wars of this chamber,
Representative Cleveland, Marine Corps retiree, you think he's tough,
Speaker Tillis, business man, IBM consultant, Representative Killian,
West Pointer, Airborne Ranger.  They had all been my seat mates and they
couldn't take it another term, but Larry Brown was going to do it, and I
hope the post Blust traumatic stress disorder didn't bother him too
much.  I fear for Representative Turner.  The Speaker in his wisdom, has
now put a female here.  But Larry made it.  I'm going to miss him, he
was a great member, and I commend the resolution to you.

Brown was one of the 3 Larry's in here.  Larry Bell, Larry Hall, Larry
Brown and Larry Wampo, yeah there are 4 of us, and we'd always talk
about that when we came to meet.  And he became a good friend of mine,
and as Representative Lewis mentioned, was a true statesman who'd reach
across the aisles and work with people, and he did just that.   He
reached across the aisles if he selected me and Prior Gibson to travel
with him to Taiwan.  First time I ever roamed that far away from home,
but it was a long trip and I enjoyed it and some of the other members in
the House went along with us.  And we were the only 2 Democrats to go on
that trip, Prior Gibson and myself.  And I think we made friends across
this aisle that last even to this day, and so I always thought of him
for that reason, and he kept me informed about the members that we met
there all the time.  He stayed in constant contact with some of the
officials Taiwan, and he would always send me pictures, whatever, and
news briefs about them.  So I was really sad to hear of his passing, and
he was a good friend and a good statesman as you said, and I commit the
resolution to you.

Of these legislatures who were here for the right reasons and both of
them serve as such a wonderful example to us. Larry came in with my
class, or our class, there's a few of us left that came in in 2005 and
when I came to the chamber, one of my major goals was probably my top
goal when I got here was annexation reform, and I knew there were a few
people in the chamber at the time who had been working for years,
tirelessly on that, some of those folks were getting ready to leave the
chamber. Little did I know, Larry Brown, when he came in, had the same
goal. We spent eight years, there were a number of legislatures that
worked on that issue. But I would have to say that no one worked any
more tirelessly on the issue of involuntary annexation and property
rights for the citizens of this state, than Larry Brown. He was dogged
for eight years and as representative Blust said we finally got it done,
and we thought we got it done in 2011. We did get it done in 2012. Put
the final stamp on that and I think that's a lasting legacy that will
live on in the memories of so many very grateful citizens all across
this state and it's wonderful to see legislatures that are trying to
promote goals that are beyond themselves that are not part of self
interests, but are goals that won't the best for the citizens of our
state. I think that Larry had that in his heart and he served with that
at the forefront of his mind and all of his actions. So ??
Representative Wainwright and Representative Brown, we miss them both
and we aspire to their example of servant leadership. Thank you!
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman's recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies
and gentlemen of the house, Larry Brown is my friend and I was glad to
serve with him as a colleague here. It's interesting to see the
different character and the nature that different members have. Some
people love to get up and holler and shout and scream to make their
point. Larry Brown had a quiet resolve about him. He proved that you
don't have to be loud to be heard. When Larry Brown spoke, people
listened. They knew that what he was getting ready to say was something
that was worth listening to. You didn't have to know Larry Brown very
long to understand that he was very devout in his faith. He loved the
lord with all his heart and he was unashamed in telling you that he was
a Christian. Larry Brown was a servant of the people. I don't know of
any member who I've ever served with who had more of a servant attitude
than Larry Brown. He always wanted to see what he could do to help you,
not what you could do to help him. Larry Brown was a man who never
wavered in his principles, or in his convictions. He would work with you
on an issue. He would try to come to an agreement with you on an issue,
but when it came to his core principles, he never compromised on what he
felt was the truth. Larry Brown was a very effective chair of the
government committee ?? he had a unique ability to chair with just a
quiet authority. Very confident in the knowledge that what he was doing
was right. Excuse me ?? rights. And as others have said, the annexation
reform was one of his burning issues and he spent years and years and
years seeing that the bill actually come to pass. But why was it that
Larry Brown was interested in annexation? It was because he wanted to
help members or individuals protect their property ?? have to go in and
do battle against the cities who have the resources that the average
citizen did not. You know, when I think about Larry Brown, I'm reminded
of a poem by Walter Foss and it says, &quot;Let me live in a house by
the side of the road where the race of men go by. The men who are good.
The men who are bad. As good, or as bad as I, I would not sit in this
corner seat, nor would I hurl the cynic's ban. Just let me live in my
house by the side of the road and be a friend to man.&quot; We all know
that Larry Brown was our friend and I don't know of any greater
compliment that we can pay to him. Mr. Speaker, I commend the resolution
to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Goodman, please state your
purpose.</p>

Thank you Mister Speaker. It is great to hear so many wonderful words
about Representative Wainwright and I would love to have said more but I
don't think I could have added anything to what was said. But I did want
to tell you about this one incident that happened to me right after I
was elected in 2010. I came up here to the legislative building and got
inside and was totally lost; was
walking around in circles and I ran into Larry Brown. And he asked me,
he could tell that I was confused.
He said &quot;What's going on?&quot; And I said &quot;I'm trying to find
the Speaker's office&quot;. And instead of saying &quot;Go up those
stairs, turn left four times, walk down three halls, turn right three
times and you'll find it&quot;, he took the time to walk me out there,
walk me up to the office and make sure I got in. And it was just a small
act of kindness but it meant so much to me as a new member here and it
really made me feel welcome. So I would like to commend the resolution
to you.

Thank you Mister Speaker. Members of the General Assembly, my life has

would have written something. But to have known Larry Brown, I came here
seven years ago and his office was two doors down from mine. And each
time I had a problem or anything I had to talk to, he was always there.
He also left to go to
Pinehurst. And one day I was in Pinehurst at a tag sale; many of you
many know about tag sales, but they're fun. I heard this lady say
&quot;Who has house number 44?&quot; And I told her &quot;It's me&quot;.
So I went over and I met his wonderful wife. She was on the phone to
him, wondering who I was, and we met there. And that was the last time I
got to talk to him and I talked on her phone to him and I miss him.
He was even our representative for part of Randolph County because when
I came they were having an annexation. ?? situation and the people were
calling me right and left. He said &quot;Have them call me. I'll explain
and I'll help you every way I can&quot;. And we did. We worked on ??
legislation every way we could and he did help mine. And he emailed my
people and he talked to my people on the phone and my life has been
enriched for having known him. And the people from Taiwan, his sister
city, they came to his funeral. They had a delegation there. And his
life has meant a lot to the people of Kernersville. Thank you.

representing the people. I will tell you that after I met him in '09
when we started a session we started, I started recognizing Larry at a
local restaurant that we would eat at on Monday nights. And I said, well
that's Larry Brown. He's in the House with me. And did not know that on
Monday nights we would eat at the same restaurant in the bar section and
always had a sandwich and that became, that we would meet on Monday
nights when we weren't in sessions with Martha, which he dearly loved,
and that was a nice event. I also come to find out that Larry had a
second home in Pinehurst and so, even though the district was
represented with Brubaker and no, I'm sorry, Hackney, Speaker Hackney
and myself and then when we found out we had a third, Representative
Brown was there because every issue that came up that dealt with Moore
County he knew about it and was telling me about it. It was great that I
had his knowledge. I learned a lot from him on the annexation, which he
was very passionate about, and it would just, unique relationship that
Larry and I had by being a resident there in Moore County as well. I got
a strange phone call one day and Larry asked me, he said, &quot;hey do
you want to go with me to Taiwan?&quot; I thought, &quot;well, you know
I, are you talking to me?&quot; And he said, &quot;yeah.&quot; And I
said, &quot;well, who else is going?&quot; He said, &quot;well, just me
and you.&quot; And I thought, &quot;well you know, this is, yes.&quot;
And so I did not turn him down and I will tell you that that was
probably one of the greatest trips that I've been on with Larry and I
will tell you that he was very respected by the Taiwanese people and
that he had a great relationship with them and with, through the state
of North Carolina at the House of Representatives. He introduced me to
several people that are from the Economic Cultural Office in Atlanta and
Larry had grown such a bond with North Carolina and the Taiwanian people
that the General Director, Anna Kao, called me two days before Governor
Pat McCrory was going to be at the Saturday inauguration and she said,
&quot;We want to come in respect to Larry Brown, to keep our
relationship with the Governor's Office.&quot; And I said, &quot;well
you fly in and when you get downtown you let me know and I will meet you
and I will try to introduce you to everybody. And Representative Stone
and myself, we met Anna, Director General Anna, and we got her hooked up
with Representative Fred Steen and they were able to meet with the
Governor, sit in the parade review, and also meet with the Lieutenant
Governor. And so Larry's legacy is still, will still live on as far as
his commitment and the relationship that he built with the Taiwan
Government. And at this time, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to, if I could, read
a letter that was sent overnight from the Director General please? From
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Atlanta, January 31, 2013,
the North Carolina House of Representatives. On behalf of the Republic

respect to the late Representative Larry Brown. Representative Brown was

the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the
House, most of you, probably three-quarters of you who were in
Appropriations today heard the explanation and discussion, so I will be
brief. What this bill does is it simply allows individuals in group home
who no longer qualify as of January 1 this year for personal care
services to be able to access temporary funds that run through the end
of June of this year, and these funds were put forward in our budget
bill last year for the purposes of allowing us to keep our adult care
homes as well as group homes and other long-term care facilities up and
running as we work though a host of industry issues, and we hopefully
will be  bringing some more permanent solutions to this body before the
end of this session.</p>

individuals in group homes to be treated the same way a similarly
situated individual in an adult care home would be treated with regard
to a loss of personal care services due to changes in federal
requirements and other requirements.  This just simply makes that clear
to the department to treat both those groups the same and follow the

[SPEAKER CHANGES} Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Members of the House, this
resolution before you today simply lays out the procedure whereby we
approve or confirm the appointments by the Governor to the State Board
of Education.  This was one of those processes that actually require a
joint session of both the Senate and the House and so what this does is
simply lay out the procedures where the President Pro Temp of the Senate
and the Speaker will pick a date to have that joint session and would
allow the process to move underway. There's a second resolution, I
believe it's 21, that actually calls for the confirmation of these
appointees.  The House Education Committee will be taking that up I
believe on Tuesday morning and that will be the actual substantive bill
that we have.  This is the procedural resolution.  Would encourage your
support. Be glad to answer any questions if there are any.  Thank you.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the house I stand before
you today in a red suit, not as a republican woman. I've been asked
several times today. But as a survivor of sudden cardiac arrest, and to
remind you and to ask you join with me and a lot of other people

day. This is the tenth day, the tenth year rather of the national wear
red day. It is awareness for women who suffer from heart disease, and to
let you know that heart disease is still the number one killer of women,
although a lot of women, and men don't believe that, that is the fact.
So this awareness that started ten years ago, is to help us to be
reminded that it causes 1 in 3 deaths each year. This means you my
fellow women, my colleagues, all of and to the men, all of our mothers,
wives, daughters, granddaughters, sisters, friends, are dying at the
rate of 1 per minute. Each year the first February, the first Friday in
February. Thousands of hospitals across the country, small businesses,
multi-national corporations, news broadcasters, schools, individuals,
and even landmarks go red to help raise awareness of this crucial
disease. The significant finds that we need to fight heart disease in
women, so I ask you to don your red ties, your red shirts if you're
playing golf, or if you working in the yard in the cold weather. And
women to put on your red clothes, it's a critical issue not to be made
lightly, but one that is a fact in women daily, thank you.
