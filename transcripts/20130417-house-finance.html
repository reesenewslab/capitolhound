In order for products to be accepted onto the GSA furniture schedule,
the company and the products must be vetted by the GSA program. So
first, the company bust be vetted for HR employment practises and being
in good standard. Second, the products must be vetted for meeting BIFMA,
GREENGUARD, the Trade Agreements Act and various other standards. Also,
the company is subjected to periodic audits by GSA. By way of
illustration, Bernhardt's contract furniture division, Bernhardt Design
currently has 388 chair skews, 181 table skews, and five cased goods
collections. If you look at the handout that has been submitted to you,
you'll see most of our products listed there. Of these, 298 chair skews,
76% of our chairs, 115 table skews, 63% of our tables, and three cased
goods skews, 60% of those collections, have been accepted into the GSA
program. In contrast, the state has only accepted ten of our current
skews for the qualified procurement list, or less than 3% of our chairs.
None of our tables and none of our cased goods collections. You'll see
the chairs that have been collected highlighted in a red block on that
handout. Despite having high quality current products that are made in
North Carolina by North Carolina workers and that are accepted into the
GSA furniture schedule, Bernhardt is unable to compete for most state
furniture requirements, contracts, and daily furniture business. House
bill 449 will provide Bernhardt and other similarly-situated North
Carolina furniture manufacturers with a greater opportunity to compete
for state requirements contracts while maximizing furniture products and
value available to state agents at no additional administrative costs to
the state. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I can't see why anybody would be opposed to
this bill so I'd like to move for a favorable on the PCS, unfavorable to
the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold that thought. Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've been working with Representative Starnes on this bill. Part of the
reason for qualified products in this state is due to the budgetary
cutbacks. It takes a long time to evaluate each piece of furniture and
each category and they have not been able to get as rapid a changeover
as business has changed. Therefore, to allow North Carolina vendors and
North Carolina vendors only to be able to be taken off of the GSA
contract to show that they have qualified in a certain level is very
good and I support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ma'am. Representative Howard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, please state your motion for the convenience of
the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to move for a favorable on the
PCS, the house bill 449 and unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, you've heard the motion. All in favor say aye.
 All opposed? Motion carried.

Representative Samuelson, house bill 135.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. He's let me go because staff has to leave on
this one. It's not very often that financees and ER-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move that we have PCS before us for the purpose of discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bless your heart, you've heard the motion on the floor. All in favor say
aye. All opposed? Motion carried. Thank you Representative Howard. My
trifocals are not working that fast this morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But the environmental review commission reviewed this bill. This goes
back to a legislation that we passed a couple of years ago that allowed
for permit for landfills to be permitted on a ten-year cycle rather than
a five-year cycle, but before we could do it on a ten-year cycle that
was held until the rules were formatted for how we would do the ten-year
permit and what the fees would be. So they now put this in place. It is
neutral. It is technically revenue neutral, however, there is a fiscal
note that will show- and I had it right here, what's changing is the
timing of the fees, because whether you do a five-year cycle or a
ten-year cycle, you're permit fees will be the same, it's just the
timing will be off. So what you see on your fiscal note- do they have
copies of the fiscal note? Okay, thank you. We see in the fiscal note is
the first five years, they will be increasing collections. If you could
see the next five years, you could see that the next five years, the
collections are down by the exact same amount that they were up the
first five years because they've gone from a five to ten year cycle,
but's technically revenue neutral and I urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions, comments from the committee? Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We heard this bill in environment, I think we
got all of the questions answered so I'd like a motion if it's the
proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions from the committee? It's the proper time.
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to move for a favorable for house bill
135.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, you've heard the motion on the floor. Any
further discussion? All in favor say aye. All opposed?</p>

Motion carried. Sold. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill, Senate Bill 56, the Wallace satellite annexation. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, members of the committee. This is a bill
that ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Your mike’s not on, my friend. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, members of the committee. This bill is a
perfect example of good cooperation between city, developer and tenant.
It allows the town of Wallace to annex lots in this particular
development as they come onboard. There is no opposition to this at all.
It passed the Senate unanimously, I ask for your support. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair.
At the appropriate time, I’d like to make a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions from the committee? Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I make a motion for a favorable report on Senate Bill
56. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, you’ve heard the motion
on the floor. Any further discussion. If not, all in favor say aye. All
opposed? Motion carried. Thank you Representative Dixon. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, members of the committee. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We appreciate you being here. At this time we will have House
Bill 336. Representative Conrad. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. House Bill 336 has been filed at the request of the University
of North Carolina, school of the arts, and we do have here Mr. Jan
DeCristo this morning if you have any questions. He is Director of
Economic Development and External Affairs at the school. Prior to the
session, the entire local delegation met with the school of the arts and
this bill was their request and you can see that it’s also sponsored by
Representative Lambeth who’s here today, Representative Hanes,
Representative Terry, and also Senator Parmon and Senator Brunstetter
are supporting it in the Senate. We are very proud to have the school of
the arts in Forsythe County. It opened in 1965 and it’s very unique in
the university system in that it has a high school component. They have
about, average about 200 in-state students and between 50 to 70
out-of-state students. The students in the high school, they are
required to take all the credits that a normal high school student would
take, in English, math science, social science and foreign language. But
of course, they choose to choose the high school because they are very
gifted in some area of the arts, drama, music or dance. And they want to
get this concentration in the arts and then the high school also has a
component where they do a lot of performances, which of course causes
the expense of the high school component of the school of the arts to be
perhaps greater than a normal high school. Up until the year 2000, the
in-state high school students were charged a tuition. The General
Assembly in the year 2000 decided to appropriate enough money that
in-state students would go at no charge to the school of the arts. Well
we know that in the last few years, there have been appropriation
challenges and the full complement of money for the in-state high school
students has not been granted to the school of the arts. I think it
mentions this on the PCS but the cost of all the fees and education for
the in-state students totals around 2 and a half million dollars, but
they’ve only been appropriated in the most recent year about 1.9 million
dollars, leaving a gap of about 500,000 dollars. Now they’ve been
covering this gap by using money from the undergraduate and graduate
programs. But the intent of this bill is that they would like to
reinstate charging tuition, of course the exact amount which would be
the bridge gap, would be established by the UNC board of governors and
the board of trustees of the University of North Carolina school of the
arts. And they have also assured us that if this amount of money is
difficult for any of the students that of course there is financial aid
or scholarships that would be available. And happy to answer any
questions or as I said Jim DeCristo is here as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion, at the
appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Actually, I have several quick
questions if the gentleman will yield, be patient with me. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Absolutely. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative, I may
have missed this. Did you say if the charges would be based on the
difference between funding, so would there be a difference between
in-state and out-of-state fees? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. The out-of-state
students pay quite a bit. They pay, their tuition is $10,571.</p>

?? just with the tuition. And if they stay on campus and take a full
meal plan, that’s about an additional combined total of about $9000, so
out of state is close to around, rounding it off, about $20,000. For
in-state, the gap would be, and the numbers that I had from the school
is a little different from the summary, but around $2500, but again,
this bill does not set that amount. That would be for the UNC Board of
Governors to actually set a dollar amount. This just allows the school
to reinstate some tuition amount for in-state high school students.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess the only other question I have is how this course fits into
Representative Carney’s bill that requires an art class or something for
graduation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, they have about five hours a day of intense training in the arts,
which is why they choose to go to the school of arts, because you can’t
get that at a traditional high school.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think they would be very overqualified as far as the credits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Representative Conrad for mentioning
the point that the financial aid is going to be available, I think, for
many of us in the House Education committee. This was a key point that
no one, because of income, not be able to attend the school with these
fees and I appreciated that there were people from the school who talked
very explicitly about that. Thank you for working on that and I support
your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Representative, I know the school of Arts is looking for the most
talented across the nation and I’m sure they would not deny access to
someone who had extraordinary talent it a particular area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney, your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Just a question then. This bill is intended to bridge the gap
between funding of the General Assembly and the actual cost, so do you
envision the School of the Arts will be self sustaining then?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
JIm, would you like to answer? I believe so. This is just for the high
school.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right I understand that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you will please state your name for the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Jim DeCristo and I’m the director of external affairs at the
UNC School of the Arts. As far as self sufficient, I mean, we would be
self sufficient in the fact that we would close the gap and would still
be receiving the appropration from the general Assembly that is used to
cover the fees that were waved in 2001. It definitely is part of our
plan to improve our self sustainability and if that gap was to continue
to grow over time and give us the ability to keep that gap closed and
make sure that we’re not charging those costs on to our graduate and
undergraduate programs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow up then. So basically if the General Assembly appropriates
less money to the School of the Arts, the tuition charged to the
students would increase.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It not…the fee charge. We’re not talking about tuition. But the fee
charge would increase as that gap increases. If the General Assembly
would give us more approprations then those charges would go down. If
the appropriation was equal to the cost, we would not charge any.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks for that, Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, I will add that this will not take effect until
the year 2014 - 2015, not for the current class coming in this fall. I
believe also, when I met with the School of the  Arts, they did say that
this concept has been vetted with the student and they understood the
necessity and wanted to keep the standards of the school high so that
there was not an objection from the student body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Maybe to the gentleman. Can you give me the
breakdown of the amount of instate student versus the amount of out of
state students.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It varies every year, obviously, but it’s about 200 in state student in
our high school to about 50 to 70 out of state students every year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I like the policy of this, but has somebody on staff looked at whether
you can actually charge fees to public high school students?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They used to charge
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Griffin, excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, there is some case law that we looked at, there was
a challenge to some fees that were charged back, I think it was in the
early 80s in a Greensboro school and the court concluded that reasonable
fees that were associated were acceptable, but there also had to be some
sort of a policy to accommodate students who couldn’t afford them. There
was a case on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions from the committee. Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the Representative bringing this
forward.</p>

although I would like to see the students not have to pay it is a public
high school but I do think it's an exceptional school, and if you
haven't visited it you should. I had a niece and nephew to graduate from
there and it's an amazing school nationally recognized. So with that Mr.
Chairman, I move for a favorable report for House bill 436.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, you've heard the motion on the floor. Any
further discussion?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed? Motion carried. Thank you. Glad to have you again Rep.
Conrad.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thank you so much, this bill is one that is near and dear to my heart
and I've been waiting 18 years to have the opportunity to file it. If
the title seems familiar, to those of you who were here last session,
former Rep. Del Fallwell presented a bill with the same title,
addressing more disclosure on bond indebtedness but it was unsuccessful
in getting a  favorable report. The process for authorizing general
obligation bond debt in North Carolina is founded on sound principles
and is well run by the state treasurer's office, but I always felt that
we had been lacking in transparency to the citizens. Since general
obligation bonds are issued on full faith and credit, elected officials
have the authority to pay back these bonds by taxing the citizens, and
as former Rep. Falwell said to me the other day, the people who know the
less about the bond process are the ones who are obligated to pay for
it. I was a county commissioner in Forsythe for 18 years, and of course
as a county commissioner I had to consider adoption of many bond orders
during that time for school construction, libraries, and community
college needs, and each time I was very outspoken on the need for
complete transparency on the ballot, and also when each of the steps and
public process on the way to the ballot. My main concern was that in the
public notices and particularly on the ballot question, that only the
bond principle amount is emphasized with little or no mention of the
interest paid on the bonds, which as you know is a considerable amount.
I originally as Del did wanted to place the exact dollar amount,
estimated amount, of interest in addition to the principle on the ballot
for full disclosure to the citizens and of course still wish this was
possible. But there were a lot of objections from bond council and the
treasury. So I decided to work with all the stakeholders to come up with
a compromise  and you have the PCS before you At the stakeholders'
meeting with the League of Municipalities, the North Carolina
Association of County Commissioners, representative of the treasury
department Vance Holloman, Tony Solari, we had a couple bond counsels
there including Tom Lee, my own finance director from Forsyth county and
I think we have come up with a very good bill. The interest of course
has to be estimated and it will be if you look at the bill in sections
1, 2, and 3. It has to be estimated because you know there are many
factors between the time of the passage of a bill or referendum and the
time the bonds could be issued. Interest rates can be changed, the bond
rating of the government entity could change, you have up to 7 ears to
issue the bonds, so during that period of time of course interest rates
could change and also it occurred to my county, if you have a large
school board referendum, we would not issue the bonds all at one time,
we might do them over a period of 7 ears in parcels of 2 or 3, so there
are a lot of factors that make the interest estimated.
There's also of course the option of running out the clock. If you don't
want to issue the bonds at all. The committee substitute bill beefs up
the disclosure of the estimated interest cost, and requiring the
publication of those cost in the authorization process. Sections 1, 2,
and 3 cover those steps, from the introduction of the bond by the
elected bodies finance officer to the publication by the clerk of the
bond order, and also through the adoption the adoption of the bond order
by the elected body. Note that there's also a statement in each section,
the validity of the bonds authorized by the order is not subject to
challenge on the ground that the actual interest cost of the bond when
issued is different than the amount set forth in the statement. This was
was put in there to address the concerns of the Bonds council, that a
citizen might in some way want to file a law suit down the road, that if
the actual estimated interest was different</p>

...than the interest at the time of issuance. I felt that only probably
a small percentage of the population may actually may be informed by
steps 1, 2, and 3 so, to me, the most important part of this bill is
section 4. This deals with the ballot question. In the past the ballot
question was very minimal, very short, just mentioned the principal bond
interest and do you approve and that was basically it. And, again, I
was, as a County Commissioner who had to review the language that would
go on the ballot, I was very frustrated at the inability to put more
language on the ballot.  If you'll look at lines 41 to 44 this is the
new language, and the new pieces are underlined, &quot;Shall the order
authorizing,&quot; and then you have the blank, &quot;for the principal
amount of the bonds plus interest.&quot; This is a new statement,
&quot;For,&quot; and of course for library, schools, whatever it is
would go into the parenthesis, and then the additional new language,
&quot;and providing that additional taxes may be levied in an amount
sufficient to pay the principal of, and interest on the bond be
approved.&quot; This is just for transparency. I know during my long
time as County Commissioner a lot of citizens really didn't understand
the bond process. From the comments they made to me, and I just felt
that as an elected official it was my duty to make them at least have
more information before making that decision. It's not there to dissuade
them one way or the other to vote for or against the bond. It's strictly
for transparency. There are some, I believe they were here, Bill McGee
and Tony Solari from treasury. Everyone has reviewed the (I see, Tony,
he's back there) the PCS and on board with this compromise language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions from the committee? Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanted to ask a question of Mr. Lee who I saw in the back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Lee would you approach the mic, state your name and department for
the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, my name is Tom Lee with Womble Carlyle Practices as bond counsel a
lot of state and local government bond issues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Lee we've heard that all the stakeholders were involved. Last year
when we heard this bill bond counsel was very, very concerned about it
because they thought that it was going to represent something that might
not be true and there were going to be a lot of different problems. Are
you satisfied with this version of the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I am, and I have shared this with several of the other bond law
firms in North Carolina that do the kind of work that I do. And,
everyone from the legal side is, at least if anybody is dissatisfied
they haven't told me. And they've been given the opportunity to tell me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Than you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Ross. Mr. Lee. First off I want to thank Tom
Lee for being part of the process
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question for Mr. Lee. If the bill had gone forward in its
original form, and there was actually an estimated, that's call an
estimated amount of interest, what could be the possible basis of a
lawsuit if the estimate didn't work out to contract a reality? How, How
would someone be harmed if it had clearly been on the ballot as
estimated? That's just...I've just been baffled by the fact that that
would cause such a stir - the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The longstanding principle in North Carolina has been that what's on the
ballot question that goes to the voters as a contract between those
voters and that unit of government. All the bond counsel who looked at
this last year were very concerned that if we put an estimated amount
then that becomes part of the contract or at least if we, well, let me,
that becomes part of the contract and that if, for any number of
reasons, the amount of interest that is going to be due on those bonds,
which could range from, like Representative Conrad said: from the terms
of the bonds, where tax rates are, whether the bonds are tax exempt or
taxable bonds, whether or not their variable rate. There are any number
of factors, the credit of the union, all of those that can go into it
that if we have a significantly higher number then that breaches the
contract. That's the . . . The voter's can say, &quot;I was fraudulently
induced into this contract.&quot; Now, if we could write about a
question that is this long me might could handle all that and I think
the bond holders could get satisfied, maybe not, but what we try to do,
through this process, is to keep the ballot question much shorter, but
separately in the process put those estimates, into the process but also
. . .</p>

Put them in places where we can state the various assumptions that go
into how we determine this interest rate to give the qualifications that
I just mentioned that are a number of reasons why this may not hold up.
What we're trying to do is bring certainty to the entire prices, so
that, if I buy this bond, I don't have to worry that it may get
challenged later because of something that was in a bond ballot question
ten years earlier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Excellent answer. Thank you. And I mean that sincerely.
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think my question is for staff, and it is a
question concerning the difference in the language in the original bill
and in the committee substitute as to the ballot question, the
precision. And I guess the question is this: In the original bill, it
seems to me that's straightforward and basically lets the public know
what's going on, and I think that's a good idea. In the PCS on Page 2,
Line 33 and 34, there is a phrase &quot;providing that
additional&quot;…. essentially, does the voter understand that
additional taxes may be levied, providing… actually, providing that
additional taxes may be levied are not sufficient to pay the principal
of an interest on the bonds we have approved. My question is, that's the
law. Why would we need to put that additional phrase on there? I mean,
clearly, if there's not enough … You've got to pay the bonds just like
you've got to pay the bills for the Department of Social Services. I
guess my question is, how does that improve the bill, or even is it
necessary to have that language?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I felt that was an essential--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to ask staff about the difference between putting that on
or not and whether… My concern isn't that it's already in the law and
it's misleading, as if there's going to be a tax referendum or something
later. Miss Griffin, if you could address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, I think that the question speaks to
Representative Conrad's point about transparency. I think that you're
correct that it is, in fact, the law, and so I think to restate it
simply restates the law. I think the issue was that, in discussions
about this bill, that there was concern that a lot of taxpayers may not
be aware of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, this goes back to my experience as the county commissioner. It's
not that citizens are not knowledgeable. They have buys lives, and they
don't really know the intricacies of bonds. We've had citizens come up
to me and say, &quot;I didn't know that we had to pay the bonds.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want it very clear for them. In Forsythe County, we do what's
called a debt levy plan now, where there's an immediate tax increase,
even before the bonds are issued. We want them to know to expect a tax
increase so that they won't be surprised.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Conrad. Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As a further example, some voters, Representative Luebke, including some
legislators, think that bonds are like manna from heaven that just
appears at you don't have to pay. As a matter of fact, at the federal
level, some people think that borrowing money from China never has to be
repaid, and it's therefore free money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a comment. I'm thrilled now that the bill
now doesn't create legal problems. But I do think that it's going to
create infrastructure problems. It think that fewer bonds are going to
pass, and we're going to have less infrastructure. I will say, though,
more bonds might pass in our cities, so this will be another situation
where our cities will have amenities  and many of our rural area will
not. I think that that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Bill Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Carney and I were laughing over
some previous experiences. There was a situation in Mecklenburg County
early in the '90s when people all of a sudden realized bonds did need to
be paid back, and a bond referendum in 1993 just barely passed. Schools,
libraries, parks got slaughtered. When we did bond referendums in 1995,
1997, 1998 when I was a park commissioner. We put out literature that
said what the expected cost of the bonds would be and what the maximum
tax increase, assuming no other</p>

Money was found from retiring earlier bonds and could do a full
disclosure. Now that also allowed us to get votes from people who had
taken the no tax increase pledge because the people were fully informed.
It also led to discussions about the bonds. There was a lot more sense
of openness and those bond referendum than in the past by huge margins
where they had previously failed. I think the comment about people being
surprised that they have to pay the bond back is a surprising number of
people that don't realize their taxes might go up to pay for the bonds
and by putting it out there and having the full discussion it also cuts
the legs out from under groups that will come in at the last with attack
ads to try to overcome the bonds. The conversation is fuller. We were
very successful. I'm a conservative republican. Representative Carney is
less conservative than I and not a republican. We agreed on this. We
worked together. And we were very successful. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could we
please ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley, please speak for
yourself. Representative Samuelson. Oh, Representative Hager. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this bill is a good bill. I
appreciate Representative Conrad bringing it to us. You know, if we give
more information to our taxpayers and to our constituents, why is that a
bad thing? You know, if we give more information same as we'd expect if
we go out and take a personal loan on a mortgage or a car, why is it,
I'm trying to figure out, why is that a bad thing. And the last thing
I'll say as Representative Brawley keeps talking is, the other thing
I'll say is that if we don't vote on parks and our citizens don't vote
on parks and infrastructure, why is that a bad thing? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Hager. Representative Collins, I believe you
had a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to make a comment and then a
motion if we could. [SPEAKER CHANGES] By all means. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know I've got a lot of confidence in our people in the rural areas.
I live in a fairly rural county and I don't think our folks will be
harmed at all by additional information. Personally I wouldn't care if
the, in fact the only problem we have in my county is that folks have
improved so many bonds that we have no limit left. We're at our limit.
So it's not like rural counties don't want to improve their situations.
Those of us that live in areas like that know that. I don't care if the,
you know personally I wouldn't care if the ballot was a page long when I
sign I'd like for it to have the type of information that we have when I
buy a house where I know up front how much money I'm going to pay and
that contract is several pages long and I look through that pretty
carefully to see what the total amount of money is going to be, but if
this is a compromise we can get as one of those who was a primary
sponsor of Representative Falwell's bill last time, I certainly move
that we at least give our tax payers this much information. That we give
a favorable report to the Proposed Committee Substitute on House Bill
248, unfavorable to the original. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Blust. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff, are these kinds of disclosures, aren't
they required for consumer loans? Disclosure of the amount, the total
amount you have to pay back including interest? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam I think can answer your question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've done about 3,000 of those closings with the truth in lending. Yes,
the total amount is there, but what is also there that I think is more
important is the interest rate. Frankly, I think the interest rate is
more significant to the consumer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative. Committee, we have a motion on the floor. All in favor
say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed. Motion
carried. Thank you, Representative Conrad. Representative Tim Moore.
House Bill 409. Like they say on The Price is Right, come on down.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative Moore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This should be the easiest bill
of the day. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, we anticipate that with trepidation.
That statement always brings fear. Please continue. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. This is an deannexation bill for the city of Shelby.
Technical Classical Academy is a new charter school that is located in
Cleveland County and they are waiting to close on property that is
described also in this deannexation request to construct a charter
school. It consists of roughly 56.38 acres. The city of Shelby, where
the land presently is, has passed a resolution, I have a copy of that
here, concurring and consenting to the deannexation of property. I have
a letter from the city manager and also from the mayor. This is a,
everybody's in complete agreement, I told my good friend Mr. Stone over
there that</p>

We’re not Buncombe and Lee county, we don’t like to fight all the time.
We all just get along in Cleveland county. The reason they’re wanting to
de-annex is they’re going to qualify for financing through the USDA and
to get that you have to be in a county, you can’t be in a city limits.
Sorry we don’t have quite the drama you guys do, Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, just hide and watch, you never know what happens next.
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To make a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Starnes.  Representative Moore, we’re not done
with you yet. We haven’t finished with you…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Because charter schools are public schools, typically they are exempt
from ad lorem taxes, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s my understanding, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, I know you like my questions and amendment so
much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tickled to death.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We had this in government, Representative Moore, as you remember, and I
don’t think you could explain then, why does the city need to de-annex
this. I think it’s along the lines of Representative Stanes’ question.
It’s already, the school would be exempt from ad lorem taxes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, he wasn’t in the Government Committee, another
member presented it for him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I wasn’t then that day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone presented it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize then, I thought you had. But again, as Representative Stanes
say, if it’s not subject to ad lorem anyway as a charter public school,
why the deannexation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It has to do with the financing that they’re going through. They
have...they’re receiving financing through the USDA and to receive that
financing that can’t be in the city limits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions for the committee? I know there’s a motion out
there somewhere. Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move that we give a favorable to House Bill 409.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, you’ve heard the motion on the floor. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed. Motion carried. Thank you, Representative Moore.
Representative Tine, House Bill 242. We have a proposed Committee
Substitute. Representative Moffitt moves the proposed Committee
Substitute before us for discussion only. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, motion carried. Thank you. Representative Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m afraid to touch the mic. I’m not sure where Representative Moore
touched it, but…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He has been under the weather.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Adjusting the mic to make sure that ….
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ll spray you with Lysol when it’s over.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This bill is the result of a contact
that I received from the local fire department shortly after beginning
the session that was having a difficult time getting a tax refund on
their sales tax. I contacted the Department of Revenue and it took a few
weeks but they figured out a fix to be able to get it back to them. I
just asked simply how do we fix this so we don’t have to keep going
through this type of process. Found out that in 2009 we intended to fix
this issue by basically just saying that the fire departments and EMS
have to be tax exempt, but then we realized that that IRS no longer
requires that you apply for tax exempt status or to be a 501c3. This
first fix went to Government and it went through and then Representative
Howard very accurately recognized that the first fix made it too broad
and that we might include some folks we didn’t intend to include, so
this fix says you can either be tax exempt or financially responsible to
a city or county. I’m ready for any questions that you may have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s an open ended statement. Representative Waddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney. Representative Moore. Representative Waddell,
it’s the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I move that we give a favorable report to House Bill 242
to PCS. The Committee Substitute 242. I think it’s referred to
Government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s already been there thank God.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’ve heard the motion on the floor. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed. Motion carried. Before we adjourn, I have one announcement,
I know you all going be tickled to...thank you Representative Tine.
There has been a subcommittee appointed to deal with de-annexation
bills. I know you’re all tickled to death to hear that. Representative
Stone, you’ll be the chair. Members of the committee, Representative
Blust, myself, Representative Tines and Representative Hanes. We
appreciate you all’s willingness to serve. The bills that have bee4n
appointed to that committee, House Bill 500, 567, 568, 245, and 260.
Also for information of the committee, I’d like for you all to keep
Representative Robert Brawley in your thoughts and prayers. He is
currently at Wake Med and he is going to have to undergo a stress test.</p>
