[Speaker changes.]...away in last year's law so this is not about overly
restrictive zoning regulations. And, if the airport is no longer in the
city, city police and fire service will no longer be available on the
same basis, which is not a positive step for a regional metropolitan
airport serving an urban area and the city would experience a loss of
revenue from property taxes collected on the facilities at the airport
of about $193,000 annually and in a budget that isn't all that large,
this is a chunk out of their budget...but for $193,000 annually, are you
going to allow a piece of property and a building that was established
in the 1950's by the city of Asheville acting alone to be taken out of
its corporate limits. I ask you to really, seriously consider this.
After the string of bills that you have seen come before this committee
all session long, are you going to allow this &quot;one more thing&quot;
to the tune of $193,000 hit to the budget in Asheville to happen. I ask
you to oppose this legislation. Thank you very much.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, madam.  Next, Representative Moore?
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chair...question for the bill's
sponsor, please.
[Speaker changes.] Representative McGrady, the property taxes being
collected by the city...what has been the relationship of the city, as
far as development in support of the airport over the period of time
that they've had?
[Speaker changes.] The lady from Buncombe states it properly in terms of
the role that the city initially played in the operation and founding of
the airport. Subsequently, the airport was operated by a regional
authority set up by contract and, more recently, the airport is operated
by a regional authority established in law. The airport over years began
to provide some of its own sets of services and..including fire and
police and, more recently, solid waste and lighting and a whole range of
other things...and then, by statute, as the lady stated,  we...last
year...took away the zoning responsibilities of the city from the
airport so, at this point in time...again, sort of in theory...because
it, in fact, doesn't have to happen...fire and water services, excuse
me...fire and police services are not in any active basis, provided by
the city to the airport.  And the issue here in part is that the...you
know you've got a lot of plane owners and car companies and other things
that are paying taxes for basically no services.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Representative McGrady. Any other
questions from the committee.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman? I'm over here again.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Fisher?
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. And I will add that one
of the sort of byproducts of the passage of this is that in potential
disaster situations or emergency situations, throughout the history of
the airport, businesses in Asheville, emergency services in Asheville
have come to the aid of the airport.  I can remember a pretty
significant crash at the Asheville airport where the whole city and
businesses in the city rallied to come to the aid of the airport. That
would no longer exist...and the ability for them to supply emergency or
disaster coverage from the city services, Asheville police and fire with
this, would be hampered. You know, I really think that we, as a
committee have probably been overtired by a lot of the bills that have
come through here...that seem to be very pointed in the direction of
Asheville. I'm not sure why this is occurring but I really think that,
for $193,000, the...</p>

away from the ashville city budget, this bill is just not necessary, and
i would ask you to oppose it, thank you
[change speaker]
representative mcgrady response please
[change speaker]
what the lady has said, regarding the provision of fire services, or
emergency services to the airport, just isn't true. When the plane crash
occurred, that the lady referred to, in fact fire and police responded
from all areas, including my own county and that will continue to occur
no matter what happens. The only thing that I would add in closing here
is that when we crafted the original airport authority bill a portion of
the (silence) proving this because the city, at least initially has not
been at all cooperative in its transfer of the property. I will state
for my colleagues and for the ladies purpose, if we pass this bill out
and it makes it over to the senate and in fact the city is fully
cooperative in moving the airport property appropriately to the
authority, this bill will probably never become law, but it appears that
the city will not do anything in a cooperative and colleaguel fashion
and therefore these types of bills have to move forward, and I apologize
for that
[change speaker]
thank you representative mcgrady, representative wilkins
[change speaker]
thank you mr chair, representative mcgrady, you just mention cooperative
and you mentioned collegual and cooperative fashion, and you said that
ashville has failed to be cooperative in all attempts, cooperative with
whom? the rest of us don't know
[change speaker]
respond representative mcgrady
[change speaker]
when we passed the original airport authority bill, i drafted a large
portion of the bill, I went out of my way to make sure that there was no
negative financial impact upon the city if ashville, by de-annexing
property, but subsequent to the passage of the bill, it became law. The
city of ashville had to cooperate with the authority itself to transfer
the property because it required FAA approval, and the city, at least
initially bocked. I will tell you most recently within the last several
months, curiously upon the filing of this bill, we've gotten a new level
of cooperation, and today I don't have any complaints with the city of
ashvilles cooperation in trying to resolve the issues with the FAA, and
that's why i said that my hope is that this bill never becomes law, but
if we get back in the situation we were in, where the city isn't
cooperating with the FAA, then this law may be necessary.
[change speaker]

just one and im going home here in a bit, is this the last actual bill
we are going to see this session?
[change speaker]
mr chair that's the wrong person to ask

<p id="15:00">
Thanks Mr. Chair, to committee members. I stand in presenting Senate
Bill 177 today. And this is a local bill that impacts the town of
Hookerton and Maysville. What it would do is extend or relax the
satellite ?? rules. In the case of Hookerton, to allow them to annex a
park in a water town area. In the case of Maysville, a economic
development park. The bills have unanimous support in the Senate
resolutions and support of our municipalities. From Senator Brown, who
represents Maysville is in full support of it. And I ask for your
support today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator. Do you know of any
opposition to the bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No opposition. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Ford. Any other questions from the
committee? Representative Ford. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. I noticed on this bill you list some of my towns on here. I
don't see Sulsberry. I'm a little worried from time to time about
satellite annexations. Because then we get back to the donut holes and
everything else, and how far is the satellite annexation, and I just
don't want it affecting my area anymore. We've had major problems with
that. So what's going on here with some cities listed and others not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative what that means is your city has
already taken advantage of this. This bill does not add to yours, it was
already done in the past. This now allows my city and Senator Brown's
city to be added to the list to take advantage just as yours did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions?
From the committee? Representative Floyd, you're recognized for a
motion. Ladies and gentleman we have a motion for a favor report. All in
favor say aye, any opposition? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you so much
committee, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, the ayes have it.
Ladies and gentlemen, next we have a House Bill 569, fox fire satellite
annexation. Representative Bowles, you have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. This would permit the village of Fox Fire to
volunteer annex potion of a subdivision. There's a horse farm and
they've already extended the utilities.
And asked that their develop they're coming in to the city limits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Setzer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At the
appropriate time, in spite of that tide, I'd like to make a motion for
favor of report. But it's for the children. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just
wanted to make sure the chair says you're not talking about his tie. ??
Questions from the committee? Representative Floyd. Representative,
please mash the button so we can all [SPEAKER CHANGES] The location of
Fox Fire, is that even favorable? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ah yes, is ??
between Favol and East Over in Cumberland County. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's
in Moore County [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you there again. Now any other
questions from the committee? All the motion before Representative... ??
You're recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move for a favorable report for House Bill 569. Refer to the committee
on finance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman, you heard the
motion. All in favor say aye, any opposition. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Chair and committee, and I look forward to representing ??
finance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The eyes did have it. Ladies and gentleman,
next we have up will Senate Bill 297. Senator ??, You have the floor
maam. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning, ?? Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One
second, I'm sorry. We do have a PCS before us to present the motion. So
moved. All in favor say aye. The ayes have it PCS is before us. You may
resume. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair and committee, Senate
Bill 297 would allow the city of Wingston Salem to do economic
development projects in distressed areas as long as 50% of the funds
used are not city funds and they would not.
This would exempt them from having to do use the contact requirement and
at sunsets in July 2018. This would allow our city to go into areas
that's in economic distress and do some economic development activity.
It only impacts once</p>

[speaker changes]
Ladies and gentleman, we have a motion for favorable report. All in
favor say aye. Any opposed? Thank you, the ayes have it.
[speaker changes]
Thank you.
[speaker changes]
Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, next we have up, Senate Bill 547.
Senator Hunt.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Chair and members. The purpose of this bill 547 is to
allow DOT to raise the speed limit to 100 miles per hour. Energy saving
contracts is what this is all about. Basically, this allows the state
energy office to issue contracts based on RFQ as opposed to an RFP.
Energy saving contract, some of y'all may not know what that is, it's
just allows governmental agencies to allow energy saving contracts with
contractors and the contractors guarantee a certain savings to the
governmental agency. They have to back up that guarantee with a letter
of credit or some kind of binding capacity. The reason for making this
change from an RFP to an RFQ is because it costs these vendors a lot of
money to actually go in there and do the estimate and figure out exactly
what is needed to do this work on the individual buildings. In one case,
I'm aware of the vendor spent $100,000 to go through and evaluate the
energy savings measures and design them and it cost them $100,000 and
then they did not get the job and that has happened several times
throughout the state.  The second part of the bill stipulates that it
limits the ?? performance of energy conservation measures by the UNC
system schools. NCSU has been allowed to do these contracts, and this
bill would actually terminate that  ability except that they would be
able to continue the contracts they already have and to continue the
contracts being negotiated as long as they are financed by the end of
2014.  This bill has passed unanimously in the senate and I'd appreciate
y'alls support.
[speaker changes]
Thank you there Senator. Questions from the committee?
[speaker changes]
over here.
[speaker changes]
Representative Holley.
[speaker changes]
Thak you Mr. Chairman. A RFQ for the benefit of the committee, is a
request for quote. RFP is a request for proposal.
[speker chagnes]
Qualifications RFQ. Request for qualifications.
[speaker changes]
Of the one for request for qualifications. The problem - the only
problem that I have basically with this is that it is counter to the
state's established procurement process and when you start going out and
making exceptions to the state's established procurement process, it can
cause problems and then it does this domino effect. If you allow it in
one area, will you allow it in another area? I got a little bit of
reservation here. I understand what you're trying to do. I see that
you're trying to limit it to when you have a mandatory site visit or to
a ??, but every business person that makes a bid to the state knows, or
makes a bid to any entity takes on the financial responsibility of what
it takes to make that bid. It is part of their cost of doing business.
We can't --</p>

<p id="25:00">
Well, it's going to cost me some money to give you an estimate, so I
should automatically get in here without that. I have some reservations.
I'd like to see it tightened up a little bit to address that if
possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You may respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
A good example of why I think this is needed is to compare these energy
saving contracts to DOT contracts. You know, when DOT lets a contract,
they have done the design work. So the vendor of the contractor knows
exactly what he's bidding on, he doesn't have to design it. So he can
just, you know, what's the cost of concrete, what's the cost of labor.
In this case, the vendor has to actually go design the project, and
that's what is very time consuming and very costly. And that's the
reason for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up. Yes. I understand that, but DOT has engineers and DOT has
engineers exclusively do these things for transportation issues. But in
different areas, a vendor who does something knows that he has a cost,
that if he's going to submit a bid that there's going to be some cost
incurred in going out and measuring and doing whatever he needs
designing whatever he needs to put in his proposal. I really have a
problem when we start saying that he does not have to do that. That we
will accept his, I really have a issue with this part of it, because
every area does not have a DOT staff person with engineers and
architects who can do this, and once we start this train, it continues
to go. I can't support this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I have my question answered. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Well, thank you.
Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Hunt, I understand, you mentioned NCSU,
and I understand, perhaps some of the other Universities have a problem
with this bill. Can you tell me what their concerns would be for that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I think NCSU has some projects that are underway and this bill does
allow them to continue those that are underway. The idea, of course from
my perspective and our perspective in the Senate, is to provide
individual contractors with employment to help our employment picture. I
think that with this provision, the first provision would allow more
contractors to bid if they don’t have to incur those upfront costs. And
I think that bid procedure would allow construction costs to actually be
reduced substantially because you have more bidders.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, is there's anyone here from the
UNC system that can speak to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The Chair is asking anyone from the UNC system here that would like to
engage us on... Please present yourself to the mic.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yeah, this is Drew Moratz with the University of North Carolina, Journal
Administration. We do have some concerns with the bill. N.C. State
University did get this authorization 2 years ago to go forward with the
self-performance of the contracts, and currently the private sector is
engaged. We've got 7 of the 8 contracts that have been lettered to North
Carolina companies, so we still are using North Carolina based companies
and the private sector specifically on the contracts that we have led at
this point. Our concern is that in the time that we're asked to make
cuts and become more efficient, this is one of those areas that we could
expand and our hope coming to this session was to allow additional
campuses that authority as we go forward, as envisioned by House Bill
818. So, we do have some concerns with the bill because it limits our
ability to become more efficient.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you.
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I listen to the discussion here, I'm really
having some doubts. I don't quite understand a request for
qualifications. If I'm a business person and I'm bidding on a job, I
have to know what that job is going to cost me before I can put a bid
in. And does this request for qualifications entail that? I just, I
don't quite understand it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Hunt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Basically, you have to have, the vendors that are asking to do this job,
their qualifications are evaluated by the State Energy Office to find if
they in fact have the skills and the financial wherewithal to get it
done. So, and then, the contract is actually negotiated with that agency
and the State Energy Office.</p>

do to do the work and put a bid in on based on that, but I just I have a
large problem with having a state agency do the selection of the
contractors, Change Speaker:the Rosenblum, you do understand the
difference between a competitive bid contract versus a evaluation of
qualifications. when you
meant, because that center is funded with me Change Speaker:good morning
countries. unlike lionesses Maresca Resto is one of the companies in the
state. the dust performance contracting their others represented here as
well. let me try to explain how this works. what happens is we have lots
and lots of old buildings in North Carolina that are owned by the state
to very inefficient, so electricity cause. for example, to run a prison
might be ten million dollars per year, and they decide we want to be
more efficient so the proposal, representative Cleveland is about is
tied to the savings and those savings are guaranteed, so it's not like
when, after the RFQ Department of corrections chooses one of us. we then
get to bed twenty five million dollars. the project is always been
across the state less than their current utility costs. that's better
performance contracting is all it is all about. it would be the same to
replace the toilet in a prison or all of the white why are you guys in
control of yellow. the same cost at a time when we don't have the
capital to go out and redo all these things, so the private sector takes
the risk spend the upfront money. it is only pay out of savings. it's
it's really a brilliant concept. I wish we could get a lot of other area

Representative Cleveland, unless I misunderstand, State energy office
won't choose the vendor, the owner chooses the vendor. The state energy
office qualifies as they do now. The 14 companies in North Carolina are
eligible to do the work but state energy office won't choose which one
gets the business. The owner will indicate the DOT or whatever.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, coming back to the committee. Any other questions from the
committee?
Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I understand what he is saying but he is still
circumventing the ?? process. We'll be having a quick pre-qualified
vendors list is what you are actually doing. And then they get to
choose, which vendor would they use of the pre qualified vendors list. I
have no problems with that except there is still no bidding process
where someone can actually qua and wait. It's competitive other than
somebody arbitrarily saying &quot;We like your business and we appeal
qualifying you.&quot;. It eliminates small vendors, it hurts the vendors
who came in the last moment who may want to bid only for a specific job.
I have problems with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The chair there are two more people that want to speak and
I'd ask  you to keep your comments as brief as possible because we do
need to move forward. Introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hi, My name is Tim Gasper and I'm with trained U.S incorporated pre
qualified ?? in North Carolina. I have been performing these contracts
in North Carolina for the past 10 years. I can tell you, first thing
that the expense to develop and deliver a promised contract is far
beyond to what it needs to do a fair, efficient and competent delivery
of a performance contract. For example, it really does follow very
closely ?? at risk technique negotiation which is allowed by North
Carolina Statue and it does provide for competition however below or
underneath the energy service company as acting as a general contractor
more or less. So it's not a risky venture for an agency or local
development unit. There are jump off points along the process. We are in
fact lengthening the process for the performance contract negotiation.
By adding this first step, all we are trying to do is reduce the amount
of cost that the bidders who are not successful do not have to ?? and
carry on to the next project and the next project and the next project.
There is one winner and 4-5 losers so there is up to $400,00 of wasted
money in development and so I believe there is plenty of protection and
plenty of north Carolina statues for procurement to support what we are
asking for.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. We were also speaking in favor or gonna indulge this
committee with some information. And I also ask you to ?? in the
committee we had 3-4 for speaks who would obviously favor this. Anyone
who would speak against it in the committee since we would open it up
for people against the committee.
Alright, please present yourself and keep your march to a minute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir Mr. Chairman. My name is Will Heath and I am with ?? Woods, the
company that does these contracts. Representative Hall and
representative Cleveland saying that it's a competitive bill is slightly
confusing. if Honeywell bids on it you come in and you design the
project. We may have different design than the resco or trans and the
state is actually not putting up that money so if I say Honeywell is
going to propose a 10 million dollar bid, the Resco may come in with 12
million dollar bid and Trans will come in with 14 million dollar bid.
Those are state savings, that's not the money state is paying out and we
come to those numbers differently because we have different engineers
that look at different efficiencies. Something of confusion is, a
competitive low bid process would be if the state was actually
purchasing it. These are savings that are being provided to the state.
So it's slightly different from other ?? process and that's why we are
looking at qualifications before you go into the investment grade or a
process where we bring in our engineers to ?? through buildings, to take
energy readings, heat sensor readings, we need to cut that cost down so
we can expand to more vendors and smaller vendors. They don't have that
upfront cost so they can put up. This will actually open it up to more
people bringing bids.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Coming back to the committee. Any questions from the
committee? Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to make a motion at an appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Chair and most of you members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Next before us is Senate bill 659.  Senator
Harrington.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Chair, members.  This is Senate bill
659 as map 21 also known Moving ahead for progress 21st century.  It is
an agency bill it's been very narrowly tailored and does not do more
than required by the Federal Highway administration DOT is seeking to
make changes to state law so that North Carolina will be in compliance
with the federal Highway Code.  Section one addresses open container
requirements.  Section two addresses penalties for repeat offenders of
DUI and DWI.  Current North Carolina laws not in compliance with federal
law and because of the federal highway system has redirected five
percent of fiscal year funds into alcohol impaired driving programs.
The redirected money totals about eight million dollars currently and
woke up to ten million in fiscal year twenty fourteen. This money is
needed for roads so this bill must be passed in long session.  To
comply, North Carolina must prohibit the possession of any open
alcoholic container in the passenger area of any motor vehicle located
on a public highway or the right-of-way of a public highway in the
state.  Under current North Carolina law the open container requirement
supply only to those types of vehicles required to be registered this
means that mopeds are exempted and thus North Carolina is not in
compliance and this bill correct that.  Federal  agencies have
determined North Carolina’s  repeat intoxicated driver law does not
comply with the impoundment immobilization or interlock installation and
mandatory minimum sentence requirement to comply state law must require
the impoundment, immobilization or interlocking of each vehicle owned,
operated or owned and operated by repeat intoxicated offender to comply
with mandatory minimums repeat offenders state law must provide for a
mandatory minimum sentence of not less than five days imprisonment or
thirty days of community service for second offenders and not less than
ten days of imprisonment or sixty days of community service for third or
subsequent offenders. This bill will eliminate these exceptions to North
Carolina law that cause us not to be in compliance with federal law and
allow us to continue receiving these funds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Senator Harrington.  Questions from the
committee?  Representative Bell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’ll motion at the appropriate time.

vendor that on an ignition lock device can be put on a motorcycle, so
how that person testing uses ignition lock device while operating a
motorcycle is another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you sir any other questions for the committee?

<p id="45:00">
Woudl you have a pcs before us?
Motion made all in favor say I
YOu are recognized to esxpalin the bill
Thank you mr chair. This is a bill that started as a local bill but we
had to do it as a statewide bill its very simple that deals with housing
structures and structures that are vacant and abandoned. A lot of you
see these structures in your neighborhoods and this is why we deal with
it in this bill or the city has to take over in an arbitrary way. This
gives the homeowners and the city a more cooperative way to deal with
these buildings that I call eysores. What I learned was that I had a ton
of boarded up houses and buildingin these neighborhoods and if we were
willing to reinvest in these neighborhoods and revitalize them. There
were ceratin homeowners that had no intention of fixing up their houses
and I know some people think this a property rights issue but my goal
for the committee to look at the rights of the owner. Mr Jones has been
in her house for 30 years with two people in the community who abdicated
their responsibilities as a homeowners. I want people to see her
property rights and her property value goes down. I want to look at the
rights of everyone and not just one personl. Thats why I have this bill.
Civitas is okay with this bill and the lEague of Municipalities. THis
same program has been done in cleveland and detroit who have depressed
areas. Most of the time you see the homeowner loves this bill because
this is their property and they dont want to deal with it and gives them
an out. I think its a good bill, rep ??? has signed onto it and at this
point I will take questions and comments
Ill just make a brief comment. This is a difficult issue becuase we want
to move forward but still respect property rights. It is a serious
problem and I would say the district of each person in the body has
blighted property. WE want to respect property rights of individuals.
Those who own the bligthted property and those of the surrounding
community. Imagine a shopping center that has been abandoned for years
its dilapidated and its an eyesore that bringing down the other property
valeus. I am a property rights advocate, against eminent domain for
economic development uh forced annexation but we have worked on this
bill and worked with Civitas and we wanted to bring it by the committee
to seek your input and see if you have ideas.
REp adams
THank you mr chair I konw there are problems with boarded up properties.
I would like to know what the bill does that the current law is not
doing.
I would like someone to explain that portion too beacuse there are two
parts.
IF a homeowner has not complied</p>

Building inspection statutes of the minimum housing standards and the
city or county has issued an order for the person to rehabilitate the
property or demolish the property. And if the owner has failed to do so,
then the County could seek to appoint we’ll call a receiver to either go
in and rehabilitate, demolish or sell the property.
This can be a voluntary process or the homeowner agrees to it. Or if the
homeowner or the property owner does not agree then the county or city
may seek a court order to appoint the receiver. The receiver would have
to show you [pause] ensured it’s appointing a third party to either
rehabilitate, demolish or sell the property.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If the property is not sold but it’s rehabilitated,
who actually owns it then?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The property owner would maintain ownership interest
in the property if it is rehabilitated but there would be a lean on the
property for the cost of the rehabilitation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Wilkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we’re here for the
purpose of trying to identify questions. And I had one at the bottom of
page two and that’s in the event of a sale. What makes action incumbent
upon the purchaser? I mean, I don’t see anything that says this
purchaser has got to do something to improve the property.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not sure if understand the question. But the
action I think, I think I understand your question. It’s because the
purchaser would take the responsibility of taking that property. And
then they would actually, after the liens and all of that stuff is paid
for, then they would actually become the owner and start the
revitalization process.
Like take for example, like I have a big hotel in High Point right in
the middle of a really big revitalization project that we've got. These
folks have no intentions of fixing this hotel. The roof has actually
collapsed and went through the building. It is now a health hazard and
we still cannot get the owners to do anything.
So it would be very beneficial for us to be able to take a receiver. And
we have one, people who want to revitalize that area. It’s actually the
Boston street area that we've been trying to revitalize. And we can
actually take that property and we can revitalize it. And the property
owner will get any of the profits that’s left over after liens and those
things. But we now have a property that’s not, you know, I can’t get
investors to come in there and invest in that area as long as I have a
big humongous hotel that is literally falling in the street.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. May I try again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If that current owner can sit there and do nothing,
what prevents the purchaser, the new purchaser from sitting there and
doing nothing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? We’ll send that to staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The bill does require a purchaser to demonstrate that
they will be able to rehabilitate a property within a reasonable time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair has questions for Government staff as well.
I guess my question there, what is different with this bill that we
currently can’t do in government now? What cities and municipalities and
counties?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The county or the city is permitted to rehabilitate or
demolish a property if the codes have not been complied with and the
order to rehabilitate has not been complied with. The difference is the
appointment of a third party to do these things. Also currently our
statutes do not provide for a method for the city or county to sell the
property, nor to take it and rent it out. So, those two things are
different than what is currently in Chapter 160 and Chapter 153.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So the third, just to follow-up for myself, the party
the ability</p>

<p id="55:00">
...sell the property and what was the...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The ability to rehabilitate the property and then rent
it out for a period of two years. Those two things are in addition to
what the city and county already has the authority to do, which is to
demolish or rehabilitate the property and then place a lien on the
property for the cost of those two things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just three points and that's in reference to the one
thing that every city charter has in it. Safety of this community. All
of them had that. So I think that that would in the parameter if that
building is falling down within the inner city. The city has a statutory
authority to take whatever action that is necessary. Two, I see there
was a bill, I think it was 743 and the staff can help me, wherein that
some cities tried to address this through their house and like the City
of Fayetteville has a RAMP program and the City of Fayetteville has a
court that hear these kinds of complaints. And I see that that may have
an adverse effect as House Bill, I think it's 743, would have on this
RAMP program to remove these kinds of areas and provide as to
Representative Whitmire meant. It's what the property owner must do in
order to bring the property up to what we refer to as the minimum
standard. And then if not, the city can carry that particularly
organization or individual to court to take whatever action is
appropriate. But I do think that the city already has that statutory
authority to or some kind of way for citizens to pass by and the
building collapse and one of the bricks fall on that particular person.
The city may be sued because it knew or had knowledge that the building
by virtue of its own inspector that it was not fit for human habitation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I would like to say that this does, this
my point to people who are in opposition. What you fear the city's
already have the statute to do. And so this gives us an opportunity to
not just actually just only have to tear down the building and only like
destroy property that we already have. That's really our only recourse
at that time. Now you can actually have another option to bring in a
receiver and to try to save that property and be able to use it for
revitalization processes. Right now, that hotel that we have, we
certainly could. The city can go in and just tear it down. And they have
every right to do that. But it is an historical structure that we would
like to preserve. It was the only black hotel that people could go to
way back in the 50's and the 60's, and we would like to preserve that.
And getting a receiver to be able to do that is a better option than
just tearing it down, which everybody agrees we can just do that, but we
would like to have another option.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd? Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What hear are third party. I don't think it should be
our responsibility to provide a third party the opportunity to become an
investor. If that third party want to invest, then that third party
should go through whatever legal challenge or legal responsibility to
acquire that particular property. So why should we condemn that piece of
property as per se, tear it down and allow the third party to come in.
Now, having said that, the building with in itself that the person, the
reason why that person don't want to do the repair, as long as there's a
building there, the land is valuable. But once the building is torn
down, a third party comes in, he or she simply buys the land.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's what we're trying ?? is that we don't want the
land, we want the building and so the third party is actually needed.
You cannot, the third party, the receiver, which you have to get that,
you have to get the receiver to be able to do that. But in order, to
your point, is that we still have a property owner, so there is no legal
ramification for another investor without this, to be able to go in
there as long as I have a property owner that is abdicating their
responsibility to be a property owner and take care of their ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Last follow up, Mr. Chair. Follow up. I don't think
that it should be the responsibility here for us to provide a third
party the opportunity to invest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We do it all the time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair's going to move on because there's a lot of
questions. I've got about six here wanting to speak and we also hope
that this would help guide the bill sponsor...</p>

<p id="60:00">
…and some ideas may be possibly. So we’ll start off with Representative
McNeill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I think you’ve got a good concept here. I think
the bill needs some work on it. On page 5, I’ve kind of got a problem
with section E right at the top, where the receiver has exclusive
authority. It basically says that once they’re appointed, everybody else
is divested on any authority. They don’t… Apparently the way I read it,
and staff can correct me if I’m wrong, but once they’re appointed,
they’re pretty much it. And that person then could really put enough
cost into that project, and they would then own the property. Basically.
To me that seems to be quite a problem. And there’s one other area, and
may be in the bill, that I’m not sure that if the bill passes and goes
through, we might need to put in here something. What is the owner of
the property going to do about taxes? Is he still going to have to pay
the property taxes on it? Or is there something in the bill that
excludes that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right. I think what you’re talking about is in both ??
the E kind of combines… We were talking with staff about this, and they
can correct me if I’m wrong. We really wanted the whole entire
responsibility to be on the receiver. The taxes, the insurance, all of
the liability, and the court fees. All of that is going to be on the
responsibility of the receiver.
So let’s say you’re fixing up a house and you still have the property
owner and something falls down and hits somebody in the head. That is
the responsibility of the receiver, not necessarily the property owner
who’s not actually dealing with the renovations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Representative McNeill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, maybe I’m reading it wrong. On that last sentence
it says, except taxes or other governmental assessments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Where do you see that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be page 5, line 8.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe you’re looking at the section pertaining to
liens, but to speak to what Representative Brandon was just discussing.
Currently there would be no civil liability for the property owner if
anything occurred on the property during the demolition or renovation.
Currently the bill does not speak to court costs or taxes. That’s
something that we can work on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks Mr. Chairman. Being up here I’ve had to go a
month without cutting the grass at the old house I’m trying to sell that
nobody’s living in. I don’t want to start this on me before we get out
of here. Just wondering what the standards are on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll give that question to the bill’s sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff can clarify, but I can tell you that this is not
something that this is a worry about. We’re talking about years and
years and years of trying to get people to do what they need to be
doing.
It’s not something that somebody could do one month. I mean I had a
person across the street from me that didn’t mow the grass for two
years. And we still can’t get him to mow the grass.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] With regard to the building inspection statutes, if
it’s a residential building, in order to be in violation, the property
would need to be especially dangerous to life if it’s a residential
property. If it’s a nonresidential property, the building must be vacant
or abandoned, and appears to be so dilapidated as to contribute to
blight, disease, vagrancy, or fire hazard.
With regards to the minimum housing standards, It would need to be,
let’s see… I apologize. I’m trying to find the exact wording. It would
need to be in significant disrepair. But I’m trying to find the exact
wording. I’ll get back to you on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair would note that the questions we’re hearing
one of the concerns is to make sure at some point we could ensure that
it’s went through all the processes to protect the homeowner before it
gets to this. So as you’re looking for ideas for your bill just make
sure we have all the precautions to protect the homeowners, and property
owners, period. Next, we’ll have Representative Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. Chairman. Is there anything, to the
bill sponsors, in this that addresses the other side of the equation?
And I’m…</p>

<p id="65:00">
Because at home we had a home that was burned at the historical section,
and it was more than fifty percent destroyed, and the homeowner wanted
to tear it down immediately and rebuild.  And the city stopped him from
doing that for a year, because they thought it should have been rebuilt
as is and using what he had, and he didn't see the profit or the need in
that so I'm just looking at the other side of the equation on this.
[Speaker Changes]
?? That's a good question, and I don't know.  I know that there is a lot
of historical credits, and historical laws but when you're dealing with
historical areas and I don't know that bill addresses this or that we
even need to but we'll definitely bring that up.  That's a good
question.
[Speaker Changes]
A great question.  Representative Adams
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr.  Chair.  I just wanted to comment.  I think that this bill
is not here today to be voted on, but to get input so while people are
making comments I don't think people are necessarily in our position,
Representative Brandon, but trying to help you get the bill out.
One the - you talk about property and peoples rights and it used to be,
and I remember when I came here we had so much boarded up housing in
Guilford county, and district two that our representing council, we
checked the law, the city couldn't do anything because the law said that
if you were a property owner, and you couldn't fix up your property you
could board it up.  What the law didn't say in that was the loophole is
how long you could board it up.  So we found that the properties were
boarded up for 10, 20, 30 years.  We've taken that loophole out, but it
takes time to get through this process, so I think you're getting some
good input today, and you need to take it that way, and use it to try to
help and get this bill out, because we have a lot of lawyers in this
place, and they're going to be challenging you on some of those things
because they represent - many of us are property owners and that kind of
thing, so I think you should take it for what it's worth, and I've heard
some good comments today.
[Speaker Changes]
Chair would like to thank Representative Adams for comments.  I think
they're really at heart so hopefully those responses will take a lot of
these questions and work and make the bill even better than you may
currently think it is.  Representative Faircloth
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr.  Chairman, I am one of the primaries on this bill, and
basically what we're talking about here is a way for a owner of a piece
of property who does not have the means to bring it up to the condition
it ought to be in in order to be safe and all that.  He can voluntarily
participate with the city in having a receivership appointed and have
this property brought up to the condition the city is happy with, make
it safe for everybody, and if there is some realized profit over and
above cost and so forth, the owner and receive some of that.  He may or
may not.  But what the two sponsors are talking about are situations
where we have for instance a large apartment house, and the owner is
saying Yes I would love to fix it up, because then I could sell it and
make money on it, but I don't have the money to fix it up, and I cant
borrow the money to do it.
So this is a petition by the owner, voluntarily, or if the owner says to
the heck with it I don't care what the decision is, he gives the city a
way to make the city better.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you for the comments.  Representative Hall
[Speaker Changes]
A couple questions for the bill sponsors.  Representative Faircloth said
voluntarily, but as I understood it it also applies to people that don't
agree.  Is that correct?
??
Alright.  An option to be voluntary if you don't agree.  There are two
options.

I did have a few questions, but I guess the main one was the one that
Representative McNeill asked first which I didn't really understand the
answer to.  Are there any limits in the deal on how great a receiver can
come for a property when he goes into the change and renovate like a
percentage of the value or the dollar amount.  Any type of limit at all?
[Speaker Changes]

The bill does not contain a limitation on the expenses a receiver can
occur.
[Speaker Changes]
Followup.
[Speaker Changes]
So this would mean that they could go in, tear down the place, and build
a Trump tower, which essentially does take property from them.
[Speaker Changes]
In theory, that is correct.  Yeah.
[Speaker Changes]
Well try and fix that.
[Speaker Changes]
Any other questions?  Any other questions from the committee? I move
that we've learned quite a bit about this bill, and the positives and
the work we have cut out for us.</p>
