Can ya’ll hear me? Welcome to the Ag Committee. I think we’ve got a
quorum; do we not? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We do have a
quorum. I’d like to welcome our pages this morning. We have Trevor
Edwards from Goldsboro, Senator Parmon. Trevor, glad to have you with
us. Aga Wyatt from Chapel Hill, Senator Stein. Glad to have you with us,
Aga. Caleb Sanders. Where’s Caleb. Caleb, glad to have you with us from
Morganton, Senator Daniel. And Ron Davenport from Clayton, my page this
week. Glad to have you with us, Ron. And our Sergeant-Of-Arms, you know
who you are, so… They’re too busy talking. We’re going to move around a
little bit and we have a presentation from Vanessa Harrison with
AT&amp;T, but we’re going to let Senator Brown go because he has another
committee meeting, and Senator Brown, we’ll turn it over to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I hope this is pretty simple.
The bill pretty much explains itself I think. It just provides that
members of the armed forces who are serving on active duty shall be
considered residents for purposes of attaining certain hunting, fishing,
trapping and special activity license. I think that pretty much says it
all. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bingham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to
move for a favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hold that just a moment.
Any discussion on the bill? No discussion. We have a motion by Senator
Bingham for a favorable report. All those in favor, let it be known by
saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, like
sign. The bill has passed. Thank you, Senator Brown. You’re certainly
welcome. Sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that a record? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
don’t know. Could be. Could be a record. At this time we’re honored to
have with us Ms. Vanessa Harrison from the President of AT&amp;T in
North Carolina, and she’s going to give us about a 10 minute briefing on
AT&amp;T’s new plans and what they plan to do for the state, and we
welcome you and if you would like, you can come up here. We’ll put you
on the spot. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I love it. I love it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sure you do. We’re glad to have you with us. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you so much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re certainly welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Make sure that mic is on, Ms.
Harrison. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you hear me now? Senator Jackson, thank
you so much for the opportunity and to all of your colleagues here for
giving me a little bit of time just to number one, come and introduce
myself to you. I am Vanessa Harrison. I am the newly appointed President
of AT&amp;T North Carolina, a company who I am just so proud to work
for. As many of you may know, my predecessor has Cynthia Marshall, who
was my boss, my mentor, and most of all my friend. Cynthia has moved on
now to a bigger job in Dallas. She’s now Senior Vice-President over
Human Resources, and so I’ve been blessed to be able to come in and fill
this position, and you’ll notice I did not say “her shoes” because those
are pretty big shoes to fill, but we will keep those shoes moving as we
go along. I am here today on behalf of the seven thousand AT&amp;T
employees in North Carolina to number one, thank you for your support of
laws and policies which encourage private investment and then help drive
economic growth, and in this day and time I think we all have that
common interest in economic growth here in North Carolina. You and your
predecessors have worked so hard and diligently to make sure that North
Carolina laws make sense in a changing economy, and that’s the second
reason why I’m here, and that is to give you an idea of more changes
that are yet to come and how they will benefit North Carolina,
especially the families who live in rural parts of our state. As most of
you may know, out wireless services are becoming more and more important
today than ever before. In North Carolina, wireless subscriptions
outnumber traditional phone lines or what we call out landlines two to
one. 35 percent of American households are wireless only, and over the
past six years since the smart phones first hit the market, we’ve seen a
30 thousand percent increase in mobile data traffic. That’s a lot of
traffic. That’s a lot of pictures, that’s a lot of emails, that’s a lot
of text messages; that’s a lot of monitoring of various agricultural
equipment in rural parts of our state, but yet there’s more to come. We
expect that mobile-connected tablets will</p>

<p id="05:00">
generate more traffic in 2017 than the entire global online network,
which means that we expect what we see as tablets, IPads, Samsung
products, apple products. That will generate more traffic because people
are using that, not only in their own offices but in their homes, while
they're on the road traveling, just about everywhere they go. And at
AT&amp;T, we are committed to meeting the needs of our customers, and
our communities, and our state with this new mobile society. That is why
we have invested 96 billion dollars in the U.S. economy over the past 5
years, more than any other public company. And in North Carolina, here,
what I'm responsible for, we have invested more than 1.5 billion over
the last 3 years. Looking ahead, we recently announced a project, and
it's called Project VIP (Velocity Internet Protocol), which means that
we are going to now be transporting a lot of data via the internet, and
using the same technology that we use with the internet. We already have
the largest 4G network in U.S. history. Making it possible for products
like our digital life, which is for most of you with home security
systems. We are not entering into that market where we're going to be
providing home security systems where you'll be be able to activate it,
monitor it, and do whatever you need to do via your smartphone, your
iPhone, your Samsung phone, whatever type of smartphone you have. But
with Project Velocity IP, we plan to build out our 4G network to over
300 million Americans by the year end 2014. That's a very aggressive
build out plan that we have. And I will tell you, North Carolina has the
most aggressive build out plan than any other state in the country. And
one of the reasons that I am here is because I want everybody to
understand the importance of this build out, and how important it is to
have public policies that are easy to do business with on the state side
as well as the municipality side. So that we can continue our build out
and keep our project going. The way that it really works in all honesty
is that when you hit road blocks and you're not able to get through it,
then the company says &quot;Well okay, let's take this money here for
this particular area in North Carolina and let's move it over here to
Georgia or South Carolina, because we're able to get it done faster
there.&quot; That is my job here. I have a team of people here. And my
job is to make sure we get the money here, and my team's responsibility
is to make sure that we are educating you guys, we're partnering with
you, we're doing everything we can to make sure that we have the public
policy environment that will encourage this type of investment. Also,
we're going to deploy fiber to an additional 1 million businesses,
customer locations in its ?? areas by year end 2015. We're going to
expand and enhance our wire line network. At one point, there was a lot
of discussion like &quot;People don't like using wire lines like they
used to. What should we do with that business?&quot; And, our chairman
had the insight in as I say, he's a genius, to just say &quot;You know
what, let's not just throw the baby out with the bath water. Let's take
this network that we have and let's reinvest in that, and let's make
sure that we can get wireless technology with that wire line network and
be able to provide wireless services to our customers in our traditional
wire line footprint. In Wilmington, North Carolina, we're going to be
providing U-verse, which is our version of television service in
Wilmington for the first time. We have fought and fought and we have
finally won that battle. People in Wilmington are very excited about
that. That's just one of the things that we're doing in our traditional
wire line territory. 99% of the customer locations in our 22 state
footprint will have access to high speed internet broadband, either by
mobile or wire line internet broadband. That's huge, because when our
kids go to school, if we're encouraging companies to give tablets and
technology to the schools, to be able to help with the education process
or curriculum, they got to have some type of network to do it. And it
doesn't mean just AT&amp;T, of course that's the company I promote, but
they got to have...</p>

?? From some company. And fortunately we have been great partners with
the whole wireless industry, and our wireless industry, we've all come
together, we all realize the goal, and that is, to bridge that digital
divide, to make sure that we get broadband out in the areas where we
need it. Especially in our rural areas where there is sometimes it's
been overlooked for a long time. The transition to IP and
broadband-enabled services benefit all of our consumers, but especially
those that live in rural America. Let me just give you some examples of
how that, how that works. Across the US IP strengthens communities and
make access to distant learning technology easier and faster. The number
of K-12 students enrolled in distant learning has increased 472% in the
last decade, which means that they are learning over the Internet.  They
are learning from home. They are using their computers and their smart
phones and their wireless technology. Seventy-four percent, bless you,
74% of districts using distance learning say that they plan to increase
the number of distant courses offered in the next three years. That
means that we're going to be doing a lot more online classes. We,
meaning a society of us. By expanding the educational opportunities, IP
technology encourages and allow people to say, to stay, learn and work
in their communities. The way that IP technology will benefit rural
America to more physicians is that rural America has fewer than half the
number of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents than urban areas
do. So I mean there's a gap there. IP-enabled Telemedicine helps reduce
the rural Americans' physician disparity and allows 7.5 million rural
seniors to receive care right there at their home. Eighty-four percent
of US farms with sales and government payments of $250,000 or more have
access to a computer. Eighty-two percent of these farmers have Internet
access, and 72% are using the Internet for farm business. Now, I want to
just share with you some of the ways that they're using the Internet for
farm business. Access to advanced next generation high-speed Broadband
network, it allows for monitoring of pesticide and herbicide
applications. It allows for animal tracking and identification. It
allows farmers for monitoring water or flood levels. It indicates for
frostbite or frost events that are coming in that could be harmful to
your crop. It allows for farmers to monitor crop health and rainfall,
temperature, and other meteorological data. It also helps to track
shipment of perishable crops and crops input. It helps to monitor
equipment, movement, and performance. Web cameras are used through the
wireless Internet to view hazardous and remote areas. It also lastly
helps to monitor the odor and gas and other environmental indicators for
livestock housing facilities. So making these things possible requires
investment, it requires capital, and that's why I'm committed to getting
as much of the planned 14 billion dollars that my company has committed
to investing. I want to have as much of that here in North Carolina. And
I think we can do that. So you’re helping me to do that by continuing to
evaluate and update our telecommunication laws, our policies to
encourage investment in new technology. I cannot thank you enough for
what you have done so far this session, and I'm just excited about what
is about to happen between now and the end of the session. Thank you so
much for allowing me time to come and address you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ms. Harrison. We're glad to have you with us - [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now I know why we wanted you on
this calendar to tell us about what's going on in rural and Ag North
Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Right. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very
much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At this time I'm
gonna turn it over to my co-chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I'm pinch-hitting today. Senate Bill 509, the North Carolina
Agricultural and Forestry Act. Senator Jackson, the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members, this bill is -
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Senator Jackson moves adoption of the
proposed Mini Substitute. All those in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All those opposed? Senator Jackson, you
may continue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.</p>

Called the North Carolina Agricultural and Forester Act and basically
what this does. You know sometimes I learn things up here I might have
been better off I'd not been up here to know.  I did not know that over
the years as we've changed crops or as we've changed our operation from
a grain to a produce and now adding tobacco and different things that
every time we change our operation, technically, it's not a modified
form for one year.  That's what this bill is trying to address and
correct this problem is that once you are a modified form that no matter
how many times you change crop it matter, cause we do it for rotation
and other things, you are still a modified form without having that one
year exemption.  So that's what part one does and we have seen some
instances across the country, especially in the Midwest, where they took
this law and were able to sue an integrator because they changed
livestock facilities was out for a while and when they came back in they
were sued.  So section two, basically the second part of this deal,
deals with attorney fees being awarded to the prevailing defendant.
Indiana, Louisiana, and Texas and other strong agriculture states have
passed similar language and we need to protect our farmers and our most
important our industry and this bill gives the farmers an opportunity to
change commodities, invest in new technology, and buy retiring farmers'
operations without the worrying of being pestered by lawsuits and I
would ask for your support of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other further questions from committee?  Any comments from audience?
Senator Jackson, if you have carpet in your truck are you a bonafide
farmer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I have carpet?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, up until this year I would say yes, but now that we are trying to
be FDA certified, the answer would be no.  We have no carpet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just an inside joked.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, Senator Cook moves for unfavorable to the original favorable to
the PCS.  All that is in favor will say aye. Opposed no.  Ayes have it,
thank you senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And it has to be referred to J1.  Let the lawyers weight in on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bear with us just a moment we got some members out in the hallway trying
to discuss our next bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Senator ???
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If they have a long enough debate do you think we could put it on next
time so we could go eat lunch?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that's a great idea.  Give me just one second and I'll go find
that out.  I'm glad we were thinking alike on that one.  It appears
there is not a consensus on this for senate bill 391 right this minute
they're trying to work out some of the differences with the parties so
with no further business being said we should go ahead and adjourn.
Thank ya'll.</p>
