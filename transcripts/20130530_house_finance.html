this chair and a day of the few words of a loss to feel about the one
we're looking at with this project of the home and we have a real
problem in the nation that you're all aware with people being killed on
the highway by a third person driving or under the influence of alcohol
or drugs, VR status tried many different ways to try to cut into this

The pro cheer what we're saying is what the gold: mission is to have
people on the highway who are driving not drink that special events. The
best answer we have this approach lives rather than having somebody
arrested taking away their own driver's license, which causes some of
these of the problems that problem list have been tried with less
control them but that the drumming is less allow them to drive to work
in backless allow them to drive and a limited way is the best be sure
they can do with gifted ranking and that's what this admission and
reliability of the 16 bit of there are some of the technical part of
this legal parts of this and the less money owed to five carol national
primary sponsor on those two issues with an explanation of basically I
want to understand we're trying to find a remedy that allows people to
continue the work that allows them to have less domestic violence and
home to make it safer for you and I am, all of our family, my weight and
not be confronted with new drugs are so with that unlike for a gesture
of the message action to save the word about the middle portion of the
message text as chairman,(SPEAKER CHANGES)  Maryland from had this was
ideal that as soon as a part of all the other deals hired a secession
about is on track to address the problem from driving the more save this
bill is about the addressing repeat offenders and looking around in
other states are looking at a scientific research on a mandatory analog
is the way to do that. The cuts down on repeat offenders I believe of
67% from a weekend outside missing two free e-mail to you last night
there's more from a few things or handed out this morning , but that
this bill is just sat is just to keep some money from his namesake one
Thomas ¬be a punishment is just as when the car and just basically a
second passenger nickel or just to make sure that vs. non-java on these
things are not what you might have heard how they would have a operated
1015 years ago and are very advanced L column yet again somebody in the
more peace overture below into your machine on the issue, she was a very
close plays you have to repeat that step over and over and over again at
certain intervals is designed to try to extract reports correctly to TV
and say you if you have one of the Singapore united that if you drink
and drive you to be called unity and peace, be notified and may even get
a lot more trouble and so hopefully the key people to come on the
straight hair taken from the war two, political neighbor helping
children do things on the week's events , where the currently not able
to do that via to go all the amount region, or the financial penalties
(SPEAKER CHANGES ) this is fine as calm as a fiscal night that she never
sued last night that says that no estimate is available on that but I
will tell the body is that berry is some actually a huge, money out by
the Federal government this is much like when the state's news from the
0.10192108 the Federal government started with a large car money on the
day care plan to deny a promise a deal with the navy grants to states to
do that and that the lobby came through the seventies a state without
the cold safety, I was seeking money to know that all right now we're in
the care, approach studio lots of ideas about 52 -$0 million is out
there been estimated that North Carolina makes a change to a mentally
ill of slalom vendors under the gala for about $23,000,000 a year and
more unusual Federal safety album that is not in the fiscal nine,
because we will not have is up and running by July 1 and not be eligible
for this fiscal year until the next voluble we are hopeful than in the
long term that will actually get money to help us with the costs
associated with this program in the inland valley site is Linda say
briefly that I was a fair calls came to me about this bill, Morris, but
the more fathers a win  for everyone from the main thing is to get to
literally presents some discussion came from driving their color 90

if you are unable to do so if you're intoxicated protects the safety of
the public and protects the safety of that driver it also allows that
driver to get to a business, to get to a job, to support their family it
helps all along the way and if you're concern about the cost I think
it's about one to two dollars a day is going to be the cost to the
person that's really not more than a ?? or two per day so I thought this
was a win-win I hope you do too and we'll be glad to answer questions or
listen to any amendments[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Hanes  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chair, I'll like to thank the bill sponsors on
their work on this very important bill I think everyone of us in here
unfortunately has been touched in some type of way by people who've
driven while intoxicated my question Representative Jackson you might be
able to help me with this could you talk to us a little bit about
whether we already have existing limited driving privileges for folks
who might have a first DWI how does that interact or  how does that jive
with this bill and I have a follow-up question for you as  well thank
you[SPEAKER CHANGES]Upon a first conviction while driving impaired DMV
does revoke someones drivers license for a year provided they have met
unique certain criteria you are eligible for limited driving privilege
if you had a blood alcohol read reported to DMV point one five or higher
then you are required in addition to those other provisions to also have
an interlocking vehicle you might operate this bill is currently written
that lowers that threshold from point one five to point one three
[SPEAKER CHANGES]follow-up[SPEAKER CHANGES]clearly you always going to
have bad actors even in a well-intention bill like this I'm wondering
what is the penalty clause for those folks who might be convicted under
this bill and then take that interlock and put it in a vehicle they're
not actually using as their primary operating vehicle you know this
stuff goes on all the time right now what kind of safety measures you
have in place to kind of try to protect in some of that and accomplish
the goals that you all tried to do and I thank you[SPEAKER CHANGES]any
vehicle that you are operating that did not have the interlock your
license will be revoked you are driving outside the scope of your
privilege subject to up to 120 days in jail depending on your driving
record and will be a loss of your driving privilege as well[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Starnes [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman
and I offer an amendment and I believe the amendment has best passed
off[SPEAKER CHANGES]Members have a copy of the amendment [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Starnes [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
ladies and gentlemen of the committee I'm a co-sponsor of this bill not
a primary sponsor but the original bill has the standard point 08 level
blood alcohol content and the committee process in the J committee got
raised to .13 this will simply take it back to the .08 standard which is
what we typically look at for convictions of drunk driving[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Mofitt[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chair I have
a question of the bill sponsor and it relates to the amendment offered
by Representative Starnes and this could be for Representative Jackson
or Representative Jordan when a person that is that has a .08 you
mention a moment ago that is automatic revocation and if they meet a
certain forward criteria they can get a limited driving privilege is
that correct what's the difference between a limited driving privilege
and Representative Starnes amendment to make it an interlock ignition
compulsory at .08 what's the difference between the two[SPEAKER
CHANGES]in order to qualify[SPEAKER CHANGES]follow-up[SPEAKER CHANGES]in
order to currently qualify for a limited driving privilege you would
have to had a substance abuse assessment no priors within seven years,
proof of insurance it has certain conditions it has certain hours what
this does is add to in addition to having those things it adds the
condition that you have to have a interlock on any vehicle that you're
operating so you still have the same limited driving privilege you just
got an additional condition that you have to have an interlock[SPEAKER
CHANGES]further questions from the committee regarding the Starnes
amendment[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Brawley</p>

Assume,  shropshire index rose five-and listen only the strong appeal
actually reduced from 115 to 2.13 , would apply only come from that can
only assume the original bill and the 6 seconds standard that we use a
mistake the most across the nation 459 -second-guessing that symbolic,
that's when the bill was originally, it was awfully high standards
without its related to this release of hosts of the language are all
offenders from the cleanest way to do what is probably to say all
offenders us what the Federal government requires a boardwalk of the
Federal funding a way to eight in most people's mind that he is a
dolphin is the difference being that she can be convicted of driving
while impaired four other funding sources other than alcohol and save a
dolphin language and also expects those who've taken to mean streak of
us who are smoking marijuana and care of those companies under the deal
has risen written was a plea of a judiciary the key play came as a PCs
have made the move from increased at a 0.13 yen vs. stars amendment
which I would just four largest anti-Clinton attended this language
channel question from disclosure clues are in this discussion was
wondering two things, one LP to figure: 13, welcome well off (SPEAKER
CHANGES )one fruit and others in the house of those close to fill the
human flaky only state from a sale there's a lot of other bill's
sponsors of the discussion so I can say I do support the value of all
Federal funding of all the way I do support at the 0.13 came about as a
compromise on the deal was 100 days than that was stuck in the fourth
district committee helicopter my husband and Mr. Anderson Davis also
scored well a change, it was a litigious care about is a compromise plan
is too aggressive olive bottomless pit to the minute that was taken the
bill would be sent to the Sunday warned that Mr. Had just two quick
questions on the intercom the fifth amendment to the defeat of the bag
and 0.08, like to know what exactly how much fat, so we have to try to
register that , from a gentleman from the second thing is how many are
lost in the NFL comment on how the warrior locks that would encompass a
few lower down 5.5 FM in sound like you and everybody is that everybody
in the process of all differently so I can give you a number for exactly
how many drinks out never seen a steady they should two beers which
labor body in mike's Puc court always say if Elisa Daly had two deer
park awful, and that is not the way, if you if I can process would be
real, 11 thing about Colin hour on December 8 I can say that from the
national traffic safety board just write recently recommended by states
consider moving the sender from 0.08105 (SPEAKER CHANGES) , and that's
one of the things so that I believe a 0.082757728 straight as far as the
number of analog from that number conventions in North Carolina league
last year was in the 30/1000 , believe it is in the fiscal nine months
are you looking at Colville he'll be a significant number of additional

document from a good setup that Maddox says saw a later, more break from
an informer for a fan in 2 hours -takers is said that starting this
adoption is a man that can affect the process, David of this sad, but
those manages about that we're back on the bill raising doubts that this

him with sectioning the bill deals with that I can go through that,
because there had been issues in the past where people said, well, if
you're rich enough in God, and if you are notyour Gwinnett, you know not
have as many options, so I'd like you to go to that and then numb and
then lost my second question
Change speaker:after receipt would do first issued under it is a
veryindigent date of funded instead about a deal that again was part of
a compromise. some people don't believe that we need that at all or some
people would think you everything what itwould do that with kale with
the initial installation of interlock device, which is the most
expensive part of it, but it would not help with the monthly that you
would be the offender wouldbe one hundred percent responsible for the
monthly civilian service of making an interlock and I totally understand
the poor rich versus poor economy, but the truth is that United youget
commitment from one page, or insurance is going from and if you can
afford to pay triple your insurance to drive and I believe that you can
afford to pay two dollars a day to makesure that you don't reoffend and
maybe kill some
Change speaker:
mystic question his name off the other issue that came up was in the
past it was really only one vendor to vendor 's and there was some
questions about the vendors and so I just liketo know do you know how
many vendors. there are these interlock systems on how many have been
certified, who certifies them those kinds of things because, again, in
the pastthere were some questions about the relationship of certain
vendors with the state and known and how they do their business
Change speaker:
proceeded there are in your body and your will there are three vendors
named in their modern tech smart start and alkali, there may be those we
know those three
Change speaker:
follow-up and so does my next question is, do they have to go through
some kind of certification, state or federal certification and you
explain what that is, then, whether you know when they got certified any
of that kind of issue,
Change speaker: but I do know to be certified and not was one of the
issues the topic you referred to couple years ago to modernism
litigation aboutmaybe only one company was the and certify that has been
corrected. there is at least three maybe four companies now the state
Oliver, the state provided Mister Timmins area.somebody here from one of
the providers elected your from a loving actual certification process.
Change speaker:please stick to the podium, state your name for the
record you have pressed the button
Change speaker:
from Johnson( monitor neuron three vendors are funds rate monitor
SmartStart in our walk. the certification process was asked about all
companies must did hear to the nationaltransportation safety, nutrition,
Stanford and locks, impulsive, who are complied as of the other two
vendors with the state standard, which requires a multi- day test device
avoidanceover sixty seven days of advice things operation and understand
what Joyner, some of the toughest in the nation interlocks and apply
knowledge of all three companies complyrecovery certainly does. but each
has been certified by the state lab and also met the Knudsen
certification for an independent third-party level
Change speaker:
of and just the question in the past that while the price for the
interlock among the three companies is that about the same as a coming
battle. what is the situation that
Change speaker:
you start up front all to about the same, which is about seventy dollars
per month from now on the related targeting for the quizzes within thank
you for the
Change speaker: Moffitt business hours. theChevrolets and don't
Change speaker: you think this bill is is necessary. it's been a long
time coming, but we have in this state is a system that we have beaten
then we made our best to test toaddress drunk driving in the state. I
will take the court. we will convict them and we can take their drivers
license away from them, but people still drive. I mean just because you
loseyour glasses that doesn't remove their needs. it do get to work or

I am going to submit you that we can continue to take steps in that
direction by adopting the bill that is before you. What this bill seeks
to do is to take North Carolinian's tax system which is extremely
complicated and simplify . It takes north Carolinian's tax system which
I submit to you offers to a disincentive for people to try to better
themselves and it addresses by creating a flat personal income tax rate
a 5.9%. As we currently have the highest personal income marginal tax
rates in the south east. we have three rates 6, 7 and 7.75. This bill
would propose to create one flat rate of 5.9%. As current North Carolina
tax law begins to tax at 6% rate from the rate first dollar that you
earn , this bill will create a tiered exemption system upto 25 thousand
dollars that would be taxed at zero percent. This bill further goes on
to address our franchise tax. The one thing that nearly everyone will
agree on is that nobody particularly likes the franchise tax or even
completely understands it. I deal unlike other proposals that come forth
is not expand or imposed to franchise tax on any entity not currently
paying it. What is does do is to move in the direction of trying to
eliminate the franchise tax by cutting the rate which is a move that I
hope we can repeat in subsequent years. The sales tax  quite of  bit
conversations has gone on this year about sales tax. This bill does
expand the sales tax base but it does so in a limited and measured way.
It does so in a way that focuses only on the installation and  repair of
tangible personal items. The bill that the sponsors selected that
definition is that the vendors who already collecting, remitting and
storing the sales tax records for potential audits for 7 years are
already equip to collect, remit and store this information. There are a
few tax breaks that are repealed and this our first step to refine and
further clean up our tax code. We are glad to go into that is where the
final piece of the bills with North Carlina's corporate income tax. We
have debated a long time about what the corporate tax should be here is
What I can tell you.I can tell you that having the highest corporate
income tax in the south east creates sticker shock whenever companies
are looking to locate in our state. The economist will verify the best
way to spur job growth to create opportunities for people to go to work
and advance in there career is to cut the corporate income tax. The bill
before does a responsible and measured way, the rate will fall from its
current 6.9% over the next 4 years to 5.4%.5.4 I regret to say is still
higher than neighbor to south</p>

...our immediate neighbor to the south, but it is in fact lower than
most of our other competing states. As I said, I did not prepare a long
speech to introduce this bill. I know that each one of you in this room
has concerns and a commitment to make our state the best that it can be,
to provide the best business climate that we can provide, because it is
the business climate that we provide that leads to employment
opportunities, opportunities to advance, and opportunities for our
citizens, our constituents, to better themselves.
Mr. Chairman, we've spent about three or four weeks with most of this
bill on line. We have attempted to address concerns that have been
brought up. I think in your direction, it may be in the best use of the
committee's time to let me yield at this point to inquiries.
The Chairman: Questions from the committee. Representative Luebke.
Representative Luebke: [Silence.]
Representative: Mr. Chairman, if no one else has a question, I do.
[laughter]
The Chairman: Proceed.
Representative: I want to yield, because some people have said I always
go first, and I just want the record to show that nobody else had her or
his hand up. [laughter]
The Chairman: Absolutely, and we're always glad to hear from you.
Representative: Thank you.
First question, for Representative Lewis. Thank you, first of all, for
working hard on this. You said something, I think, in praise of lowering
the individual income tax rate to 4.9%; I'm sorry, 5.9%. Does that mean
that a family making $40,000 will pay at the same income tax rate as a
family making $4 million?
Representative Lewis: Let me answer that this way, Representative. First
of all, you've got to remember that I prefaced the remarks on the
personal income tax saying that there would be blocks of income up to
$25,000 that would be taxed at zero percent. After that, the short
answer to what you ask is, yes. And I respect very much there are deep
philosophical differences when it comes to trying to assess what the tax
rate should be.
I will submit to you, and I will continue to advance, that the rate that
income is taxed should be the same for everyone to whom the tax is
applied. You and I both know that, even though the rate's the same,
obviously a family that makes $4 million a year will pay a whole lot
more in taxes than a family at $40,000 a year. The rate would be the
same; of course, the amount paid in, the amount contributed to the
revenue of the state, would be vastly different.
Representative: Followup, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman: Followup.
Representative: Do you know, Representative Lewis, thank you for that
answer. Do you know what these tax savings will be for the family making
$4 million; that is to say, paying 5.9% under your bill, and under what
I assume you have the votes to pass, and the governor will sign? So
what's the tax break? How much money does a family making $4 million
save as a consequence of your bill lowering their rate, their marginal
rate, because you and I both know they pay 6%, well now you're saying, a
little bit, then 6%, 7%, and 7.5 on the amount about $100,000 taxable,
for a married couple. You and I know that; it's inside baseball, but we
know it. Now, you're taking that marginal rate, from $100,000 to $4
million, and you're bringing that -- basically there is no marginal rate
anymore, you're bringing it from 7.75% down to 5.9%.
My question is, ...</p>

<p id="55:00">
Given any thought to that and any thought to maybe requiring some kind a
suit . [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that representative. Let me hit
the first thing that you asked first if I can. When we began this
stretch, we were asked to fund roughly 20.5 20.6 20.4 billion dollars
worth of state paid expenditures. I wanna make two quick remarks on
that. First of all you're point is absolutely correct in terms of this
is a phased in over multiple year program. The reason it exist that way
is obviously we don't live on an island and we're not starting from
scratch. If we could we could decide exactly what services and what
level the state would fund. And then based on those decisions that we
make starting from scratch we could then decide how much revenue we
would need to raise. We don't have that luxury at this time. One point
that I Wanna make and I realize we're in finance and not appropriations
but I think its very important to make and I don't think it gets made
enough. This state, this general assembly has historically chosen to
fund more of the services that our constituents are used to on a
percentage basis than many many in fact I'd say most other states do.
Look at the level of funding that we provide as a state as a percentage
in our education system for instance. We get hit and say that we're 48th
or 49th in how we fund out schools. Well if you look at what the state
part of that is we're about 23rd. The same thing holds true for our
roads. And I can go all the way across the board. So what I'm trying to
say to you is what this does is propose a gradual step down in the rate.
It also slows down the rate of growth of total income to the state. It
doesn't reduce it unfortunately but it does slow the rate of growth, the
tax growth, from about 4 and half % to about 4%. Is that a great thing?
No, I wish it were more, I wish it could be more. But when we were
tasked to write this bill, we were tasked to meet the obligations of the
state as we understood them. My hope is getting to work with this
general assembly and the administration that we can find additional
savings in the state budget that can then let us further reduce the
burden of taxation on our citizens. In terms of trying to require a
super majority or what not to raise taxes or change rates that concept
makes sense to me. As you know thought any thing short of putting that
in the constitution would really just be a waste of time. Because a
subsequent general assembly could choose not to follow that. So what we
proposed does slow the rate of growth and its a step towards where I
know you want to go and where you fought hard for us to go. It just
doesn't get there quite as fast as perhaps you or I would like. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? Thanks. Three quick questions. Representative I thought
about raising the point of water on representative Lukey. Barks ?? of
the sales tax increase here was regressive because as he knows for 8
years as coach here of this committee he led the house to impose an
additional 8 billion dollars of sales tax increases. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Chairman may I reply [SPEAKER CHANGES] In a moment. But I didn't
raise a point of order, but you opened pandora's box. Secondly ..</p>

I think the phasing is fine, because if a company is thinking of looking
here they’re not going to actually start making a profit for one, two or
three years so, that induces location here. But thirdly, as I read this
bill Representative Lewis, usually a tax reform package is a hodge-podge
of compromise, and I looked at this and I thought it was a work of art,
and you should be commended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative
Stam, I know Representative Luebke you would like equal time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES Thank you Mr. Chairman, I really appreciate it. I just want to
note, going back to 1991 that I have only advocated for increases in the
progressive income tax. Any time a sales tax has gone up Representative
Stam, is because I was out voted in a particular party caucus. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And that’s the end of our history lesson right
now. Representative Tine. But thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. I have two questions if I can, the first would be on the
mortgage write-off. It’s capped at 25,000 my understanding that is based
on a mortgage at $400,000 and plus 5,000. Is that right? If I could, my
question is, if that’s at current rates, then should we see a
significant increase, which is obviously a concern for many people in
regards to inflation. That would significantly reduce the amount of
interest or the property value that you would be able to take a loan out
on. Just wondered if there was any provision that would handle that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At this time this bill does not contemplate that
representative. What it does is, it says that you can, that an
individual tax filer can choose to either take the standard exemptions
in income or the standard 0% rate up to $12,000, if they’re married
filing jointly. Or, they can combine their mortgage interest deductions
and their charitable contributions and claim those at 0% rate, for an
amount not to exceed 25k. I would certainly be glad in a few years, if
we move in this direction, to talk with you about what that number
should be. You mentioned an amount of 400,000 obviously many of us
represent areas where that is not the average home cost. That was merely
an example that I used that it would represent the average amount of
mortgage that someone would pay on a $400,000 loan and average
charitable contribution of 5k. That not only won’t fit everyone in the
state, it won’t fit everyone in this room, but we had to start
somewhere. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I understand that, but as prices go up
and if interest rates go up then obviously in five years, ten years you
could be looking a significantly different amount of home that you could
afford to purchase and still get the deduction. My second question was
on the eliminating the personal exemptions the state personal
exemptions, we asked staff last night in a discussion and I appreciate
you rolling this in phases, is that; what are those personal exemptions
at the state level that are being eliminated? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman that was a direct inquiry and I think I could answer but Mr.
Boardman or Mr. Averitt may be able to do so more concisely, if
Representative Tine would not mind. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Boardman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Currently on your return, I’m just going to
refer to married filing jointly, you and your spouse would be eligible
for a $2,500 exemption per you and your spouse. If you had any
dependents, they would also be eligible for 2,500 exemption as well.
This bill just eliminates those exemptions, instead has a larger
personal exemption or standard deduction and it also increases the child
credit, which is currently $100</p>

Heading out to $250. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative
Collins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just make a comment, if I could? I did just a
little calculating over here, and as Representative Lewis knows, I
really appreciate the work you’ve done on this. I’m one of those who’ll
actually pay more taxes under this because of the limit on charitable
contributions, and yet I applaud this bill and I plan to back it. For a
family making $40,000 as was mentioned earlier, the fact that they won’t
pay any taxes on the first $12,000 whereas under our system they
currently do, will put about $720 back in their pockets. In order for
the extra services that they’re going to pay the sales tax on, you have
to spend $10,500 just in the services that we’re going to tax them on,
which I think would be impossible probably if you’re making $40,000 a
year, to balance that out. As far as what people who make a lot of money
do with their income, it sounds like some of us think that the best
thing they can do with that is turn it over to state or federal
governments. The wealthy people I know, what they tend to do with their
income is number one, hire people with it into companies that they tend
to own. Number two, they tend to invest in other people’s companies with
the extra money that they have, and thus spur employment that way and
drive economic activity. I don’t know what I would say that state and
federal governments are the best drivers of economic activity in our
country. I really trust the people that have the money to understand how
to do that better than we do in government. Also on a national level,
we’ve had presidents in my lifetime from both parties prove that when
you lower tax rates, you spur economic activity. President Kennedy
proved that in the 1960s, President Reagan proved that in the 1980s. So
I applaud you for what you’re doing and plan to support you even though
it’s going to cost me a little more out of my pocket. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Collins. Representative Robert Brawley. [PAUSE]
We’re not voting today but thank you. Representative Samuelson. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Actually, Representative Collins said
much of what I was going to say because I’m another one of those who’s
going to pay more under this bill. And we’ve had some long discussions
about that. So I’ll just go to staff, when you do the comparison that
Representative Luebke asked for, would you also do the effective rate
for the people making $40,000 a year, once they take advantage of the
exemption that Representative Collins mentioned? And then also when you
do it for the upper income people, acknowledge the loss of the
charitable deduction at the average rate of charitable deduction in
those, and I think you’ll find that it won’t be as much of a shift as
Representative Luebke has implied, because of the loss of deductions.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. I’ve got two questions that’s along the lines of
Representative Collins. But either Representative Lewis or staff, has
anybody run the numbers to determine how many tax filers would be
affected by the $25,000 cap of charitable deductions and mortgage
interest? How many people would be caught with the ceiling? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, could I ask Dr. Borden to speak to that, and as
he’s preparing to do that please understand Representative Starnes and
all of the members, everything that we do of course are based on
hypothetical models. We can’t get the actual information so he’s going
to say that more concisely and probably without stuttering, but I’ll let
them say it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Borden. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
On itemized deductions, we’re fairly limited in our data sources that we
can look at. When we look at statistics of income from the IRS on North
Carolina filers, that data’s aggregated up to fairly high level or
combined levels of income. The only thing we can really comment on is we
recognize that about a third of all tax returns itemize. Obviously as
that income goes up, the level of itemization goes up. 80% of our
filers, 80 to 81% of our filers have income, federal adjusted gross
income below $75,000. We think that those that will be affected by this
cap are likely to be in the upper 19% of that income, and particularly
as you move above $250,000. That’s where you’re most likely to see those
that will be affected by the cap.</p>
