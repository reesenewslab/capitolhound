certainly go away. But section 3, I'll turn over to Rep. Murry and he'll
explain that to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3 changes the deadline for the Office of State Budget
Management's fiscal note certification requirement from when the rule is
first published until the rule is adopted. This helps make sure that the
track of the rule making process runs efficiently. It also changes the
threshold of when a rule must have a fiscal note from $500,000 to $3
million. $3 million is what it was in 2011, before the regulatory reform
efforts that we engaged in in last session. And so this, this just
brings it back to what it was in 2011 before our regulatory reform
efforts.
Section 4, moving on, Section 4 of the bill is the sum and substance of
House bill 74, which this committee has heard and passed, and the House
has already passed as well so this is the process, the new process by
which agencies can engage into help, help us cull down the 12,000 rules
that are on the books and it details the process by which rules are
identified to be controversial and noncontroversial, those aren't the
exact terms of them, but that's the concept that we're going for. To
identify rules that are obsolete and can be taken off the books.
Section 5 is a recommended study from the administrative procedures
oversight committee that met during the interim before the long session.
If there's opportunities for  consolidations of boards and commissions
for licensure, this is the vehicle by which that could occur, and so
this would be a comprehensive program of evaluation division study.
Section 6 prohibits delayed enforcement of ordinances by local
governments. It basically creates a 10 year statute of limitations so
local governments can't go back after a development 10 years after the
fact. Rep. Hamilton recommended this is- we've had a- many people have
wanted to improve this legislation so I wanted to give credit to Rep.
Hamilton for bringing this to us.
Section 7 deals with equal treatment for fraternities and sororities
without regard to whether they're officially approved or recognized by
colleges. This includes also language from House bill 843 that allows a
student to have an advocate represented in a dispute when being
disciplined by a public university.
The first part of section 7, the primary purpose for this is to ensure
accountability for zoning decisions affecting private land and business
owners statewide, specifically for fraternities and sororities to be
able to count on zoning decisions affecting their private property be
made by only elected officials rather than unnamed unaccountable
university officials. And now I'll turn it over to Rep. Moffitt for
section 9.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 9 deals with outdoor advertising, and essentially what we have
there in the first part of that is clarification of some
misinterpretations of Senate bill 183 that was quite contentious last
session as members who were here then will remember, but that deals with
the pruning of vegetation specifically regarding outdoor advertising
assets that exist on on-ramps and off-ramps. That's  part a1 of section
9b when it comes to modernization of outdoor advertising devices. This
does not deal with digital modernization, this simply deals with
allowing the outdoor advertising community to go from a multi-pole
system to a monopole system.
Section 10 deals with the disposition of medical records. And basically
it allows entities who no longer provide medicaid service to transfer
records to the Dept. of Health and Human Services, or destroy them after
2 years unless federal law requires a longer retention record.
Section 11. Tom, that would be you. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's see here. Alright.
Section 11. I apologize, I think I misspoke when I spoke with regards to
section 5. Section 5 deals with exemptions from the Administrative
Procedures Oversight- directs the Administrative Procedures Oversight
committee to study the exemptions by administrative agencies.</p>

11 direct the Program Evaluation Division to deal with the occupational
licensing process.  Just for clarification. Section 5 deals with the
exemptions that current administration agencies have from the APA.
Several agencies are completely exempt from the Administrative
Procedures Act.  This directs the Administrative Procedures Oversight
Committee to study that. Section 11 directs the Program Evaluation
Division, as recommended by the Administrative Procedures Oversight
Committee from the interim, to study occupational licensing boards,
including the accommodation or elimination of some of those licensing
boards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to elaborate on that, one of the things that we accomplished last
term was we made rule making more difficult, as it should be. Because
when the executive branch agencies are implementing rules or adopting
rules, these rules affect every citizen of our state in one way or the
other. So a lot of the work that we did in Senate Bill 81 and Senate
Bill 781 was exceptional work, but one of the outcomes, which you find
out in subsequent years is that we’ve made rulemaking so difficult, that
there have been a number of requests from agencies this year to actually
exempt themselves from all or part of the APA.  So it’s actually moving
us in a direction that we don’t need to be moving into. However, instead
of removing the exemptions in one fell swoop, we’re going to actually
study that in the interim to find out what removing those exemptions
actually means, what the outcome will be.  Because the direction that we
definitely want to move into is making rule, having an efficient and
effective rule making process, but have it done in the sunlight. But
also have it done and apply to everyone that would be adopting these
rule and not be able to  have it continue the way it’s continuing now.
Section 11, actually Section 12.  Section 12 amends the law of governing
industrial commission to exempt the Administrator and Deputy
Commissioners from the State Personnel Act.  These positions are
salaried positions. Most salaried positions within the state of North
Carolina that have direct appointments are exempt from the State
Personnel Act so this just brings that into compliance with similar
positions in the State Personnel Act.  Representative Brawley will
handle Section 13.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Moffitt.  Section 13A and B is language that
has already passed the House and been sent to the Senate.  This was to
block efforts by some local government entities to create responsibility
on the part of employers to manage the carbon footprint of their
employees. So this language has just been slightly clarified and brought
over. The next one is on Section 13.1, to clarify local government
preemption.  This language was listed from Senate Bill 612 and
essentially says that if the state of the federal government is
regulating something, that local governments cannot enact regulations
that are more stringent than those adopted by either the federal or
state government.  It also makes the same thing apply to counties. And
then Section 3.2 applies it to counties and then Section3.3 is repealing
a protest petition. There is currently in law a provision of where
adjacent land owners can require super majorities of local boards and
basically take over control of the land use process. What this does is
restore the responsibility to the city councils and make them
responsible for deciding what is the appropriate application of their
designing laws, and their normal voting procedures would continue to
apply.   Section 14 is one of those things that you often hear about as
far as statues that are on the book that really don’t make sense.  This
basically allows a bed and breakfast to serve more than just breakfast
to the patrons that are actually staying in the bed and breakfast.
Currently in statute, a bed and breakfast can only serve breakfast.  But
we have a number of bed and breakfast locations that are quite a bit
aways from restaurants that would actually serve lunch or dinner but
they’re prohibited by statute from even offering lunch or dinner to
their patrons that are actually staying there.  This does not put them
in the restaurant business, this just allow them to accommodate the
folks that are actually staying there overnight.  Section 15 would be.</p>

Representative Murray.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Section 15 is the contents of a Senate bill that has
come over to us for action in the House.  It deals with Professional
Employer Organizations, PEO organizations are similar to ADP, that's an
example of a Professional Employer Organizations, or PEO.  They help
small businesses with outsourced HR, and help provide efficient, cost
effective payroll services.  These changes to lease a definition of a
hazardous financial condition to demonstate that instead of the current
definition it allows to demonstrate when current assets exceed current
liabilities.  It also allows for a uniform bonding requirement,
$100,000, which is similar to other states that regulate PEOs. It
deletes a requirement that a licensee gives assigned employees written
notice when the employee ceases to be an employee.  Makes changes
concerning the rights of the PEO in the client's control, hire,
discipline, terminate signed employees and provides that the insurance
commissioner can only recover reasonable cost, examination of the
licensee following disciplinary violation.  And it also repeals the
provision in the PEO act, giving the commissioner authority permission
to discipline the licensee who has an insurance judiciary willfully
fails to give notice of approved health or life insurance plan
termination if the licensee is an insurance judiciary failure to prior
notice remains a Class H felony under the existing law.  We have people
from Professional Employer Organizations, we still want to dig in and
get some more information about this.  Actually we do have
representative from these organizations here with us today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Section 16 applies to child care providers, and this
only applies to employees that are actively employed with the child care
providers.  Currently a background check is required every 3rd
anniversary, every 3 years of existing child care provider employees,
and when the background check does take some time to go through, and
during that delay, essentially the child care employees have to quit, so
this allows them to move to a probationary status, and allow them to
continue operating in a probationary employment status waiting on the
return of the background check, and the language in there specifically
say that they cannot be alone with any of the children while they're on
probationary status.  Section 17 is something that we're going to take
out, simply because we have an agreement between the House and the
Senate to where we will not be directing in-law what the LRC should be
doing.  That's a joint decision made between leadership in both bodies.
But essentially what we're doing is one of the things I have uncovered
during this regulatory reform effort is that within the Utilities
Commission, they are still assessing regulatory fees on things we as a
body have told them they no longer have the authority to regulate.  From
a public policy standpoint, I do not think it's good for the State of
North Carolina and its legislature to deregulate something, but also
allow it be taxed by allowing the regulatory fee to continue to be
charge against that when they have no oversight responsibility.  So
instead of going in and actually correcting that, we would like to study
that in the interim, and find out how many things we are actually
charging a regulatory fee for, that we no longer regulate and put forth
a plan in the short session.  Section 18, I believe Representative
Murray is going to amend that.  Are you going to amend that?  So we're
going to have an amendment at the bill's presentation to take out
Section 17, but I thought I was instructed to let you know what are
intentions are regarding that particular subject matter.  Section 18 is
another one of those things that, it's brought to you, and it kind of
leaves you scratching your head, but currently retired school buses,
they cut the tops out of them, and they use them as transportation
vehicles for produce.  But the old school buses weigh 26,000 lbs. or
less, the new one's weigh 26,500 lbs., and essentially if it weights
under 26,000 lbs. the driver does not need to have a CDL.  So what we're
dong is we're moving that to 26,500 lbs., so when the newer buses are
retired, they don't have to get a CDL.  Now we do have some additional
work being done in the background here to make sure we're not causing a
problem with the US-DOT, and if there is, then we'll take it out on the
floor, but from all the work we've done thus far, we don't anticipate
that to be a problem.  Section 19, Representative Murray.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Section 19 represents an effort to continue</p>

North Carolina to be the most military friendly state, and it would
allow private non-public employers in the state to provide employment
preference to veterans and spouses of honorably discharged veterans who
have service connected to the veterans. And this provision specifically
provides that granting a preference is not a violation of state or local
equal opportunity law. What we're doing is trying to protect employers
who give a veterans preference from law suits, from discrimination law
suits. So that's the purpose of section 19. Section 20 what we're
referring to is the agriculture right to work piece. Basically it
prohibits a contract purchases of agriculture products from forcing the
farmers to hire union labor in order for their products to be bought by
the contract purchaser. The next two sections, section 20, excuse me, 21
and 22, I'd like to recognize representative Jimmy Dixon to run those
two parts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And for information purposes for the committee and the
public, we will vote this bill out today and we will take a vote on this
bill at 11:30.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. On section 21 I've been
indirectly involved, you may remember that  on certain instances we have
increased the wight limit on certain situations. Number 8 of that
section would add feed ingredients, that would be corn, soybean, corn
meal and so forth as well as certain by-products. It's come to my
attention this morning that this has not been as completely vetted as it
should have been with the highway patrol, and so this particular part of
it is in limbo until we get that worked out.
The other section that he's asked me to talk about, the first part there
22-A is above my pay grade, 22-B just simply does some adjustment to the
definition of agriculture and I think that number 7 there under that is
very good since we do have different kinds of facilities that we are
using as far as grain storage and so forth is concerned. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Additionally on Section 11 the first section is
intended to include grain dealers from the exemption for counties zoning
ordinance. it adds grain and realities of grain to the list of
exemptions, and the second section of this bill codifies that grain is
included in our state's definition of agriculture and agricultural
farming. This helps make sure that counties, that farms operating out of
one county that have another farm operating in another county and
transfer things between those counties don't lose their zoning in the
main county they're operating in. We are on section 23 now.
Section 23 deals with the presumption that taxicab drivers are
independent contractors for purpose of workers compensation law. This
bill passed the senate last session and has already passed the house
this session and is awaiting action in the senate so we are just  - this
bill has already passed this committee once so we're just including it
in this bill as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 25 would amend a provision enacted in 2012
which required the department of environment and natural resources to
adopt rules to prohibit permitted scrap tire collectors from contracting
with the scrap tire processing facility unless the processing facility
documents that it has access to a facility permitted to receive scrap
tires. So that's all that part does. At this point I'd like to recognize
representative Becky Carney. She brought forth section 26 which deals
with carbon monoxide detectors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. First off I want to say thank
you, this language has come to us by recommendation of the restaurant
lodging association. Jim Hobbs got that to me. but I want to thank
representative Hanes whose been involved with this and representative
Jeter and also I really want to say thank you to representative Moffett
and Murray for working with us to get this in here. It does exactly what
it says, it would require the lodging establishments to install
electrical carbon monoxide detectors in hotels. All of us are aware I'm
sure of the senseless deaths that happened here in our state recently,
and also the hospitalization of several people and a lot...</p>

<p id="25:00">
[Speaker Change]
The people’s members up here were quite surprised that they weren’t
required already. So this just moves the building code, directs them to
require that in our, our lodging establishments.
[Speaker Change]
Section twenty seven and twenty eight will actually be handled by
Representatives Catlin and Millis. But before we hear those parts of the
Bill, these particular parts of the Bill have been brought to us by
[??]. Essentially these are actually rules they’ve ask us to, to put in
statute. And this is a result of the fact that rule making has been so
arduous and difficult that this is certainly another way in order to get
a rule adopted which is to have due process done here in the
legislature. But it’s not the most effective way to get accomplished
what we need to get accomplished in our State. However in looking at
what they have asked us, we vetted this with staff. We feel comfortable
that we can move these particular rules forward. And Representatives
Catlin and Millis will explain these three sections.
[Speaker Change]
In regards to sections twenty seven to twenty eight. The Bills for me
does a good job outlining what those sections entail. I just want to
make out a few just quick points so this is a threshold farm issue,
regarding cattle only, confined cattle. Basically if you have confined
cattle over a hundred, then you are required to have a permit from the
Division of Order Quality. This is a Hotel California style provision
where if you go over a hundred confined cattle, you have to have a
permit and if you ever drop below you can’t get out. This [??]
establishes a very responsible procedure. If you drop below a hundred
confined cattle you actually have an opportunity to get yourself back
out. That’s basically it. I’ll stop there.
[Speaker Change]
This is section twenty nine which allows, it’s a [??] question. And it’s
basically related to golf course irrigation, using reclaimed water,
reclaimed waste water which has been treated. And as for those of you
who do play golf, you know that there is always water real close to
where you lose your golf ball. And if you’re going to irrigate those,
those greens and those fairways, you, it’s difficult to meet the
setbacks that are there now. It does still, it eliminates the setbacks
but it does not eliminate the discharges to the water and it does not
allow discharged water to SA waters. So, I think that it’s a good Bill.
And, oh yeah, and then the, the next one is section thirty. It’s the
smoking ban rules and I actually served on the State Healthcare
Commission when we did the first smoking ban rules. And then I served on
a local Health Commission where there was an issue with that in this
restaurant called Kick Back Jacks that in Wilmington they’re not allowed
to smoke and I think up here they are so there’s some confusion on
interpretation of that language. This Bill asks the Commission of Public
Health to clarify that language. Which I think it needs to.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Representative Catlin. Last two sections, section thirty one
is a separability clause which is self-explanatory. And section thirty
two simply deals with the effective date as, which is basically when
this is, becomes law. We do have, I am aware of two amendments. The
first amendment, actually I need to act like a Bill sponsor versus a
Chair. Mr. Chair that concludes my presentation.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you. Representative Murray is recognized to bring forth his
amendments. It’s being passed out to the committee.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. The purpose of this amendment is to delete
section seventeen. The, we’re working with the Senate to, to get this
Bill agreed to and, even though our Speaker would like to see this
remain in the Bill, we’re going to remove this to help foster agreement
with the Senate and take this study out with the hope and intention that
a Legislative Research Commission study will, will be formed to address
this issue. But for the purpose of this Bill, we didn’t want to have
this study in here so I move adoption of the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Members of the committee, you’ve heard the motion from Representative
Murray. Any further discussion or debate regarding this amendment? If
not all in favor say aye. All opposed. Motion carried. Thank you
Representative Murray. [??] is adopted.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Chairman, if I could, I believe we skipped over section eight which

Definition of a private club and the legislation in the previous
session, the definition of private club. I believe there is statutory
reference in advert being left out and so and this just makes sure that
the definition of private club is referred to in the appropriate
statutory references and it statues. So basically it's a technical
change to make sure the definition of private club is appropriately
referred in statues.

Members of committee, the next amendment, this being passed out is being
offered by representative Brody. The committee will be at ease until all
the members have this amendment. While that is being done, we'd like to
thank you the sponsors of for bringing this simple little bill before
the committee today. And we'd like to echo our thanks to Jeff Hudson and
Karen Kopin Brown for their efforts in helping in composing this bill.
We appreciate all the efforts that you have put in. Thank you.
All members have the copies of this amendment. Representative Brody,
please explain your amendment to the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. The amendment basically doesn't change anything,
it just basically asks q request, actually puts it in the statue to have
request. North Carlina is trying to make it's way out of a economic
slump especially in construction and other areas and what we are asking
is that the rules review commission review the surface water quality in
wetlands rule within the next year so there tends to be some dispute
sometimes in that area and we figured we'll get those rules clarified as
soon as possible.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. The bill sponsor answered my question when he
covered section 8, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Ma'am. Representative McElraft.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I have an issue with section 13 1B which is a local
government restrictions on making their ordinances. I do think sometimes
the local government gets out of control but there are times when those
rules need to be more stringent. For instance on the coast we have
flooding issues and some of our storm model rules are 2 inches rather
than the 1 and a half and it's important for us that the, I forgot what
the flood board is called that you put around the bottom of the houses
as a requirement at Atlantic beaches actually brought down flood
insurance cost and insurance cost significantly for that town. So I'd
like to say and I'd like to work with the bill sponsors into this
amendment on the floor because it's gonna be a little bit long and I'll
need time to develop it but I'd like to say that they are not restricted
from doing an ordinance during the public hearing or after the public
hearing within so many hours or so many days or whatever. They receive
10 letter of objection to this ordinance, then they would not be able to
pursue the ordinance, it'd have to go back to the state agency for the
waiver and then the state agency will then decide whether they had a
good reason to do that ordinance or not. I think it will work for the
local governments and I think this will work for a state.It'll keep
control of those who are wild with their ordinance but I really think we
need to give the local governments a little bit more control on that
way. I did talk to bill sponsors, both in the house and the senate and
they are Okay with this but I'd like to do this on the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative McElraft.</p>

<p id="35:00">
Representative Craig Horn. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I
just have a couple questions for, so I can understand, first is on page
12, line 22 I think it is, hold on a second, line 22 is correct. The
phrase, &quot;for the benefit of the commissioner&quot;, would someone
explain that to me, please? Shouldn't it be the benefit of the
commission? Or is that one and the same? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
commissioner refers to the insurance commissioner, in this case, and so
that's, that's what, that's, the appropriate term is commissioner,
because the insurance commissioner does have, is the entity which, where
PEOs are regulated. The, in section 22, that bond is for the
commissioner, not, there's not an insurance commission, it's a
commissioner, that's what that bond is for.[SPEAKER CHANGE] Okay, follow
up, on page 17, the explanation was that lines 43 through 47 are in
limbo, if my recollection is that we passed either out of the ???
committee, or maybe out of the house, that change, and I would have
thought had there been a problem from the state highway patrol that that
would have been voiced by now, is there some new information? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Dixon will answer that question for you,
Representative Horn. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Horn, the
legislation that we passed increased the weight limit for feed trucks
hauling processed feed. The ingredients and the additional byproducts
are totally different types of circumstances, and the highway patrol is
currently working with those who would like this at this time. So it's
totally sepa rate from what we passed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, just
a followup question on that? So therefore, how is that gonna impact the
bill if there's a piece of it that's unresolved? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chair? If it's not resolved it will be taken out on the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Okay, that's, that's, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Harrison? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair, I had a
couple questions for the bill sponsor, and then a comment if I could
please. So, thank you, I do appreciate the need for this, but I think
they may be going a little overboard, I need a clarification on the
House bill 74 provisions, that might be directed to Representative
Murry, or ??? or ???, because I recall that the discussion- [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Harrison, for the benefit of us that do not know
what section you are talking about, please reference that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Section 4. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you ma'am, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I recall that we have some federal, we have some
federal mandates that have to ??? act and such, and because the
provisions in section 4 allow for rules to expire automatically, that
provision, that trouble made it in the earlier discussions in this bill,
and I think you are gonna spend more time thinking about it, but we have
some federal mandates, and I just don't know how that interacts, if we
just let rules expire that are implementing these federal mandates
related to clean air, clean order, whatever federal environmental laws,
how that, how we resolve that, if we just let the state rules expire,
and it might be a question for staff, because I'm just concerned on how
that issue is dealt with. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm looking for the section.
Ms. Cochrane-Brown? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. The rules
don't expire unless the agency fails to actually go through the process
of reviewing them, so the agency has the power to prevent that from
happening. In addition, there's a provision that allows the rule's
review commission to subject rules to review, so that, certainly someone
raised it to the rule's review commission if the agency wasn't action in
a timely ???, the rule's review commission then could direct the agency
to readopt the rule. This isn't supposed to happen, rules aren't
supposed to expire, this basically is a process to require and enforce
agencies to actually go through the process of readopting rules.</p>

And that’s the intent, and page 4, um lines 3 through 7 the necessary
without substantive public interest.  A rule where the agent has not
received public comment concerning the role within the past two years is
being, as determined by the agents to be necessary without substantive
public interest.  We would expect that an agreed upon role, by members
of the regulated public, that are subject to or required by the federal
government because of an EPA-type situation that would likely fall under
that category would not require any action by the agency to prevent
expiration. A rule that has been identified by an agency that is
necessary without substantive public interest would prevent that role
from expiration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I appreciate that. What I’m sort of trying to anticipate different
scenarios I can see in the agent, see that when there’s a very
controversial bill that they might be hostile to the implementation to
that rule and might just let it expire but the fact that Karen Concord
Brown says that the rules review commission could take it up if they got
the ten letters of protest gives me some comfort that that might not
happen. OK, thank you, the second question I had was related to the
vegetation changes because I know we’ve been dealing with this billboard
issue for several years and I thought we had sort of stakeholder
compromise agreed to last year. I’m just trying to figure out what, why
these changes are being made. Let’s see, I’m not sure I have the
section. Sections 9, A and B.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moffitt
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. In regard to Senate Bill 183 that passed last session,
there’s a disagreement in regard to the interpretation and
implementation of the vegetation cut. On on ramps and off ramps between
the DOT and the industry. And this attempt to clarify that
misinterpretation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and Mr Chair if I could just comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I really appreciate the hard work of the bill sponsors and I’m very
troubled that we’re going a bit too far. I’m concerned about the
substance of House Bill 74. I still don’t have concerns about that. That
are folded into this bill. I’m worried about the section that
Representative McElraft mentioned about the local ordinances. I think
that the federal government has provided a floor not a ceiling for
protecting the public health and the natural resources of our various
states and local communities. The protest petition repeal, that’s very
troubling to me. That’s been very important to ?? in Greensboro. We just
got it back a couple years ago through the hard work of our entire
delegation. And there are other provisions as well. I’ll be vetting
those. Thank you for your work on this sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative ??. Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ve got a, I have a question on page 6, line
33 and I’m just a little… Is this saying that a private contractor does
not have to pay minimum wage?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moffitt
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, it does not. Basically what it says is that a city or county may not
impose on a vendor that it’s doing business with, a rule that it cannot
impose on everyone else in regards to compensation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But isn’t minimum wage the law?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This does not apply to minimum wage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Baskerville?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just have a couple questions
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What, Representative Moffitt, thank you for doing a very, I think,
detailed job on explaining these provisions to us. My question is What
is a PEO? I mean, I don’t even know what that is. Can you tell me what
that is, what they do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please identify that section if you will, for my benefit if not for
everybody else’s.

I would like to- we have both representatives from the insurance
commissioner's office here and a representative from PEO here with us. I
would ask that, Mr. Chair, that you would recognize Rose Vaughn Wiliams
with the Dept. of Insurance and then recognize the representative from
the PEO, the organization after her, and I think we can hear a
conversation about this section that would enlighten. Rep. Baskerville.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Chairman, Rep. Murry, Rep. Baskerville.
My name is Rose Vaughn Williams and I'm legislative counsel to the North
Carolina Dept. of Insurance, and we were tasked several years ago with
the licensing and regulation of PEOs, which is short for Professional
Employer Organization. A PEO can, for example, for your business, you're
a small business owner, and you don't want to run all the Human
Resources part of the business. You can hire a PEO to do that for you.
Collect the taxes, pay the taxes, if it's a health insurance issue,
collect that money and pay those premiums and that kind of thing. They
can also provide staffing services as well, but a large part of their
job is to take the funds of other business's employees and handle those
funds in an appropriate manner, and that's the transfer that gets the
government involved a little bit to make sure that it's safe. And I can
answer any other questions and would love to be heard on the provision
if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions from Ms. Rose Vaughn Williams?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, the changes in this section of the bill in my opinion
improve the licensing oversight process for PEOs by making requirements
less burdensome and costly for the PEOs, and it will- but, it still
maintains, in my opinion, appropriate regulatory authority for the
insurance commissioner over these entities. This balance will help our
small businesses, and it will keep the costs of regulation low while
helping our small businesses. And Mr. Chairman if you would recognize
the representative from PEO to describe one of these sections necessary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please come forward to state your name for the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members.
My name is Adam Peer, and I'm the director of state and government
affairs to the National Association  of Professional Employer
Organizations. So we're a national organization ?? substantive presence
here through our membership in North Carolina. Rose is correct in her
description of the industry, the only thing that I would add is what a
PEO does is through a statutory creative relationship co-employees those
workers, it creates the nexus with those employees so that they can
directly sponsor benefits such as health insurance, workers'
compensation, remit UI taxes, etc. In working with the bill authors,
both in the Senate bill where this language comes from as well as the
office that's for the bill before this committee, it's the association's
provision that these amendments are more in conformity and strike that
balance between regulation and allowing us to serve our small business
clients. It brings it in a little more balance and also brings certain
provisions in North Carolina law more consistent and more harmonized
with what your neighbors in the other states are doing to make it more
of a level playing field. So I'd be happy to answer any particular
questions. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So these PEOs are hired by small businesses to take care of their
benefits for their employees, their taxes they need to pay on employees,
and those- and things along those lines and this provision makes lax the
reporting requirements or the educational background that these PEO
accountants have to have? I'm still- I don't understand what the- I do
understand what a PEO is now, but I don't understand what this law- what
this section does about what the PEOs can or can't do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Murry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First section deals with a consistent bonding requirement of $100,000,
which is similar to every other bonding requirement that any other state
that regulates PEOs, we've got a consistent $100,000 bond.</p>

<p id="50:00">
The section there is some ambiguous qualification language in the
current statute so this replaces this with a clear requirement for the
network of a PEO to be in order to obtain and renew a license. The bill
updates certain requirements that much be included in contract between
the PEO and his client between rights and responsibilities  of each
party over covered employees. Current law permits the Insurance
Commission to charge a PEO for the cost of an examination even if no
violations are found. And so this permits the Commissioner to recover
the cost of that examination if violations are found. This approach is
consistent with neighboring states and so additionally this bill removes
a reporting requirement that could force a PEO to pay a client’s
insurance cost if the client chooses not to fund an insurance plan. And
so if the small business doesn’t fund their insurance plan the burden of
that, the decision of that shouldn’t fall back on the PEO that’s the
small business owner’s decision and so this clarifies and modernizes
that provision as well. This provision, this bill, Senate Bill 475
passed the Senate and is waiting action here in the House and I know
the, I think that we’ve got a balanced solution here to make sure
there’s appropriate regulatory oversight and maintain flexibility for
these PEO’s to help benefit our small businesses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’d like to revisit one moment House Bill 74, in
regards to some reservations that Representative Harrison mentioned. In
the development of that bill, I’m not sure if members will recall but we
actually had all the stakeholders at the table. We had Rules Review
Commission as well as the Rules Review Coordinators from our agencies
and we paid particular attention to the concern that was voiced
regarding any encroachment on federal regulations to make sure we would
not run sideways with any action that we took in this body. So we feel
comfortable that House Bill 74 was re put into this bill, which is the
same that passed the House is consistent with the, has the necessary
precautions in there to where we won’t run afoul of federal law. In
closing, I would like to thank Senator Jackson for allowing us to use
his bill, Senate Bill 112 for this regular form effort.  I appreciate
all the work that has gone into this bill, I appreciate staff. This is a
bipartisan effort. We’ve got lots of issues in here that have been
brought forward by members of the body as well as members from, citizens
from our state. And with that Mr. Chair I’d like to move for a favorable
report for Senate Bill 112 as amended rolled into a new Committee
Substitute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Moffit. We have a question from Senator
Bumgardner.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I had a question about Section 30. Specifically,
on page 23, line 42 and 43 it says, as though 10 or more written
objections had been received by, as provided by GS150b21.  Explain that
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, that if I may, I would like to redirect that to Ms.
Cochrane-Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Cochrane-Brown please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Representative Bumgardner, under current law, the
AK provides a process when the rule has been adopted and reviewed and
approved by the Rules Commission, which is a part of the current
process.  Any 10 people can submit letters objecting to that rule to the
Rules Review Commission by the day after the Rules Review Commission
approves it. And that rule then cannot go into effect until the 30th day
of the next legislative session. Basically this is a process to subject
controversial rules, and by that we mean rules that at least 10 people
have some  concerns with, to bring those rules back to the legislature
so the legislature can determine whether there are any needed changes in
the policy that need to be made before that rule can go into effect.
That’s the current law and that’s the current process for all
rulemaking. What this provision would do is to basically provide that
these new rules that are going to be adopted under this section will be
treated that way regardless if whether or not they get.</p>

...actually get ten letters. These rules will be required to come back
to the Legislature, so the Legislature can review them before they go
into effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is this section going to make it more or less
difficult for a restaurant or a bar to have a smoking section, or not?
And, what effect, if any, is it gonna have on these smoking bars that
are in various places.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Catlin will answer that question for
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I'll do my best to. There is an
issue in the definition of no smoking. It requires that it not have
three walls, and that you don't have to pass through it if you're a non
smoker, and a variety of other definitions like that. And there have
been some, some local differences in how to interpret that, as I
mentioned with the Kickback Jack's Restaurant. And so, I would suspect
that it'll just clarify the rules, and if, and if a restaurant or a bar
meets the clarified rules, then they'll be able to have smoking. If they
don't, then they won't. But right now there is some confusion, confusion
between the interpretation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not right this minute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Hollo.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Real quick question. Overall,
it seems we've increased the effort and time, and maybe expense for the
agencies to maintain the rules they already have in place. And we, of
course, cut the budgets over the past several budget cycles, and I wanna
know, has there been any attempt or any statement of what the additional
cost for this more periodic rule review is? And has it been allotted for
in the budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Representative Hollo. We have actually put a provision in the budget
that allows for the Rules Review Commission to actually expand in
regards to number of attorneys, as well as support personnel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Has there been any additional funding provided to the
agencies themselves, who are gonna do the internal reviews and process
these on a more periodic basis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not that I'm aware of. I would just add, in the
development process of House Bill 74 every agencies, every agency has a
person dedicated for rules promulgation. Every one of those individuals
was invited and participated in the stakeholdering process to develop
House Bill 74. So they're aware, and they help make it less burdensome
on themselves by helping make this process more clear so that not every
rule is gonna be subject to continual review. They will be able to
identify rules that will prevent extra work for them. But, but at the
same time, I think when we're in, just to rehash some of the discussion
from House Bill 74, for every rule that exists, there is, there is a
person or a business that is regulated. And so the burden on the
regulator and the burden on the regulated, you have to balance both of
those and make sure that the rules are not overly burdensome on one end
for the business and small business owners, and that the regulator has a
sufficient direction from the general assembly and they aren't enforcing
rules that are outdated or unnecessary. And I think the agencies are
completely on board with helping make sure their job is focused on where
the, where the need is. And that's, that's what this process and House
Bill 74, and section 4 of this bill are intended to accomplish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fulghum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To that, Mr. Chairman. My understanding was that there
was some staff attorneys for agencies that had been assigned to the
Attorney General's office, that were back, reassigned to the staff
agencies. Is that correct? For this purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know there were, has been some shifting around of
attorneys in the budget process, and I'm, it is unclear to me at this
point. But I think you're correct. Some attorneys from the, from the
Attorney General's office are being redirected back to the agencies. I
think that's mainly for hearings. For the administrative hearings
process, for appeals and such like that. But, but divisional labor for
the agencies from an attorney's perspective is occurring.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt, you are recognized for your
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move that Senate Bill 112 as
amended receive a favorable report.</p>
