I would like to begin by offering my sincere thanks to those of you who
have taken time to be here today. The agenda of today will be a
presentation from our State Board of Elections, in which you will get, I
hope, to meet our Director. And he has brought some key staff that he's
going to introduce as well. We will then introduce our committee staff
and they will address the election related legislation that passed
during the last legislative session. So with that, the Chair is going to
ask Mr. Gary Bartlett if he, Mr. Bartlett's here I was told, to please
come up to the front sir. And at this time, the Chair will recognize the
Executive Director of the State Board of Elections, Mr. Bartlett. You
have the floor sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I would like to
thank you and the Speaker and other leaders for the approach that you
are taking on the Voter ID Bill and I concur with your gold standard. As
everyone knows in here, there's a transition going on. There will be a
new board soon and the new board, when they are named and sworn will
make some changes, but until then, for this committee and for any Senate
Committee, we are going to have Johnny McClain, who is our Chief Deputy
Director, be responsible for anything dealing with administration of the
elections, absentee, any ITS issues with the help of Marc Burris and
voting systems, and Kim Strach, anything to do with campaign finance.
And I will assist in anyway possible to do whatever needs to be done for
the needs of the voters, the general assembly and any interested public.
As you know, there are five members to the State Board of Elections and
we have fifty-two employees. The Board has oversight of all the
elections, voter registration and campaign finance. Also, they hear
appeals and conduce investigative hearings. We have a little over six
point four million registered voters. When I began we only had three
point one million registered voters. I would like to share a couple
things before I introduce the staff. I was told that [?] revenue was
what was needed. I'd like to call your attention that we have some very
good websites that you can get information from. We have a general
website and also an elections resource center which shows our governance
and also we probably have the most data of anyone or any elections
office in the United States. So, feel free to use it and if you don't
know where to look for it, please give us a call. Some of the things
that we were able to do through the years is that we were the first
southern state to implement the National Voter Registration Act of 1992
and we were one of the leaders in the Help America Vote Act. We also
have one of the most cost effective and comprehensive voter registration
systems and there were only two in the United States before we started
ours. This has been very helpful during the redistricting process. Since
2010, our staff, both the voting equipment section and the [?] seams
section has been getting data and reports to the general assembly and I
have been, and since the lawsuit, have offered five affidavits for the
state. North Carolina has also been an elections model for agency voter
registration and also for those with handicap and disabilities. We have
worked that part very hard.</p>

<p id="05:00">
And we also have got a couple things that may not know about.  Is that
long time ago, back in the early, it was around 2003, we started
implementing a uniformity, a uniformity program where everything that we
do as far as procedures and forms are the same from one end of the state
to the other. This was something new in elections. And we left enough
flexibility for local control, so that they could make some decisions
that would be helpful for their county. We also have something we call a
wellness check and that is a self audit of the county board of elections
to determine if they're in compliance and what their needs are and what
help that they may need. But, we also have many other successes but I
thought that I would just share that with you. And Mr. Chairman, if
there's time at the end, I've got seven suggestions or I can just give
them to you. At this time I would like to introduce Johnny McClain, she
is our chief deputy, for a few words. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. McClain
please, you have the floor ma'am. Up here, please. We're glad that
you're here with us today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and
Mr. Bartlett. It has been my privilege to have worked at the board of
elections since 1985. In case you have heard a rumor that I have been
there forever since the beginning of time, it is slightly exaggerated,
but I do seem to have quite a period of time with the board of elections
and have been fortunate to oversee and be part of many of the changes
that Mr. Bartlett has identified. If there are ever any questions that
you have, information that you need, we are pleased to provide that
information to you as quickly and accurately as possible. In addition to
election results, voter registration totals, we also assist in the
administration of the absentee voting laws. There has been a complete
rewrite of the absentee voting laws that included both the civilian and
then most recently, the military and overseas citizens. Not to say that
it might not need some further review to allow for more participation by
the people qualified to vote by absentee ballot. Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Director McClain. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Next we
have Kim Streck, who is our campaign finance director. Deputy director.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Welcome to the committee Ms. Streck. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you committee. I am Kim Streck. I'm the
deputy director for campaign finance and most of you, if I haven't had
the opportunity to meet you personally, I'm sure you've probably met
someone on our staff who has hopefully been helpful in assisting you
with your required reporting with our office. The campaign finance
division provides disclosure, as you well know, of all your reports. We
do that from our website and we have the ability for you to come in and
see anything that any candidate in the state has filed. One of the
things that we hope that will happen eventually will be that all
committees will file electronically with our office so that we can
provide you more efficient and timely disclosure of those reports. We
have a small staff, but please know that any questions you have,
anything that we can do for you we would certainly at any time be happy
to do that. Thanks. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Next, I'd like to call on Mark
Birth, who is director... [end]</p>

Then what you mean by that regulation and it's supposed to do this I
mean, but you have the envelope of the following home at night, but said
the machinery of the different from the machines  such techniques used
from the ITC employed now the action we have two types of unemployment
North Carolina one is optical scan works since which is the paper refill
in the auto the post with added later that is calling him 100 and they
have us the counter in deplorable actions office that takes the same
ballot that is of 650 handed, is only four absentee ballots or recounts
the other, voting equipment is the on direct record of electronic on the
 touch screen machine that, as a paper trail and those served two terms
of had been living on a machine called a freak accident when she is
currently being used the state board is in the process of completing a
certification or the next generation of him 100 would show will be a
hands better features but that is why we have a North Carolina analysts
say that, the touch screen, try even though it's in the balance of the
45, 32-represents about 40% by the voters and it's usually in the war
populated metropolitan areas the optical scan workstations and better
utilized in smaller companies Mr. Bartlett feature could fall on that
all need to use a touch screen technology (SPEAKER CHANGES)   is they're
in Colander all for the books real life the way to achieve not solve one
of us need two and received a call from one and we have been (SPEAKER
CHANGES)  we have a backup batteries with a 4 hour lights and we also
have generators Stevens county needs to be a patient, we'll have we've
had some electrical outages four and we're not an issue that we've been
able to get the general reader scored 4 hour is battering go back to
schools and was sufficient of two additional action picture arts and
(SPEAKER CHANGES) some have called you have to have a column and an
basic question the nineties there was the direct touch typing the G A
heard they're all hour of paper trail forces to simply we've read out a
number into the game that's considered a paper trail (SPEAKER CHANGES)
noted has a boater visible paper trail where the voters sees how they
are toys is more peace initiative owner wants to change the walls and
for the change in one movie on the voting this then the cast and inside
machine there or in least  two or $3.00 rebounded that that's where you
could create health ballot issues, but by the way the things that is so
the bill of more of a legislate tours may not mind is that in 2006 we
introduce any of saying after each election, Mario original and also a
tournament selections where we have a statistician currently under
contract if you and say they have to election it was a random selection
of polling places where we do they can track  not only for the emblem
hundred marks its paper on ballots and also for the scrolling paper and
other cities in the output from AIDS and determine whether in on the
roads and so far and away and not had any issues with either machine the
only difference is used it would mark cents paper ballots some people do
not always market for Gerry Owen market too late but issue voter in 10th
when the circle and they were circle or write in the name of all the
circle where is if there is an IQ of you …..</p>

Speaker Changes: Representative ?? please state your purpose
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr.Chairman i ask Mr?? a question
Speaker Changes: ??
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr ?? for being here with us this afternoon
ii have a question and follow up that if chairman if how many votes were
cast here in 2012 election in North Carolina
Speaker Changes: if the chair could interrupt told Mr.Chair ?? is no
going to do any maths so of we need to check that up we need to evacuate
Speaker Changes: then let me ask that follow up before that question
Speaker Changes: 4.5 million
Speaker Changes: yes
Speaker Changes: 4.5million
Speaker Changes: somewhere around there
Speaker Changes: and follow up Mr.Chairman
Speaker Changes:yes mam you are recognized of that 4.5 million how many
documents of cases were of fraud ?? find in that number
Speaker Changes: Speaker Changes:we are still having that investigation
at the moment we have out ??
Speaker Changes: thank you
Speaker Changes: Representative john please state your purpose,
Speaker Changes: for a question Mr.Charmian ? behind you thank you than
you for being here today had  another line of questions that I'm gonna
be brief but just a i wanna little bit tabulated between ?? on the
machine trail could you give a some approximate percentage of ballot's
in north Carolina that o f the actual paper ballot that voter actually
marks do you know that I'm asking,
Speaker Changes: no sir
Speaker Changes:let me predict this way idea of more than one buying OK
i gotta buying and i actually get what i received ?? in duplicate that i
marked down and that shows exactly what my amount total was i gotta
another buying and i receive a seat if it will it tells me that my ??
was certain amount but it is not i duplicate my paper OK in my home
county we mark ballot's we mark paper ballot's and the machine that
counts that balance and if we want to ?? we would see the actual ballot
that are marked and it would be ?? in that paper ballot's now what I'm
understanding with some of the paper computer there is as paper trail in
the sense that is ?? that tell some who i voted for ?? bit three is not
a actual piece of paper that i marked  is that correct
that is correct
Speaker Changes: and so the question I'm asking you i guess i
approximately what percentage of those votes in North Carolina would be
the actual pieces of paper that the voter marked  I'm just trying to get
a feel for 95 % or 50% ??
Speaker Changes: i would ask the staff ?? if they have a better answer
than me but i would say that the paper of that the voter actually marks
represents about 60% those who vote
Speaker Changes: follow up Mr.Chair different subject altogether i don't
know if you have a particular staff member that ?? I'm gonna talk little
about training for people that work on county board of elections i seen
that have over seemed in count y board of elections but there is some
kind of training conferences that they may attended something that helps
down is that in the case
Speaker Changes:yes sir
Speaker Changes: we have during the even number of years two conferences
state wide during odd number of years one we also have director
conferences that are in same number in opposite years so we have at
least two over year we have a certification ?? that is optional for
county board members in fact a direct must have a passing grade of 85 or
have to take the test until the ??
Speaker Changes: follow up in odd number of years when were that be the
odd number of years would probably be in august
Speaker Changes: is that some king of training that takes place from
April i heard recently from county board
Speaker Changes: that is going to be the county association conference
and that is overseen by the state board of elections would you have an
input and would that be</p>

And we usually said the Indian those say they can have a course called
him and we know that there is one of the building (SPEAKER CHANGES)
four 1st week of all but five, to share my like my concern else getting
around to use if you had some oversight are input in the SNA is
concerning the meeting we would have training in April for basically
outgoing board members when you when you're placing board members in any
gap in the state board is coming in first and may need county board is
coming and then in June I understand some of the same people will still
be on that board of building the new members and that this ABC to the
resources and time and effort being spent to train people that are
basically outgoing board member site is not always to get some input
into the timing and schedule there might be there  (SPEAKER CHANGES)
going home state to the directors association about the honesty and yet
is there are all conference with Bateman of every one of the
steelworkers made lately and of the board members become the law will
have always (SPEAKER CHANGES ) represented by the restriction or to
become belligerent banking is cheered I usually two coming on the
facility missed on command you hang your staff from the great work to
achieve. I had been down here for several years who started out doing a
paper polling and your staff is trying to help me convert two via
electronic I can imagine you weren't of work seemed to really
overwhelming for this month's elections are eight Angeles, 12 black go
to Cuba nine visit two of the inner core of the actions we need to go on
at least  some of his staff to link and telling them I think they
probably think if dying on behalf of the students are really nice
facility and much more room is the first time at the end of an
opportunity to see you now want to mention for the work that you ought
to continue doing a great job in 2 to 1 and two represent two on stage
or five question Mr. Garlic (SPEAKER CHANGES) ginger and let rise and so
they were present Jones question of offering me with an election process
of migrating from Greg bell Atlantic and on election process alone as a
catcher national party and I stand with a stranger for you suspect of
money back in the town of medicines and then authorization vote which
ago and signed an issue of sessions using the same as much attention and
then the moment as in the newspaper scroll of mine (SPEAKER CHANGES)
Mr. Bentsen the authorization vote is a slew of its use in lieu of fall
below and reason why it is a better system of keeping out the one that
he and his username your address the balanced out by the way and
signature scent of the areas in the issue with the black market record
of that record is not try to play with so far over to the fall of some
of the second site and that the median and I think this (SPEAKER CHANGES
)using used during early voting against the computer strain the article
with five different or you still have the same process: things you need
to know about early voting is the bad effects of the voting and you will
be documented with the number and if it means Chairman George is not
correct all but if its challenge for use by the little of the campaign
for two or more fall agenda for kids under the subject,(SPEAKER CHANGES)
 we have a situation project was passed selection and the 2012 receiving
some problems John Gresham’s plane such an era line between good and
presidential election of leaving its mark on logging plans to come out
of five boys are the vote jump from one to the other end of session
airlines and its solution down the road four making a bigger space may
be so that the sausage and we'll have representatives of the U.S. wants

soon. One of the things that I would like to share with the committee,
is that some of it deals with how high or short a person is, whether
they use their index finger, or if they use their thumb, we've seen them
use their knuckles,
and what we suggest, aside from looking at the scrolling paper to ensure
that you mark the choice that you wanted, is to use a stylus or an
eraser at the end of a pencil. That certainly will help cut down on
those issues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Chair's gonna give Mr. Bartlet a brief break, and the Chair
wanted to ask Miss Strack - and I apologize, Miss Strack, I didn't give
you time to prepare for this, but as I listened to Representative
Mobley's comments, I was just curious if you could speak - and you can
speak from that mic as well - if you could speak to what percentage of
the campaign finance reports are still filed manually as opposed to
electronically. Miss Strack, if you will, would you press that button
right in front of you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Probably, a safe estimate is there's probably close to 75% of the
reports are probably filed manually, and what this translates for our
staff is that all of that information has to be in the data entered in
order for the public to be able to search that data, but there's
probably... I would say less than 30% are filed electronically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair would like to thank all of the members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Representative Michaux, please state your...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I'd like to...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair does apologize, sir, I did not see you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's all right. No problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm used to being ignored.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's never happened since I've been here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know, I know.  Miss Strack, let me ask you this. Have you all changed
the platform so that it would be able to interact with various other
platforms? I've raised that question before.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know you have. You have, and that is something that, we are working
with a vendor now, to do just that, so that people that have Mac
computers, such as yourself, could also use the software. That is
something we do not have available at this time, but it is something
that we have asked the vendor that we've contracted with to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You got an idea when that's probably gonna get through? I'm tired of
filing manually.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we want you to be able to file electronically as well, so I will
see if I can get back with you on a time that it should be ready.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair's intent was only to give Mr. Bartlet a break, the Chair was
not trying to ignore Representative Faircloth and Representative
Cunningham. Representative Starnes, you have an inquiry and you are
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any evidence that people who file electronically have fewer
errors than those who do it on paper?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not sure that I could tell you... Speak intelligently about what the
differences are. I would say that those that file electronically, there
are things in our software that prompt you if you make a mistake, it's
gonna point those things out to you, so I would hope that people that
file electronically are gonna find some of their errors identified for
them before they actually file the report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, did you have an inquiry for Miss Strack?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman's recognized. And Mr. Bartlet, I think you're gonna be back up
here in just a minute. Please, Representative Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you file the electronic version, and the last sheet on the hard
requires signature, to show... I mean, I haven't seen it, haven't tried
it, but everyone keeps encouraging it so I'm gonna try it... but what
type of signature's required, on the last... Page nine?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We still require a signature, so you would file electronically and
submit that to our office, but you would also have to print out a hard
copy of just the summary page-- the cover page with your original
signature and mail that to our office.</p>

we was in one of the other sub-committee meetings and the one person
said the reason why they hand carried hard copy so they don't have to
deal with mail fraud[SPEAKER CHANGES]well I would hope is not the reason
why you would do that[SPEAKER CHANGES]the chair would like to point out
that we only have about five minutes left the chair has acknowledged
Representative Faircloth and then Representative Cunningham so Mr
Bartley I think they have an inquiry for you Representative Faircloth
you are recognized[SPEAKER CHANGES]thank you Mr. Chairman questions from
Mr. Bartley if I may we have literally thousands of students every year
who come from North Carolina for higher education we have literally
thousands of military personnel who come into this state and out of this
state every year when a student for example from let's say Kentucky
comes to North Carolina and goes to one of our Universities and on the
records at the University and list their home address as Kentucky
whatever their proper address is but they're staying at obviously
staying here for the purpose of the election what is their address are
they a North Carolina voter or a Kentucky voter [SPEAKER CHANGES]because
of court cases in the past which governs this the student has the right
to register in North Carolina same thing with a military family however,
if there is any evidence that shows that they are not truly a resident
because of other actions they do then they can be challenged and if they
are shown not to be a true resident then they can be removed from the
rolls[SPEAKER CHANGES]follow-up [SPEAKER CHANGES]gentlemen
recognized[SPEAKER CHANGES]assume for a moment that a student is in
North Carolina another student registers here cast a vote here and then
gets on the plane and goes back to Kentucky it's a National Election and
goes there because that's his home state and cast a vote is there any
cross reference between elections boards in the various states that
would protect that double ??[SPEAKER CHANGES]not at the moment unless we
received information thirty years we have collaborated with different
states whenever we were able to get that information in fact, one of the
seven suggestions I've got with chairman Lewis is to enter into a
consortium with states on voting equipment and voter registration so we
can do cross checks beyond state lines. Currently we have just
completed,well we'll soon to be completed an investigation where we

Carolina[SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you sir[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative
Cunningham you are recognized Ma'am[SPEAKER CHANGES]thank you Mr.
Chairman Mr. Bartley as a regular voter I came in and voted I wanted to
know if there is any kind of verification of how I voted i'll have to
come to the board of elections how long would that process take and is
not technology to the point where they can give me a verification slip
when I vote [SPEAKER CHANGES]repeat please I want to make sure I
understood what you said[SPEAKER CHANGES]as a regular voter if I came in
to the voting booth and I voted and wanted to check and see if my vote
was cast properly I would have to come to the board of elections what
would that process time take for you to verify and show me how I voted
and is not technology to the point where if I vote it can kick me out a
verification slip showing how I voted[SPEAKER CHANGES]but first of all,
there is no verification slip to show how you voted because we have

Representative Starnes, I'm gonna let you have the last word.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I want to follow up on Representative
Faircloth's comments. The student is from Kentucky. He's in college in
North Carolina, so he registers to vote in North Carolina and by doing
so is claiming that he is a resident of North Carolina. The parent of
the student is claiming him as the deduction on his federal income tax
saying that I'm keeping him up. Would that in itself be a conflict as to
residency?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, sir. What I need to do is get you the court case and show you what
the standards are that the court has laid out for that. One of the
things that we have seen in the past that is unsettling is that you'll
have a student go to a university. They will get excited about
registering and voting there, and the parents, being their relatives
send an absentee ballot application request, and it's sent to the
parents and we have caught some voting that ballot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Starnes. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe Jerry
Cohen wanted to weigh in on this. However, the chair did not anticipate
that Mr. Bartlett would have been as big of an attraction as he has been
today, and in accordance with House rules, we must adjourn in order to
go to the floor. So the committee stands adjourned.</p>
