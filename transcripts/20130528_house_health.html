We'll call this meeting to order.  Pages serving the committee this
morning are Cindy Beaver, Emily Hishram, and Madison Hendrick.  Thank
you for your service to the committee this morning.  Sergeant at Arms
serving the committee this morning are Fred Hines, Reggie Sills, John
Brandon, and Mike Clampett.  Thank you gentlemen.  We have one bill
before the committee this morning, Senate Bill 208, Effective Operation
of the 1915-BC Waver.  There is a PCS before the committee without
objection.  Representative Dollar to present the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
What we have here, Senator Tucker sent over to us in Senate Bill 205, a
framework which what we have done through as number of iterations, and I
want to thank the staff, Jan Paul, Walker Regan, Dr. Porter, Sara Riser,
and I think some others that have worked on this is to refine the bill
Senator Tucker sent to us.  I think it was termed at one point in time
the 'Red Flag Bill', and those that are familiar with that, we certainly
kept to the spirit and refined it further.  Let me just try to explain,
and I'll try to keep it relatively brief and obviously we'll be
available to answer any questions you might have.  This is actually the
3rd, or at least in my view, it's the 3rd in a series of bills.  General
Assembly made a decision in 2011 to expand what's call the 1915B, and
1915C waivers statewide.  Under those waivers, we operate in Medicaid or
mental health services, and our intellectually or developmentally
disabled services as well substance abuse services.  The state had
established the pilot some 7, 8 years ago with Piedmont Developmental
Health.  That pilot demonstrated both tremendous strength in terms of
the provision of quality services as well as considerable savings with
regards to state funds.  It was actually a nationally recognized model.
So the decision of the General Assembly in 2011 was to expand that state
wide.  Now, since that time, since the passage of House Bill 916, the
House also passed last year House Bill 191, if I remember correctly, it
was a bill that with further refining, addressing some managerial
issues, some governance issues.  There was a committee put together of
stake holders.  That bill was crafted, it was passed in furtherance of
making the transition from the local management entities into the public
managed care organizations.  The target date was set, and will be met,
and is being met July 1 of this year, for the entire state to be
operating under the 1915 B and C waivers.  We knew it would not be an
easy transition, and it has had its challenges.  The key, I think, in
mental health is for us to have a plan and stick to it.  I think that's
been the thing that has troubled the state over the years.  We don't
always stick to a plan that we make.  This time we're trying to stick to
it, and we're also trying to make adjustments as we need to make those
along the way.  Senate Bill 208, in my view, is sort of the 3rd bill in
this series.  Some of the issues that have come up, there were questions
with regard to the secretary's authority to transition to a small number
of LME-NCOs.  As many of you know, there were 40 some groups, several
years ago</p>

was winowed down to 23 in the initial movement to the 1915 DNC waivers,
we transitioned again down to 11 and are in the process of moving to 10
as Western Highlands is becoming a part of Smokey and what is going on
there and what was felt as there needed to be clarification for the
Secretary as other issues have come up and come to the ?? there needs to
be clarity as to what the Secretary's specific authorities are, how
those operate and what are those parameters and that is what you see in
front of you in Senate Bill 208.
Section 1 is an additional clarifying power. Section 2, the title says
the actions by the Secretary to ensure effective management of
behavioral health services, under the waiver, these are the things to be
looked at.  If you turn over to page 2 the bulk of page 2 in items 1, 2
and 3, are the areas, if any one of these is not being met, the
Secretary is directed to take action to combine that essentially failing
LEMCO?? in with an LEMCO?? that is operational and has the capacity.
Item 1, there on page 2, basically involves financial solvency, item #2
is the payment of claims and Item #3 is the appropriate documentation
that you have to have to operate.
Further on there are specifics in here with regard to time tables and
how the
non-compliant LEMNCO?? is to move forward.  If you look at page 3, down
on line 14, under item D, you see 7 separate sections in there.  These
are areas that if the LMNCO?? is found to be deficient in one or more of
these areas, there has to be a clear plan of correction put into place
where we have deadlines and certain ?? to move forward and to get these
items and these areas corrected.  Moving on down, beginning at the
bottom of page 3 and moving on over to page 4, we have provisions in
this bill that lay out how the transitional, when LMNCO?? is being
susumed by another, how that area and that MCO?? is to be susumed, how
we ensure successful transition to the larger group and issues like for
example, ensuring that providers are going to be paid for and that the
new larger area is going to be representative of the area that is being
taken over.  Risk reserve, there is a lot of technicality and so there
was a tremendous amount of work put into working through these issues
making sure we have a process that will operate efficiently and
effectively and will both serve as a protection for clients receiving
services as well as protections for providers in the process to ensure
that during the transition they will be paid and we will have a smooth
transition.  Obviously, right now there is a transition going on between
Smokey and Western Highlands and from what I understand that they are
working on, their transition will be able to fit within what we are
looking at here in this legislation.  There are, down under section 6 on
page 5 and moving forward, there are some clarifying technical language,
there is under, on the last page, you will see, that under item #8, we
have establishment of a county commissioner</p>

Advisory board as these LMEMCO's get larger our counties have expressed
an interest to continue to be engaged. They're engaged anyway because
they're appointing the members of the LMEMCO governors board, but we've
also provided for an opportunity to have an additional advisory board of
county commissioners that can be established to sort of relieve the
concern about continuing to have input form the counties. We are also in
this process eliminating under section nine the ability to have a single
county LMEMCO everybody is going to have to operate in the state under
the same set of rules and regulations so we're taking care of an issue
that was there. Mr. Chairman, I covered a lot of ground, we certainly
will attempt to answer any questions or probbaly call on staff if folks
have questions that they want to ask.
I would just quickly sum up to say what we are committed too and what I
hope this committee will endorse and what this general assembly will
endorse is a continued commitment to have an effective wayward [??]
program statewide in the area of mental health. Mental health is a
difficult area in need of reform. I believe that we have established the
structure to have one of the best mental health systems in the country.
But we have to continue to work at it to make sure that it's operational
and to make sure that our goal of having statewide effective operation
of the 1915 B and C waivers is the reality moving forward. Mr. Chairman
I'd be pleased to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. A couple of concerns if I may.
Legislature in 2001 as I recall did mental health reform and then  about
2007 it seemed like everybody was surprised and concluded, well my
goodness, it's not working. And it was almost although we spent six or
seven years walking away from a reform that had been put in place that
was supposed to ensure patient care and communities outside the
traditional psychiatric hospitals, and it wasn't happening. My question
is as we move to these new LMEMCO's, is there something in this bill or
in the plan for the operation that is going to provide that continuing
monitoring process of patient care and to guard against complaints that
I hear often at home of concerns that MCO's and LME are going to satisfy
the state financially by keeping down cost, by denying needed services.
So what's the plan for monitoring how well this is working so we don't
get surprised down the road that it isn't and how are we could to be
sure that the care is happening rather than just the financial
management?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I would answer that in a couple of ways. One of
the things that we did last year in house bill 191 was to change the
governance model. That will not be fully in effect until October 1 of
this year. So and in this governance what we did was we ensured that on
the LMEMCO board that we would have additional, financial and legal
expertise so that folks could successfully operate what is essentially a
small insurance, well not a small but an insurance company, a
significant insurance company. In addition to that we balance that by
bringing back what had been lost over the years and that was
representation on those boards of consumers and of the CEFAC [SP], the
advocacy folks, in the various areas. So folks from substance abuse,
mental illness and IDD would all have representation, voting
representation on the actual LMEMO boards. And the reason why the
element was brought back was to ensurer that the...</p>

It seems to me that, as we, or I understand, are moving towards more
electronic medical record, and the filling of prescriptions, that
especially with people we have a concern whether they're being compliant
in taking their medications as they should, that if somebody is
electronically filing for reimbursement for a medication, and if we've
got a medical record for someone who's on Medicaid saying they're
supposed to be getting it every 30 days, it ought to be sort of a
technological assignment, that doesn't sound to me like it ought to be
tough to say,  I Joe Blow is being compliant in taking his medicine, and
if he isn't is somebody following up with him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mrs. Crosby.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Kelly Crosby, Division of Medical Assistance.  I agree
with you, and I wouldn't say that through CC-NC, who's our medical home
for most of the individuals with serious medical illness who are on
these type of medications.  One of the things that CC-NC does do for
Medicaid recipients is look at their medications, try to justify
medications against each other, look at who's refilling these
prescriptions.  CC-NC is doing a lot of this in partnership with the
LME-MCOs, they do have access to all those medications through their
database so they're able to see some of our higher end individuals with
mental illness to make sure that they're refilling their prescriptions,
that different prescriptions aren't counteracting with each other, and I
know of at least 1, maybe more of our MCOs have actually hired specialty
pharmacists to actually look at this.  So, we do use a lot of our
pharmacy data to make these types of decisions.  It's really more at
the, people can fill their prescriptions, and you can monitor that, but
really it is the individual provider that has a relationship with the
person, that knows that they're actually taking those medications or
not.  So, that's what I was referring to for about the MCOs having to
monitor their provider network to ensure that those clinical
interventions are happening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Fulghum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman.  The question for the sponsor
in regards to the contemplated further NCO development for the rest of
the Medicaid delivery.  Are they going to overlap these MCOs as we see
them now for behavioral health care to cut out confusion, or perhaps
keep them add to the confusion?  Is there going to be an Eastern,
Central, and Western MCO contemplated at least in the HSS proposals that
we've heard floating around that will actually be proposed for these
same regions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think ultimately, well, the General Assembly will
make the decision on what kind of Medicaid system that we have in the
state.  What we launched into here in 2011, was an expansion of an
incredibly successful pilot that started out in 5 counties, that's
expanded now, PBH has become Cardinal Innovations.  You know, none of
these things are easy, and what we're doing in this Senate Bill is a
further refinement of that process.  So I think the General Assembly is,
in my impression, is very committed to having a successfully operating
state-wide 1915B and C waivers for our mental health, substance abuse,
and intellectually and developmentally disabled services.  And I would
expect that we want to continue to keep that strong and moving forward
down the road.  That's certainly the intent of this legislation in which
we're further clarifying.  We're ensuring that the LME-MCOs are going to
be strong.  If they have to merge, how they merge, how they operate,
what the standards are, and obviously ensuring that our partner, our
very critical provider partners all across the state, you know, will be
paid, particularly if there's a transition to fewer LME-MCOs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chair, I had a couple of questions.  The
first one was in reference to the fund balances in section 5B on page 5.
 And my question basically is, I think the change, if I'm correct, is
due to</p>

<p id="25:00">
Of the phase of where we are, with the MCO’s transitioning emergement to
managed care. How has that worked, the existing situation in terms of
prorating funding for the transfers? Has that worked well with the MCO’s
when they merged?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well what we’re, and staff may be better to answer the question but,
what we have had prior to has been LME transitioning into MCO’s for
which we had procedures and then contracts and the like to do that with.
This is dealing more with the merging of an existing LME MCO in with
another LME MCO and trying to be clear about how that process works. And
to ensure that providers are going to get paid. That people are going to
be served. That areas that are being subsumed under a larger area are
going to have representation on the board. Making sure that the
appropriate risk reserve is going to be able to be maintained in that
process. And I don’t know if Ms. Paul would want to comment further.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may, Thank you Mr. Chair. Representative Farmer-Butterfield, with
regard to how that has worked in the past, research staff would need to
defer to either financial staff from the department or fiscal research
staff who is present. With regard to how that has actually from a
practical standpoint operated on the ground in the past. I don’t know if
Ms. Bush is present, or if fiscal research has anything to add.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well what we haven’t had is we are just now having our first MCO merging
with another MCO. Which is the merger that is in process with Western
Highlands and Smokey Mountain. And it’s my understanding they’re close
to a contact agreement for how that is merging together. And in certain
respects that’s going to be the test case, so to speak, for how to make
that functionally happen in an appropriate way and they seem to be
moving forward well considering the circumstances.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll get with fiscal staff on specifics in terms of how it’s worked with
others that have merged. Other question that I had
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, follow up final one. Who provides compensation and assistance to
the MCO’s when they merge and they go into the waiver? Those that are
unfamiliar with it, who helps them move forward in the system to make it
work? I know we got, what, PBH, which is now what, Carnival, are they
doing any consultative assistance with these other…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well they have done other- Oh, I’m sorry. The ocean. OK? Well they have.
They’ve done a tremendous amount over the last couple of years in trying
to provide assistance and help and the like. But obviously the
department is the one who has taken the lead in providing that
consultation and oversight and assistance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Reason I ask is because I’ve heard some comments about the need for
that. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too have a couple of questions. One of the
things in presentations as well as in private conversations with managed
care companies. One of the things that they tout is an advantage or
something that they’re able to do is provide services that aren’t
necessarily paid for by Medicaid. In other words, the perfect example we
heard repeated several times by our director of Medicaid is the issue of
the lady repeatedly going to the emergency room because she didn’t have
air conditioning. Do the MCO’s with their budgets, do they fund this or
free of that same type of restriction that they have a flexibility to
really, if they see a need that isn’t quote on the list, that they can
take care of it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well they do manage the LME MCO’s also manage state dollars, as well as
federal Medicaid dollars. And in terms of working to assist someone with
a need that might be outside of the medical need, it’s my understanding
that most of them</p>

...work can do that sort of thing. In these communities, people know
where resources are that are outside the realm and obviously, they work
as they can to help people identify additional resources, whether it's
an air-conditioning program or fuel program that's run through some
other part of State government, making sure people get hooked up to
those resources.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There's language in here about an LME MCO disengaging.
What is the process for one of the clients or service people who are
receiving services disengaging? I mean by that, if they move in the
State from one MCO to another, what is the process? Because we recently
heard some issues and I actually had run a bill on the county of origin
that was kind of a stumbling block. What has been put in place to make
the movement of our citizens from one are of the State, with this new
set up, more convenient and no lapse in services and things of that
nature?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we're hopeful your bill is going to pass the
General Assembly because I think it takes care of that. That's not
really part and parcel of this legislation. Ms. Crosby, at the direction
of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Cosby?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't know if Ms. Crosby has comments she wants to
make about those individuals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, Kelly Crosby, Division of Medical Assistance.
Right now, at least on the Medicaid side and the State funds follow.
There's a contract for a particular catchmen area. That side base of the
capitation, that's how they enroll providers, that's how Medicaid
eligibles get services, they know their catchmen area. That's the LME
that's on your Medicaid card. To actually have one county go to another
LME MCO, it's a big deal. A lot of things need to get changed at the
system level in terms of resetting the capitation, making sure providers
all move to the other MCO, consumers all are able to maintain their
services, getting the waiver approved by CMS to move one county to
another LME. Were that ever to happen, and I think Smoky Mountain and
Western Highlands merging together is a good example of that. What they
have done is put together a project plan for us and it's something that
we monitor with them on a weekly basis. Because at the State level we've
got to do all those things in terms of tell CMS we need to change the
waiver application, that these new counties now belong to this MCO. We
have to change the capitation rate entirely and get it actuarialy
certified with CMS. We have to have a transition plan that says if you
were a provider formerly enrolled with Western Highlands, Smoky will be
able to just accept you into their provider network. If you're a
recipient, how are we going to do outreach and education to all the
recipients to know that they can maintain their services. Hopefully,
with the very same provider who's now just a Smoky Mountain Center
provider. So it really is, there's administrative things we have to do,
but there really is an on the ground level project plan that has to
happen in terms of educating providers and consumers and making sure
that to the consumer at a provider agency people are transitioned into
services. That's something that we've required all along throughout this
transition that MC has touched every provider and all recipients to
ensure that folks are able to transition from one provider to another,
or one MCO to another. It's a lot of work and it's quite complicated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, clarification please. I was asking,
actually, the consumers changing. Say if you lived in Buncombe and you
moved to Raleigh to Alliance, what process do they go through when the
provider that they've been using in Buncombe and they'll need somebody
new. What's the step by step process you use for that person to
re-establish services and get payments and things of that taken care of.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Kelly Crosby, Division of Medical Assistance. I'm
sorry I answered the wrong question. That's a bit of a messier answer to
be perfectly honest with you and I think that is why you've introduced
your bill. Individuals are tied by their county to particular LME.
They're county in our Medicaid eligibility system determines which LME
they're assigned to. We know that that is challenging for children and
adults who have a county of eligibility in one LME but may have a
residency or a treatment facility several counties away, or many
counties away. What actually...</p>

<p id="35:00">
What happens is two things. Sometimes people just move and they go to
they have to go to the new county DSS and register their new address and
get a new county eligibility. Therefore they get a new EMO on their
Medicaid card and the got to engage in services there at that point when
the gout through that process and get a new LME the LME is notified they
know ever month the new eligible are they have to provide outreach and
information about their private network and their services to engage
them in new county that is if they have moved.  Probably the worst part
about that process is that thee county of eligibility can change can
take 30 to 60 days and that is something that we are we have a group
trying to streamline that for individuals who literally have moved
across the state and have to get seat a new county probably the more
challenging and we have a work group working at this too are those
individuals who have individuals at one area and they are just so we
have providers across the state all overt the place who have to enroll
with different LMEs  some of them only have to reenroll with an LME with
one individual who they are serving and its pretty complicated but I do
believe we have a dedicated group looking at those law around
eligibilities seeing if there is anything we can do about stitching
county eligibly quicker but also the besides that while that gets done
what can we do for providers who are providing services for single
people across multi county lines who do very wink standardized lines so
the individual can maintain their same provider they can get paid in a
timely fashion and not have to go through a lengthy enrollment or
credentialing process while the the other LME. I think ideally what we
just really want to have a state uniform state wide credentialing for
any provider yes a LME can choose what provider what enrolled in
Medicaid if you will the LME can change what provider they want to deal
with so providers don’t have to be difficult. No matter where an
individual lives they can go they can maintaining their same providers
and providers scan get paid.  It is not a neat process right now.
[Speaker Changes]
I have just a couple of questions one has to do that all LMEs of the
phrase I used is a bathroom functions that there is something in this
bill that would authorize this secretary to standardize back crew
functions or did I miss that? I think that has been one of the big
problems with the mergers that a lot of LMEs have had their own systems
or billing systems and haven’t been able has cost them billing problems
[Speaker Changes]
Obliviously that has been worked on wet me refer that to Ms. Paul.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. chairman if you can recognize the doctor so she can respond
[Speaker Changes]
Consultant to the general assembly the can you ask the question one more
time again
[Speaker Changes]
It has to do with let me put it this way I believe that the house bill
916 authorizes the department to ensure that the LME that are coping on
board with MCOS would adopt the back crew ??? that were held by PHLD
that didn’t happen so that has created some problems so I understand
there is a process going on that would im fine if PBSH needs to change I
don’t think you have to something needs to be negotiate but how is that
going to get the back room function change especially if a MCO changes
and has to merge if their back room functions are different that at is
going t to make the merger more difficult.
[Speaker Changes]
Actually 3 things toing on in relation to that
[Speaker Changes]
The first one is internal the ??? community programs has been working
with each of the 11 LME and CEO to standardize their back room processes
and information technology IT Claims, billing contracts TSO that’s going
on within in that group so that they can transmit information one to
within each other</p>

[Speaker changes.]
[Speaker changes.]
[Speaker changes.]...been done to tweak this model and to make it work
better. Appreciate it.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Blackwell, for brief comment or
question.
[Speaker changes.] Quick question. Maybe for staff. Following up on the
concern that Representative Insko is discussing about how small we might
get. Does the provision that is in this budget that allows for merger,
does it limit it to simply over time a reduction in the number of the
LME's, MCO's...or does it also allow that a new entity could be created
or that an existing one could be divided. In other words, does it work
both ways or does it only work to get smaller?
[Speaker changes.] I think the anticipation would be that...you're not
gonna grow MCO's.  You're not gonna see be twelve or thirteen LME/MCO's.
That would not be the direction. It could get smaller but it would not
get larger and I don't see any of the groups looking to split in terms
of where they are.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Burr.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman...just for a motion at the
appropriate time.
[Speaker changes.] It's the appropriate time.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chair. I move that we give the
proposed House Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 208 a favorable
report; unfavorable as to the original.
[Speaker changes.] You've heard the motion.  All those in favor say
&quot;aye&quot;. (Ayes.) Those opposed.  The ayes have it. The motion
passes and the bill will be reported to the floor.
[Speaker changes.] And, Mister Chairman, thank you and the committee and
also, Senator Tucker's over here. Thank him for all his hard work on
this legislation.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Senator.
[Speaker changes.] This meeting is adjourned.</p>
