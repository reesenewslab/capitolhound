<p id="00:00">
Ladies and gentlemen, it's 5:00, the meeting will come to order. We are
out of recess and back in full swing. I'm going to ask that we hold the
majority of our comments or that we focus on the financial portion of
this bill this evening, please. And when Senator Rucho is ready, he will
present the proposed committee substitute or the commerce committee
substitute for Senate Bill 786, Senator Rucho. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members
of the finance committee, sorry for the delay in getting all the
paperwork ready, but we are focusing on keeping a good schedule and
trying to be out of here sometime around mid June. Sorry. No, this
meeting will be over by mid June. We did have a two hour debate on the
subject of entire sections of the energy modernization act. It offers
North Carolina energy independence. It offers us a diverse economy with
economic growth revenues, good quality jobs. The bill, as it's designed,
goes a long way to improving a lot of concerns, whether it be
prohibiting waste water injection into the ground, or all of the other
questions that came about where that's been discussed already. Mrs.
Chairman, if we could begin the discussion and explanation of the
financial portions of this bill and then we can respond accordingly to
questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, the first finance
related provision is in Section 11 of the bill, which, if the members
have it in front of them, the 2nd edition is on page 13. So Section 11,
this would amend a provision changed in 2011 or 2012 which established a
3000 dollar fee upon application to drill a well. The 2nd edition would
amend that provision to provide that it was $3000 for the first well
drilled on a pad and $1500 for each additional well to be drilled on
that same pad. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Moving on to the tax portions of the
bill, part six is the severance taxes. This can be found on pages 19
through 24. This repeals the existing severance taxes which were enacted
in 1945 and they haven't been modified since 1973. And the state is
currently not collecting any revenues under these statutes. This bill
creates a new way of taxing the severance of energy minerals from the
state. And if you wanna turn to page 5 of summary, there's a chart that
shows you the tax rates. And I'm gonna first go over the tax rates. Oil
and condensates will be taxed at 2% for 2015 through 18, 3.5% for 2019
through 2020, and 5% for 2021 and thereafter. Marginal gas, which means
gas produced by a well that's incapable of producing more than 100 ?? of
gas, these types of well will need to be certified by the Mining and
Energy Commission to be certified that they are this type of well and
that they are eligible for this preferential rate. So these are gas
wells that produce very little gas, so they are given a slightly lower
rate. So, marginal gas is .4% for 2015 through 18, .6% for 19, 20, and
.8 for 2021 and there after. So all other gas has a slightly different
mechanism for which it's taxed. 2015 through 2018 is .9% and that
applies to all gas, but starting in 2019, there is a variable rate based
on the price for MCF, similar to the graduated income tax where the
first $3 in 2019 through 2020 is subject to .9%. Any price paid from 3
to 4 is 1.9 and any price paid above 4 is 2.9. And as you can see
through 2021 through 2023 the rate goes up. It starts at .9% for any
price paid under $3 and goes up to 5% for any price paid over 7. And
then for 2023 and there after, the price is again .9 for any price paid
for $3 and under and up to 9% for any price over $10. Now the tax base
varies based on the type of minerals that are being severed. For oil and
condensates, the tax base...</p>

<p id="05:00">
is the gross price paid for gas. It is the delivered market value. And,
what this does is allow that the costs that are incurred from getting
the gas from the wellhead to market are deducted from the gross price
and that is the delivered-to-market price. So, that is the price on
which that rate applies. The taxes administered similar to the sales
tax, the liability is the producer, the liability lies with the producer
of the tax. And, the producer is the entity that first extracts the
mineral from the soil or the water of the state. Returns and taxes are
due either monthly or quarterly based on the total liability of the
producer and a bond or letter of credit is required of producers that
fail to file a tax or file a return or make a payment of a tax due.
Also, permits for this will be suspended if an entity fails to file a
return or pay a tax. There's also no new local taxes allowed so no new
privilege taxes or any other taxes that would be imposed by the local
government on the energy development. And, there is a property tax
exemption for the presence of energy minerals. So, except for when a
permit has been issued. So, if the property has energy minerals on it,
they will not factor into the property valuation until a permit is
issued to allow the exploration of those minerals.
I'm gonna quickly go over two studies that also relate to property
taxation. Section 20 of the bill directs the local government division
to study how other states value energy minerals for the purpose of
property tax and it directs that the division to establish guidelines
for counties to value the minerals to ensure that there's consistent and
fair taxation throughout the state. And, Section 21 is a study that asks
the Joint Legislative Commission on energy policy to study the
development of the energy industry and how property tax revenues will be
affected by the development of the energy industry. It also will examine
how the industry will affect property enrolled in the PUV or the Present
Used Value program. And, it will also study ways to limit the growth of
property tax revenues resulting from increased property valuations that
are a result of energy production.
Now, I just will note that this is a study of provisions that were in an
earlier version of the bill. You may have heard about the provision that
would cap local government revenues at 80% of property tax revenues.
That has been taken out of the bill and that is no longer in the bill.
This is a study to study that sort of same sort of thing. The last tax
portion of the bill, on page 28 of the second edition, Section 30. And,
this is regarding the motor fuels tax. As you are aware, we have a per
gallon tax on motor fuels that's currently 37.5%. For alternative fuels,
the Secretary of Revenue can actually calculate an alternative rate and
this actually sets the alternative rate for two types of alternative
energy. Compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas. It sets the
gas gallon equivalent for compressed natural gas and the diesel gallon
equivalent for liquefied natural gas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you members of the committee. Senator Newton, Senator Brock and
myself will respond to him and to any questions in regards to the ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you members of the committee. Questions for Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Senator Rucho, the first item we talked about
was the perf well fee being changed from $3000 to $1500.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is it my understanding I believe from what I heard Senator Newton say
earlier, this would actually bring more money into the state. If they're
on the pad, we get to charge for each individual well where if it was
just one pad it would be one fee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, actually that may be a misunderstanding. Before it was $3000 per
well regardless of how many wells were on a pad. Now, it's gonna be
$3000 for the first one and $1500 for the follow-on. Part of that was
industry asking questions of why do they have to pay the same fee for
each additional well when ?? and others aren't gonna have to do a whole
lot more. It's already sighted the pad and most of the heavy work's been
done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All of the work has been done. It's just a matter of registering that
next well on the pad.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McLaurin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Question about the-, we've got information that 33
states, including North Carolina, currently impose a severance tax. How
many of those states, and maybe staff would know this and maybe you do.
How many of those states also do have some type of a local tax that is
imposed on the operators. Again, I'm just trying to think of it in-. I
have a local government background. Are you aware how many of those
states</p>

<p id="10:00">
Have some type of a local government tax. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Unfortunately I'm not aware of how many. I know some states share some
of the local taxes and some states allow locals to have taxes but I
don't off the top of my head know how many that have a specific local
tax, regarding this industry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Would that be something that you could do some research on? I
think that'd be of interest to the members of the committee and as we
move forward with this process just to see what other options local
governments have for generating some revenue. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman? Senator Carney, you know we were in Arkansas
together and they apparently have property taxes down there, on the
equipment that exists within that county, during let's say January first
of the year and apparently everybody fights about when the rig is going
to be shifted over there so we can be looking at a number of those
issues, okay? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Ford. Excuse me,
Senator Ford, did you want to weigh here? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could,
very briefly. I think it's also, on Senator Ruccho reminding us about
the equipment and so forth. When this occurs, there's a great expansion
in the tax base. When the permits are issued, as you talked about in
commerce, those minerals then become on the tax rolls and subject to
taxation. So the local governments are going to have a lot of
opportunity to have property tax resources. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
understand. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As it relates to the taxable portions of this
piece of legislation, how would you say that our tax rates would compare
to those states that are doing similar or the same type of drilling?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're talking about like severence taxes? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I'm referring to the severence tax as well as the other
portions of the bills that are taxable. How do we compare to those other
states that are doing similar or the same type of drilling in those
states? And it's, Mr. Chairman, it's relative, loaded question as
relates to, I want to see how competitive we're going to be as relates
to what we're doing and the rate that we're taxing it at. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] There's a lot of variety in the tax rates. It can range from 2%
up to 14%. This would be on the lower end of that spectrum. I will also
say that the original severence tax that was proposed last year had a
higher default rate, but a similarly low incentive rate for what were
called high-cost wells. And there are a lot of states that do that,
where they give an incentive rate for certain wells. And this is
basically to horizontally fractured wells. Because what we think at this
point is most of the wells will actually be these types of horizontally
fractured wells, we eliminated the higher default rate because it
wouldn't actually apply to anyone, and just have the incentive rate. And
there are other states such as Texas and Arkansas that also have
incentive rates. We are the only state that has this exact sort of
tiered tax based on the price. There are other states that have somewhat
of a variable rate but they're not identical to this. This would be a
tax on the lower end of the spectrum. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up,
Senator Ford, or are you good? [SPEAKER CHANGES] And we discussed this
in the last session with the congress, but if you noticed if our rates
in 15-18 are relatively low to be an attraction to getting activity
here, and actually looking at it and seeing what we indeed have in our
areas of shale gas. And then you notice going out, the out years, there
is a significant increase because that small market type rate and even
to the point of escalating the rate as the price of natural gas goes up.
So we're adjusting as the market will allow us to do. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Senator
Ruccho, I'm trying to figure out how to phrase this question. The bill
as it's written says that property can't be taxed that doesn't have a
permit assigned with that parcel. I know with forced pooling, I presume
we're going to have squares like they do in North Dakota, where you've
got 640 acres that are pooled together. Would there only be one acre
that has a well on it that has a permit, and therefore we would only
tax, or would we be taxing the entire 640 acres proportionally? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I would assume and that's a risky thing, but I would assume
that if, the way the local government would interpret this is that
basically if you have</p>

<p id="15:00">
Forced pooling, and you have a permit issued it would apply to all the
properties that are in that forced pooling. However, this is also one of
the issues why we've asked the local government, teh division at the
department of revenue to look at this. So we want to make sure that that
is clear. But that is, I would assume that if the permit was issued it
would be to all the properties that applied, not just for the actual
well head is situated. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And if I could add, Senator
Daniel, I think that makes a lot of sense to me too, because those
property owners within that unit, once that permit's issued and the
resource starts coming out of the ground that's when they're going to
also experience the royalty checks. And so that would be the logical
time to begin that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
guess this is sort of a different subject, but I know some states have
caps, or made a minimum royalty amount that companies can put in a
lease. Has that been something that y'all have considered? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Yes, in 2012 the General Assembly
enacted a floor of 12.5% royalty. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the
committee, any further questions? Comments? And now we will entertain
Senator Hartzel. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the severence tax apply to the
?? the courts find from the Pennlan Valley property near Spruce Pine?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartzel, would you like to answer your own
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I would, and I would hope that it
would, but I seriously doubt that it does, but I don't know whether that
quartz which forms a basis for a lot of this, the computer chips. Thank
you. I'm old, I'm forgetting these things. I'm really serious. It's a
very valuable mineral quality that's the finest in the world and we
don't tax any of it at the moment, as far as I know. Isn't that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. This severence tax only applies to oil gas
and ??. It does not apply to any other sort of what you'd consider
natural resources of the state. It doesn't apply to ?? It doesn't apply
to quartz. It does not apply to any of those things. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I'm aware, quite honestly, of
some folks who have figured out a way to use quartz to generate energy.
With some coatings and utilizing some battery sources. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That may be out of the scope of the discussion of ths one. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Okay, thank you Senator Hartzel. Any further discussion or
debate from the committee? The chair will entertain a motion by Senator
Clark Jenkins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would move for favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There's a motion for favorable report. Can we have a
second? Seconded by Senator Curtis. All those in favor please say Aye.
Opposed No. Motion carried. Meeting adjourned. Thank you very much.</p>
