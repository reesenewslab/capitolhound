…meeting to order.  Let’s hold the racket down.  We’re coming to order.
Let’s hold it down back there.  That’s better.  First order of business,
I‘d like to recognize our Sergeant of Arms today, Marvin Lee, Young Bay,
Joe Cook , Martha Ferris.  Thank you for being here and getting us set
up to go.  Today we will introduce the pages.  I would like for them to
stand up, tell us their name and who their sponsors are.

[Speaker Change]
Thank you.

[Speaker Change]
Thank you for being here.  We have another page.
[Speaker Change]
Back in the back
[Speaker Change]
Introduce yourself and tell us your sponsor.
[Speaker Change]

[Speaker Change]
Thank you for being here.  The first bill we are going to take up today
is Senate Bill 372, Senator Davis.   We have a PCS for that and
Representative Millis moves the PCS to be before us.  All in favor say
aye.  All oppose no.  The ayes have it.  The bill is properly before us.
 Senator Davis.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Chairman West and members this Senate Bill 372 is a companion
bill to a House bill that was passed out of this committee in April.
There are just a couple of changes to that.  The Senate added section
2-1 which clarifies that the new and formal bid amount applies to
contracts awarded to disadvantaged business enterprises.  Also the PCS
clarifies in section 1 that the notice to county commissioners
requirement only applies to solid waste not liquid waste, and I would be
glad to entertain any questions you may have.  We have representatives
from the NCACC here as well to help, and I would like for your favorable
report sir.
[Speaker Change]
Any questions from the Committee?  Representative Lucas.
[Speaker Change]
On the point you just mentioned about liquid waste not being included
any longer in the bill, what’s the rationale for that please?
[Speaker Change]
I’ll defer to the NCACC.  Joanne with the Chairman’s
[Speaker Change]
Joanne if you would like to answer that question. State your name for
the record.
[Speaker Change]
Yes sir.  Thank you.  Joanna Reese with the County Commissioners’
Association.  The goal of our association, the request that came from
our membership was just for a notice for bio-solids, sludge, for that
notification.  And we added a request from another local government,
that we clarify that it was only solids and not the liquids.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Any other questions from this committee?  If not, Representative Hager
is recognized for a motion.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Make a motion for a favorable as to the PC,
unfavorable to the original.
[Speaker Change]
You have heard the motion.  All in favor say aye.  Opposed no. The ayes
have it and the bill will be so reported. Thank you Senator Davis.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you ?? and Chairman West.
[Speaker Change]
The next bill we’ll take up will be Senate Bill 151 the Coastal Policy
Reform Act.  Representative Catlin and Representative Millis, I think,
are going to explain the bill. And there is a PCS before us.
Representative Hager moves the PCS be before us.  All in favor say aye.
Opposed no.  The ayes have it and the bill is properly before us.  Would
you like for staff to go through the bill first or do you guys want to
take it on?
[Speaker Change]
We’ll take it on.
[Speaker Change]
Okay, Representative Millis has the floor.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Ladies and gentlemen of the committee I believe
that Senator Rabon was possibly going to be here, but we will go ahead
and roll with this without his presence. But what we are doing to today
is submitting a full fledge PCS to address some of the concerns in the
original language of Senate Bill 151.  In the part that I am mostly
referring to is the Part 2 of the bill which is to amend the Terminal
Growing Construction Law.  I will briefly go over with you what we
actually have addressed in the original Senate bill.  And that is as you
see there on page two of the bill, or if you are looking at your
summary, we actually have amended the definition of terminal growing.
And the purpose of this is to truly restrict the definition of terminal
growing to the types of terminal growing we want to see present here in
North Carolina.  We are very explicit about there is a lot of
differences of opinion about what a terminal growing is and what it’s
not.  And there’s a lot of misconceptions with that and this amended
definition is to alleviate the concern and take away a lot of the
misconception about what people view terminal growing is. Also too, to
make…</p>

You have any notes about the propsed changes/ As we have also uh.. on
page 4 of the bill section 8 we have.. the senate bill 151 previously
had this part stricken. We have unstricken this part about the taxpayer
protections and we also on line 40 we have brought the cap of terminal
groins back down to 4. The intent is that we are gonna have the 2011
legislation was a quiezop? program that was designed to function and the
performance of these terminal groins we wannna keep that intent with
this revisiion and to continue to move in that direction that way the
public and legislators are comfortable with the direction we are headed
with terminal groins and uh whatever may need to happen will happen but
we wanted to reinstate that cap. I would like to give the floor to the
rep catelyn
thank you rev
thank you mr chairman
you all have my handout and there were a lot of confusions and I wanted
to be sure those were addressed. And youll see the first picutre it the
goin field and most people thought thats what we were doing and that is
something I  will take ot my death because that is not somethign we want
in NC and that is not allowed on this bill. The second is the
misconception of the gettys. Gettys do often trap sand and require
bypassing but that is not the case here with the terminal goins. The
terminal groins is the las tpicture and is designed as permeable and
porous but do not extend out and hold sand. They stop erosion onthe
beach but they do not stop the sand from being eroded. Its important to
understand these differences. I have been on the coast for some time as
a geologist and an engineer but for the last 20 years I have been
chairman of the porch waterways and the NOrth Carolina water resource
congress and what has happened over the years is we have had federal
money to be able to do maintanence and beach renourishment and we used
to match that federal money with state moeny but since federal money
stopped the state money stopped. So the cost is on the backs of the
local citizens and we need these tools in place. The pilot program is a
great place to test these tools. I think all these protections are in
place and the permit requirements are in place and I urge your support
and will answer any quesitons.
Have you considered in a new term to mention this to the public and they
go what? So maybe just rethinking the term and coming up with something
good. I do want to make a comment to first thank you bills ponsors for
cleaning up this bill. I just want to make a comment to which you dont
need to respond. THere is a lot of commentary from some how awful it is
the federal budget is so large. I think its important to recognize what
the rev just said. The federal gov thas cut back, so the burden shifts
to state and local govt. This needs to be seen on the record because its
easy to talk about how awful the fed govt is, but we see the fed govt
does a lot of good things for us. I am not asking you to comment or to
agree or disagree I think its just important to recognize.
Rep ??
Thank you mr speaker I think its important to recognize the bill
sponsors.</p>

<p id="10:00">
Representative: …fought this fight for several years and I think it is a
great step forward, and it makes it impossible to maybe possible. So,
thank you very much.
Speaker: Representative Harrison?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair.  A series of questions, if I may. I
will echo my compliments to you too for fixing a very troubling senate
bill. It seems like we are weakening any protections we put into place.
NC is one of the two states in the country that did not allow [xx] until
last summer. It is well that we were able to work out a compromise that
allows for protections for the taxpayer and for the natural resources
that are at stake with the construction of these terminal [xx]. It
appears to me that we are expanding the definition now of terminal groin
so that it could include groin fields, because it looks like it could be
a number of structures. Am I interpreting that accurately?
Speaker: No, it has to be at the terminus of the aisle. By the way, if I
could change the name of ‘terminal groin,’ I would, but that is a
technical engineer name. it does not allow groin fields at all.
Representative: Thank you, I appreciate that. It sounds like it is one
of structure but I could be… I appreciate… we have been back and forth,
Representative Kaplan and I on this, because it sounds like that each
stops the sand and keeps it from downward transport; sea wall drops the
sand – it seems like this is a hybrid of the two, because ‘terminal
groin’ does not create damage on either side, either by trapping sand or
by causing property erosion.
Representative: What happens is that there is erosion of the beach at
the end. It erodes at an angle, up the beach. What you get is beach
erosion all the way down. The terminal groin restores the original
coastline and then it is prefilled before. So it is literally filled
with beach sand and all the sand movement goes around the end of it. so
it does not trap anything or stop any sand movement.
Representative: I would like to add too Senator, that the terminal groin
does not jut out past the beach shore line. Again, the definition is
very explicit about that, i.e. that there cannot be a jette. Again, what
we are doing is anchoring the end of the aisle, and anchoring the inlet,
providing us with some certainty as to the end of migration. What this
does is, as Representative Caplan has alluded to, is that it allows the
good sand to bypass and the sand that needs to be there to anchor the
inlet as well as to prevent the inlet from migrating, is actually held
in place. Again, it is something that is not blatant to the eye. We are
not talking about a parallel structure of a hardened structure, like the
Jersey Shore. We are not talking about a jette, that goes miles beyond
the inlet. We are talking about something that is contained in the
aisle, actually, at the end of the aisle, in the inlet. This definition
is very explicit. It does not broaden the term or definition, but
restricts it to make sure that we have the delivery of a terminal here
in this state, that we want, and not those other terminal groins that
have a kind of marred reputation as to what these can be. So, hopefully
that answers some more of your questions and, hopefully, Representative
Caplan’s handout provides some more insight there.
Representative: Two more? Two items, I believe Caplan mentioned to me,
is one on a financial insurance piece. I think that there are many that
felt like the protections that were in place in last year’s jette – I
mean terminal groin bill, had protected the tax payers from exposure. I
know that those financial insurance changes are made in this bill. Could
you just… no?
Representative: I will ask you to flip to, within the bill, page 4, line
42, that is the taxpayer protections you are speaking about. They are
not stricken from this bill. They are actually in place. So those three
provisions, the financing mechanisms, to bond its cover, these terminal
groins for monitoring, maintenance and for mitigation measures, are
still held in place. Those three provisions are not removed.
Representative: Last question. I really appreciate that you</p>

<p id="15:00">
I thank you for pointing that out there. The last result was on this,
the sort of mitigation maintenance piece. Could you just be a little bit
more specific about how it's changed in the bill there? Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, exactly. If you go and stay on the same page 4
and you go up to line 1, this is the aspects of the financial assurance.
So this is what the financial assurances must cover. These items here,
in terms of the maintenance, the monitoring, as well as the mitigation
measures and the removal of the terminal groin, those are all going to
be provided as a part of those financial assurance persistent to the
inlet management plan.
If you back up a few pages, the inlet management plan outlines what is
required to permit and to receive permit for these terminal groins. So
basically we're constraining the design of the engineering within the
purview of the inlet management plan and therefore, we're actually
making sure that financial assurances are in place so the inlet
management plan is actually able to be executed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate that and thanks for pointing out that
page, because I see a new line in here that says the inlet management
plan is not required to address sea level rise. Is that new language?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That was new language that was entered into the
original Senate Bill 151 and ours kept that same language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Harrison asked
my question about who's responsible for maintaining them, so that's
good. I appreciate that answer. My second question was who owns, if it's
occurring at the end of the island, does the State own the sand that's
within the terminal groin? I mean, is it private property? Is it public
property? Is that even a reasonable question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It depends on where you are. I mean, if you're on a
private island, then yeah, it's not State owned. But if it's...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I give a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Maybe I should give an example of what I'm thinking.
The north end of Topsail Island, which has had a lot, a lot of problems
with that inlet shifting. If this were to take place in that location,
how would that affect ownership? Would the State be responsible and own
that property or would it be private?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton, my understanding if the local
government pursues putting the terminal groin in that location you're
speaking about, if the local government pursues putting a terminal groin
in the location you're speaking about, it would be under the purview of
the local government and all the responsibilities, the permitting, the
bonding, everything would be under their purview. And of course, if it's
any relationship to public property, that all those aspects, legal as
well as easements, would be attained and handled that way. But just to
let you know that of the four that are currently out there to be
permitted, north Topsail inlet, or north Topsail Beach, by my knowledge
is not one of those four.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Last follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may, Mr. Chairman. There's a statement of
credited, accreted sand belongs to adjacent property owner. Is that in
the bill? Just a policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You might have to ask Representative Harrison. I don't
know what you're referring to. Especially, I don't remember reading
anything that, about bill. That may be a really a deep coastal law
issue. And again, that's definitely above my head and above my pay
grade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The bill does not speak to that. It doesn't say
anything about accretion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could make one point just so we're keeping
perspective here. What we're doing is we're actually refining and
defining further the 2011 legislation to allow these four that you all
allowed here in 2011 to be able to be permitted, to be able to be
designed and to be able to be bonded. And that's the perspective here. I
think that this is a polishing effect on what was in 2011. It's no ways
lowers the bar, but really further defines it to make sure that we are
achieving those good groins and good taxpayer protections along in the
same manner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing me a second
time. I want to follow up what Representative raised, and that is that
it seems like, and I guess this is really a question, but it appears
that on page 3 some of the, it seems to be kind of a watering down of
the responsibilities to ensure environmental protection. And I mean as
an example of that, and I don't know if this is a sentence that you
added or whether this came over from the Senate, but at lines 38 through
40 it says the inlet...</p>

Managing plan monitoring medication requirements must be reasonable and
not impose requirements. Now that was not etcetera. Now that wasn’t in
last years bill or last session’s bill. Why is that in there? Has there
been some evidence that people are being unreasonable in terms of what
their doing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke thank you for that question. It is my
understanding that this language actually came over in the original
Senate bill. And what was actually the purpose for that, by my meetings
with the department, was the aspect of trying to put a fence around what
we’re actually trying to do within in the purview of the inlet
management plan and what actual the impacts could or could not be per
the ??. You can think about this as the butterfly effect. If it shutters
its wings, does it cause a tree to fall? Or whatever analogy you want.
And that is, we really have to define is that, what is the effect of the
tremble groin and if something did happen downgradient or upgradiate,
was that because of the tremble growing or not? What were trying to do
is, we’re trying to have engineering and science really make these
decisions about this and really put that fence around it and this is
what that language is intended to do. And this language has been, as for
bother department in order to allow them to do their role in a way that
is achievable versus an open ended discussion that could leave their
rear end exposed tremendously if one of these ever goes installed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for staff on page 4, line 38, number 3. What are those
financing contracts? Staffs recognize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry could you give me the page and line number?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Page 4, line 48, paren 3. It’s talking about financing contracts and are
they eligible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What are those?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My understanding and working with the finance committee staff last
session on this particular provision are the three types of financing
that are listed here are all the types of non voted debt that are
available to local governments. So I don’t really know anything about
the specifics of these different types of financing mechanisms but my
understanding the three that are listed here are the only types that are
available under current law for local governments to use. And this say’s
a local government can’t use non voted dept for ?? but I’m sorry I can’t
really speak to any specifics of the three types of mechanisms.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Millis, do you know what those financing ?? are?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m actually trying to pull the email now. I actually asked the same
questions from a fiscal staff cause I had no idea what all three of
those were. So in response to that and I will try to read off this
little phone here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I know what the first two are but just… That other one is a
reference to GS number and I can find it out. I just thought somebody
might have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s right. From my understanding here, these financing contracts,
it’s not something, from my understanding. I’ll give you this email too
from the staff here. From my understanding is that, this has to do with
local governments being able to have the ability to finance this against
the property. It says the property is public in terms of these inlets
and these beaches most of the time then really, that can’t be entered in
by a local government. So that’s the reason why its no…from my
understanding there’s nothing lost by basically saying this can be
forbidden because it probably won’t be utilized anyway in the first
place. I’d be happy to pass this to you. It’s a very lengthy response
and I didn’t want to bore the committee but if you want me to read it I
will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I’m used to being bored in the finance committee so I’ll get an
answer. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I wanted to just follow up a little bit on some
questions that have already been asked. If you look at page 4, line 19
and then page 3, section 1 also starting on page 19. The eminently
threatened that other structures are impractical. That language has been
taken out. I only commented on that before but if you can explain that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that question. What we’re really doing is we’re really
trying to define the language with something that is actually practical
and achievable for what these ?? will be used for. The aspect of
intimately threatened as well as the non-structural approaches. It’s one
of those things that’s about.</p>

<p id="25:00">
...prevention versus reaction. And to actually say &quot;Well this is
intimately threatened&quot; is that how long do you have to wait before
it's intimately threatened? And since these growings have to go through
an environmental permeating process that takes six years, that's some
notion, is one of these things where, if we want to use these as a tool
of prevention from a benefit cost savings aspect, in a way that is
environmentally sound, in this language, if it's not [??] it really
removes that from being a tool it's a reactionary measure instead of a
pro-action measure.
So I hope that explains that. It's really just refining the language to
be a little better. That's just a policy aspect. It's not watering down
or lowering the bar, but really just polishing it to something that can
be achievable and practical at the same time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hold it just a second, we've got a couple more
questions to be asked. We're going to vote on this bill at 10:30 so you
might want to make your comments short. The nonstructural approaches,
we've been doing that for a long time, I support those but we've lost
the funding for it. Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick question. Thank you, Mister Chair. And thanks
again to you too. I think you both as coastal engineers. North Carolina
is the third most vulnerable state sea level rise. We had the USDS study
that came out last year that showed us that and our sea level rise hot
spot. Does it make any sense to take out the requirement that you factor
in sea level rise? Are you all, as engineers, is that good practice to
be factoring in sea level rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm comfortable with it. I've been evaluating the sea
level issue for a long time and I approach it based on historic trends
and not the hundred year projection. And historic trends indicate that
it's a manageable issue. It's moving very slowly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starns is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair. As a Committee member I've
been very excited to see that we have environmental and a civil engineer
and hopefully we can fix these [??] issues so I won't be back dealing
with this next year. And the [??appropertirement], I'd like to make a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's appropered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair. I'd like to make a motion for
a favorable report to Senate Bill 151, proposed committee substitute,
unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You've heard the motion. All in favor say aye.
Opposed, no. The aye's have it. The bill will be so recorded. Thank you,
gentlemen. Next bill we'll hear, gonna be Senate Bill 341. Senator
Rabon, can you do that one quick? We have a PCS for this, Representative
Starnes moves it be before us. All in favor, say aye. Opposed, no. The
aye's have it. The bill is properly before us. Senator Rabon, you have
the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I would love to see the
PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We'd like to see it also.
Good job. Everybody have copies? We're ready any time you are, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen..
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Override, sit down. Go ahead, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. As you've probably seen in your bill
summary, the thinking behind this bill is threefold. The portion that
I'll bring before you first will be the coastal portion, and I'll give
you a little history if you don't mind.
People on the coast get their water a little differently than people in
other parts of the state. Historically, North Carolina in the old days
when we were first settled, the people on the coast settled near the
rivers because we used the rivers for commerce, of course. And we took
our water from the rivers and of course from the groundwater very close
by, from shallow wells or dug wells. As we migrated inland, people
settled along ridge lines and then headwaters of rivers. So they had a
little different method of getting their water. People upstream get
their water from reservoirs and from aquifers. When you get to our neck
of the woods down, because we get surface water only. So we take our
water from certain rivers. Regardless of where we put it back, it goes
to the ocean. When the tide changes, it comes in and out where we live.
So we don't have the same problems, if you will...

[Speaker changes.]
[Speaker changes.]
[Speaker changes.] ...water that we use and where it's going to go, it's
all going home to the Atlantic Ocean and going there pretty quickly.
What we're attempting to do on the coast, is just make the...we're not
making the rules any less stringent but we're trying to expedite the
process by which we take ...get our ability to take water say from the
Cape Fear River and put it back into the ?????? River Basin rather than
going back to the Cape Fear River Basin because there's no one
downstream. We're not stealing anyone's water, if you will. We're using
our own water and our water is going offshore quickly. That's a synopsis
of just what we're trying to do on the coast...and we're trying to amend
this law, if you will. This can be done in a quick fashion. Currently it
takes three to five years and three to five million dollars to permit
this process. This bill would allow us about half a million dollars
worth of money and about six to eight months to get this process done.
It is a...it doesn't lighten the restraints or constraints in any way,
it just gets rid of a little paper work and speeds up the process and
that's what we're trying to do. And, as we meet today, ??????? County is
trying to finish up a process that they've been in for over five years.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Hager is recognized.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman...there's very rarely a
time that my seatmate to my right and I agree on issues such as this,
and I know he's got an amendment but I would like to...love to make a
motion on behalf of Representative McGrady at the proper time.
[Speaker changes.] If you'll hold that, we'll recognize you at the
proper time. Representative McGrady is recognized to send forward an
amendment.
[Speaker changes.] This is an amendment to...to get the line...it's on
page 2, line 46, simply changing the five million gallon number to three
million gallons. I've spoken to the department.  The effort that they're
trying to address is fully addressed with this number.  I just don't
want it...this thing to grow into something bigger and I think it's a
friendly amendment. The department is fine with it and would urge your
support.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rabin/Rabon????? is recognized to comment on
the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you. That amendment would have little or
absolutely no effect on us, where I live. I would ask Senator Barringer
if she would like to comment on that or the department if they would
like to comment.  It is my understanding that the reason this was
changed originally is that the two million gallons per day is not
monitored on a daily basis but monitored on a monthly basis, and just so
people would not be out of compliance, the department thought we should
raise that and they wouldn't be issuing non-compliant orders because
people had slightly exceeded the two million gallons a day. Senator
Barringer, if I...
[Speaker changes.] Senator, you're recognized.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chair. This is very important to
the municipalities that have already gone through the IBT process. It
took ?????? thirteen years and about thirteen million dollars to get to
where they could have an IBT and what this does is allow modifications
to go in a much more expedited manner but in a way that will not
adversely effect the environment. ??????, I understand, is fine with
this amendment and so, we do see it as friendly. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Iler, were you wantin' to talk on the
amendment or the bill?
[Speaker changes.] On the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Millis, were you wantin' to talk on
the amendment or the bill?
[Speaker changes.] I just have a quick question regarding this
amendment...and not to take up time. I just wanna make sure...I know the
big picture of this is really to get the intent that the Senators have
expressed but I just wanna make sure this amendment is not gonna' have
unintended consequences and that is that...like for the department wants
 to weigh in on this and maybe we can take care of it before it goes to
the floor but, Representative McGrady, my understanding is that the
?????? has a ???????? factor of two and a half so the reason why they
took this average flow into have a max a day flow of five million is
that, if you do the math, the two and half times two is five...and that
was the reason why they came up with that and is that, over a month
monitoring period, you're still gonna have two million gallons but in a
single day, you may have five. I just wanna make sure that even
tho...the main intent is to get this bill forward...is that we don't
???????? the department and have a statute that is unachievable for them
to be able to fully do their job and I was just...it's a friendly
question...
[Speaker changes.] Secretary Gillespie, would you like to comment on
that?</p>

<p id="35:00">
Thank you Mr. Chair.  I'm Tom Reiter with the Division of Water
Resources.  What Representative Millis said is exactly correct, however,
the three million gallons a day won't actually impact the overall intent
of the Bill, so we're fine with three million gallons a day.  The idea
is just to add some additional flexibility for municipalities that are
trying to stay under the IBT threshold and that still is accomplished
with the three million gallons a day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  You've heard the amendment.  All in favor say aye.
Opposed no.  The aye's have it and the amendment is docked and we're
back on the Bill and Representative Iler is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chairman and Senator Mixon of my
favorite County,  Brunswick, and they've been through quite a whole
process, as I describe it and it appears that some of the IBT lines on
the map were just that, lines on the map and this isolated river basin
idea and the other things on the coast make an awful lot of sense and if
somebody didn't already offer to make a motion I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Luebke is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I'm questioning we've had
so many of these Bills first in the 90s about interbasin transfer law
and then they just been through the years and Senator you mentioned with
respect to Carey that it took 13 years and what do you estimate with
this Bill how will it affect the timeline.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you.  My understanding is for modifications
not for new IBT but for modifications for the organizations, the
municipalities that have already gone through this laborious process
that it would be probably no more than a year and we would like to think
perhaps six months and about a million dollars worth of investment to
prove that it is an appropriate step.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  And maybe you know and maybe the league can be here
to comment on it but does the league municipalities support this
legislation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]:  Representative Insko is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I would just like to put in
a good word for being cautious about interbasin transfers.  I know that
it makes a lot of sense when you have a growing community that needs
water to get the water there as fast as possible, but it also makes the
assumption that the river basin you're taking it out of won't need it
sometime in the future when growth might happen there.  That's been a
problem before.  Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I urge your support of this Bill.  Being from the
coast the interbasin transfer rules on the coast just don't make any
sense.  If New Hanover County wasn't grandfathered in, we would not be
able to take water treated from the river and pump it over to the beach.
 So ?? take sewage from the beach and pump it back over to the treatment
plant on the river, so this is a very good solution.  I support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Hager is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I move for a favorable on
the PCS as amended.  I'm favorable to the original and the PCS roll into
a new PCS ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  You heard the motion.  All in favor say aye.
Opposed no.  The aye's have it.  The Bill will be so reported.  The next
Bill we have is going to be Senate Bill 205.  Representative Brisson
will be.  Rather PCS Representative Hager moves that it be before us.
All in favor say aye.  Opposed no.  The aye's have it and the Bill is
properly before us.  Representative Brisson.  Just as soon as they hand
it out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chair and Committee.  This Senate Bill
205 it came to our Agriculture Committee.  It's kind of a simple Bill.
It's just changing soil samples from once every year to once every three
years, and the NCDA didn't have a problem with it and Gaynor didn't have
a problem it.  I'd be glad to answer any questions you have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  For motion at appropriate time, Mr. Chair.  It seems
to be the appropriate time.  Nobody...Mr. Chair I move that we give a
favorable report to the PCS, unfavorable to the original Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  You've heard the motion.  All in favor say aye.
Opposed no.  The aye's have it.  The Bill will be so recorded.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Brisson.  Nothing else before the
Committee.  We stand adjourned.</p>
