Members the Chairman, I'm gonna ask you to do something I don't think
we've done before. But the chair would appreciate, we have the screening
today. I've done the skin screening today at about 9:45 and that was 45
minutes into the screening process and there have been two or three
people who had identified things that they needed to have a doctor look
at and referred out and I'm sure there may have been others over the
course of the day. The chair would like to ask questions, just press
your light momentarily so we can see a cue count up on the board. If
you've had a cancer screening over the last six months or today, please
turn your light on. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, suggest the A's and the A's. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The reason I
bring that up, there are 120 members. I cannot illuminate my light, but

members have availed themselves of the screening. I would encourage you
to consider either going down there this afternoon if they're still
available, or seeing your doctor. They're doing good work for us. On
behalf of all the members, the chair would like to extend the courtesies

Universities are exactly like police forces that you have in
municipalities or sheriff’s departments or other public institutions,
Universities within the University’s system. To date there are about 16
out of some 30 private colleges and universities that have set up police
forces. These employees are employees of private colleges or
universities and during this time period there were not standards as to
what they needed to release in case there were an arrest on campus. So
the private, North Carolina private colleges and university group has
been working for a number of months now to try to put together a set of
standards and has come up with the bill that’s before you, which
essentially requires that they release the exact same thing that would
be released in one of our public universities or colleges.
The committee substitute had just two very minor technical corrections
to it, one was a number change and the other was removing the word
“infraction” on line 19. It’s a pretty simple bill, passed judiciary
with no opposition. There is no opposition that I know of to the bill.
What this does is kind of level the playing field, set of standards for
public colleges and universities that will be really identical to any
other police force agency in North Carolina, so I will be happy to
answer any questions.
[Change speaker]
Further discussion, further debate, Representative Jeter please state
your purpose.
[Change speaker]
To debate the bill
[Change speaker]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Change speaker]
I appreciate Representative Ross’s discussion and my point is more
global in nature than specific to this bill as I will vote in favor of
this bill. I do have very serious concerns about a situation where, if
you have a private or public college and I understand this bill, all it
does is take private colleges in line with public colleges, but if you
get a campus security police force and you arrest someone, arrest by
definition in North Carolina law is holding someone against their will
if you have the legal right to do so by North Carolina statutes.
If you arrest someone on a campus security police, that record under our
current statue allows that to become public information to anyone moving
forward regardless of whether you are ever indicted, transferred to
local enforcement, that types of things. That significantly troubles me.
I will say that I think this bill is a good bill in the fact that it
puts and even playing field amongst private school and public schools
but I am hopeful that we will look at the overarching issue here which
is, an arrest should not be sufficient unless you’ve gone to local law
enforcement off campus. An arrest in and of its self should not be
sufficient for a public document to be released to your name and have
that go against you in perpetuity if it never passed the litmus test of
going to an actual off campus law enforcement facility an indictment or
some sort of issue to that effect.
So I know I am being contradictory but now you know what it feels like
to be my wife… but it’s one of those things that I think we have to make
it consistent and I will vote in favor of this. I think we have to look
at this statute as a whole and change the word arrest because I do not
think that meets the litmus test for us to release this information as
public knowledge. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[Change speaker]
Representative Ross please state your purpose.
[Change speaker]
I thank you for your comments and I somewhat agree with what you’re
saying.
[Change speaker]
Gentleman has recognized to debate the bill a second time.
[Change speaker]
But really that is another issue. The issue before us today is a bill
that is really trying to bring in line and get a set of standards that
are equivalent to or very similar to or actually identical to what a
public police agency would provide.
[Change speaker]
Representative Baskerville please state your purpose.

Gentleman has been recognized to debate the bill.

I thank my colleague Mr. Jeter for his remarks mine are in the same vein
that there is a provision in the bill, section C, number 3, which
requires the campus police department to maintain the records regarding
the circumstances surrounding an arrest and I don’t think it would be
much of a stretch for them to maintain records regarding …</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Faircloth placed that your purpose for which I was recognized by Bill
may have come along way and in the last few years with the concept of a
campus Police Department. it used to be, then a hard security guard
constituted the campus Police Department for many agencies now in an
cases where they actually create a campus release department. it is in
fact under North Carolina law exactly that it has a authority that a
public release. agency has caused basically the same practices with
perhaps one exception, the practice of policing nowadays gives more
latitude to the law enforcement officer owned in the what this is, in
years past. we are urging for instance local police officers, and I
think I was the please alter the rubber gets on the same advised to look
at the situation you're dealing with and see if the best answer is
something other than arrest and if it is take that Avenue rather than
creating an arrest for the steps we need to take to cut down some of the
population in our jails and prisons. I satisfied that within the
progress we have made a campus police departments that most of the day
of private institutions, if not all are requiring their officers to
operate as publicly, soldiers, and to follow the rules and follow the
procedures that are necessary if they do in fact arrest somebody. they
will take them to the court system, the court system will maintain the
same records for them own disposition, and so forth, as is maintained
for the municipal police or sheriff 's department, so I feel like this
is a good bill. I think it's a step forward. I think it does something
else to do in a rare case where an administration and a private college.
my own take on a high whatsoever. students may have gotten involved in
what's they choose a campus Police Department. they basically have to
have a student live in virtually the same climate rest of us live in.
you follow the laws you follow the procedures you do with a chant with
the college requires of you do with the law requires of you, and I
think, imagine a very good way and I hope you sports Bill the discussion

we call a technical correction to the administrative procedures act,

select the jurisdiction in which once an ?? administrative law judge
makes a ruling on a proposed rule that has been challenged by an
individual if the want to appeal that, then that ?? party can file their
appeal in the court of their choice under current law it's only Wade
County. And so we're allowing that challenge to occur in any court and
additionally we are changing the place where the procedure, as I
mentioned in the previous amendment, it's going to be on the agencies
website containing that information, in addition to the rules reviewed,
commission, so those are the main changes the ?? rules. The agency has
to notify the ?? rules when a rule is repealed and that's in a couple of
different places in the legislation as well. I'd be glad to answer any
questions about this riveting subject of the administrative procedures
act. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Members, I'd like to call
your attention to a handout that should be on your desk, a yellow piece
of paper. And it tells you a little bit about the establishment of the
Legislative Prayer Caucus.
We mentioned this several days ago in thanking the Speaker for
recognizing our Prayer Caucus. Our Senate colleagues have done the same,
and so this is a joint caucus, it's a nonpartisan caucus. It's modeled
after the Congressional Prayer Caucus that was established in 2005. And
the Chairs on the House side are Representative Annie Mobley, and
Representative Dean Arp and myself.
I've also sent you an email, but I'd just have you take a look at this
and if you would respond to the email, if you would be interested in
being a member of this Prayer Caucus. If you have any questions, let me
know. We will have our first meeting, I will just say for your point of
making your plans, next Thursday at 7:30 in the morning. And we'll get
the details out on that later, so thank you.
