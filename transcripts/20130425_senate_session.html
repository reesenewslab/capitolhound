Senate will come to order. Sergeant at Arms, close the doors.  Members
will go to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery will please
silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is the
Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the
gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let’s take a moment to pray together. Our Lord, sometimes we expect so
little from you. We box you up and we put you on the sidelines. We try
to take the bull by the horns and solve everything on our own. All the
while we forget that our chariots and our horses and our bills are
nothing without you. Unless the Lord builds the house, the laborers
labor in vain. So, may we not be vain today. Lord, may we humble
ourselves to rely entirely on you for everything. In Jesus’ name we
pray. Amen.

Whereas, in 2012 the Rams became the first historical black college and
university football team to win fourteen games, topping the team’s 2011
record of thirteen wins; and
Whereas, in 2012 Winston-Salem’s State football team also captured the
Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association conference championship for
the second consecutive year; and
Whereas, WSSU football team won the NCAA Division II Super Region 1

...National Champions and was ranked number 1 in the final box to row
national football poll. And whereas, during the 2012 season, the
Winston-Salem football team, its players and coaches, won numerous
awards and individual awards that were also consistently congratulated
for their sportsmanlike conduct. And whereas, despite playing an
extended football season, team players still achieved academic success
with 21 players making the fall 2012 dean's list. Now therefore, the
2012 Winston-Salem State University Football Team should be commended
for its outstanding season. Mr. President, at this time I would like to
recognize Coach Maynard Hayes and his coaching staff and the
Winston-Salem State Championship Football Team. Would you please stand?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, Members. We have come to a Conference Report
signed by the members from the House and the Senate. I will hit some of
the high points,  be happy to go into more detail if you like. But the
Conference Report the changes made and ratified were agreed to Senate
reduced to 11 on the Coastal Resources Commission. The Conference Report
reduces to 13. Conference Report restores some of the member
qualifications and existing law. We’re talking about the Coastal
Resources Commission and as a requirement, CRC members must reside and
own property in Coastal North Carolina. Utilities Commission Conference
Report does not sweep the Utilities Commission but reduces from 7 to 5
members in 2015. Also adds a requirement that members of the Utilities
Commission cannot be delegates to a political convention or serve as
officers in a political party. Special Superior Court judges, Senate had
eliminated, but the Conference Report allows no more specials to be
seated after April 1, 2013. The Conference Report allows those seated
April 1, 2013, to finish their current terms and then the position will
be eliminated and it also keeps the 3 Business Court judges. That’s
basically the high points of this and I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion, further debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and Members of the Senate. I encourage you to
reject this Conference Report and vote against it. If the bill remains a
power grab, this is going to be detrimental to the people of North
Carolina. The bill as written fires all current board members of the
Environmental Management Commission, the Industrial Commission, the
Wildlife Resources Commission, the Lottery Commission. On the Coastal
Resources Commission there’s not a requirement that there be a single
person who has any knowledge of marine related science. It shortens the
terms of the existing members on the Utilities Commission. The
legislation injects politics and ideology in the commissions that serve
to protect every consumer in the state and the environment and it
adjudicates claims of injured workers. Our current system works. It
allows for the governor, and the President Pro Tem and the Speaker to
fill vacancies as they occur in their natural term. This allows for us
to have continuity and to resist the temptation on y'alls part to just
grab power because you can. Please vote against this Conference Report.

House, have insure that the political patronage for the minority party
stay intact, through the extent of their, term and  only is replace by
the political appointees of the majority party, on the expiration of
there therm.  This judges that we don't need. That work 7. 8 hours a
week are gonna continue to lap up tax payers dollars, at a 125 thousand
plus  dollars a year, for their 20 30 hour a week,  at best, of their
hard labour when we don't need them. The state is gonna continue to
expend 2.2 million dollars a year on judges that we don't need. When we
have  places through out the state that are in dire need of elected
superior court judges. That answer to the people. But the courage over
there in the chamber, just cant find the way to elect judges, we have to
have politically appointed judges. I'm wondering one day we'll find out
why it is that certain people wanted to be so sure, that we didn't
remove this political appointees, before their time in order to save the
tax payers dollars.
the rest of the bill, conference report, I think is a pretty good
report, but as a matter of principal I can not support this. I would not
sign the conference report and I want my fellow members, of this body,
to understand why. I hope we will work hard as we go trough the budget
and in the years to come to find ways to better reallocate our judicial
resources. We sorely need this money in other places, that is better
spend, there are distinct such as my district, down in Johnson county,
that needs another elected superior court judge. But I can't work on
trying to see that done in your district or my district, because we have
to protect this political positions. Its a shame, its disgusting and is
indefensible. I am anxious, for some body to one day explain to me why
it was so necessary. I understand why this body is making this
compromise. We can not hold this process up for ever on this few
position, but that is the reason for my vote. Thank you .
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mister president.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Blue for what purpose do you rise .
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To comment briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Blue has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I'm sorry on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Blue has floor to speak on the motion .
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you mister president. I happen to think, that the wisdom shown by
the conferees on the provision relating to the special superior court
judges was a very wise decision. First we were gone loose the law suit,
about judges, where the judges or the laws deciding the fate of judges.
Secondly, apparently, you don't fully appreciate what happens on many
Sunday evenings on the state. When the director of the administrative
office of the courts calls a special  superior court judge from Manteo,
and says pack up your bags be in Murphy by 10 o'clock in the morning.
The superior court judge schedule to hold up court up there is sic, or
incapacitated, for some other reason, He packs up and he goes or she
goes, to the other parts of the state. That's how this specials are
used. We eliminated them in the 1980s and they were reappointed latter
on.   I happen to have strongly sported the superior court judges that
Jim Hose Houser pointed, as well as those that Jim Marting appointed. I
thought that they were good judges. Many moved on to serve in the state
courts of appeal and in the supreme court, and distinguish them selves,
and still distinguish them selves. I'm talking about judges appointed by
republican governors, as well as judges appointed by democratic
governors. I think is a good idea for the governors to balance the
judiciary with candidates of a certain attitude. The governor having the
power to appoint superior court judge is noting that we ought to
apologize about. I believe that governor McCoy would appoint good
superior court judges, and over a for year period, which is the the time
during which he would appointee them. I think, that they would
distinguish themselves, as well. That's one are were we haven't had a
bunch of loafers and others. I think that you ought to be commended by
letting those who have already been appointed serve. I wish you have
gone a little bit further and continue this</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister president.
I hope we don't start this as the appointees to boards. We need more
involvement in the political world, not less. Not necessarily more
elected people. We're the ones that make a mess out of everything. These
people that labor in the vineyards out there are good people doing civic
duty and being a precinct chairman should not disqualify you from
serving on the utilities commission or any other board of commission in
the state. I just wanted to pitch that out there.
Politics can not be perceived as something that is inherently evil
because it is what our country is. And without it, you don't have a
democracy. And I'm just pitching that out there so that hopefully we
aren't starting a new trend, here on everybody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion? debate?
Hearing none, question for the senate is the adoption of the conference
committee substitute to senate bill 10. We will have one electronic
vote. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds

Senator Rucho is back in the chamber and free to vote.
Let's do that again. We're already voting. Never mind.
Rucho, aye. Rabin, aye.

Members it's good to get to something that is not controversial to deal
with today. I'm just gonna hit the high points here and then turn it
over to senator Nesbitt.
First, mister president, if I might, I'd like to send forth an
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do members have copies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? speech should be on the dashboard ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members on the dashboard, clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is on the dashboard, senator. You should have it before you, senator.
Senator Apodaca is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister president. Members.
Let me turn my dashboard on. Set my copy up. What this does is that
there were questions in the finance committee on how this would affect
other counties if they did not want to participate. If it would be
pushed upon them, have a metropolitan sewer district and the
establishment of it. This was mainly concerns out of Wake county and
what this does is it makes a county have all municipalities sign off
before an MSD can be established. So that is what this amendment does.
It should take care of the other concerns from other members about it
being forced on their county. I'll be happy to explain it further if
needed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, ?? what purpose ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To enthusiastically support the amendment. And to thank senator Apodaca
for sending it forth before he turned the mic to senator Nesbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion? debate?

Mister president, I need to move under rule 29. That I be recused from
voting on this amendment and all the matters relating to this bill. And
I have sent the clerk a statement of reasons.

one. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will

<p id="30:00">
Members, this comes from the western part of the state. We've discussed
the Asheville airport before. This deals with the Asheville water
system. It's a lot of history here, and I think by the time we get
through it, we'll give you a good overview of the history. There was a
regional water system set up and it was, dissolved is a good word,
around 2004. It combined all, well, most of the municipalities in the
county and the Asheville city. It also involved Henderson county. Part
of it was we allowed them to put a water intake plant in Henderson
county in the Mills River area. It had specific agreements that were to
be executed as we went through it. They weren't fulfilled, the
obligations of Asheville. Asheville dissolved the water system like I
said in '04 and said they were going to take it over. There was no
compensation made to anyone when it was dissolved, although the whole
regional system was a system put together by a lot of smaller parts in
the Asheville/Buncombe county area I believe in the late 30s or 40s,
that area grew over time. So when this was dissolved, Senator Nesbitt,
myself, and the whole delegation became involved. And we sat through
meeting after meeting after meeting trying to get everybody to come
together. And at that time, one of the ideas brought forth was to let
the MSD, the Metropolitan Sewer District, in that area take over the
water system because they did a good job. And we just didn't get there.
We passed Sullivan agreements to allow no differential rates charged
outside. Anyway, this is to hopefully put together a true regional water
system that will protect western North Carolina, mainly the
Bumcombe/Henderson/Transylvania areas, to have a secure source of water
going forward, and to give us some continuity in how we grow and provide
water, and also it brings in a sewer plant in northern Henderson county
into the MSD, and allows three seats from Henderson county to go on the
new Metropolitan Sewer Authority that will be formed out of this bill.
This is a overview, there's a lot of back and forth as you've heard. I
think we heard a lot of this in finance, but I just would like to say I
ask for your support. We're not trying to steal from anybody, we're just
trying to come up with a way to protect the citizens of western North
Carolina, and hopefully have a stable source of water and sewer for that
area, because we are one of the major growth areas in the state now.
I'll be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate. I
apologize to you all for having to go through the torments of western
North Carolina. Apparently the old legislature used to have to go
through this all the time. On annexation, on disputes between cities and
counties that we tried to settle over time, and apparently didn't do a
good job of reaching a settlement of that by the way. It tended to
alienate the people, but it kept you all from having to endure these
debates. But I think this is one you need to hear. The amendment that
Senator Apodaca just sent forward, if that had been followed in this
case, you wouldn't hear a peep out of me. It requires the counties that
are affected by this to ask that it be done. That's the way you build
regional agreements, that's the appropriate way to do it. And I'm for
regional agreements, I want them to occur because it's a more efficient
use of resources. In Henderson county they do not have a sewer treatment
plant out on the, what would be the north end of their county. We treat
their sewage for them already. We do that by agreement. They don't have
a water system on the western end of their county, where our water
intake is, and they signed an agreement which is still in effect and
still being enforced, I think it will be done away with by this, but as
of right now,</p>

And he just wants to do it in a forceful way to where he's, punished
them for some sin that apparently they had done to him in the past.
Representative McGradey, now senator Apodaca represents part of Buncombe
county and he has every right to have an opinion. But representative
McGradey, a republican up there named Dr. Mumpower, who severed on our
city council for awhile made a statement. And I said this at, and
Mumpower is know to be eccentric at best. And I told him at this meeting
and I said &quot;I've finally lived long enough to where Carl Mumpower
said something that I agree with.&quot;  And Chuck McGradey was chairing
a meeting in Buncombe county about taking our water system by the way.
And I said he said &quot;Mr. McGradey when you tell us your over here to
help us figure out what to do with our water system its a bit
disingenuous, it kinda looks more like somebody casing a bank fixing to
rob it.&quot; And Chuck, we always thought he was a great, charming
fellow when he was coming to Sierra club meetings, in Buncombe. He was
president of the Sierra club, and we thought well boy he's something. We
didn't realize  he was checking out all of our assets so that when he
got in the house he could start taking them. And he hasn't slowed down a
bit and he just thinks he has the right to do that. Now folks this is
not anyway to conduct business, and we all have talk about this down
here before. If people in this room know anything, we know that the sun
don't shine on the same dogs head all the time. Things change, and you
don't start a regional agreement and get everybody's water and sewer
tied up in it, in a shotgun marriage. It doesn't work that way its just
the other side made the next time, and we gotta deal with that. I was
trying to think of a good analogy. Its almost like, Henderson county
kinda went and got in a cage with a 400 pound gorilla back in 95' and
woke up with a hangover the next day. And Now they found a cage that's
got two gorillas and that's Bunkum and the city of Ash-ville and their
cutting the lock off to climb back in there with them. And for the life
of me I don't see what the long term deal is here. The people in
Buncombe are upset, of course the people in the city of Ash-ville are
upset. Ash-villes about 70,000 people Buncombes about 220,000 I think,
somewhere around there. And this just isn't going to work long term, you
just cant do this under these conditions and leave everybody with hard
feelings and expect anything to last any length of time at all. Now the
powers here its going to pass, but understand that my people rightfully
believe that an asset that they have invested 100 years in, is being
taken from them without compensation, against their wishes, that
Henderson county will have an undo influence over our future. And by the
way this authority has taxing authority, I know they think it doesn't
anymore but it does. It has taxing and assessing authority over
Henderson county, and Buncombe, and the city of Ash-ville of course.
There's just way to many moving parts in this for any good to come of it
. And I think you know I ask everybody to look at it, think before you
do this. If you don't think its coming your way, you just wait. Water is
going to be more important then oil in this country, at some point. And
if you don't think your neighbors will steal form you, observe. They'll
be there if you've got water and they don't and they got power and you
don't, they'll take it. And the</p>

Representative: …the amendment we passed a while ago says, oh well, both
of them have to write a letter. Well that is until somebody decides not
to. We all know what a statute means down here. The minute you got the
votes, you can do anything you want to. This will be a thing of the
future. Now, we were talking a while ago about who all is in this. It is
interesting, MSD, the board is a bunch of [xx] – I know most of them. I
am not sure if there is a lady there or not, not one that I know of
right off the top of my head. We have the mayor of Black Mountain and
the mayor of Woodson. We have an appointee from,.,,, We have Bill
Stanley, who was on our county commissioner for years. It is Buncam and
Ashevilleand six municipalities: all of them are sitting there and not
saying a word because they all are on their own water systems and do not
want them sucked into this deal. This is not a deal where everybody is
getting into play. It is a our water system for Buncam County that is
being sucked into this deal – and that’s all. In Henderson County, the
city of Hendersonville, has a great water system – it’s not regional,
it’s just Buncam’s that is regional. This is not regional – it is a
taking of Buncam’s assets for the purpose of Ashland County. It is
taking control of it from the people we entrusted it to, to put it with
another board so that Moffet can get even with the city of Ashland. I
mean we can pass a bill that Ashville has to do all this, but hat is not
what we chose to do. Or, we could have passed a bill that Buncam County
commissioners can take over the water system if you are worried about
management, but that ain’t what we did. I ask you to think long and
hard. I think we are starting something that I have never seen here
before. I have never seen this before: where you come in and just take
control of somebody else’s stuff. The list is as long as you arm of
stuff they can come in and got, and I urge you to defeat the bill.

parents legal guardians or members of the household, however today's
education is more collaborative and uses more modern instructional
options including the internet, electronically stored information, video
instruction and cooperative activities. This bills updated definition

This bill changes none of this. All this bill does is allow the use of a
legal suppressor while hunting, increasing the risk of hearing damage
related to the use of firearms. Suppressors also allow hunters to wear
less ear protection, which increases their awareness of their
surroundings and improves safety. This legislation will benefit farmers
who need to hunt nuisance wildlife such as feral hogs and coyotes. These
animals are typically found in groups or packs and when using a normal
rifle, the animals will scatter after one shot. Suppressors will allow
farmers to fire multiple shots and take multiple animals without them
scattering. Currently, hunting with legal suppressor is allowed in 24
states. The bill is supported by the Lilac Resource Commission, and it
did pass the Senate Add committee and the Senate Judiciary One
committee. In closing, I would like to use the words of Dr. Phillip H.
Dater who writes &quot;It is easy to spot older, long time shooters.
These are the guys who can't understand a word you're saying while
regaling you with tales of the great hunts in exotic locations, the
competitions won, or the battles bravely fought. Some use hearing aids,
which are second choice to natural hearing. Others will be able to
understand you if they can see your lips move and their is little
ambiance in the room.&quot; I would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters, what purpose your aye's?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. I think this bill, this is not a second
amendment rights bill. We've heard today from the bill sponsor all the
guidelines that we have to go through to buy suppressor or silencer. I
don't think, that's not the issue. There's an issue that's far reaching
than hunters, and it's landowners, private property rights. As we go
forward, you know there's a thing, it's safety. Safety should be for
every North Carolinian. Not just the hunters in North Carolina. Because
living in rural North Carolina, when you live there day after day, and
you walk out in the morning, and you hear someone duck hunting, or in
deer season you hear deer rifles discharge, you know someone's on your
property. And you know when you've given permission or not. You can hear
them. And so as a landowner, you go and check on your property. But
also, you send farm workers out everyday. And a lot of places in North
Carolina, little farms, we travel across two or three neighboring
properties to get to a property in the back maybe. And we may not know
that someone has the right to hunt, but if you hear that gun discharge,
you stay out of that area. If you're working in the forest products
industry, in deer season, you understand if you hear a gun discharge in
the green ??, 660 acre block, which is a mile squared, you don't enter
that block, because you understand someone is hunting there. What the
next thing is is deer poaching, or night hunting. If you're at home in
the evening, and you hear a gun go off, you know probably someone is on
your farm hunting illegally. You can call the sheriffs department. And
we passed a bill in 2010, general senate, landowner protection. Where
you have to have written permission to hunt. Oh, 2011, thank you. Where
you have to have written permission to hunt. Those are the issues that I
have with this bill, it's safety and trespassing. And I think at some
point in time, we as property owners and family farms for generations,
we need protection as well. Hunting is a wonderful sport, I participate
in it all the time, have two or three hunting lodges; I understand the
joy and the privilege of hunting. But it is a privilege. And we have to
protect our workers, and our family farms.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. You just made the statement, Senator Nesbitt that you had the
right to go over there and hunt on Jackson's property, or Walter's
property. We passed a law in 2011 that said no you can't do that. You've
got to have permission, written, signed and on your person, to be there.
So you're hunting illegally if you're doing that. You do remember us
passing that. You voted for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes I do remember that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I ought to have to do the same thing if I'm going to go on his
property with a suppressor, or tell him if I'm on his neighbour's
property with a suppressor so he'll know to wear a hard hat while he's
on his tractor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird. For what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the Bill sponsors a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Randleman do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm working on the logic here as was explained by Senator Brock. You
said that this was in case we have wild hogs or coyotes or something and
they, they go in packs, and you want a suppressor so that if you shoot
one the others don't know it and they all won't run away, but Senator
Brock tells me that you actually can hear the gun and therefore it's not
really a danger to Senator Walters, so which one is right? Can you hear
the gun so that the hogs will disperse, or they can't hear the gun, so
the neighbours won't hear it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Kinnaird, and that was the second rationale for the
Bill, the first being the safety from ear damage. I will tell you that
this suppressor, when the gun fires, it decreases the decibels at the
hearing range, but you can still hear it out from you. So these herds,
they would be in your immediate vicinity. It's not like they're going to
be extremely long range, so when they fire, they should be able to kill
more than one. As I explained the other day, typically, rifles generally
fire at around 160 decibels. The noise from a suppressed rifle varies,
based on the specific suppressor and the type of ammunition, but they
typically lower the decibels to between 120 and 140 range.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question to the Bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Randleman do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are there other methods of protecting your ears? Aren't there muffs and
those things you insert in your ears?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for asking that and if you had listened to my explanation, I
explained how when hunters have to wear other hearing protection, that
it causes them not to have as much understanding of their surroundings,
because when they have ear muffs on or ear plugs in then, in their
immediate range, it lessens their ability to hear what's going on in
that range.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

learn cursive writing. If you take a look at the last time you got a
cursive written piece of information it is very rare. Most of us are
using electronic pieces of communication to communicate back and forth.
I understand that the department of public instruction does not require
keyboarding. Which I think is our present as well as or future. I go
back to the concept of a top down approach toward education. I think we
need to work more with our boards of education. We need to work more
with our superintendents and take instructions from them about what is
best to educate our children. I thank you for your time his afternoon
and I will be voting against the bill and I encourage you to consider
your actions as it relates to public instruction. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
further discussion of debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Allran for what
purpose you rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Allran has the floor to speak a second time on
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would just say first of all the state
board of education for those who are interested supports this bill and
so does superintendent June Atkinson. However I didn't put the bill in
for the sake of any of those folks. I put the bill in, I drew up the
bill last session because a lady in my district called me up, a mother
slash parent, called me up and said she was so upset and concerned
because her child and the other children couldn't read cursive writing.
Since they couldn't read it, that means they couldn't write it. Since
they couldn't write it they also couldn't read it. So I drew the bill up
and put it on my desk and set it aside and a group of young people from
Newton North Carolina came to visit called teen leadership and I was
sitting with them up in the appropriations rooms talking and asked them
what they thought about that bill. Every single one of them raised their
hand and said please put that bill in because we believe you should be
able to write in cursive and read it. And they said people are just
being deprived. To me its very neglectful that we would let our children
graduate and not be able to read or write in cursive or know the
multiplication tables. And the way we should be going in this state is
more education. If we can't give them more education we should at least
hold our own. But if they can't read or write  the way everybody in this
room can we are going backwards, we'er depriving these people. I would
simply say that its common sense. They have a right to know the same
type of things that we learned when were coming along. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford for what purpose you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I would like to speak a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Ford has the floor to speak on the bill a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator I respect your approach I just simply bring back your attention.
We have school boards. We have superintendents all across this state.
And I think that is we are going to do something as relation to public
education we need include those folks. I respect parents. I am one with
a child who is public school myself but I go to my principals, I go to
the teachers to figure out what their struggles are before I come to you
with any piece of education, piece of legislation that relates to
education. I think we do them a disservice when we don't include them
and we are just listening to parents about what they want. Teachers have
to do a lot to educate our kids. In my opinion this legislation is
piling on what they already have to do to educate our</p>

I’m not going to go into you about what the budgeting is for education;
I just simply ask you folks in this chamber to consider the impact that
it’s going to have on those folks who are going to have to add this to
the curriculum. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further
discussion or debate? Senator Rabin, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin has
the floor to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As a former trainer
and educator with some huge responsibility in that world, I don’t find
training and educating as arcane as some people do. If we look at the
results of our current system, a lot of us have agreed that for our
investment, we’re not doing too well. Maybe a bit of guidance going the
other way is in order. As to the need for cursive writing, I had to sign
a check yesterday and also I read the Constitution. I support the bill
and I support the disciplines involved. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, this
bill basically authorizes, and listen to me carefully, a voluntary
assessment of no more than two tenths of one percent – of one cent,
excuse me – on propane gasoline. The dealers are entitled to request and
receive a refund on the assessment paid similar to other assessments we
have in our laws. We currently have 19 assessment programs in North
Carolina now, and the group is asking that we allow them to do this as
well. The funds from this will be used for education, training, safety
compliance, equipment replacement for low income customers, marketing,
advertisements and customer rebates. To my knowledge the industry is
behind this, there’s no opposition, and I would ask for your support and
be glad to answer any questions. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator

Mr. President. Well fellow Senators, you’re in for a treat. Today we
have a 51 page limited liability company act, and I have my esteemed
colleague Senator Clodfelter here to take up where I leave off. Now to
the merits of the bill. It comes to us from the business law section of
the North Carolina Bar Association where it was well-vetted and has been
well done. It was also fully vetted by two meetings of our Judiciary 1
Committee, and it comes to us now today extensively revising the Limited
Liability Act. This is</p>

It's an important act because what it does is it gives tools to the two
hundred thirty-one thousand, five hundred and thirty limited liability
companies in North Carolina. Limited Liability companies are now the
premier and the most prolific or business organization formed in North
Carolina. It's particularly important for small businesses. This act
does modernize. It gives flexibility and what it really does, it's truly
critical to, for economic engine which is so much built on the limited
liability companies, especially for those small businesses. I do
anticipate that it's going to help us create jobs for our working
families. I am prepared to answer questions, but before I do, I do have
one technical amendment. It should be on your dashboard as we speak. I'm

Senator Randleman you have the floor for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I wish to speak to a Senatorial statement
honoring the life of  Arthel Lane Doc Watson. And I have sent that
statement forward. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen. In 1998 this body adopted a Senate
resolution paying tribute to North Carolina native Arthel Lane Doc
Watson, legendary performer and folk artist and honoring his son the
late Merle Watson. Today is the opening day for the 26th annual Merle
Fest held at Wilkes Community College. The event was started in 1988 as
a fundraiser for the community college and the memory of Doc’s son
Merle. By last year the event had grown to over 75,000 participants who
come from all over the world. Unfortunately this year will be the first
time in the history of the festival that its founder, Doc Watson will
not be in attendance, who acted host and played music with his friends.
He passed last May at the age of 89. Doc inspired countless musicians
with his guitar pickin’ style. Over his legendary career he won seven
Grammys and was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music
Association Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2006.
Amazing accomplishments considering he lost his sight as an infant.
Despite all of his success Doc remained a simple and humble man. And I
don’t think he ever truly realized his impact on country and bluegrass
music. He would often describe his guitar playing as country pickin’. I
encourage everyone to come and enjoy the Merle Fest. The event lasts
through Sunday and the tribute jam to celebrate Doc will be played
Saturday night. Mr. President, I respectfully request that the words of
the Senatorial statement honoring the life of Doc Watson be spread
across the journal. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So ordered. Senator Apodaca for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President we have one
time sensitive matter that’s on the calendar we need to do. It shouldn’t
take but a second. House joint resolution 599. I move it be brought
before us for immediate consideration. It has been passed out. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So ordered. [BLANK_AUDIO] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Sanderson for what purpose do you rise? ??
House joint resolution 599. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House
joint resolution 599. Supporting prayer week in North Carolina. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Sanderson is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. President. Just to speak to the resolution. Members of, of the
Senate, everyone does have a copy of this resolution. The purpose of
this resolution is to join with our Governor in proclaiming next week as
a week of prayer for North Carolina in conjunction with the National
Prayer day which will be observed next Thursday. This resolution is very
self-explanatory. Two things I would like to point out is that the auth,
that the authors of our Constitution knew the importance of prayer to do
what they had to do to make the decisions they had to make. And we would
like to join with them and our Governor and the many thousands of our
citizens across this state who will be in prayer for our state and for
the business of this General Assembly next week as we come back to do
the business of the state. I would just like to offer this resolution to
you and I commend this let, this resolution for concurrence with members
of the House. Thank you Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Senator. Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none the
question before the Senate is the adoption of House joint resolution 599

extend courtesies of the gallery to Jacob Crawford and his parents.
Jacob was the winner of a national sandwich contest that resulted in a
$25,000 college fund, a trip to New York City, an appearance on Fox and
Friends and lunch with the Governor, which he prepared with the help of
executive chef.  Jacob is ten years old.  Jacob are you still with us in
the gallery?  If you are, please rise and be recognized.
Congratulations.
Now, time to thank our pages for the week.  Pages, we thank you for your
service to the Senate.  We hope it's been a fruitful week for you.  It
was certainly an exciting one here, so hope you'll come back and see us.
 Thank you for your service.
Do we have any notices or announcements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What little's left of our caucus will caucus immediately after session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other notices or announcements?  Senator Daniel, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel has the floor for point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  The Senate governor just recognized my
constituent Jacob Crawford for a sandwich that he prepared and won a
Jiffy competition.  Frankly, I learned about this probably a couple
months ago that Jacob was involved in this competition, and when my LA
mentioned it to me, I kinda thought, well, you know, so what, it's not
really a big deal, what's a Jiffy competition?  So, apparently, this
competition, it was sponsored by the Jiffy corporation, and you had to
use peanut butter in your recipe, and Jacob came up with this creative
idea and eventually kept getting farther and farther along in the
process until the point when he was deemed the winner, and so we set up
a session today with the Governor where he had this prepared, and here's
one of them right here on my desk.  He served, in the Governor's mansion
today, his sandwich, and I just wanted to tell you what the sandwich is
called and what some of the ingredients are and you can see how creative
Jacob was.  So, this sandwich is called a Magnificent Mole Chicken
Torta.  Ingredients are rotisserie chicken, Monterrey jack cheese, a
roll, avocado slices, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, minced onion, minced
garlic, two tablespoons of Jiffy chocolate flavored hazelnut spread,
condensed tomato soup, half a lime, chopped green chili peppers, ground
cumin, and dried cilantro, so I think Jacob should be commended not only
for his sandwich- this is a $25,000 sandwich.  He just paid his way
through college, so congratulations, Jacob.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Jacob.

Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jacob, you're coming over to my house to cook dinner tonight.  Senator
Gunn, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor, sir.

I'm just glad that Senator Daniel finally got through what was in the
sandwich, because Senator Hise was starting to foam at the mouth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I move the Senate do now adjourn subject to the receipt
of committee reports, the re-referral of bills and resolutions, the
receipt of messages from the House and the Governor to reconvene Monday,
April 29th, 2013 at 7PM.

The motion is the Senate do now adjourn subject to the stipulations
stated by Senator Berger to reconvene Monday, April 29th at 7PM,
seconded by Senator Gunn.  All in favor, say aye.
