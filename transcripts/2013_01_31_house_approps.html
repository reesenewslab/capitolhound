Before we move into the consideration of the one bill, on our calendar
today,
let me just stop right here and ask if you have any questions that I can
answer
in terms of the procedure? If not, I'm going to turn the Chair of the
meeting over to Chairman Johnson. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good Morning. Since we will have questions after this, if freshmen could
keep their nameplates out, we've got so many, want to make sure we call
the right name. We don't have to have a motion to have this bill before
us, it's a first edition, and Representative Dollar's going to present
House Bill 5. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair. The committee you have before you is House Bill
5,
and I'll try to give you the simple explanation of the house bill. What
you have in front of you I believe you've probably got the physical
note, there's no physical impact to the bill since it accesses currently
available funds and does not exceed those funds. There is a brief bill
explanation. What this bill does, very simply, there's technical
language in there but what this bill does is a very simple thing. What
this bill does is it allows individuals in group homes who have
lost...who are no longer qualified for personal care services as of
January 1, 2013, or for those who are appealing that assessment,
once that appeal is completed, if prior to June 30 of 2013 would be able
to access temporary funds for their financing of them in that facility.
This is currently available to individuals who are in adult care homes,
it was never the intent, in my opinion, of the General Assembly to leave
out group homes
because the individuals impacted who are in a facility whether it's an
adult care home, or whether they were in a group home, and the group
homes are smaller facilities, it's usually two to six individuals, it
was never the General Assembly's intent to leave out group homes to
start with, because the individuals involved have exactly the same
circumstance. And, in many cases, are essentially exactly the same
people. But, the department in their interpretation of an amendment that
was put in on technical corrections bill last year
said that they were left out. We went through several rounds of this
with the Legislative Oversight Committee in the Fall and for the
purposes of making sure that we move on and are clear as a General
Assembly, we are putting this bill forward. I'd be happy to give you a
longer explanation of what's going on with personal care services and
the like and the federal involvement if someone desires that, or you can
let me do that on the floor, I'll certainly be free...ask any questions
you wish but I think that essentially covers it for this legislation in
terms of what it does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair. First, I'd like to make the motion to get the
bill before us. I guess we needed to do that...is that right? You'd
mentioned
that in the beginning? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, it's a first edition, we don't have to have a motion, but thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question, then, is, could you very briefly describe for us what
personal care service means. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. Personal care services is an optional Medicaid service that
the State of North Carolina provides in its Medicaid program, and the
issue originally came up,  I'm not sure when the State originally
started with offering personal care services in Medicaid, but I do know
in the 90s what happened is, you have the program set up as a bifurcated
program. And, you had one definition of personal care services for
in-home, individuals staying in their home, and a separate definition
for personal care services for those who are in a facility, whether it
be an adult care home, group home, nursing home, whatever...</p>

general intent of the General Assembly. When this was designed, the
General Assembly’s intent was for individuals similarly impacted by the
changing definition of personal care services to be able to access this
pot of money. Just as you would if you were in an adult care home.
There’s more than sufficient funds in there and it will operate the
mechanics of it and the qualifying of it will be the same as it’s
already in session law with the budget that we passed last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am. Follow up. Representative Dollar, I’m still trying to figure
out...we had already appropriated $39.7 million for community living
funds. From what I understand, those are the funds that are authorized
by the budget for that particular program, this program was not included
in that. I guess my question is, did you over budget for the program
that the funds are coming out of, or if you didn’t, then if that fund
runs short before July 1, how are you going to make up that money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, if you look at the legislation on the second page, these funds,
and let me go ahead and mention something here, these are temporary
funds, this is a temporary fix that does not go pasty June 30 of 2013.
Payments would end effective June 30th of 2013 if you look on page 2
line 8, or upon depletion of the $39.7 million appropriated. When the
funds are finished, now what is happening in practice, when we set that
number at $39.7, we were making the calculation including individuals
that would be impacted in group homes. That was within the original
thinking so that was from the General Assembly’s perspective, we had
already taken that into account. Whether an individual was in an adult
care home or whether they were in a group home or there are a couple
other setting that this would have an impact on so we believe that there
will be sufficient money there to cover those additional individuals.
What has also happened is that with the number of appeals, they're
probably going to be excess money left over. We do not anticipate this
fund being depleted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Saine, you have one more follow up…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know, Madam Chair, I’m just as old…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I realize you know the procedure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As an old appropriations chair. My problem, Representative Dollar is
very simply this. The money was appropriated at $39.7 million was
appropriated for one program. The other program which may have been
included in there, but was not, is now being put back in. The problem
I’m having with this is you mentioned the appeals. You know that the
appeals process is slow, but if the appeals process starts speeding up
then you’re going to have a problem. If this money runs out before June
30, where are the other funds coming, number one where are the other
funds coming from in order to take care of this program, and number two,
I still don’t understand how you take this 39.7 for one program and
apply it to a second program and think your going to run both programs
off that 39.7.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, maybe I’ll try to clarify it this way. It’s not two separate
programs. It’s one program. But what the department came back and they
took a particular group of individuals and they said, no they weren’t
included in this when it was the intent of the General Assembly when we
put the program in place in the budget and when we calculated the $39.7
million, those people were already assumed by the General Assembly to be
there and to be able to access those funds beginning January 1 of 2013.
The only thing we’re doing, really, is just because we have to is making
it clear to the department that those individuals have access, those
individuals in group homes</p>

<p id="20:00">
We have something in North Carolina that’s called institutional bias. So
if you are elderly and you have income is 150 percent of the federal
poverty level, you are eligible to enter into an adult care home and
qualify for these personal care services, and the state county special
assistance.  If you choose to take that money and stay at home, you are
only Medicaid eligible up to 100 percent of poverty level. So if people
made only a little more than 100 percent of federal poverty level, it
was to their advantage to go into the institution and CMS doesn’t like
that either because they prefer for people to stay at home if they can.
This is a complex issue.  I think you’ve done a really good job of
explaining it and this is the fix we need and I agree that the intention
was to include a lot of the language originally said adult care homes
including group homes. I think it was just a short error that didn’t get
included in the technical corrections bills, though I think this is a
good fix and I’m really happy that we’ve been able to put it in place
before the deadline ran out. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Inskot, we thank you for your work and appreciate your
comments. Truly.  Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chairman. Favorable report on House Bill 5.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re checking to make sure we’ve got the motion right before the floor.
While we’re waiting on that, please remember that Representative Dollar
had announced the explanation in discussion on finance and the UI Bill
is in 544 and it’s continuing on there. Representative Cleveland, your
motion has been accepted. Your procedures are correct. All those in
favor of a favorable report for House Bill 5 will say, “Aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those opposed? The ayes have it. I’ll turn this back over to
Representative Nelson.  Did you want to adjourn? No further business
before us? I now declare this meeting adjourned.</p>
