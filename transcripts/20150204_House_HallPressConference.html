  We&#39;re going go ahead and get started. Close that door and we&#39;ll.
First of all I wanna say good morning to everyone. I&#39;m
Representative Hall, Democratic Leader House of Representatives. I
appreciate you coming this morning to hear about an issue that is of the
greatest importance to North Carolina. And certainly one that we&#39;ve
struggled to deal with so far. We&#39;re here this morning to announce
the launch of North Carolina Left Out, Left Me Out dot org. North
Carolina Left Me Out dot org. And this is gonna be a website and a
project that&#39;s gonna allow people to record and present their
stories for everyone to see and hear and understand the impact that our
failure to expand Medicaid has had on North Carolina. And going forward
what we should do to ensure our citizens have access to good healthcare,
and all the other benefits that come with expansion that other states
have done. We&#39;re further here to announce the People&#39;s Grand
Jury that&#39;s gonna be held at the legislative building on February
16th and it again, is gonna collect the testimony and the stories of
real North Carolinians who are affected by this. What the effect of
denial of coverage is and what the benefits are that we&#39;re losing.
As we send dollars to other states for them to benefit while North
Carolina citizens languish without the benefits of this expansion. Right
now, I wanna have Felicia Williams from Mom&#39;s Rising come to the
podium and she&#39;ll be going forward with this. But again, it&#39;s
important that we understand this is about the people of North Carolina.
About the loss of opportunities for jobs and training as well as good
healthcare. And we can certainly see with the question of the outbreak
of measles as well as the high numbers of North Carolinians who have
died from the flu outbreak recently. That we need to expand this. Not
only to get the jobs available, but also to get the protection for
people of North Carolina that we&#39;re already paying for. Felicia
Williams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, thank you, Representative Hall. And thank
you all so much for being here this morning. I am about to introduce
Dana Wilson who is why we are here today. She represents the 500,000
North Carolinians who are caught in a coverage gap. She grew up in
Gastonia and lives in Charlotte currently. And I&#39;ll let her go ahead
and tell her story and then I&#39;ll have a little bit more to share
with you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Good morning, my name is Dana Wilson and I
live in Charlotte. I&#39;m one of the half a million people who&#39;ve
been forced into the
Medicaid coverage gap by the actions of Governor McCrory and the
politicians here at the North Carolina Legislature. When I was 22
years-old my doctor sat me down and told me, I had multiple sclerosis.
Just like that, all the dreams and plans that I&#39;d been making for my
life changed forever. All my friends were spinning their last years of
college, applying for jobs and celebrating. I was forced to deal with a
serious lifelong illness and questions on how I was going to pay for
treatment. For those of you unfamiliar with MS,I suffer from
debilitating ?? fatigue every single day of my life. My symptoms are
made worst by stress. Which sometimes makes it harder to speak and use
fine motor skills. All of this means I&#39;m an unable to work more than
eight hours a week. It also means that my husband and I were unable to
have children. Because the doctor said the stress would be too much for
me. My husband would have to do most of the work. Because of my
pre-existing condition all health insurance companies refused to even
consider me. When I finally found an insurer willing to take me, the
plan came with a monthly, monthly premium of over a thousand dollars. I
do work. I have a part-time job as a salesclerk in an antiquing gift
shop. But I just don&#39;t have the strength to work full-time because
of the MS. And since I&#39;m unable to work full-time and because of my
chronic illness, there&#39;s no way I can afford the thousand dollar
premium [laughs] without my family&#39;s help. And that&#39;s unfair to
them and it&#39;s unfair to me. All of that should&#39;ve been changed
when the Affordable Care Act was passed. Which prevents health insurance
providers from refusing coverage to people like me who have pre-existing
conditions. Though also raised the Medicare eligibility level which
would&#39;ve helped me afford treatment for the first time since I was
diagnosed with MS. Unfortunately, Governor Pat McCrory and the General
Assembly decided to play politics instead of helping people like me to
get the care we need. Their refusal to expand Medicaid means I&#39;m out
of luck. And my income means I&#39;m unable to receive a subsidy to
purchase health insurance from the marketplace. I&#39;m in the coverage
gap, that&#39;s me. Governor McCrory and the lawmakers can help me and
half a million other people just like me to afford healthcare by
expanding Medicaid. All, the money is already there waiting for us. All
they need to do is accept it. But the longer they wait the deep.

  People like me fall into debt as we struggle to pay for treatment.
Lawmakers like to talk about fiscal responsibility. This just is common
sense. And it&#39;s not just about money, every day North Carolinians
are dying because they aren&#39;t able to afford health care. Let me
repeat that cause I don&#39;t think the lawmakers are getting the
message. People are dying. Is that not a good enough reason for you, Mr.
Governor? I know we can&#39;t save everyone, but you have the power to
start somewhere. Don&#39;t you see that? I know this Medicaid issue has
gotten all wrapped up in a larger political fight. I just hope the NC
Left Me Out Campaign can really help people to understand that there are
real people, good people, who are getting hurt by this refusal to fill
this coverage gap. For the sake of hundreds of thousands of people
around this state, I hope the lawmakers can connect the people to their
political decisions. I hope they can change their minds. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you so much, Dana, for sharing your powerful story. We are all
hear today because of Dana, and because of the half a  million North
Carolinians just like her who fall in the Medicaid coverage gap. A
majority of the people in this gap work in industries that just
don&#39;t offer health insurance. Industries like construction,
childcare, retail, hospitality, and food service. People working in
these industries often earn too little to qualify for a subsidy to buy
insurance on the state&#39;s new marketplace, but Medicaid in our state
doesn&#39;t cover parents who earn more than $10,000 a year. And it
doesn&#39;t cover adults without children at all. That is why this gap
exists, but this coverage gap did not occur by accident.  The Affordable
Care Act set aside a portion of money specifically for North Carolina to
use to extend Medicaid to uninsured low-income adults, however, the
General Assembly has refused to do so thus far. North Carolinians have
3.3 billion tax dollars in Washington right now earmarked to provide
citizens of our state with the health coverage they need, but our
legislative leaders have made the conscious decision not to bring our
money home. That is why, today, I am proud to stand on behalf of the NC
Left Me Out Coalition to announce the launch of our new website
NCleftmeout.org and a statewide tour to share stories of people who are
hurting for falling into the healthcare coverage gap. That coverage gap
can be filled if our legislature and Governor agree to extend Medicaid.
While some of our state leaders insist that there is &quot;no good
case&quot; for expanding Medicaid, we&#39;ve heard here today a very
good reason. We are here to send a clear message, that this dismissive
attitude is out of sync with hardworking North Carolinians.  Expanding
Medicaid would not only improve access to healthcare in our state,  it
would improve families&#39; economic security, bolster our economy, and
bring much needed jobs. It just makes sense that having reliable health
coverage improves a families economic security, and the data back this
up. When parents have access to health insurance they are able to get
preventative care, and see a doctor when they get sick so that they can
get better faster and get back to work. It is no surprise then that what
is good for a families economic security is also good for our economy. A
new report from Cone Health Foundation and Kate B. Reynolds Charitable
Trust found that by refusing to expand Medicaid last year that North
Carolina lost out on billions, with a B, of dollars and thousands of
jobs that would have given our economy a boost, however, if North
Carolina&#39;s leadership acts to extend Medicaid coverage right away
the state would create 43,000 jobs by 2020 (yes, thank you) and generate
approximately a billion dollars in related tax revenue. In addition,
closing the coverage gap would save the state budget more than 300
million dollars in that same time frame. The positive economic impact of
expandding Medicaid for our state is undisputable, and the positive
health impact for our citizens is undeniable. More than a thousand North
Carolinians will die each year because they lack access to affordable
health coverage.  NCleftmeout.org is designed to document the real,
human impact of the coverage gap.

  We intend to collect the real stories of folks like Dana who represent
the half a million North Carolinians who lack coverage and struggle to
get the medical care they need thanks to our state law makers refusal to
put, refusal to expand medicaid we are encouraging folks who can&#39;t
get coverage because of the medicaid gap to share their stories with us
at nc left me out dot org and for those who support bringing our tax
dollars home and closing the coverage gap to join us too. These stories
are important, because they shine a light on the  real people affected
and make the strongest case for why our legislators must act immediately
to close the medicaid gap, and finally we are renewing our plea for
lawmakers and the governor to stop putting politics ahead of people and
do what is right for the health of the citizens of our state and for our
economy by creating our own state program to cover people who fall in
the coverage gap and now I&#39;d like to introduce a man who needs
little introduction reverend Barber [Speaker changes] Good morning to
all of you who gathered four hundred and ninety nine thousand nine
hundred and ninety nine thats how many other people besides Dana our
friend and sister are being denied healthcare medicaid coverage I wanna
just state a few facts about why the forward together more movement is
glad to join with North Carolina left out why when we have our mass mall
march on February 14th for love and justice we believe that for in order
for the heart of North Carolina to be revived and recover one of the
major issues has to be the full acceptance of medicaid expansion and I
wanna talk about the North Carolina forward together mall movement
peoples grand jury that will be held on February 16th right here in the
journal assembly building the denial of medicaid expansion and the fight
to undermine the provisions of the affordable care act in some ways
represent a new civil war in this country 26 states the difference
though is that while many of the states have been denying medicaid
expansion 6 out of 10 african americans live in those states like North
Carolina in North Carolina 346,000 of the people being denied medicaid
expansion are white and only about a hundred and some odd thousand are
minority John Kasick a republican governor in Ohio has said that to deny
medicaid expansion is in fact to engage in war on the poor thats a
republican Teddy Roosevelt a republican 1910 1912 was the first to talk
about healthcare as a universal kind of provision so in a real sense
when senator Phil Berger who has been one of the major roadblocks in
this and last year speaker Thom Tillis and now we have wait to see what
house speaker tomorrow will do but we know that senator Burger
particularly is not even standing with the hallmark principles of his
own part that he claims which is why we continue to call them extremists
they talk about religion around this place and had some conversation
about it the first day well a scripture that is taken and accepted by
all of the great faiths from islam to Christianity to Judaism isaiha 10
says woe unto those who legislate wrong and rob the poor of their rights
I wish they would open our deep religious faith in this place every
great religion recognizes health and healthcare as a major factor in
determine whether or not ones faith is authentic out constitution
article 11 section 4 every member from be the hall to speaker more to
senator Phil berger they swore to uphold they placed their hand on the
bible article 11 section 4 says beneficent that means generous generous
provision for the poor

  <p id="15:00">
The unfortunate and the orphan is the first duty of a civilized and 
Christian state. Now those are not NAACP's words. Those are the words 
that every legislator in this place swears to uphold. That the first 
duty of a legislative body is how it cares for the poor, the 
unfortunate, and the orphan. Not the second, third or fourth, but 
first. And that the good of the whole, passing policies that lift 
up the good of the whole, is supposed to be primary. The North 
Carolina legislature , when they stopped and disallowed  Medicaid 
expansion – you all remember  the early debate didn't allow doctors 
to testify. They passed the bill in such a way that, even if the 
Governor wanted to expand it, the Governor couldn't, because it 
says that every decision has to come back through the General 
Assembly. So it is the General Assembly, it is Senate Pro Team 
Leader Berger that must be held accountable. And think about that. 
Senator Berger, Phil Berger, represents the 26th district. Includes 
part of Guilford County and Rockingham County. Well, when he blocks 
the Medicaid expansion, there are 26,935 people in Guilford County. 
Notice I did not say black or white, just people, North Carolinians 
in Guilford County, in his district, that would benefit from that by 
2017. And there would be almost 2 billion dollars in new business 
activity, if he would move to do what 24 other states have done. 
And what even Republican Governors are doing around this country. 
In Rockingham County 4,408 people would be covered. House Speaker 
Tim Moore, who's risen to this new position, needs to recognize that, 
if North Carolina would expand Medicaid in Cleveland county 4,856 
people in Cleveland County would be covered by 2017. More than 446 
jobs would be created, and nearly 200 million dollars in new business 
activity. So on, we join with North Carolina left out in this powerful 
website, this powerful launching detail of the story to put a face. 
This is not about the distortions, about broken systems, and what not. 
It is about our moral and constitutional focus in this house. It is 
about whether we're going to pass a  policy that is constitutionally 
consistent, morally defensible, and economically sane. And that's why 
we're having this People's Grand Jury. We're responsible. We don't 
have a judge. We do it right over in the new building. We don't have 
a prosecutor, we don't have witnesses, we don't have a jury of the 
people. We're going to invite members of both sides of the aisle to 
come and testify if they will. We're going to have doctors to come. 
We're going to have persons who are, some of them dying. Terminal 
with diseases that they could be treated for right now. We're going 
to have them and others to testify. We'll have a court reporter. 
We'll do a people's Grand Jury. We're going to look at the constitution, 
and whether or not the denial of Medicaid expansion is violating our 
deepest constitutional values. And we're going to look at wrongful 
death laws. Since Harvard's study says 2,800, another study says 
1,200, but the reality is, we know for every 500,000 people denied 
Medicaid expansion, people die. Is there a liability, when you know 
as a legislator, when you know it. When it's not from farce. When it's 
not some spooky fancy, but it is the truth. You know it. It can be 
empirically proven that you sign a law, or deny access to something, 
and people, citizens, human beings die. When your constitution says 
your first duty is supposed to be for the least of these. These are 
serious legal, constitutional, and moral question. Hospitals are 
suffering. 59,000 people in construction jobs would be, would have 
insurance right now, according to Families USA report. 56,000 in food 
service, 43,000 in cleaning and maintenance jobs, 34,000 in transportation 
jobs. And my friends, every legislator in here talks about how they 
love Veterans. How they love the people in our Armed Services. How we are, 
my brother-in-law.

  Speaker 1: is a former member of the army, brother (inaudible) in the
Navy, and we always talk about how we love our bases!  From Jacksonville
to Fayetteville, well Mr (inaudible) ...Governor, 23,000 according to
The Families USA report veterans are being denied access to medicaid
expansion.  It&#39;s time to put down the partisan talking points.
It&#39;s time stop playing Russian Roulette with people&#39;s lives and
it&#39;s time to do what is right, what is moral, what is constitutional
and what makes economic sense.
Speaker 2: Great.  Does anyone have any questions about the website?
Anyone, yes?
Speaker 3: You talk about Republicans in other states who favor
expansion and are in support of it.  Yesterday there were Republicans
and Democrats in this very room talking about supporting redistricting
together.  Why don&#39;t you have any Republican support for this
legislation in North Carolina, or do you and they&#39;re just not
showing up?
SPeaker 2: That&#39;s a very good question.
Speaker 1: I think if you listened recently to the Governor and his
efforts, when he went to D.C. and tried to broker some way to have an
entry to North Caroline coming up with a program, he has brought that
up.
I spoke with him earlier this week as well about the concept of getting
it done and he has indicated he&#39;s gonna try to do something.
We&#39;re here to make sure he has the help and the information and the
public support to get off the bench and get in the game and make it
happen in North Carolina so leadership on that side, people in power who
have the ability to make this happen as we said, the governor knows that
it needs to be done.
They know  that factually that we&#39;re talking about we want to make
sure the public knows and understands that goodwill on both sides,
people of goodwill, and people who can count .... 43,000 jobs, 23 or
24,000 veterans who don&#39;t have coverage, those kind of numbers that
have been proven ...people who can count, irrespectable of their party
who care about North Carolina, they&#39;ll stand up get off the bench
and get in the game and get this done.  And that&#39;s the call
we&#39;re making.
Speaker 4: I think that is confusing, especially whenever you say to
start with this was Teddy Roosevelt&#39;s idea and we&#39;ve heard the
government, the movement is that we believe that because of the movement
because of the pressure because now 60% almost all North
Carolinians&#39; said we aught to expand medicaid and what we say to the
government is just do it.  Don&#39;t try to find a way to opt out by
putting a job training requirement ...things that you know won&#39;t
work   when most people are already working; just expand it.  Just
expand it, don&#39;t play games with it, just expand it.
We know what&#39;s going on and what we hope is as you said yesterday,
you saw people in the same room.  The problem that often happens is
people can come in the same room but the details is what drives them out
of the room.  It&#39;s like yesterday on redistricting, we glad to see
that, but when we start talking about what kind of provisions are gonna
be put there to make sure there&#39;s not an (inaudible) representation
on that independent commission or what kind of section 5 coverage cause
some of the same people in the room talking about redistricting are also
against reinstating the voting rights acts.
So the problem I think Jim, is because people get stuck in this
extremism, this Tea Party extremism, and these talking points rather
than looking at people, (inaudible) has said ...Dana come here, this is
what we&#39;ll say ...Dana come here ...forget all this other stuff,
democrat, republican and look right here, look right here.  I dare them
to sit in the room with her and ten others like her and say I&#39;m not
going to expand medicaid.
That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to put is a human face on this real
human tragedy by not allowing the expansion of medicaid and we asked the
media to help us.  This is not about this back and forth democrat and
republican, not about left and right, this is about the moral center and
the constitutional center and what we aught to be doing.
Speaker 5: So you all talked a lot about the economic growth that would
happen from the medicaid expansion but time and time again Republican
leadership has said that they don&#39;t support medicaid expansion
because it would be unsustainable after the federal government pulled
its funding.  What is you all&#39;s response to that?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a

  <p id="25:00">
  Did you wanna? Okay. Well, we&#39;ve seen all across the country in the
states that have extended Medicaid that they have had very, a very good
economic impact. Jobs are being created, hospitals are staying open,
which is a good thing, and that people aren&#39;t having to travel past
hospitals that don&#39;t actually accept their insurance to be able to
die on the way to the next hospital. So we&#39;ve seen in states all
across the country, Republican and Democratic states, led states, that
it does have a good impact. And Medicaid&#39;s not the first program
that the federal and state governments partner on. It&#39;s basically
just a red herring argument. The federal government and the state
government have always had partnership programs like this. ?? is one of
them, Medicaid is one of them, food stamps, a lot of other programs, our
interstate highway system. It&#39;s interesting. The very next vote that
they took after the first Medicaid vote was about the interstate system,
so if they can rely on the interstate dollars, why can&#39;t they rely
on dollars coming to our state to help keep our citizens alive?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, we&#39;ve drilled down in their argument. Three years free. No
money. 100%, already there, if we don&#39;t use it it goes somewhere
else. It&#39;s the taxpayers&#39; money of North Carolina. Fourth year,
you pay, they pay 90%. If you want to opt out for a year, you can do
that, but we know four, three years 100% is gonna build the system and
strengthen the system and strengthen the economy. Our, and I can&#39;t
say Republican, I&#39;m just sorry because this is extreme stuff. The
same people that will, will pass unsustainable tax cuts that create a
deficit in state government budget to the point that they can&#39;t, you
can&#39;t even find money now to do infrastructure and roads and raise
education. Then turn around on the flip side when it comes to working
primarily, working poor people, and say we can&#39;t sustain 100% free
dollars that are already there is illogical. It does not compute. It
does not compute. As she said, these are red herring arguments, and, and
this whole business of racializing and class baiting when it comes to
what they call entitlement program when the fact of the matter is
Medicaid expansion will make economic sense, and it makes moral and
medical sense. That&#39;s, that&#39;s the answer to that, and if people
would get off those talking points and talk honestly. But extremists
have a great way of distorting the record, just like they do with, with
trickle down economics. No matter how many times Republicans say
it&#39;s voodoo economics, they keep using, and we believe that
we&#39;ve got to get past these distortions and get down to the truth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m Representative Bobbie Richardson, and I represent Franklin and
Nashtown. I was at a conference in Florida earlier in January, and it
was a women in government conference and I was speaking with one of the
Senators there, and she said that Arkansas made $70 million off of
expanding Medicaid. So we can look to states like Arkansas and Kentucky
and see that they are not being bankrupt, that they are benefiting. And
so we&#39;re losing our dollars to those states, tax dollars that North
Carolineans have paid. So we need to do some research and see how well
those states are doing that did expand. And I just wanted to add that
tidbit, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry, one more follow up. This is actually for Representative Hall.
Representative Hall, a few weeks ago you, you and Senator Blue offered
your caucuses&#39; support to Governor McCrory, and Governor McCrory has
said that he would, he has publicly said that he would ask the federal
government for a waiver on Medicaid expansion to require enrollees to
have a job or be in a job training program. Do, do you and this
coalition support that waiver?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, we support the concept of having some kind of program that will
allow the state to get Medicaid expansion as soon as possible. Again,
we&#39;re, we&#39;re really not wanting to engage in a bait and switch
game to make proposals that the federal government has already ruled
that they will not accept and repeating the efforts of other states who
had those same proposals turned down. So we are here to ask for a
sincere, legitimate effort to work within the confines and the framework
that&#39;s already out there that all these other states have been able

that we have even more intelligent people so we could certainly find a
way to get that done. And it's only a matter of will and leadership and
that's really where we are. We believe there should be something worked
out with the federal government as soon as possible. We don&#39;t think
this should be a political issue where we make token efforts to say we
want a waiver. And we know those conditions have our ?? by the federal
government for other states. It wouldn&#39;t be fair to the other
states. We need to do something that works for North Carolina and for
these folks who are here today and throughout North Carolina. And so, I
think the ?? is on us; not to play games with Washington, but to take
care of the citizens of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me separate this a little bit. Because it is important because our
movement is neither side of the aisle. In the ?? movement and with all
of our coalition partners from day one. We have said expand Medicaid.
Most of us here were for single payer universal. We compromised and we
supported Affordable Care Act. In the ?? of the government had failed.
Other states have tried it. We don&#39;t win the court in the movement.
Do not want to see the governor set up a situation where then says
whether it was Obama's fault. We know that game. That’s bait and switch.
In other words, you put something on the table that you know is going to
be denied, so that instead of you taking the blame in an election
season, you can then say “Well I tried to expand Medicaid,” period. It’s
already been done. It’s already working. We&#39;re already a year or so
behind. It was denied wrongly anyway without any real debate or focus in
2013. We say the governor should not have signed it because he would
have vetoed it anyways, to start with. He shouldn&#39;t have given away
his power. However, if the governor, and we say this emphatically, we
don’t care about party. Stands with the whole, maybe speaker because
he’s new I don’t know what his positions are, we’ll meet with him next
week. We’ll stand with him to just go ahead and expand Medicaid and
protect these 500,000 North Carolinians and the thousands of people’s
lives who could be saved if they had healthcare. That’s really the point
and some things we are not playing games with at all. Because we&#39;re
really playing games with people’s lives. This legislator we asked
before. They could have come back for a special session and in thirty
minutes done this. They could do it right now, they could do it today.
It doesn’t take all of this. They could do it today. Right now. Bam. Be
done. And Dana, Dana, Dana would have healthcare. And 499,999 other
people would as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does anyone else have questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok well thank you for coming and they’ll be available for interviews
after the press conference.
