  Some of this testing is being done in labs in other parts of the country
because they have these capabilities that we don&#39;t so we want to
make a big step in modernizing this lab then combine it with our food
and drug lab the pesticide lab and the standards lab that tests gasoline
and fuel oil. Our food lab is the only food lab in the state. If you
think back once again to it being built in 1977. How many people did we
have in North Carolina at that time? I&#39;m not exactly sure but I
would guess maybe half of what we&#39;ve got now. The food
establishments would be the same way. The food manufacturers and
establishments we actually inspect all manufactured foods facilities in
the state of North Carolina. Even down to Pepsi&#39;s Coke&#39;s
anything that is packaged in the state of North Carolina this food we
actually inspect and license these facilities. And it does involve
testing for pathogens we know could be harmful to the population.
I&#39;m proud to say this is only one of five state labs in the nation
that has been  ISO 17025 accredited to be able to do both chemical and
biological testing. And we lead the nation in the number of tests that
we do in this laboratory. Now what this says is I&#39;ve got the people
to do it. They have the expertise to do it but they need the technology
to be able to keep up with current demand and future demand. So this is
going to be a major initiative with us and top of that the food safety
modernization act is going to be implemented fairly quickly which will
be the most sweeping food safety program that we have seen in this
nation in thirty years maybe ever. So it&#39;s going to put even more
pressure on us to be able to do the things that we can do here in this
state to ensure a food supply but also ensure a safe food supply but
also ensure that the quantity of this food is available to the
population. So representative Dickson I know you can understand the
number of chickens and turkeys that are now in North Carolina as opposed
to 1972 and I think I know we have over eight hundred million chickens
and turkeys and these types of animals in North Carolina now. We had no
where near that back when the lab was built. We don&#39;t have the
statistics but we know the multiplication that has occurred on that
period of time. It&#39;s in the news right now there&#39;s a high path
outbreak of avian influenza in turkeys in both Minnesota and Missouri.
What this means is we in this department have got to be able to not only
respond to these kinds of things but we&#39;ve got to be proactive to
keep this out of here if we possibly can. These are high priority needs
for the department of agriculture and something I will be asking you for
your help with. We do have some budget priories in the department
I&#39;d like to talk about additional funding for the agriculture
development of farmland preservation trust fund. There&#39;s a reason
for this we led the nation a couple years in the disappearance of farms
in North Carolina. I talked about seventy eight billion dollars. Sooner
or later if we don&#39;t protect farmland in North Carolina we&#39;re
going to get to the point of diminishing returns. Now technology is
bringing yields up, up,up, up but if we don&#39;t have the natural
resources and human talent available we will reach diminishing returns
sooner or later in North Carolina. And this is not going to be good when
you consider the loss of the largest industry in the state so I&#39;m
asking for the ability to protect the farm and far slant in this state.
We&#39;ve been appropriated about one point eight million dollars over
the past couple of years. We did get an additional million dollars to
work with the military on protecting farmland around military bases in
North Carolina. So you bring two things into play, we all know that
there&#39;s going to be a reduction in bases and forces across the
nation. We don&#39;t want that to happen in North Carolina so being able
to help the military protect these bases is vitally important from
encroachment in North Carolina. But I look at states like Ohio,
Pennsylvania, New York they&#39;re investing big sums of money into
protecting farmland and the reason is they lost most of it before they
got started and they can ill afford to lose any more. It got to the
point in New York that the city of New York would not have potable
drinking water if they did not protect the farmland in the far northern
part of New York. So I&#39;m asking you to help us complete our mission
over time of protecting farmland in North Carolina and I tell people we
as the people of North Carolina need to have a better attitude

  ?? farmers and farms and forests. We need to review. You think about
farmland. You know, we know about agriculture production but it&#39;s
open space. It&#39;s also wildlife habitat, forestry, the forests
replenish the air in this state. There are so many things that we need
to look at in that regard that say, this needs to be a priority, not an
afterthought. So I&#39;m going to ask you to help me with that. We also
need some additional funding for the Division of Soil and Water
Conservation to enhance technical support for land owners and, in a lot
of different cases, we have a lot of animal agriculture in North
Carolina and we in agriculture want to make sure that we&#39;re doing
everything we can to make sure that you know, the environment is
protected, when we need to do it. But it does take technical assistance
so we need more there. I need additional staff in the Food and Drug
Protection Division to implement FISMA and I want to explain that to
you. The Federal Government&#39;s idea of the implementation of ?? Law,
particularly FISMA, is to go to the state, go to the farm, and if
they&#39;re not in compliance with the law, you know, hit them with a
hammer, shut them down, say when you&#39;ve got it done like we want it
done, we&#39;ll come back. And the thing is, this time it&#39;s going to
be you&#39;ve paid the Federal Government to come back to reinspect you
under the FISMA law. But that&#39;s not our way of doing business in
North Carolina. Our way is to first educate, and then regulate when we
have to. I want to be able to go to these farms, these food
manufacturing facilities and be able to educate them as what the law is
to help them be in compliance, so that they don&#39;t have this problem.
That is the idea that we are pushing through the National Association of
State Departments of Agriculture in negotiation with FDA over how
implementation will take place. So we&#39;re going to need some
additional staff to do this, if these changes do take place. The other
thing that&#39;s happened and I think I&#39;ve said it every year when
I&#39;ve been before this committee, the Department of Agriculture has
taken its fair share of cuts over the year. The last time we looked
back, our budget was probably comparable to our year 2000 budget.
That&#39;s been a long time. But the inflation costs to electricity and
utilities, gasoline, fuel oil, whatever it is, it&#39;s kept rising. So
we&#39;re going to need a little help, to be able to just you know, get
to the point where we&#39;re paying our bills and not having to rob
Peter to pay Paul. That can go on for so long. So that&#39;s another
major initiative. One thing that happened last year that we knew was
going to be problematic was we started having to charge for forestry
management fees, inter-department. We knew then that the level that was
set was going to be problematic. We&#39;ve gone through that process,
and we know it&#39;s going to be problematic. It&#39;s going to create a
budget hole in the forest service budget. And for you older members, I
want you to understand a little bit about the forest service. You see
the forest service and you think about well, they&#39;ve got to put out
forest fires. The truth of the matter is North Carolina leads the nation
in the ratio of exposed property to forests. And what this means is if
you get a forest fire, it&#39;s not always about just putting the fire
out in the forests. It&#39;s protecting the home owners and protecting
the businesses that lie in close proximity to these forest fires. And I
think back to 2011 when we had the major fire in Pender County. Had we
not stopped that fire at Highway 17, there were 17billion dollars worth
of exposure on the other side of 17. So how much is that worth? I think
it&#39;s worth making sure that we have the ability to stop these fires
and keep them in place. We are becoming a more ?? state but we&#39;re
still working with urban forestry programs, even in the cities. All of
these things are what the forest service is.  And it also is about the
reforestation of the state of North Carolina, where we do harvest
timber. You know, we want to plant those trees back. What we know is a
new growth forest is more environmentally friendly than an old growth
forest. Especially when you talk about the replenishment of air and you
start talking about the wildlife habitats, so replenishing these forests
for future generations is so, so important and that&#39;s what the
forest service is. If you&#39;ve heard the Governor speak at his State
of the State address, he talked about his initiative on food
manufacturing task force. And I&#39;m happy to say that I share that
enthusiasm with him over adding value to our agriculture products in
North Carolina. I think about the sweet potato dehydration plants that
are going in. I think about the sweet potato fry plants that we&#39;ve
got going in. I think about adding value
