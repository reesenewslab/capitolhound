water as a source.  Water was adopted, he reconsidered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Okay.  The gentleman from Catawba has to reconsider
the adoption of the conference report, Senate Bill 163.  The gentleman
has the floor to debate his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister Speaker, members, this bill was done in
cooperation with the staff of the administration.  The General Assembly
again worked with administration to get this bill through a conference
committee.  We have now had a request to revise the original conference
report after it was approved by this House.  That was beyond an eleventh
hour change but I ask that you support this reconsideration and we will
provide an additional conference report shortly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    For what purpose does the gentleman from
Cumberland, Representative Glazier rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    to see if the Representative would yield to a
question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Does the gentleman from Catawba yield to the
gentleman form Cumberland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  	Thank you Mister Speaker, thank you Representative.
I wonder if you could give us just a bit more detail I mean the bill was
a good bill, I think, and you had actually a lot of folks involved in
that I think a good process and so now there's a reconsideration could
you,  I’m going to  ask you a  double question.  Exactly what and who in
the agency’s asking you to, or us to reconsider and what's the provision
that they want reconsidered and why?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The provision, although staff nor I nor the
conference committee entirely agrees with this, there is a potential
gray area that would put this bill, as adopted in conflict with the
Clean Water Act.   Again, we don't agree with that but I ?? thinks there
may be an issue there and so where we've already added a belt to the
suspenders were now adding another set of suspenders.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   One last follow-up please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Does the gentleman form Catawba yield to an
additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    As opposed reconsidering and going back through the
conferences, is it your view that this is not a technical matter that
can be done through an amendment to correct or an additional bill?  Well
let me ask it this way.  Do you view this, if there is a need to change
it, do you view this as a substantive change or a technical change?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    I view it as more of a technical change, but staff
is saying that they’re not comfortable doing it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Thank you very much Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    For what purpose does the gentleman from Person,
Representative Wilkins rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  	Thank you Mister Speaker but I had a similar
question.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Further discussion. Further debate.  If not the
question before is the motion to reconsider the adoption of conference
report Senate Bill 163.  ?? favoring the motion will vote aye.  Those
opposed will vote no.  The clerk will open the vote.  The clerk will ??
the machine and record the vote.  84 having voted in the affirmative and
22 in the negative, the motion is adopted.  Conference report is back
before us.  I believe the gentleman from Catawba is going to make a
motion that the conference report be returned to the conference
committee.  Is that correct sir?   The gentleman is recognized for that
motion.  Does the gentleman desire further debate or discussion on that
motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    No further debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Further discussion. Further debate?  If not the
question before the House is the motion to, actually is there an
objection to the motion?  Hearing no without objection the conference
report will be returned to the conference committee.  The gentleman from
Catawba, Representative Wells is recognized to send forth a new
conference report.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    To the President, the Senate and the Speaker of the
House of Representatives ?? is appointed to resolve the difference
between the Senate and the House of Representatives on Senate bill  163,
a Bill to be entitled an act to designate reclaimed water as a source
water under certain conditions.  The ??is recommending the Senate and
the House of Representatives adopt this report.  ?? is for the Senate,

from a member of the first game of the year was that not a concurrent
because of the timing of when the game of the year and sometimes I think
you can actually improve the bill by the way it can if you don't like
many changes to it and this was soon as this was a situation where
concern for our members are not on those two commands that five of eight
million additional exploration and questions Representative Lionel
myself a mistake, and staff on the floor if necessary, otherwise the
commission of opinion that the correct five homers from even thinking

One has to do with the confidentiality of complaints of environment
violation by cultural operations unless the ?? has concluded the
violation has happened, it is critically problematic especially related
to hog operations where it is often known deficiency in ?? violation
issue so it is not clear how this situation would be down worth and it
doesn't deny resolution to the individuals who file the complaint and
actually the subjects of the complaint so if they had a complaint that's
fall against them.There is a problem about the other piece  about the
drainage districts proper of provision is another way back.?? all
protection?? so i would be encouraging to vote now.Thank you [SPEAKER
CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentlemen from Macklenberg
representative Brawley has [SPEAKER CHANGES] to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]gentlemen has forwarded the debate motion.[SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr speaker and members of the house. I was really
welcome when the finance committee on the question of the new licensing
board for the landscape contract. What having dug into it and as known
specific question, It is my opinion that the circumstances under which
one had to become a license landscape contractor are the same trigger
conditions where u did become the landscape contractor u would have to
become a general contractor, so anyone who is not already required to
become a general contractor will not be required to become a landscape
contractor under this regular troy board. Now we will have to watch the
regular troy creep because I would except to see a bill that it says to
be 20 thousand or fifteen or seven and we will need to block there. But
as this bill stands now it does no harm to people who are currently been
regulated and I will support this bill. It will be only objection of
what I found in the bill everything else is good work on the part of our
agricultural chairs and on our department and I urges supported the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentlemen form
Maclenberg represented Alexander as. Speaker of the bill gentlemen has
forwarded debate for the motion.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaking for all of
the farmers in my district and I find myself in the refreshing position
being in fully support of the comments from representative Brawley and
haven,t said in couple of committees where I has heard this measure and
what I had to see in Latin and tried to hear is. But?? is a good measure
we need to move ahead with it we need no to caught up in the sad weeds
about whether or not one licensing board is going to delay the whole
operation. I urge everybody to support and lets move on with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentlemen from Durham
representative luebke has[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the conference
report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen has forwarded the debate for the
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr speaker. Let me start and as I
did in the cultural committee how much I appreciated the chair dixson
and landen and brought the bill back before the agricultural committee
and I also chaired Howard who brought it when the bill was in financiers
today a lot of us debate in our parts of the bill and appreciated
ourselves very much. I have question about section 11 and I guess
whether representative Dixson has raise the question fro ?? what has to
do about 80 V vehicles being on land where the driver of the 80V vehicle
has been given permission by the owner of the land to drive on the land
to take the 80 V on the land and yet even with permission as I read
session 11 and even with permission if something happen on that land
because there is farmers that harvest the seed and walk there to harvest
the seed there is no liability on the part of the  land owner even if
the landowner has given the driver the 80V permission be there. SO there
is problematic, so I want to represent Dixson if he could discuss.</p>

Instead for something and it is not a public record unless you convicted
here it says in this bill unless the complaint result in a violation
finding a violation is a confidence of record this is where the
problematic from the standpoint of the public records public records are
to be able to tell us who file the complaint and i think that an other
reason why this real problem is with those two parts of the bill and was
support the rest of the bill are reluctantly revolting know on the the
conference report thank you [SPEAKER CHANGES]for what purpose the
gentleman from ?? represent the ?? gentleman ?? here for question
gentleman from the way gentleman from the way [SPEAKER CHANGES] my
questions goes back to the A TV ?? so if you give information and you
are open for also information you are protected this is how interpreted
[SPEAKER CHANGES] does the gentleman regret the question at this point
[SPEAKER CHANGES] i would just ask the gentleman to repeat the question
one more time [SPEAKER CHANGES] okay.If i am an landowner and  i give
information to ?? A TV or my property .Therefore what i assume to rescue
here that part cracked [SPEAKER CHANGES] Currently or under this

you gave some one permission you would have any liability .Then you
would for the common trespasser [SPEAKER CHANGES]so you stick with ??
asked his question[SPEAKER CHANGES]yes i would[SPEAKER CHANGES]the
gentleman from ?? the gentleman from ?? this question [SPEAKER

what liability do i sue in this bill[SPEAKER CHANGES] miss speaker i can
answer that [SPEAKER CHANGES] the gentleman has recognized to answer the
question [SPEAKER CHANGES]you would assume any additional responsibility
than you have now , don't we think that as the trespasser  i mean you
couldn't you couldn't string up and bob the wire net ?? own purpose with
the idea that i am gonna decapitate on A TV ?? but like i said if you
put it up across the road for an other farming purpose an someone came
along will still be treated as a trespasser  and that the deal for us
[SPEAKER CHANGES] for what purpose does the gentleman from Buckingham
represents the ?? the gentleman has forwarded to debate the conference
report [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you Mr speaker I rise in support of this
conference report i think among other thing it is a testimony to do
committee work  i serve at the agriculture committee and the finance
committee i have heard this bill ?? thoroughly twice and i was one of
those who came with a bit of open mind with some questions and concern
may be about particular portion of it that i hope that you will listen
to the morals of representative ?? from ?? the council said what i would
said and i am not gonna say at all over again but i did rather have
people that are concerned about the wises in board  to i agree that we
can ?? wises in board and have to ?? but if you listen to his comments
you would understand those that are doing the type of work would right
now general contractors license that they really should need ,now they
have a license instead to do that work for that amount of money the ??
you have.So i don't see a problem there i have also have heard some of
the other arguments that have been made representative Loki mentioned
his concerns about the public records law and i imagine that our ??
representative Dickson is gonna explain this again as he explained so
well in committee  and i totally agree that once during the bill you
cant UN ring the bell and the truth of the matter is that there can be
false and true accusations that are made perhaps intentional perhaps not
and it should not ?? the integrity  of those that are being accused if
they are in fact not guilty .So i think that it is consistent with the
idea that you are innocent to proving guilty not gonna bother with the
point that i do want to thank the bills passed thank they have done a
really good job i thank you for the opportunity that we did have the
bill in committee i thank our questions were answered in</p>

The first record lap, says Jennifer and represent them as a stand-up
demand that they got some tough stands as a sign that said that given
the end of the landscape that contract and the vices general contractor

(faint voices in the background)
I think that the provision there, protects somewhat the landowner and
that landowner who's been gracious enough to allow them on his property
needs that protection, so I really support the Conference Report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Glazier rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the Conference Report, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman has the floor to debate the Conference
Report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I'm actually rising
to support the Conference Report, but with one caveat, that I hope will
ask Representative Dixon a question and and I also want to commend him
on the process, not only the formal process but also the informal
process of lots of consultation.
On the first section of the bill, where the public records issue is
raised, I think it's really worth, worth I think noting that that is a
substantial difference in how it was originally drafted. This is a very
modified provision from what the original bill filed a long time ago
contained, and there are other issues to be addressed later on. But I
will say, because I do think that Representative Luebke raises the
legitimate point about public records, I think there's a flip side to
this, and that is, I think that there is the possibility and I hope that
it will be reviewed over the next year to see if it turns out to be true
that by holding the report when it comes in, but putting out the stick
if you will that if you don't resolve this and fix it and remediate it
and the department finds you're in violation that's going to be made
public, if publicity is what we're trying to avoid, it may create a
significant incentive to settle more quickly these cases, and get things
more resolved and remediated.
Now, if it doesn't have that affect, it may be worth revisiting this
provision, but I think that there's that incentive to getting actually
these problems resolved quicker and better for all parties. That remains
to be seen based on the will of the parties, but I think there's an
argument for that.
On the liability section, that troubles me the most. The argument
Representative Jackson made that it's ?? narrow??, I think is right. But
the argument that Representative Luebke and Harrison and I others have
made really is problematic, I think there's ways to fix this later on,
and that's going to get to my question, I don't think any of us wants or
intends this provision to be a circumstance, where you give the
permission to the person or a child to ride the ATV, and we think
everything's fine, and then three-months-later, not remembering we even
did that, we put up a barbed-wire fence for a different reason or do
something and simply don't tell the person who still has the permission
and then they're seriously injured or killed. I don't think any of are
intending that there be complete immunity in that circumstance. By the
same token, I think the general view here is we want to know, we want to
give people opportunity to access the property if they can, we just
don't want the normal liability that would follow for hitting a root, or
falling off or whatever it may be.
I think that there's a difference between a, a man placed that is
life-threatening on the property that the property owner knows about and
doesn't tell the person about versus all the other stuff. And so my
question, if Representative Dixon would yield, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Duplin yield to the gentleman
from Cumberland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dixon, I wonder, if given that
scenario, and I know that's not what you're intending to prevent,
whether you would agree that in the interim, this provision might be
looked at to be narrowed a little bit to make sure that when we deal
with man made life-threatening circumstances that that can somehow be
excluded or we can talk about language about that, because I think that
that is what people are really caring about. The other 99% of the cases
I think that this fits appropriately. Would you be willing to consider
to having a discussion coming back next session to try to narrow this
provision a bit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, Representative Glazier, I will do as I have
done in the past, try to communicate with you and others, I'd be more
than happy to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Representative Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Rowan,
Representative Warren, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, in support of the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The only, the only issue I had with this in committee
was the general contractor's requirement for landscaping and that has
been sufficiently addressed, regarding the issue that has just come up
with Representative Glazier has spoken about, the liability factor, I
agree with what he said and also with what Representative Lucas said I
think the intent behind this section is to...</p>

back to us and it's just like it was when it left the house when we
voted on it earlier. It passed eighty-one to twenty-nine overwhelming.
So, the bill is just as it was when it left here and went over to the

as you know, this was the bill that we had the lengthy debate, or not
lengthy debate, more of a lengthy explanation last week. The Senate
added a few things in that were new. Did not include a few things that
we had so we would like the House not to concur on this bill. We have,
we just need to make those changes, so, as I told the Speaker before, if
you love America, children, and small animals, you'll vote yes not to

children or America? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I believe you do love all
those things. The, there were about, I don't have the list with me. I
left it at the desk. There's about thirty-five changes as I recall from
the last camp. And there were a number of provisions that House members
asked for that were in there that weren't included and there were new
provisions. Entirely new provisions the Senate included, so in liu of
going through a lengthy explanation of that, which would be required, I
simply just ask the House not to concur and let us get a conference
committee together and work out the differences. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This, if you could just give me a minute. This
bill has about 26 individual provisions in it, the majority of the
provisions were requested by the Department of Revenue, and they are
truly technical. The 2 that were added is the, there were 2 provisions
that were added yesterday that, in the Finance Committee. 1 being the,
to delay the sunset for the tax credit for investing in renewable
energy, that from January 2016 it will extend any project that is
started before January 1 of 2016 with 5% expenditure will be eligible
for that tax credit, and it also extends the historic rehabilitation tax
credit from January 1 '15 to January 1 of '20, and does make some
modifications in establishing a lower value rate of credit based on
property value and the amount in location of the expenditures, Mr.
Speaker. And I'll be glad to go through all of the ??? provisions of the
bill, the Finance Committee did go through this Bill yesterday, and
there is a motion that we do concur. No, I apologize, that there is the
motion from the Finance Committee. Yes it is. Yes, that way was reduced
for, the bill came out of the Finance Committee, not with the unanimous
vote, but we did have the motion that would give it a favorable report.
Can we have the Finance Committee, Mr. Speaker? I will be glad to answer
any questions. Thank you.

Gentleman will be so recorded. House Committee, just a moment, we're
having a technology problem up here. Members I'm aware that there are
some amendments on the bill, are there any members who wish to debate
the bill prior to getting into the amendments? And the reason we need to
do it in that order, is that right now the Chair's computer, as well as
the clerk's, and a number of the other clerk's, computers are down as
far as the, some of the system here. So is there any further debate or
discussion? Seeing none, just kidding.</p>

What purpose does the gentlemen from Chawon, representative Steinberg
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You're my light. Okay I got it now thank you
very much. To debate the bill mr speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentlemen
has the floor to debate the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen
I rise this afternoon to speak on one particular section of this bill.
And that is the restoration of the historic tax credit. It was added
back in to this bill. This corrections bill yesterday in house finance.
And I'm delighted that it was done and I thank representative Louis for
taking that initiative and doing it. This historic tax credit without
question is the economic engine for many of our rural counties. And I
can speak in particular to one of the most historic regions of the state
without delighting any other portion of the state. but this is where
north Carolina began and our nation was born in North eastern North
Carolina. These tax credits have proven to be at a time when the economy
manufacturing has just about disappeared in that part of the state. One
of the things we have managed to keep going to generate jobs and a
significant number of jobs in growth and development has been as a
direction for the historic tax credit. I have been an advocate for this
forever. I don't think I have received any more mail on any issue at all
since I've been here last year than on this particular issue. People
want to see these tax credits retained. I have talked to a lot of my
colleagues in the house on both sides of the aisle and I think those of
us in rural areas in particular realize the importance of this to
continue the economy moving forward. Of the 100 counties in the state of
North Carolina, 90 counties have benefited in this historic tax grant so
think about that, credit rather. Think about that. 90 out of 100
counties have benefited from this. So this isn't anything that benefits
one particular part of the area. But rather it benefits each and every
part of the state. And we have several projects going under way right
now in our region. And many in the pipeline that are coming down the
road that will be impacted by this tax credit going away. Another thing
that I would like all of you to think about is that the department of
cultural resources if this bill is not pass this provision and this bill
is not retained, the department of cultural resources is gonna take a
significant hit in the number of people in their employ, this is within
the department itself. Who in fact are out there promoting one of the
biggest industries we have in our state. Which is travel and tourism.
This is critical. I know the folks in the other chamber are not big on
tax credits of any kind. But I ask each and everyone of you when
considering your vote on this bill to think about the implications of
not supporting it or rising to speak against it. This is something that
clearly every county in our state can benefit from. And so I would
encourage you to join me in supporting this effort. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Member's we're gonna go at ease for a few moments. The clerk
informs me that she needs to, that we need to do a complete reset and
that would also kill the mic's. So the house will be at ease for just a
few moments while we go through this process. We have to go back to 1963
rules of where we're having to stand and do voice votes.</p>

of each location where the filming was done. This would be an excellent
tourism and economic development tool. What this would do to the film
business in North Carolina, it would bring us to what is called a lower
tier 1 rating. There are different tier ratings throughout the United
States for different states with different incentive programs. This
would bring us to the lower part of tier 1, which you have to have to be
competitive. If you're not in tier 1 bracket, then you're not
competitive at all. This would at least keep present film production in
place for one year. No we will not get anymore Iron Man 2. No we will
not get any more blockbuster films because we be at the lower of that
tier 1. But what it will do, it will ensure that our TV productions will
continue. And if you think about it, what is more important, if you're
looking at jobs, you will have more jobs through TV productions than you
will on film. Because films come, films go. But when you have a series
such as we did in Wilmington, with Dawson's Creek. And then One Tree
Hill that lasted six or eight years. That is steady, steady employment
for the film workers. And that's just those two productions in
Wilmington. This will also address the desire, once again to attract not
only more TV shows, but with more permanent crew base, capital
investment, and permanent employment base. Without totally walking away
from the TV and movie productions. While I respect everyone who is
working on the proposed budget, and I mean that both from the house and
the senate, the proposed ten million, six month grant program simply
will not work. It is the death penalty. It's not enough money to even
keep the current production for the three major film series that are in
Wilmington now, which include Under the Dome, and Sleepy Hollows excuse
me, it'll run out. Under the Dome for instance is already finished
production, they're left. They've left, they're waiting to see what we
do. If we don't do something that will get them to come back, their
gone. Most likely to Georgia. We're losing business now to Georgia.
We'll lose far more business to Georgia if we don't do the right thing.
I know that some of you are against incentives philosophically. And I
respect that. I know that some of you are against a film tax credit that
results in North Carolina giving a check to a company that is located
outside North Carolina. I respoect that. I know that some of you just
don't care about the film business, and I can respect that. But what I'm
asking you today is to put those personal feelings aside and look at
what is good for the people who live in the state of North Carolina. And
those people who work in North Carolina that do not want to have their
jobs lost. Do not want to have to move to Georgia or some place else to
work. Do not want to uproot their families and children from schools and
the communities where they live, to go find employment. Because if you
think these people are just going to go out and find another job, I'm
sorry you are incorrect. Because these are very specialized jobs that
these people do. And they will go to where the opportunities are if
they're not in North Carolina. And that can't help this state. I know
the question arises, well if we do this, where is the money going to
come from. One of the good things I say about this amendment, is that
fact that if you do this incentive program for one year while we do this
independent study to help us to determine how it's going to go permanent
when we come back in the long session. It's to give us, once again, I'm
very emotional about this and I'm trying to be overly emotional. All of
you know how passionate I am about this. I've never worked on anything
as hard in my life, as I have these film incentives. I called somebody
earlier, I was the county commissioner 16 years, chairman for 5. I've
never worked as hard all together for those 16 years as I have on these
film incentives. So please</p>

17 years ago from Tennessee he was on WECT in Wilmington, and he said,
and you'd see his children playing the yard he had a wife and two kids
at the time, 17 years later and he said that he moved here and he's been
steadily working 10 to 12 months a year since he got here in this
industry, and that, he would definitely have to move should the ??
program expire. And that was last year before ?? a year and a half away,
the expiration date. But you can turn out the lights folks I mean
really? the screen ?? the gate guard and the manager will be there for
security purposes, they've already slowed down planning in anticipation
of this deadline, they'll stop planning as soon as we fail to pass some
kind of decent support which the grant program has now mentioned is not
enough, and it is up front there, this is way after the fact, this is
not paid upfront, they have to spend the money, close the books, apply
for it, and the only time the tax people get involved is, all that's in
their books and ?? all these taxes are being collected all year and the
year and a half, whatever it is all that time so, cash flow might
actually be a positive thing one study said we made a dollar 52 in taxes
for every dollar that was in opposition to the study you heard about but
that was the economic study that was done, ?? this study was done
independently from the film industry or from the staff that's, not
including all the, the census data from the workers, and there were a
lot of workers that were not counted because of the companies and
contractors that were used so that nobody has a handle unless they go
out in the field and find these people and actually do the work. So
basically folks what we got here is a choice to reduce the program if
you will cut the program basically in half, you've stayed in it a year
doing independent study come back with a lot more information, more
fair, not one end of the spectrum or the other, and come back with a
chance to do something in the long session very meaningful for the
entire state now lets eliminate all incentives reduce corporate taxes to
zero whatever that is we'll have a chance to come back and do it on a
logical basis so let's don't fail to consider everything, let's don't
fail to pass something that's gonna continue these 4000 jobs thank you.

amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentlemen has the floor to debate the
amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker you listened, sit
here listened, I think most of you understand, those of you in finance
know what my position is on this, but I say Representative Owler talked
about studies being fair, let's talk about where the studies came from,
the first one I read was from our commerce department, said 300 jobs
were really created since 2005 and we spent 250 million dollars since
then on this credit, The other study was a reaction to the film tax
industry paid study from NC state and representative Milis could tell
you about that, it said we're losing money on this, I'm not sure, I know
which one wasn't independent  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, I'll yield for everything.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] from what
purpose does the lady from New Henev Representative Hamilton rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask my good friend representative Haeger a
question.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker
representative Haeger do you know how much money the film industry has
spent in north Carolina in the past first 6 months of 2014? These
numbers are being reported by our very own NC department of commerce
[SPEAKER CHANGES] representative Hameson I know which ?? my taxpayers in
north Carolina 60 to 80 million dollars a year that's what I do know, I
know that other industries have spent a lot more I know the opportunity
cost is never being considered so that number is really not that
important when you look at what we spent and what other folks have spent
we could say lets give a twenty five percent tax credit to the build
industry in North Carolina it wouldn't matter still is the wrong thing
to do  [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Mr. Speaker  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
gentlemen yield to additional questions?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. speaker
I yield
to all questions.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] he yields  [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank
you. Representative Haeger I'll answer the question for you in 2013 the
industry spent over 360 million dollars in north Carolina and were
returned in a rebate
61 million dollars, this year so far in the first six months the
industry has spent 268 million dollars in the state. It looks as if we

Is this an inquiry? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair, the Chair will accept
the gentleman’s point. Would ask the lady to have a question mark on the
end of whatever the lady is saying. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I'd
like to be respective of my time also. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. I think I've made the point. [SPEAKER

Maryland, I've got up on my computer, if you guys want to see this.
House of Cards threatens to leave Maryland if they come up short on film
credits. Maryland film credit prior to this was seven point five million
dollars capped. They're arguing about taking it to about eleven or
eighteen million. We spend sixty million dollars. We spend two hundred
and fifty million in the last eight years. You know, the things that
I've heard are talked about that this is an important economic tool. You
know, the airlines, like NASCAR, the airlines and NASCAR get the same
type. Well, Representative ?? , they don't. They get what's called a
credit. This is a check written to them. This is only part I know we do.
We write a check out of our treasury to these folks that take it and go
somewhere else with. Now, again, like Representative Collins says, it
come, that comes out of all our pockets. Comes out of our constituents
pockets. Four thousand film workers, what Representative Dollar said. I
guess if we pay twenty-five percent of them, we just got a thousand new
state employees. So, should we  extend the health care to them? Maybe
that's next. Now guys, I'll tell you what we need to do with this forty
million dollars. Everybody in here has said that education is the number
one priority, right? Everybody shake your head yes or no. We've got
issues we've got to put in education. We've got twenty-four million
dollars in our budgets non-recurring next year out f the TA's. We need
to put that, that forty million dollars into there. Now you can vote to
put forty million dollars any where you want. But, my no vote on this
amendment will be to put forty million dollars back in education. You
can do what you want. You can sit there and say education's the most
important thing and you said education, everyone of you in here said ??
. I said that education is the best economic advantage we've got. It's
the best economic tool we have. We've got a chance to prove it today
guys. Put more money in education. Vote no on this amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Members, the Chair observes that there are two lights on. Those
two lights are Speaker Tillis who the Chair intends to call on next
unless another light comes on. And the additional light is
Representative Davis. The Chair would intend to take a vote at the
conclusion of both of those members speaking. If there are other members
that would like to debate the amendment, please turn on your light and
prepare to do so at this time. Otherwise, again, the Chair is going to
take the debate of Speaker Tillis and then concluding remarks by the
maker of the amendment, Representative Davis. Are there further members
wishing to debate or discuss the amendment other than those two members?
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative for,
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his
inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, are we going to have many more
bills today? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have plenty of good work to be done.
There will be, to answer the gentleman’s question, there are some
conference reports that may be added to today's calendar, depending, if
that can be done by consent to get those out of the way. And we're
trying to deal will bills as they come back from the Senate. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state an
additional inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Will you take that in
consideration as we move forward with those bills with the discussion
that we had on this one? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, it is the Chairs intent
to deal with this amendment. I believe there may be additional
amendments we will conclude, we will get all the amendments heard on
this bill, then we will allow the debate on this bill, the we will vote
on this bill that's before us. Hopefully second and third readings today
and then we'll move onto the other bills including any conference
reports that are added to the calendar. For what does the gentleman from
Rutherford, Representative Hager, desire additional debate on the
amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has
the floor for to debate the amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
As always, in my ADD activities, I forgot a point that I was wanting to
make. Forty million dollars, guys, at forty-five thousand dollars a
year, provides nine hundred teaching jobs. Forty million dollars at
thirty thousand dollars a year provides fourteen hundred TA jobs. Where
do you want to put your money? [SPEAKER CHANGES] And the clerk pointed
out to the Chair that because this is a role call bill that we will have
to have third reading sometime tomorrow anyway so we'll only be on for
second reading. The gentleman from Mecklenburg, Speaker Tillis, is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, it must be that time of year. The seat
mates are in disagreement with each other. The Speaker and the the
Speaker protempor are in disagreement with each other. It's, it's, we're
at a, we're actually having a debate that I first had back when I was
the minority whip and I was in finance and I was working with some of my
Republican colleagues and some of my Democratic colleagues who were

Goes to repealing the film tax incentive back in I think 2010 in finance
and we were successful with that. I, I actually am disappointed that we
didn't get to a point to where we could put together a program that,
that would take this political issue off of the table. I do firmly
believe that this is an important policy for us, and I will tell you, a
lot of people said referring to Hollywood, if you followed what the
California legislature has done to the film industry in California,
Hollywood is really the movie capital of the world in name only. Most of
the major productions are no longer occurring in California because
California has made it impossible for them to make the numbers work. If
you talk about Maryland, the reason that, that House of Cards would be
in Maryland has little to do with their film tax incentives, it has a
lot to do with the fact that they film on location in DC, so there's an
economic reason why they go there, even though the incentives may not be
as attractive. The biggest problem that I think we have with this film
industry is it's difficult to comprehend it as a project based industry.
The forty two hundred people who are employed in this state who support
the film industry don’t go to ABC company that manufactures widgets.
They're an industry that exists to support a continuous flow of projects
that come to this state. And they're able to go from project to project
to continue to be employed, to continue to buy homes, to continue to
bring folks here to vacation with their families, and to pay sales taxes
and a number of other things. I actually believe that if we do not
extend the film tax credit, you will see a secession of a lot of
productions in North Carolina. And then a year or so from now, you all
will come back and you will make the changes that other states have who
ultimately realize once it went away, it did have a negative economic
impact on their economy. Michigan is a good example, more recently.
Tennessee and Georgia are states that we look at to be more competitive,
in terms of our tax environment. A lot of our discussion about tax
reform is how can we be more like Tennessee, how could we be more like
Louisiana, how could we be more like Georgia. You know what they also
have in common? They have some of the most attractive frameworks for the
film industry. And they will get business that right now they're just
going to Wilmington, and by the way, Representative Jeter, I think your,
the Capital Police say your car is being towed. But, but we are putting
North Carolina's cities and towns on the map. It's not just about
Wilmington. It's about Nascar. It's about Cabarrus County. It's about,
it's about Charlotte. It's about Asheville. It’s about several different
locations across this state that have professional people working in
this industry twelve months out of the year with relatively good paying
jobs as well. So I for one think, I stand with Representative Davis in
the same way I stood with Representative McComas on this issue a couple
of years ago in this chamber. What I'd like to do is have our members
come back next year and get this right so it's no longer the political
football that it continues to be. But I think in the meantime, it would
be prudent to go ahead and extend the sunset, get to the work on a
framework that, that would be more like a JMAC or a JDIG or something
else that I think most of the member will be comfortable with. Some
members will never be comfortable with any of the incentives. I've never
been one who was completely for them or completely against them. But in
this particular case, I do believe it's something that deserves further
scrutiny, and that in the meantime, keeps it in place so that we keep
that industry in place, so that hopefully next year you all, the one
thing I'm certain of I won't be voting on it. You all will come back and
actually create a framework that's sustainable to continue to allow this
very attractive industry to be a part of this state. I hope you'll vote
for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash, Representative Collins
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To, to see if our Speaker would yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Mecklenburg yield to the gentleman from Nash? He
yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Speaker I heard you, I agree with a lot of what you said, but I
heard you mention that in trying to be like some of the other states,
like Louisiana and Georgia and so forth, somebody put something on my
desk the other day, and I do read these things, agree with them or not.
And it said that I believe it was Louisiana it was one of these states
you mentioned was increasing their film tax credit to forty percent. So
my question is, if we're gonna be competitive with these other states,
how high are we gonna have to go on this film credit in order to, in
order to stay competitive?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, I think it's an excellent question. I think one
thing that we need to do is rather than going on the internet or reading
the latest piece of paper that somebody sets on the desk, and I think
probably the arguments on both sides could be easily discredited, just
like the argument that suddenly if, if this film tax credit goes away
next year, we'd have forty million extra</p>

dollars for education, that’s a false assumption about the availability
that would come from that policy. I think what we need to do is put all
of the information on the table and get the industry here and get people
engaged looking at the state to figure out to what extent maybe we’re
being gamed by some of these productions but in many other cases
figuring out a more attractive, more competitive, more sustainable, way
to put together a film incentive program that makes sense.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Mecklenburg yield to the additional question ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? but I am only asking this question to make a statement. Are you aware
that the piece I mentioned that was put on my desk was put on my desk by
the most vociferous proponent of film credits in this chamber, not by
someone who is opposing the film credits?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, doesn’t matter to me, because what it really comes down to is that
we are, I think we’re making a decision like I have said to some of my
colleagues, my Republican colleagues, if this incentive, this is all
about responsibility in our votes. I believe if this incentive goes away
that you will see shrinkage, a contraction of this industry. You’ll take
responsibility for that, my guess is that creating this memorable moment
on the floor is that a year or so from know you’ll go, you know what we
probably went a little bit too far and if we’d taken the time to really
figure out how to do it in an orderly fashion we would have had
something between what currently exists and nothing at all, or some of
the credits that we’re trying to put in or that have been proposed in
the budget. I’m just saying a more orderly process vs. the all or
nothing process to me would be a better way to deal with this and
provide us a steadier less disruptive impact that’s likely to occur if
we make it clear to the industry that this incentive is going away for
good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Michaux
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to ask the speaker a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Mecklenburg yield to gentleman from Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’ll be the first time in my tenure I would be honored
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I appreciate you answering my question and I happen to agree with
you on the statement that you were making. My question comes to you as a
logistical question more than anything else, and let me set it up this
way, Mr. Speaker, if you don’t mind. The Senate is voting on the budget
this afternoon and will probably vote again in the morning. This bill
has to go back to the Senate, what do you think is gonna be the
situation tomorrow morning? Because I’m almost certain that they’re also
gonna vote on their adjournment motion also. What do you think the
chances of this bill are once it leaves here  ?? passes with this
amendment being taken care of in the Senate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, the Senate works in mysterious ways and I think
that the calendar does as well, I think the one thing that I’m certain
of, is unless we pass this amendment and send it to them, there no
vehicle to potentially work with the Senate to get a positive outcome,
so this failing today makes it impossible. This staying alive today
makes it possible and I’ll be working to try and make that possible,
should it pass.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from New Hanover, Representative Davis is recognized for
concluding debate on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In conclusion, I would just ask you to consider
what I am gonna say in making up your mind whether or not to vote for
this amendment. If we pass this amendment this is not a permanent
action, what we are doing if we pass this amendment is replacing a
proposed ten million, six month grant that will not work, and will be
the kiss of death to forty two hundred plus jobs and over fifteen
thousand part-time jobs. We’re replacing that with something that is a
one year extension that will allow an independent study to be done that
will assist this House and the Senate during the next long session to
come up with a viable permanent solution. I respectfully ask you to vote
for this amendment, pass the amendment, and lets send this to the
Senate, so we can work together to keep this tremendous economic engine
in North Carolina, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the House is the adoption of Amendment 1 sent forth

four, five by inserting between the lines the following language to

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Pender, Representative Millis has the floor to debate
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, thank you mister Speaker for the opportunity to explain this
amendment to you. And I want to explain the amendment first, and then
I'll speak about the reasons why this amendment, in light of your most
recent vote, using the same logic would actually be proper. What this
amendment does is, it allows for every taxpayer in North Carolina to be
able to get twenty five cents for every dollar that they spend in our
state. So whether you are a farmer, a builder, accountant, an attorney,
a trucker, a pharmacist, and even our newly created landscape
contractor, all citizens, all citizens can receive twenty five cents of
every dollar that they spend, and it is structured exactly like this
film tax credit that you all just passed was actually established. And
so I'm gonna preface my comments after explaining the amendment to say
I'm just using the logic that was just put forth. I'm not saying I agree
with the actual long term aspects, but I'll say this. Theory application
in history proves that a uniform tax code leads to greater prosperity
than anything else. And as a result, if it is prosperous for our state
to be able to receive economic gain from giving to one in terms of for
every dollar twenty five cents, then I say why not give it to all? If it
works for one industry in regard to spending, then why wouldn't it work
for agriculture for your farmer, whether a small farmer or a large
farmer? Why wouldn't it work for forestry? Why would it not work for any
other aspects that we all stand for today? If logically, if this returns
value to our state to do it for this previous amendment, then again
we're gonna need hip waiters for all the cream that we're gonna be
walking around next session if we pass this bill. So I humbly ask that
you support this measure to uniformly allow every citizen that you have
the privilege to represent to receive twenty five cents for every dollar
they spend in this state. I'm happy to answer any questions and I urge
your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Dollar
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there a physical note on this amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, the, the body will be at ease. The chair will inquire of the bill
jacket. Madam clerk, is there a fiscal note? There is not a fiscal note.
Does the gentleman wish to request a fiscal note?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would request a fiscal note as it impacts the 2014-2015 budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is the opinion of the chair that a fiscal note would be required in
this case, therefore a, therefore a fiscal note being asked, it is the
intention of the chair to rule that the amendment is ineligible. Does
the Pender, Representative Millis rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Dollar a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman from Pender?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, is it your understanding that just in the same
fashion that the previous amendment we voted on to extend the film tax
credit had zero economic impact on this year's budget and therefore zero
impact by way of the fiscal note because those monies aren't realized
until the next year, then therefore it's not necessary for me to have a
fiscal note for this measure as well because those monies are realized
at a later term. So, again, at the end of the day it just seems very out
of order whenever we know the end result for fiscal note to require such
whenever we're in the twelfth hour of the session and it's really
unnecessary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, to answer your, answer your question, there was a physical note on
the amendment that was prepared, so although your assumption may well be
correct, there is not, there has not been an actual physical note
prepared for this specific language of this amendment and that is what
the, that's what the requirement is. So physical research would need to
look at the particular language of, of your amendment and determine what
the fiscal impact would be, if any.</p>

Follow up mr speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentlemen from Wake
yield to an additional question from the gentlemen from ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you representative Dollar for that articulation. As a result its my
understanding this bill is gonna be heard for a third reading tomorrow.
If I'm able to approach fiscal staff to actually get a fiscal note to
say that it is zero just like the previous amendment would. Would you be
in favor of supporting this amendment tomorrow? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm
not making a commitment on whether or not I'm supporting the amendment.
What I'm stating is that the amendment requires a physical note. The
impact of that note, is in some respects, you get to that once you
actually get the note and see what it says. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Millis the chair would point out to the members that the
chair would not necessarily rule your amendment out of order. But the
chair would agree that the entire bill would have to be displaced until
fiscal note was run. However if the gentlemen would like to withdraw the
amendment and run the amendment tomorrow that might achieve the
gentleman's goals. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr speaker if that is able to be
realized. If I am able to run this amendment tomorrow. And it be ?? and
it be allowed I'm willing to withdraw. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I may not be in
the chair tomorrow but I do believe whoever will be in the chair
tomorrow, knowing that it will be on for third reading, the gentlemen
has properly filed the amendment and will be allowed to run this
amendment. Thanks.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]For
what purpose does the gentlemen from Richmond, representative Goodman
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiring the chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentlemen may state his inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you think we could
find out how many member would have to disqualify themselves because of
rule 27.1 on this amendment?[SPEAKER CHANGES] Maybe thats the drama for
tomorrow. Does the gentlemen now wish to withdraw his amendment at this
time?[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Mr Speaker [SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment
has been withdrawn. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate
on the bill? For what purpose does the gentlemen from Wake,
representative Stam rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentlemen has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen I don't know how I'll vote on the bill,
but since its now gonna head into oblivion. But maybe a point of jollity
might be in order since this is for the end of the session. We have the
same debate every session. I remember Bill Owens and Prior Gibson they
said these jaded things. And they said this thing may have a fiscal note
of 30 million dollars. But it pays for itself because it doesn't
actually go into effect unless people get the jobs. You know that
argument. So I prepare an amendment to double it. To expand the
limitations so that they're much less so that more people can get it.
And I said representative Owens, since your bill saves us so much money
can we save twice as much. And we said we cant afford that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentlemen from Nash, representative
Collins rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] See if representative Howard would yield
for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield for the gentlemen
from Nash? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you representative Howard. Representative Howard
there were added to this bill in finance. Would you summarize for us of
what the subjects for most of those amendments were? What the subject
was. It was the same subject for almost all of them. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. One of the amendments that passed today was to restore and
extend the historic tax credit for the meals and for the non income
producing properties. That was one of the amendments. Theres going to
be. Now that credit is scheduled to sunset 1.1.15 currently. But with
the amendment that may set out, I believe that would move it out to, let
me find my sheet. That would move it out to January 1, 2020. The cost of
doing that, Its going to be about 10 million dollars in the year 1516. 1
11 million dollars in 1617, 12 million dollars in 1718. And another 12
million dollars in 1819.</p>

[SPEAKER] Jackson, Chair. Senator Rucho, Barringer, and Apodaca.
Conference of the House of Representatives. Representative Daughtry,
Chair. Representative Stam, Faircloth, Davis, Heinz and Murray.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen the Chair understands that the
rules Chair is confirmed with the manardo either Representative Larry
Hall and that there does not appear to be objection. However the chair
will allow any member to raise an objection without of objections,
Senate Bill 648 will be added to todays calendar. Is there objection?
So, Senate bill 648 article read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To the President and the Speaker of the House of
Representatives. The Conference is a part, to resolve the differences
between the Senate and the House of Representatives, on Senate Bill 648
the Bill of Tideland to create transparency. The Conference
Representatives and the House of Representative and Daughtry's report
concretes for the Senates.
Senator Jackson, Chair. Senator Rucho, Barringer, and Apodaca.
Conference of the House of Representatives. Representative Daughtry,
Chair. Representative Stam, Faircloth, Davis, Heinz and Murray.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Daughtry's is recognized for a motion
and to debate that motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker I'm willing concur in the
conference report most of the provision in this conference report you
have heard on this floor on many occasions. What I've a essential
liability. I would call, if the speaker would allow me, to call
Representative Shaffer to explain that part of the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry Representative Daughtry please restate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you don't mind calling on Representative Shaffer to
respond regarding on the essential liability part of the conference
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Shaffer is recognized to debate the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. The particular provision that
Representative Daughtry's referring to occurs in part 8 of the bill that
limits successor asbestosis limited liability. This is a very narrow
provision. A pro business provision that really focuses on companies
that acquired other companies that were engaged in the abestess
production prior to 1972 when OSHA put out their regulation that
asbestosis production was unlawful.
What has happened in these very narrow context's that you have companies
that have acquired these asbestosis producing companies through these
acquisitions and mergers and then the acquiring company is required to..
their held liable for the asbestosis production that they never engaged
in. So what this particular provision does is, that it limits their
liability too, and caps it at the fair market value of the gross assets
of the transferring company. The time of the transfer ?? fair market
value so its upward adjusted to reflect inflation. A very important
point about this is that it's for perspective claims only the effective
date is about six months so it gives plaintiffs and plaintiffs attorneys
the opportunity to file claims over the next six months if they feel
that is appropriate but at the point in time it would limit that
liability and offer these companies who never in their history engaged
in that kind of production. This has been a bipartisan effort across the
country.Twenty one other states have similar legislation so we would
like to join our neighbor to the south and South Carolina has done the
same thing in this pro business piece of legislation. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Daughtry's recognized to debate the
motion a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Theres another provision that is in here regarding
exclusive forum.This comes really basically out of Delaware. It is
simply said that the venue for litigation corporations for the internal
affairs of the corporation shall be whatever the corporation decides. In
most cases it would be North Carolina, would be the venue.
Another provision in this tort reform has to do with patent controls
that Representative Murray has been involved in for a long time. We
debated  that on the floor. I think twice already, if anybody has any
questions regarding that. I think Representative Murray would be happy
to answer those questions.
And the last part of it has to do with transparency, with the attorney
general and private contracts. With private attorney contracts with
private attorneys it simply limits the contingency fees that can be
charged by the attorney general.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don’t know what I’m going to do on the motion,
but I do want to speak to one provision. I think it’s sort of important
to get the full flavor of the discussion. This is one we had, those were
on Judiciary B might remember this was part of Representative Jordan’s
bill where there was a provision that we dealt with. This asbestosis
provision, for what it’s worth, and just so we’re clear about, isn’t
quite as clean and clear as it’s made out to be. This is the Crown Cork
provision, as I recall. I think. Let me, Mr. Speaker, if I could, before
I make my argument, in case I’m wrong, if I could ask Representative
Schaffer a quick question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Schaffer, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative. Am I right that this
is the Crown Cork provision, essentially?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. This is related to their particular situation and it was
specifically requested that we make it narrow enough that it wasn’t
opening the gate to other liability caps.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Now to speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The issue on this is
in...and I think there’s arguments both ways, but Crown Cork bought out
this company that had significant asbestos liability. Whether Crown Cork
knew, didn’t know, hard to know, but there’s certainly ongoing
litigation and ongoing plaintiffs involved here. This is an attempt to
have some outside limit of liability that Crown Cork is doing across the
country. In a sense, they really don’t much care about North Carolina,
because we don’t have that many cases relative. Where they really care
is Ohio and Pennsylvania and West Virginia. This is setting it up so
they can make the same argument in other states, and I understand that.
They may have some argument. An argument is that there has to be some
outside repose, and we remember the repose issue because we dealt with
it from the Supreme Court Decision relating to Asheville and to
Jacksonville. There has to be some outside repose, and I think this is
an attempt to sort of get at this. But this argument that Crown Cork has
made in Judiciary B and they were called on by Representative Michaux
and by myself and there were several others on both parties, is this
argument that they overtook this company in the 60s and 70s and didn’t
know at the time about the asbestosis. OSHA hadn’t been formed and it
wasn’t a clear disease is just blatantly false. It’s false because North
Carolina in 1935 in our statute, recognized asbestosis as an
occupational disease. Regardless of what they knew or didn’t know as it
related to other states in the nation, for thirty years prior to the
time they assumed the liabilities here, we knew about it and we called
it what it was. Let’s just be clear that if we’re cutting off repose,
and we may choose as a policy argument to do that, but if we are, we
ought not be doing it because this company didn’t know that there were
really deep seated healthcare issues here and didn’t know that it was a
legal liability. Now, how you view where the repose should be after that
is a different story, but I didn’t want it to go on the floor without
being said that we are going to be cutting off plaintiffs here who are
ill and dying. That’s what we’re doing and we’re doing it for a company
that bought the company that had all the liability thirty years after
North Carolina determined that asbestosis was an occupational hazard.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose. .
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Representative Glazier yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, since this bill is not retroactive, they still
have another five months to file claims, did I miss something in
Judiciary B, didn’t you somewhat agree publicly that sixty years was
long enough for people to file their claims?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, that’s why I didn’t say I didn’t know how I was
going to vote on this. I don’t know where the good policy decision is
there and I think there’s an argument by the Crown Court folks that at
some point you have to cut it off. I didn’t know...</p>

that’s one of the most conservative precincts in the county. He did that
and when the total results came it, we discovered the biggest turnout of
Republicans that county had ever had.
Jerry was an undergraduate when I met him. He was a law school student
when he ran for town council in 1973. Charlie Dean, I think, was his
campaign manager, or worked on his campaign. Charlie Dean was Howard
Dean’s brother and we lost him in the Vietnam war, but he was also a
wonderful, well known, part of the Chapel Hill mix in those days. Jerry
beat Alexander Julian, for his seat on the Town Council and he
became...had such a special interest in transit even in those early
days, public transportation and transit. He was a key figure in helping
Howard Lee establish the Chapel Hill transit, the bus company in Chapel
Hill transit. You may know that that’s now a free service. The town and
the university in Carboro contribute to that and it transports students
and faculty and community members all over the community. One of
his...when he joined the North Carolina, he came to interview for the
job with the General Assembly, and on the last day the application was
open, he wowed the interview team and was given the job. One of his
favorite bills that he worked on was establishing light rail in
Charlotte, which followed up on his love of transportation.
I always refer to him, he knows everything about the General Assembly. I
always send people to him for advice and I always go to him first for
advice and I think I’m going to continue doing that. I’ve got his phone
number and he’s on Twitter and Facebook so we can keep in touch with
him. I know that he’s not going...he’s been a politician and an activist
since I’ve known him and I’m sure that he will continue to be a part of
our lives in the future. Thanks a lot Jerry. I still have your campaign
button from 1973.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, if you have any of those pictures of Jerry during his activist
days, please post them on Twitter. Representative Dollar, please state
your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Mr. Speaker, if you’re around town as I have been in politics for
a number of years, even before I got to the General Assembly. You heard
about Cohen. You heard this name, this sort of legend. As a Republican
coming in ten years ago, I wasn’t quite sure what to make of Jerry. Here
was somebody as has been mentioned, was elected councilor in Chapel Hill
and for most Republicans, it’s sort of a verboten thing and what to make
of this guy. But then I found out something I didn’t know. I didn’t know
he was a Hurricanes fan. You can’t be all bad if you’re a Hurricanes fan
and he’s a very strong Hurricanes fan. And then you find out more about
him, you find out about the man himself. It was interesting for me, I
remember several occasions, but one in particular, I had a bill that was
important to me, probably had no chance of passing. Jerry, I’m sure,
knew it had no chance of passing, but in working with him on that bill,
he treated it just as if it was the most important…</p>

[??] Bill that would come before the General Assembly working through
questions, asking me probing things, helping me think through a lot of
stuff, relying on his, as already has been mentioned,  his tremendous
command of history. I know Representative Stam knows history in the
1600’s or 1700’s, well Jerry knows history of about every legislative
bill that has ever been in the General Assembly. I mean, you ask him
some area and he’d say well in 82’ they tried this and in 94’ they did
that. It’s a knowledge base that will never be replaced in this body and
will sorely be missed. Jerry, you moved through the stages, first you
established yourself years ago as being knowledgeable, then you became
an expert, then you became the go to person, then you  became a wise
man, then you became a sage and then I think you established oracle
status. So certainly, I think on behalf of all the members [??] that has
been said, your knowledge, your wisdom and your caring concern for this
institution will be sorely missed and thank you so much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I also would like to request the attendance of staff in case there may
be any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will allow staff on the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett yield an inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett my inquiry is, does Representative Jerry have any
comments on these particular issues here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker I feel I must yield to the staff for this question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With out objection. The 121st member has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Torbett, Mr. Jordan, Mr. Majority Leader, thank you so much for
honoring me today. It’s real pleasure to have a chance to finally make a
speech in the house after 37 years. I've bitten through several tongues
during that time. I really appreciate it, it’s really been a honor and a
pleasure to work with people, learning the institution, I've always been
interested in the legislative process, even when I ran through a 6 year
period of being an elected official, gave me training when to know, when
to shut up and learned from your mistakes, learn when to speak and not
speak. I've tried to of been a resource for everyone and I really
appreciate the very kind words from everyone and the chance to be with
you. I recently dug out, Mickey was making a reference to that, a letter
I wrote to Mickey and the 73’ Session in his first chamber complaining
about some bill I think he sponsored and he sent me back a very nice
full page letter that said nothing. I have deep respect for Mr. Michaux
and the other 119 members who really enjoyed working with. Today is my
last day and that doesn’t mean I’ll never be around here again but I
plan to take some time off and travel and do nothing. I told me wife do
not wake me tomorrow, I’m not sure how long that will last. Thank you
very much. Have I answered your question Mr. Jordan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, since I’m pretty sure that violated some rule, I
would also like the houses indulgence as you remember the rules have
changed and only members may serve in chair as Speaker, we can suspend
the rules to allow Jerry to adjourn today. It seems only fitting that</p>

Early activists would come up here in violation of the rules to chair,
so unless there's someone who would object to that and require us to
vote to suspend the rules, Representative Hollo.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Speaker, let the record show mister Gerry Cohen's service to the
institution as a requisite before he would achieve such honor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then the chair assumes that there will be no objection and, and, and
Gerry will be doing the adjournment today. Representative Daughtry,
please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not sure it violates the rules. When I first got up here I was in
the Senate and I had been here about a week, and there was a bill
regarding the redistricting of the county commission in my county. I
went to Senator Henson Barnes and said I don't know a lot about this. He
said well go see Senator Cohen. And I looked in the book for about two
hours trying to find Senator Cohen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
