[change speaker]
thank you mr. speaker, members this is the unanimous recommendation of
the legislative ethics committee from the end of last session and it was
unanimously set forward because, six things most of them technical in
nature, but it clarifies that the LEC can receive complaints directly,
complaints don't just have to go to the state ethics commission, second,
that a legislature who has the subject of a complaint should be notified
immediately when that occurs, third, it creates a time table for
response for that legislature, fourth, it extends the time that the LEC
has to make a decision on that, where they need more time to investigate
and finally it specifies that the LEC can issue a private admonishment
without holding a hearing, which would obviously would circumvent the
real reason for the privacy of the admonishment. I know of no objection
to the bill and would ask everyone to support house bill 172, thank you.

of domestic violence and parties to high conflict custody cases, so that
in fact a party who has custody of a child can transfer custody to the
other parent, but do so under supervision so that arguments or fights or
physical violence doesn't break out and harm the child as well as the
relationship that's there in front of the child. This has been extremely
successful, and so successful that there is an expanded need for the
program in Cumberland. It's funded primarily by grants, and part of the
grant requirements is that there be some sliding scale of fees to help
support the program. We initially, when we authorized it in this General
Assembly in 2003, set a $30 fee by the participants. That is no longer
sufficient to cover costs, and so they're asking for authority to move
up to $50 per case, as they need to in order to cover fees. There is no
opposition to the bill. It's a full delegation bill. Passed Judiciary C
7 to 1, and then passed unanimously.</p>

explained. I'm searching through the bill but I could ask you instead of
trying to read the whole thing.
[speaker changes]
Yes, there is specific criteria that criteria begins at the top of page
2 and the criteria for personal care services must be the same whether
the individual is in a institutional setting, a facility setting or in
another setting which would presumably be in-home. Federal law requires
us to have comparability across settings so that there is no

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  Members, this is a bill being brought
to you by Representative Stam, and myself, and Representative Jackson.
Originally, the bill was biological evidence preservation study, which
has now been rendered not needed.  And, this is now being used to fix a
problem that has occurred with a Court of Appeals case.  Putting it very
briefly, when a winning party wins in court, there is a statute that was
passed as a result of a joint House and Senate task force--or joint
House task force several years ago.  It says the winning party gets
certain costs if the Court orders them, from the losing party. And, it
tried to define those costs in a way that kept it narrow and reduced the
cost of litigation.  One of those deals with an expert witness'
deposition and it says that the deponent's cost for traveling to the
deposition- [end of data...]</p>

<p id="055:00">
During the deposition should be taxed to the losing party with nothing
else. That was agreed on by both the Plaintiff’s Bar and the Defense
Bar. Court of Appeals unfortunately in a ruling recently what enabled to
read that intent correctly to read from the statute.  And so this goes
back and says yet again, we sort of meant what we said last time, and
that is when a losing party is taxed cost for a deposition, they can
only be taxed the cost of the experts time in court when he’s testifying
or she’s testifying, traveling to court can’t be taxed the cost of days
of sitting and watching the proceedings.  It’s a way to reduce the costs
of court.  I know of no opposition to this fix and think it is
absolutely faithful to what this House I believe unanimously did several
years ago. And I commend the bill to you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  The purpose of the bill is to streamline
certain procedures of the bail bond industry.  There are three main
provisions of this bill. Section 1 would allow professional bondsmen to
sign for cash bonds. Section 2 would require assuridy to provide either
a copy of a bail bond, forfeiture, or release order when surrendering a
defendant.  The rest of the bill removes requirements for a clerk of
court to serve a motion of release.  This eliminates a redundancy
because the assurity already assures the motion of release.  The
Department of Insurance which regulates the bail bond industry is okay
with the bill. I’m not aware of any opposition and I’d appreciate your
support.

General Gov. Appropriations 8:30 meetings every day of the week.  It
came to my attention during those sessions last year, that the state
auditor in the course of her due diligence would present this body with
information that could lead to effectiveness and efficiencies in state
and government. That there was no actual way to take action. There was
no end. She would present it, but there was no official, where does it
go from there? And so what I thought we would do.</p>

...is trying to figure out a way that these could be disposed of. And if
you will read the bill, it tells you simply that the method for
disposition is that the Senate and House Appropriations subcommittees
will meet jointly within 90 days, either to take action or to decide not
to take action on reports coming from the State Auditor's office.
That's pretty much the gist of it; I'm available for any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Clerk: Representative Torbett moves to amend the bill on page 1, lines
through 12 and 13 by deleting the sentence which begins...
Rep. Torbett: Thank you. I think you all have that on your screens now.
It simply was brought to my attention that we might be in, that the
person who wrote the draft might be trying to micromanage just a bit, so
if you refer to line 10, we took out the language referencing how the
meetings will be convened and how we will oversee that; that's just
normal circumstance, so that was removed.
At the end of line 10, the Senate Chair down to the end of line 12 is
now stricken, and then add three words, &quot;an agency response&quot;
on line 13, after it says &quot;Auditor's report.&quot; They felt that
they would want an opportunity to be mentioned in the legislation that
upon receipt of the Auditor's report, we'd also like to hear from the
agency on their response, to give us some more information. So that was
added, and that's the extent of my remarks.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Rep. Hanes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the Chamber, this bill is filed on behalf of the UNC School
of the Arts. It's a straightforward bill that would allow the School of
the Arts to make pyrotechnical in any applicable performances. Currently
they cannot use pyrotechnics in this way due to language in existing law
limiting such use on state and university properties. This bill amends
that language to allow such use in buildings owned by the UNC School of
the Arts. I'd like to thank the Department of Insurance for their
assistance in helping us draft this new language and to Representative
Starnes for shepherding that relationship.
I commend the bill to you for your consideration.

[Speaker Changes] Rep Martin  is recognized to explain the amendment
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Speaker. This amendment clarifies that
our intent is not to go out and ask them to report more data on how we
eliminate data. And there was some phrasing in there that DPI was
concerned about. When we asked them to give some follow up information
that they were infact collect more data from school administrators. This
clears up the intention that as they move forward with potentially a new
IT project that will collect a lot of this data and that we got some
reasonable update on how we are progressing  without asking for more
data. So I commend the bill to you and ask for your support

[Speaker Changes] Mr Speaker
[Speaker Changes] Rep Charles Graham
[Speaker Changes] I would like to be recorded as Voting aye on house
bill 639. I wasn’t in my seat.
[Speaker Changes] So ordered. House bill 872. The clerk will read.
[Speaker Changes] House bill 872, the bill to entitle an  act taking
taking the right to work by making unenforceful and unfair trade
practice for any contract to require a contarctor or a sub contractor to
use unionized labor. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Murray is recognized
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Speaker House bill 872 protects North
Carolina’s right to work statute and makes it unenforceable unfair trade
practice for any contract that require contractor or a sub contractor to
use unionized labor. You see the provision in the bill. It’s very simply
laid out. It deals with business to business transactions and making
sure that one business can’t require another business to use unionized
labor to further protect their right to work status in North Carolina.
The genesis of this legislation was that Rep Sam and I have a colleague
that tried to get on some work the major contract wiuld not allow the
sub contract to be let because they didn’t hire a unionized labor and by
doing so would have increased that sub contractor’s cost by 25% so we
lost that contract. That was the genesis of this legislation and I would
ask your support. Thank you Mr Speaker
[Speaker Changes] Rep Paul is recognized
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill
[Speaker Changes] Recognized to speak on the bill
[Speaker Changes] My opposition to this bill is that the law that we are
about to pass is already covered by Federal legislation. The National
labor relation act already includes contracts that require only union
workers. And under this supplemental clause of the U.S Constitution the
federal law obviously supersedes state law. More specifically a state
like North Carolina can’t attempt to regulate contract. That’s already
regulated by the Federal law.  The committee yesterday we had a chance
twice  to ask our own legal staff if this legislation is required and
both times they came back with the answer they weren’t sure. So I am
sure a lot of members were thinking so what’s the big deal by passing a
law that’s already a law. But I think we should be careful as a body.</p>

<p id="075:00">
We should be careful as lawmakers of passing unenforceable laws.
Particularly ones that our own legal staff have already advised could be
preempted by the National Labor Relations Act and thus, unconstitutional
under the supremacy clause. One likely result would be that Attorney
General Cooper would again have to defend these cases and spend
thousands of dollars to do so.
Our last session, there were seven bills out of this body that were
litigated and of those seven that were litigated, all of them were
overturned in part or in full. So that defense cost us a lot of money
last year to defend the ones that we warned ahead of time or some people
warned may be unconstitutional. So regardless of how the members feel
about the intent of this bill, the intent of the legislation, I would
urge us not to continue voting for things that could be
unconstitutional, that is preempted and could be expensive to defend.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Glazier is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, very much, Mr. Speaker. I want to go into a
little bit more detail and explain why I'll be voting no on this bill
and follow exactly the point, the legal point, which I think is
precisely correct, that Representative Hall just made. Those of you who
know me know that I don't get up on the floor and talk about things that
I believe to be unconstitutional unless I really do believe that there's
a constitutional issue. In Article 4, Section 2, of the Constitution is
the supremacy clause. And that supremacy clause has come to mean at
least, that the national government in exercising the powers enumerated
in the Constitution have to prevail over any inconsistent or conflicting
State exercise of power. And it's come to be known to enforce this
provision as Federal law preemption. Preemption can be either expressed
by Congress or implied. When Congress chooses to expressly...
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] ...preempt to State law, the only question becomes
determining whether the State law is one that Federal law is intended to
preempt.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Brawley, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ask Representative Glazier a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does Representative Glazier yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Glazier, I'm just an insurance agent,
not an attorney, but I keep hearing this debate that Federal law says
you cannot require the employee be a member of the union. Is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Brawley, what I'm going to try to do is
answer your question in more detail. In that what Federal law says is
that it has legislated through the National Labor Relations Act and
State law cannot interfere with the contractual relationship about what
private contractors or contractors get involved in about who they can
and can't hire. And so whether we think that's a good policy or not, the
National Labor Relations Act has spoke to it and has preempted the field
and in fact, as I'll cite to you, several court decisions make very
clear that the exact issue we're about to pass a law on has been almost
identically struck down in three other places and in my view is
fundamentally preempted by Federal law. So the issue isn't one of
policy. The issue is whether we have any authority to legislate this and
my answer, and I think most labor lawyers' answers, and I've contacted
labor lawyers in Washington, as well as in Raleigh, and their answer is
this bill is preempted. And I'll explain why.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] If I might follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Do you yield, Representative Glazier?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To make sure I understood what you said, Federal law
says you cannot require that they be union contracts?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Federal law says that the issue of contracts between
the parties about what employees should and shouldn't be, that is we
want unionized, we want non-unionized, is a matter between the parties
and the State can't come in and create a law that says you can't do or
must do one or the other. Because that's what the NLRA is all about.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Last question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] You yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does not this bill simply say you can't demand that it
be one or the other?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Glazier, you're recognized to continue
your debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, very much. And as I was saying, the question
can be in preemption both something that Congress has specifically
stated or where they have so occupied the field that anything we do as
States simply not allowed. In the Labor Relations Law that we're
talking...</p>

<p id="080:00">
[Speaker Changes] The Supreme Court of the United States has come up
with two types of preemption. Both potentially are an issue here. One,
so that you know, is called Garmin Preemption, which protects the NLRA
boards authority and discretion to apply uniform system of laws and
remedies for the conduct that is prohibited by the labor relations act.
It is meant to be, and the court has construed it to be, a very broad
preemption doctrine. In state laws, the court is held, cannot regulate
activity that the NLRA protects, prohibits, or arguably protects of
prohibits. The other is what we call machinist preemption. That
preemption exists because the NLRA reflects a congressional policy that
certain conduct or speech is to be left unregulated and open to natural
economic forces and the parties contractual obligations. As those two
doctrines relate to the bill before us. This bill is  a broad band on
any agreement or contract that requires the unionization of contractors
or subcontractors who are employed to effectuate the terms of the
contract. These types of contracts that the bill is referring to are
called project labor agreements. PLA's. PLA's are often seen in the
construction industry. And House Bill 872 bands PLA's in all contracts:
construction, non-construction, government, private. As it relates to
government construction contracts, PLA's here have been a specific case
law. Is a more recent case actually last year out of Michigan, called
Michigan building versus Snyder. And there he court held that a statute
of Michigan legislature pass that banned PLA's and government contracts
violated the NRA and was preempted by the NLRA, the exact thing we're
trying to do here. Additionally, without going into more detail and it
explained in great detail the sections of the NLRA that are preemptive.
Aside from Michigan's, the laws that were passed similar to the one
we've got right before us in Iowa, Idaho, and Louisiana have been
challenged. All of these banned PLA's in government construction
contracts among other things. The Louisiana case is still in litigation.
The Idaho District Court held just like Michigan that the statue its
preemptive. And the issue in one other court at the Federal Level, the
United Sates Court Appeals for the District of Columbia has likewise
held that there are problem with PLA's in under state law. The second
issue that comes up is private contacts, not government construction
contracts. Here with regard to this issue, the Snyder Court again set
out very clearly, that the statute was preempted in part because it
effected the rights of private parties to repudiate PLA's or to
negotiate PLA's. So whether we think again, this is a good law or a bad
law, and I suppose there is some philosophical divide to some degree, is
relevant. The point is, its an illegal law. The courts have made it very
clear that we can't come down on either side of this issue. It is meant
and it is left to the national labor relations board and Federal Law to
control this. The only thing that will happen if we pass this law is we
will assure ourselves that we will immediately be in litigation by
somebody. And we will almost assuredly lose that litigation. And I don't
think thats a fair circumstance for the tax payers of this state. Nor
should it be as Representative Hall eloquently argued, something that we
ought to be doing.  At a minimum, if we are unsure about this, we at
least ought to send this back to committee and really ask for a more in
depth legal analysis, so that we know more deeply, I think, what the
effect is of what we're trying to do. All I can tell you is my speaking
to Federal Labor Lawyers in Washington, speaking to lawyers here, and
looking at the law myself as a former labor practitioner, and it is my
view that this statute is almost unambiguously going to be struct down
with preempted by Federal law. I would advice us either to remand this
as a committee, or to vote no on the bill. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Further discusion or debate? Representative Ross.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I'm not gonna reiterate
what Representative Hall or Representative Glazier have to say, but for
the freshman, i just want to remind you that every time that
Representative Glazier cautioned that we were going to lose a lawsuit
and spend tax dollars on that lawsuit last session, he was correct.
Every time. Please vote against the bill, save money.

<p id="090:00">
To make sure that early childhood education, that we break down those
silos and that the issues are addressed and under one umbrella.  And we
continue that effort by changing the Child Care Commission to the Early
Childhood Care and Education Commission so that they can oversee both of
those important tasks as it refers to childcare and the early childhood
education piece.  We not only want that quality childcare but we want
quality education as well.  That first piece addresses the childcare
board and the membership. Part two pertains to making the local
partnerships the sole contract administrator for the NC Pre-K Program.
They currently operate about half of the NC Pre-k programs in the state,
and this will put them as the sole administrative contract for the
state. The reason that is is in the other half of the contracts are
currently administered by the school system.  Right now the school
systems in those places are also providers. It’s been a concern of mine
that within being the provider and also the administrator of the
program, it’s somewhat of a conflict for them to be involved in
determining where the classrooms go when they’re having to choose
between a public school and a private childcare facility. So this simply
puts it in the hands of the partnership for children which I believe is
very capable of handling this task, and they obviously are in half of
the counties around the state. So that part, we’ll address that.  For
those who wonder, they will still be allowed to have the pre- k
classrooms in the public school. It does nothing to change that. It
simply puts the pre-k program a third party in charge of administering
the program.  The third piece deals with clarifying the definition of
at-risk. It will reduce the definition, change it down to 100 percent of
the federal poverty level. Even at that level, we will still have more
qualified four year olds than we do slots. What we’re attempting to do
with this legislation, and as you saw with the governor’s proposal
although they’re slighter different, is basically eligibility’s up here.
Funding is down here.  It’s an attempt to bring that eligibility down to
something reasonable that we can actually fund as a state and put them
at a level filled so that we can address those needs and have a serious
discussion about that. And ensure that those kids that are at that
level, and that also qualify under the IEP, and have family in the
military, a parent or previously has lost their life in the military,
their children would also be eligible to serve. It allows those three
categories within the at-risk definition. They would be able to be
served. As I said, there are still more kids than there are slots. There
will be not be one slot cut with this legislation.  This is simple
ensuring that as a state we fund those that are most at risk. This will
do that.  With that, I’ll be happy to take any questions but I would ask
for your support on the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker.

education at an early age. We’ve heard many times about the clichés of
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Or that a stitch in

We all recognize, at least I think we all do. Most states. Most nations

rehabilitation of benevolence at the other end. Children who are

Dollar all of the evidence shows that for every dollar that you put into
pre-school you save seven dollars down the road. So it would save the
state money to pay for, make this investment in our children, pay up
front to prevent the crime that people get into, to allow to be

your propose as you propose it and you were actually funded, how much
would it cost the state in the next budget year money that we would have
to spend today, or to appropriate over the course of the next few weeks
to fully serve that population should they choose to enter into the
program? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sure that the bill we passed last year
that cut taxes for wealthy business owners would be enough to cover this
expenditure. And I would also like to add that this bill puts the burden
on us to say these are our at risk children. We are admitting these
children are at risk and we are admitting that we are not funding them.

thing that I would do would be to cut my second job in order to somehow
save money and that's what we did last year. We were at the bottom of
the barrel in our revenue and what did we do? We gave up our second job.
We gave up that revenue that was coming in already. I just don't want us
to cut anymore revenue. Our economy will get better our revenue will go
up. Instead of using every bit of new revenue that comes up when people
get new jobs our revenue will go back up. We'll be able to fund these
children and thats what should be our goal. Our goal should not be
always to cut taxes our goal should be able to fund these essential
services and our children are essential and they are our future. This
bill says that we don't have to educate our children to take the jobs of
the future. That its okay if they drop out of high school and to have
only low paying jobs. I don't want to live in a gated community that
surrounded by slums. I hope you'll vote for this amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Dollar is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker members of the house I would just observe
that the questions are not really being answered. What representative
Burr and what representative Avila are doing, what they've been working
on is trying to make a logical alignment between those children who are
most at risk and the funds that we actually have available for the
program. What I've observed over the years is that there has always been
this huge list, ever since I've been here, there has always been this
huge list of unserved. But nobody in the good times, they never
appropriated the money. The committee before, with all do respect to my
colleague, they didn't fund the full list then because its hundreds of
millions of dollars. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko what purpose
do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask representative Dollar a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Dollar you served on the health and human services appropriations
committee and you knew that year after year we were  able to add slots.
Year after year our child care subsidy slots went up and we added
children into our three and four and five star child care centers. Part
of that was pre-k so we did add funds. We did add slots every year. I'm
no afraid of saying that we are falling short. That we could do better.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not sure I heard a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Gill is recognized to explain her amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know today on the floor I’ve heard this sponsor of the bill talk
about the kids that are at, at most at risk.  Not being successful.  And
the group of kids that are most at risk are the ones that are not on the
list. So I’m asking to add as a fourth eligibility, limited English
proficiency.  Access to pre-K for limited English proficiency students
is a great thing. Children with limited English arrive in kindergarten
with a life-changing literacy and English vocabulary deficiencies
compare to children who speak English at home.  If you notice that the
limited English proficiency student are currently the lowest performing
subgroup in our North Carolina schools. They are the most at-risk of
failing.  So I’m asking for you to support the amendment to include
limited English proficiency students.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I would respectfully ask that you

I would ask that you vote red on the amendment.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House.  I hope
that you will consider what we are doing and what we’ve done so far.
This is not a stand-alone bill. This is not the first education bill we
have before us to consider and for some reason we seem to look only at
the bill in front of us and not consider the context in which it’s in.
So we look at increasing class size, we look at taking away teachers
assistants. And now we’re saying you have to be the most destitute of
destitute to get assistance. So this bill reduces the number of children
eligible, not the number of children in need.  And so are we creating a.</p>

?? for ourselves when we say because you have need, we've waived the
magic wand called our definition of need. We've reduced that so we can
say we're meeting the need we're not meeting the need. This is gonna
impact our future. These are your grandchildren, these are the children
your grandchildren play with, your children play with. We can't all roll
up the ladder and say only our children should have an opportunity.
They're gonna need people to work with, to communicate with, to
collaborate with, to come up with great ideas, to recieve new ideas and
we're creating an environment where we're depressing them. So I'd ask
you to then think again about what you're saying about the future of
North Carolina. I appreciate what Representative Dollars?? said about
the immediate cost. But we're here to also look at the future of North
Carolina. We're talking about impacting our graduation rates. We're
talking about developing a work force in the next forty years that will
not be able to compete and we're making those decisions today. So again
take into consideration the future of North Carolina not just the
present. We weren't charged to come down here and just pass bills that
deal with the present. Clearly we're talking about kindergarten
students, we're talking about pre-k students so obviously we're talking
about the future. Let's look towards the future let's not be stuck and
be prisoners of just today let's not leave behind those who will be our
future and again you've already heard that North Carolina's graduation
rate has improved. If you think back ten or fifteen years had we not
been making the efforts we made at pre-k, that would not have happened.
We're getting ready to doom North Carolina for failure and many areas
going forward by having these type policies. Again, think about the
future. It doesn't take care of the need just because we changed the
definition. We recognized the need, we know it's there. We know we get
good results when we address it especially in pre-k and kindergarden. So
again, I'd ask that you not vote in favor for this bill but let's do
better for the future. For your children's future as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speakers?? Speak on the on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Education is expensive but let's try ignorance. We won't have quality
students if we don't provide a head start for these young people through
these pre-k programs. We talk about what we want our children to be able
to do. We say we want them to read by the time they're in third grade.
We say that we value education and of course there's a lot of data that
suggest that pre-k programs do in fact help children to be successful in
the grades that follow that. It is a vital component of our public
education system. We've had our pre-k program now for over a decade and
it's made a difference in the lives of children and we have enough data
to support that. We say that we're a state preparing students for global
competition. But this bill has already been said in addition to
eliminating nine thousand, over nine thousand four year olds from
participation. It will also exclude limited english proficient students
who are now eligeable. Thousands of young people, thousands of families
who need this opportunity to be successful in school will be hurt. We
should be thinking about creating opportunity and not eliminating
opportunities. I'm concerned as well not only for the entire state but
for Guilford County currently has twenty three hundred, more than twenty
three hundred pre school slots and they're all filled with elidgeable
students and children and we're going to lose if this passes about six
hundred and sixty eight slots. So that these children will not be able
to participate it's not a good thing, it certainly, we need to start
looking long term as Representative Hall and others have said and we've
got to consider if we don't do something now before they actually get
into school then we're going to pay later for it. I would appreciate you
not supporting this bill it's not a good bill it's certainly not good
for North Carolina and it's awful for our children.

Poverty level. I was taught to read by my mother on her knee when she
would read those little Golden Books to me, if you've ever seen those
things until I would read them back to her, after I had memorized them.
Eventually, I learned to read that way. It's kind of ironic,
Representative Hurley, but the first two things I remember learning in
public school, that I didn't already know was in the third grade when I
learned how to write cursive and learned the multiplication table. That
was so cool, because my teacher had finally taught me something that I
didn't already know by the stage I got to it. I say all that to say
this, I feel like we greatly denigrate people a lot of times by assuming
they're incapable of doing anything by themselves unless the state does
it for them. My wife and I taught our kids to read before they got to
school. My daughter is now teaching her kids, who are three and one and
a half, how to do things and she'll teach them to read at the
appropriate time. I think the fact that we think we can throw state
money at something and solve everybody's problem has proved to be a
ridiculous solution. I will also say that this idea of no matter how
much it costs, we'll just pay for it, I don't go along with that. The
latest studies I've read have shown the pre-K program that is used most
widely in our country has virtually no effect on students after they
reach the third grade, any benefit they got from it disappears. Are we
willing to pay an infinite amount of money to get a benefit in the last
three years and it goes away? The benefit I got, learning to read from
my mom still lasts today. I would certainly support this bill and ask
you to do the same.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
If you will just hold for one second. Pages, you're free to go. Thanks
for coming. Representative Brandon.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I wanted to speak briefly on the bill. I have some concerns with the
bill, I understand the bill's sponsors understand what the intentions
are. But, one of the notions that we have understand is, is that people
of 200% of poverty, when you're looking at the numbers of folks who can
not read by third grade, and you're looking at a 60% number. That goes
across all lines. That is not just poor people, and that's not just
100%. That goes across a whole wide range of folks. We really have to be
mindful when we cut it to 100% and understanding that the 150, the 200
are all still suffering from this. They all still have financial
disadvantages that prevent them from being able to enroll their children
into a pre-K program. If we always did law based off the notion that
everything that we do in this general assembly is going to affect 100%
of the population or it has a 100% success rate we would never, ever
make a law. There are a lot of families out there that do benefit from
this and I think it outweighs the negative of those that don't. If you
would want to take statistical data, try taking statistical data if we
hadn't done it. Yes. We still have a big problem by the time our
students reach third grade. It is a huge problem. I can't imagine what
it would look like without this program. I think it would be twice that.
We have a real serious problem with our pre-K programs and we have a
serious problem with children, that by the time they reach the third
grade. We all know what happens when they reach third grade and they can
not read. I really wish we would reconsider that we're doing a lot of
things good. I think this would put things, maybe in a different
perspective in terms of the percentage of numbers in our mindset what we
can pay for, but when you look at 60% of third graders who are not
reading on grade level I would prescribe to you that that's not just
100% of poverty. That goes well beyond that, the number itself will tell
you that. You can't get to reach to 60 and just leave it there. I urge
you to look at it differently and oppose the bill. Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Glazier is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I will speak on the bill. But, I'd
like to turn our attention a minute to a different portion of the bill
than we've been talking about. Which causes me as much concern as the
one we spent all the time on. That is, if you'll look at part two,
section eleven of the bill, which is the local partnership is the sole
contract administrator. Essentially, what we have now allows
partnerships, and I'm a huge believer in the partnerships. It allows
partnerships to exercise the right of, first the refusal to be the
administrator for an area. Last year, 41 partnerships did not exercise
that right to be the administrator, they choose not to be. 41 school
districts.</p>

but continue to be the essential ministry under a partnership of these
programs. if you were about two paragraphs down from where that is, will
see the effective date of this bill is July first. assuming this bill
passes the end of May were talking about moving the administrative
function of forty one of these programs in thirty days from the school
district to the local partnership without any time to do that. I think
that is all but a physical impossibility and sets them up to seriously
fail, I'll begin think they have the capacity or didn't want to do it
last you have the option now whatever force it on them a beginning July
one twenty thirteen when this bill may only pass at the end of May. I
think that creates a real administrative obstacle on it. at minimum I
would hope that if this bill were to move on the back gets changed.
secondly, I am turning to back to the issue that we are talking about. I
just have to respectfully disagree with two comments that were made on
the floor. one is that of the study showed that the rest of the
experience of these children and effects effectively a third grade.
there was a time I think that that was accurate. the far more recent
international and national studies,including one out of Chapel Hill make
it very clear that the effects of quality early childhood education
programs go all the way through school and I don't think there's any
question about it. and here I just want to share one experience when I
became a school board member. I tried to figure out all the things I did
know and start to learn a few of and that was a lot, but I went to a
teacher 's classroom, and they were having a prep practice writing test,
and this was of high poverty, high risk elementary school and that
teacher am I given the prompt of the prompt was what did you your summer
vacation and I want to see the principal lack right through the school
principal was crying. I asked her why she was crying and she said I want
you to read this response to read theresponses I read it, here's what
this child wrote child wrote well I've never had a vacation. but if the
vacation means that I could sit outside my home one night and not hear
gunshots in myneighborhood and I had a day of vacation last summer at
answer reminded me in every way possible, but very different cultural
lens were brought up with a lot of these children that things like early
childhood education and field trips and experiences can make all the
difference in their lives. things I take for granted with my children
and with the children who live in my child of my children's neighborhood
early childhood education is the difference between whether we continue
to build prisons or we don't lord knows we've been passing a lot of
bills and here I voted for Monopoly than increase penalties because were
not dealing with our every single country is ahead of us on tens and on
international testing, almost without exception, one of the differences
between their countries and arts is that they have universal access to
early quality early childhood education programs, and if you read all
the books, Finland are being the most recent one, Ireland, Denmark, they
credit that, among many things, but that is one of the biggest reasons
they were able to turn around their education systems. I recognize were
not to be able to meet Leanne grow overnight and I think a couple
thousand slots. additionally year is a is a is a budget wise and smart
way to go. this bill says were going to effectively reducing sixty nine
thousand eligible kids down to thirty one thousand or so eligible kids
in perpetuity. it's not looking forward. it's dealing with the wrong
question. we asked the question, how do we saw only had a problem by
looking at our revenue limitations we get one answer to as khow we solve
the Landrieu problem by what's best for the education of children and
how we propel education forward in the state and need our constitutional
obligations. we get a different answer.so while I don't disagree with
represented dollars. about. we certainly don't have hundreds of millions
instantly to do this. what I do disagree is that we pass a bill that
says that's not a goal and if that moves us to a lower common
denominator instead of Bihar, one for those reasons and would be voting
against the bill for what

With it. To be, rather than to seem. What we're basically talking about
is either we raise an eligibility limit, and we have this massive number
of people standing in line with no hope of getting funding, or we be
realistic and set a limit where we can begin to meet the needs. I think
our Governor has set us on the right path showing us that contrary to
what may be put out, as far as the rhetoric, we also believe in the need
and the efficacy of early childhood education.
I think Representative Collins pointed out how critical that is to all
of us, whether we're getting it through a government program, or whether
we're getting it through our families, it is necessary. But, we have to
be realistic, because if we set these eligibilities...We focus on so
much of the things that we can't do. Let's set a limit. Let's meet it.
Let's then go beyond it, because we will continue to find those children
that need it, and we will get them in the program.
To have a huge waiting list and have people with this hanging over their

me when it comes to education over the next few weeks. One thing I
wanted to do, just for a moment, is tell you about some proficiency
numbers. Third grade proficiency levels across this State that we got
from DPI. These are numbers that stand at 185% of poverty. We're talking
about dropping that eligibility down to 100%.
Charlotte Mecklengburg County schools. Only 55% of their children, third
graders, are reading proficient. Nash County schools. 55% of their
children are reading proficient at the end of third grade. North
Hampton, 51%. Chapel Hill, 48% Asheboro, 49%. Winston Salem, 48%. That's
at 185% of poverty, and we're dropping it down to 100%. I'm asking this
Chamber. We need to be very, very careful with the foundation that we're
digging into right now. We're going to be doing something that's going
to lead us to a very bad end if we continue in this way. Thank you.
