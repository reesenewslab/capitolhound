Can the finance committee come to order please? Thank you. Alright first
thing first. Let's say thank you to our sergeant at arms who helps keep
an orderly and efficient meeting, Ernie Cheryl, Justin Owens, Donna
Blake, Anderson Meadows.  We appreciate y'all your help very much. And
also we'll say welcome to our pages and senate finance today and it's
Caleb Sanders, Senator Daniel, Elijah Dukes, Senator Rabon, Ben,  I
might  mispronounce this Ben, Hexspith I think, Senator Meredith, and
then Nick Carroll, Senator Goolsby. Alright. We welcome and we hope that
your visit to the general assembly in the North Carolina Senate is well
worth your time.  It's generally very interesting and exciting.  And to
go from that point of excitement now onto Senator Jackson with Senate
Bill 378 Access Propane Bill is distributed Senator Jackson the floor is
yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Members of the committee this
is a ?? referral from commerce basically 378 is a assessment bill for
the propane industry.  There is 19 other groups in North Carolina that
access their members on assessment and this would be for the dealers and
also the distributors who would be assessed.  It does not affect the
market price of propane because that is determined nationally and so it
has no bearings on the cost to the consumer.  In other words it might
actually be better because currently they are doing their own marketing.
 This way they can collectively do it and hopefully be some efficiencies
in that way.  I'll be glad to answer any questions or we'll entertain a
motion.  Thank you Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I've got a motion for Favory Port from Senator Tillman
on Senate  Bill 378.  Members of the committee any questions? This bill
does not oppose any additional cost on the consumer. Correct Senator
Jackson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Members of the committee?  Seeing none.  Motion
from Senator Tillman Favory Port for Senate Bill 378.  All in favor
please say aye.  All opposed nay. Ayes have it.  Thank you sir very
much.  Good job.  Very exciting bill.  We appreciate it.  Well we would
love to see.  Senator Tucker's not here.  The amendment is being done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you we have a PCS for Senate Bill 523 do I hear
a motion to PCS Senator Tillman?  All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  Senator Rucho if you will discuss the bill
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the finance. This
bill, Senate Bill 523 Clarify And Reduce Penalties For Failure To File
Tax Returns.  This was requested of us and the Department of Revenue
actually was very instrumental in helping us craft the language in this
bill.  What it does is it clarifies that a penalty will be imposed for
failure to file a return when it is due.  As in anybody expected whether
you have taxes due or you've got taxes owed.  Secondly it reduces the
penalty maximum that can be opposed from 25% to a failure to file the
return on a timely manner.  Right now the current law the way it is, is
not the way the Department of Revenue has interrupted this law. So it
actually allows for and you'll love this part, the current statute
requires the imposition of a penalty for failing to file a tax return on
time that is equal to 5% of the amount of the tax per month with a
maximum penalty of 25%.  That penalty is very stiff and I don't believe
the Department of Revenue currently follows that statute because in
reality the, when it turns out that the taxpayer is actually owed a
refund and that penalty is in place so</p>

<p id="05:00">
What we’re trying to do is clarify the language so that the Department
of Revenue clearly understands what the policy should be. I would say to
you that we are delighted to be of some help to the Department of
Revenue. It appears the previous administration didn’t follow the law as
how they arrange this policy, that’s why we are here to fix it.  Thank
you very much Tom for being of assistance. Mrs. Averitt is there
anything else that needs to be addressed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, the only other thing I will clarify is the
question I keep getting asked, this requires a penalty to be paid on the
amount of the tax minus any credits, but it does not allow for any
payments, installment payments or with holding payments before the
penalty is imposed. So, this would create the situation to where if a
refund was due, there could still be a failure to file penalty.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any further discussion Senator? Questions
from the Committee? Senator Clyde [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask the question? I think [inaudible] because
what she just said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may ask.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As I understand that the IRS does not collect a
failure to file penalty on a return, if the return shows a refund due
and that has been the practice, if not the law. That has been the
practice we followed at North Carolina. If you do a refund and you file
your return late, you don’t pay a penalty, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Sir, the Federal law requires that they only
impose on the net amounts due. So, if there is nothing due and you’re
owed a refund, there’s no penalty and that is the way the Department had
been interpreting this law. In October their new program is coming
online and they looked at the law, what the law says the penalty due on
the amount of the tax. They are now saying that in October, the way that
they’re going to interpret that is the total tax due. So this clarifies
what the amount of the tax is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I follow you so far. My follow up question is; what
will the Bill the do? Will it now mean that there will be a penalty if
you file a return late but the return shows you’re due a refund? You
will still be paying a penalty?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, what the Bill does, it defines the amount of
the amount due for purposes of calculating the penalty as the tax, minus
tax credits, for example, the credits for children. However, it doesn't
allow a credit for tax payments, including installment payments or
with-holding payments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator [??]. Whether you’re owed, whether you owe
money or whether you’re due a refund, everyone has the obligation to
file taxes in a timely manner and they shouldn’t be considered any
differently and that’s all this does.  It clarifies that, it reduces the
significantly the penalties on that sense but it realities it just a
matter of making sure that everybody is treated the same.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think I now understand, but if I’ve over paid my
taxes on my estimated or with-holding, then the state has the use of my
money and they owe me back, what they’re penalizing me for now is not
asking for the money they owe me quick enough? I don’t get it, I just
don’t get it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator [Clydefelter] What they’re asking is the fact
that you didn’t file in a timely manner. That’s the obligation that we
all have and the law is the law and it should be treated that way and
the department should follow the law as the General Assembly has set
out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Following Senator [Clydefelter’s] line of thinking,
I’ve got a huge problem the fact the you ay file a day late and you’re
owed $15,000 back or maybe its $15, and now, contrary what the Federal
does, Federal takes nothing if you’re owed a refund, they’ve been using
this money for a long time, they’ve continued to use it right up until
you file and before you get your money back. I think they are profiting
by that and now to put 5% penalty because you were a day a late or 10
days late.  The other part I think is great, we’re reducing by 15%, the
penalties and that’s when you owe the state money and I totally follow
that. But, I certainly have a problem with this 5% on it, just because
you may have filed for it a day late. Never before have we done that.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator [??] The law is clear Senator Tillman and all
we’re doing is clarifying it so that the fact . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The law is clear, the penalty is not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, it is now. Because that’s what this Bill does.
That’s correct and you’ll have a vote I’m sure, but the reality is</p>

<p id="10:00">
that if a person is late, then they accept the responsibility. I mean,
that’s why April 15th is there, like it or not. I mean, you’ve got to
treat everybody the same. If you’ve got money coming, if you got $15,000
coming in a refund, you’d be the first guy out there to try to get that
money back because you ought to be. Well, now they will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s good. Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Two questions, and first trying to clarify this. I believe I understand
you said that under current law, they may have been misinterpreting up
to this point, but under current law, if we do nothing they will pay the
penalty for not filing their taxes at a higher rate than this bill
allows them to do, that’s my first question, just to make sure I’m
correct on that assessment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. The Department of Revenue is getting a new computer system
commonly known as TIMS. When that computer system goes online, that
computer system has been programed under the way the law is currently
written as interpreted to be applied to the total amount, so if nothing
was done, as of October 1st, and when this computer system goes online,
the penalty for failure to file will be between 5 and 25% of the total
amount of the tax regardless of any of the credits or pre-payments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On a...I’m trying to figure out what plays into this. Is extensions? If
you are owed money back, but on April 15th you filed an extension, and
they gave you six more months to file your return, would that still be
without penalty for filing an extension?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. The penalty only applies if you don’t have an extension.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, I often wonder, you know, you have to pay penalties and
interest if you’re late paying. If you paid too early, I think the state
ought to pay you interest for using your money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It actually does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How about a penalty too for taking our money before they need it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir, you’re welcome to request it, but you do get money back on
interest if it’s held up by the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At what rate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know the rate that you get for refining it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
5%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s a good investment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca will have us hold his money for about a year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think someone answered from the back, I couldn’t remember the exact
interest amount, but the interest doesn’t begin to accrue until I think,
30 days later. So if your refund is not refunded to you at the end of
May, that is when the interest begins to accrue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to make sure I understand this, Senator. This bill has a
limit of 10% and it’s 5% a month, so after two months, there’s no
incentive to pay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Who can answer that? Heather?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill in question has a limit, as I read it, of 10% of the tax,
that’s your penalty. But it says 5% a month. So if you go two months,
you’re at the 10%, after that, you might as well not pay it for another
twelve months.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. I mean you’re correct. It’s 5% each month of the amount of tax
due, not to exceed an aggregate of 10% under the bill. The current law
is an aggregate of 25%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Could the department like to make a comment on that? Is there
anyone here from the DoR.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon, I’m Tom Dickson, I’m the Assistant Secretary of Tax
Administration. Our policy on this has been a longstanding, well, it’s
not actually a written policy, it’s been a practice. We found this when
the new computer system was being programmed and found that we had been
interpreting the law not as is written in the statute. There’s nothing
in the statute that talks about the failure to file penalty being done
on a net amount. The Feds have done it that way, and quite frankly, in
past administrations, as most of this conversation has been talking
about today, we have looked at taxes in terms of individual income taxes
and how it would impact individual taxpayers. The fact of the matter is,
this is not just a bill for individual income tax.</p>

..taxpayers. There are other taxpayers such as sales tax and alcohol
taxes that we distribute back to local governments. When we receive
those monies in that's a good thing. But, if those taxpayers do not file
their tax returns in a timely manner, and we have to chase them down to
try to figure out how to distribute those monies. So this is more than
just a bill about individual income tax it this touches all the taxes
???  the department has also administratively actually done this in a
couple of different ways some of the tax schedules that we have
currently are not on our iTax system. iTax is the current tax system
that we use and it's about 20 years old. We have a number of taxes such
as alcohol and smaller taxes that are on legacy systems. Those taxes
have been been administered differently. When we implement TIMS
supposedly sometime later this year, hopefully around October, all these
tax systems will come under one system.The new TIMS system. So we
brought this up to the leadership and asked for their assistance in
trying to clarify this we understood that it was going to be a
difference in the way this has been administrated and Senator Rucho and
staff has worked with us to try to craft a bill that would that would
address a true fair and final penalty and not what was merely a failure
to pay ???
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It seems a little to me like we are letting the Borg take over. Where
resistance is futile. We got a computer system now that is putting
together . . . we decided there's a difference in interpretation that we
want to put into the computer system that would that would result in
folks who paid money in and we've used the money by accident or
otherwise having to pay more to get their own money back because and to
me common sense says that we need to at least program in to the computer
system what has been the case for at least the last fifty years. I don't
I mean I understand the difference in a failure to file and the failure
??? and all these kinds of things, but if somebody has had his money
withheld, and for whatever reason, one day late gets a return in and a
return says he is going to get a refund of X and it actually exceeds and
this doesn't make sense to me. I agree with Senator Tillman and Senator
Cook I can't understand this why in the world would we want to change a
common sense provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook. I just want to follow-up on that question. I'm not sure I
heard anything that helped me with this. As I understand it, it's 10%
after two months and after that whoever owes us money is gonna be
thumbing their noses at us. Good luck, cause you're not gonna be able to
hurt me anymore. Do we need to fix that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think, Heather, is it would you explain that because its reality it is
only 10% if its if you do refund. So we minimize it. It would go. The
original bill would go to 25% and we have reduced that to 10%. You would
hope that someone was do a refund would do what they were supposed to do
and that's file a tax return. And that's all we are expecting them to
do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. Can I follow-up? That's good. But, what about the deadbeats?
Folks who don't tend to pay the dagum thing, and after two months they
say, &quot;Right, I got 10% that's all you can do.&quot; Seems like
there ought to be some provision for folks who are really trying to do
us out of the money to have some further penalty after two months
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Heather, will you please respond, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, there are other penalties under Chapter 105. There's a failure
to pay penalty as well. There's also the interest provisions that we've
been discussing so this is just for the failure to file and that is a
lower amount and it does apply to the lower amount that Senator Rucho's
discussing the 10% and that would apply if you got a refund or if you
are owed a payment, however, if you owe money you are still gonna have
the failure to pay penalty and you are gonna have other penalties and
interests so that I believe is the stick that you are looking for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. That's exactly what I wanted to hear. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.</p>

Tillman was next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't know if we can resolves this here or
not because I see a conflict in the practice that we've been doing plus
penalizing people who are getting a refund, but I'd like to ask
Department of Revenue spokesman a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly the department would yield [inaudible][?]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tom Dickson with the Department of Revenue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In ballpark figures, how many people that are owed a refund are late
filers? I'm not talking about failure to file. I'm talking about failure
to file by the deadline.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that number is around one hundred thousand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hundred thousand are late filers that are getting a refund?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, that seems awfully high to me. However, I'm going to take that.
Then how much extra help do you have to put on around April 15th crunch
time in the DOR office.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You mean for mail opening or..?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for the tax filing deadline. Period. There's a month or so in there
prior to and a little bit after that you have to have additional help.
How much help do you need around that time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We hire hundreds of temporary employees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How much do you expect to net in this five percent that we are accessing
people that are due a refund. How much money? If it's a hundred thousand
taxpayers and the average refund would be about---oh, what's an average?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Around five hundred.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Five hundred or a thousand and a hundred thousand of those are accessed
at five percent. You don't have quite a windfall it looks like to me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know those numbers, but I believe the windfall is the state's
windfall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A windfall is a windfall. It's going away the taxpayer.  Mr. Chairman, I
need to go through Apodaca, I believe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. You can go through me because I was fixin' to cut you off. [chorus
of laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've been cut off before. I understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is one more time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have an amendment I want to offer if Senator Rucho is amenable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Let's do this. There is quite a bit of discussion and let's
pull this bill back and wait on that amendment and do it that way so
that we have time. If Senator Barringer wants to ask a question now, you
may then we will put it back because you were on the list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. It's to understand the implementation of this
particular law. In calculating the five percent each month, that varies
depending on how much tax is owed. Am I correct? That's what it's based
on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You mean under the bill, it would be based on the amount of the tax
which is defined as the amount owed minus credits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right and that's what I mean. So, the more refund a person owes, the
higher penalty. Am I interpreting this correctly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not believe the amount of the refund would impact the amount of the
penalty. The amount of the refund wouldn't be tied to that because it's
the amount of tax imposed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright. I'll take a closer look at the bill and perhaps you and I can
speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah. Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Barringer. Were going to pull this back for now. We
do have some public comment but we'll wait on that until we run the bill
again for the vote. With Senator Rucho will take over and we'll move
ahead. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Rabin.  Okay. Let's go ahead and bring forward House
Bill 488. And that is Representative Moffitt, Representative McGrady,
Representative Ramsey, and regionalization of public utilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's a pleasure--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before...let me get a motion for acceptance of the PCS for House Bill
488 for discussion. All in favor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [chorus]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed.  Aye have it. You have the podium.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. It's a pleasure to be
before you today. This is a rather straight forward bill. If you have
the summary in front of you, I'll work through the summary in a fairly
quick manner.  Essentially what this does is it establishes the
statutory framework for the creation and operation of a metropolitans
water and sewer district and requires regionalization of certain large
water systems interconnected sewer systems. Section one, basically
outlines the size of the public water or sewer utility that this would
be applicable to. Section two basically defines the framework for the
creation  and operation of the metropolitans water and sewer district.</p>

<p id="25:00">
and throughout Section 2 it basically brings forward a lot of existing
statutory law and how we form these districts under Chapter 162A and
we're establishing Article 5A which is a new subdivision of the state.
Essentially this is forward thinking legislation contemplating the needs
of our state and unique challenges that are public enterprises and water
and sewer system space.  It creates an orderly group blueprint for the
consolidation of those public enterprises or water and sewer systems.
It partakes the citizens and the rate payers of the state. This is
particularly true when these systems reach a certain size where
economies scales can be realized and that's what we have brought forward
to you today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah Representative Moffitt, just perusing this rather
quickly you start out and I'm on page 1 line 20 starting on line 18
basically.  In Wake County we have two systems that operate pretty
extensively.  There's one in Cary and one in Raleigh.  Several of the
municipalities contract the Raleigh system.  Several contract the Cary
system.  I think the Cary system has been issued a certificate for
interbasin transfer because they're both in the Cape Fear basin and the
Noose basin but there's no reason the Raleigh system would have gotten
an interbasin transfer.  In just quickly looking at this would this
force the Raleigh system to merge into the Cary system?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Blue it would not.  We covered this
thoroughly on the House side.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Why wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well first of all you have to have a metropolitan
sewage district form first in the county and there's not one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that defined in here that's all I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Ok.  In
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry.  Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The metropolitan water and sewage district is defined
as what Representative Moffitt?  I'm just trying to figure make sure
that we don't
have unintended consequences with what you're doing here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair if I could I would ask if you would not mind
I would like to redirect that to Erica Churchhill.  She could probably
summarize it better than I could try to explain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Churchhill can you help us with that
clarification?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I'll try. The metropolitan water and sewage
district is actually being created by this bill.  It's establishing a
statutory framework where one of those could be created.  The existing
NSD that Representative Moffitt was talking about that is part of the
trigger language on page 1 lines 13 to 24 that you were talking about,
that's already in the statute.  It's Article 5 of Chapter 162A and is a
statutory process to create one.  I believe there's only three in the
state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does that answer your question Senator Blue?  Ok.
I've got Senator Tarte.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Amendment ?? please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok.  Has everyone received the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Explain it from there will be fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes this bill this amendment to this bill is nothing
more than a clarification under the authority to restrict it limited to
the outstanding debt assuming the members are comfortable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt are you ok with that amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair.  Yes the sponsors are ok with the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does anyone have any questions or discussion?  Senator
Nesbitt on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can someone tell me what the amendment does?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Churchhill can you help us with that please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.  Senator Nesbitt the bill is drafted the new
NSWD that would be created.  There's language on page 5 starting on line
36 that would require the local government commission to approve any
transfer or would lease, lend, sell, grant, convey to the district.  The
local government commission has asked that that authority be restricted
and they only oversee and approve those transfers that are related to
any outstanding debt of the new NSWD.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Nebitt did you, are you satisfied with that
answer?</p>

Okay, we’ll come back to you. Let’s see. Any other comments on the
amendment? Senator Hartsell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s not on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not on the amendment. Any other comments on
the amendment? Senator Nesbitt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. I think I see what they’re getting at here. Apparently the way
the bill was drafted, it gave them jurisdiction over the transfer of the
asset as opposed to just the funding. Does this mean that the local
government commission has got to approve the transfer of the bonded
indebtedness? And this is important because it applies to Charlotte and
I mean, we’re, it’s the same situation ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Your
question, Representative Moffitt, do you have an answer or do we want to
get staff or the treasurer’s office on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Defer to
staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Churchill, can you help us with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll try. I believe this is establishing a new
framework for the NSWD and it would be prospective only for once the
NSWD was up and operating that the LGC would have to oversee or approve
any transfer of the asset with the outstanding debt. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Then I guess I’ll pose this to her.
Because in this instance, there’s a serious question about transferring
an [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me do something to help you. Let’s have the
treasurer’s office respond to that. Can someone from the treasurer’s
office come forward? Identify yourself please, and help us explain
Senator Nesbitt’s question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, I’m ?? Hollam, Deputy
State Treasurer. We had suggested this change, feeling that the
commission’s role in our state is to see that our outstanding debt is
repaid, we’re charged with that responsibility by statute. And that our
role in this process should be to see that that debt is handled
properly. As far as this transfer goes, the ability of it potentially to
be transferred from the issuer to this district. Or if not, the fact
that it would be settled some other way. And we felt like that was
probably what was intended initially, and that would spell out exactly
what our role in that process would be. That the amendment would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt, are you comfortable with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could ask him a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Hollam. I sent you a
letter yesterday, from bond council up there, and asked for a response
from treasurer’s office about it and I got none. I didn’t know anything
about this, nor did they respond to my request. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m
sorry sir, I’ve not seen that letter. I apologize. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can
you, there are some serious concerns about the transfer of this debt.
Just as similar as what’s going on in Charlotte. And I’ve seen your
letter on that. Are you envisioning that it would not go forward until
you could ensure that the bonds would be transferrable, or are you just
simply taking a look after the fact? What do you intend to do, regarding
the disposition of outstanding debt? That’s what I’m trying to get at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I would say that we have looked at the bond
covenants, related to the city of Asheville’s debt, and they are written
in a way that clearly contemplates a transfer. And essentially, in order
to make that transfer, you have to be able to transfer to an entity with
the same bond rating, and you have a consultant verify that that rate
should not be negatively impacted by the transfer. And then the bond
documents actually make the provision for that. And of course we would
monitor that process and make sure that everything was settled out with
the debt. And again, I think that was the role that was intended for us
in the statute and that amendment would simply clarify that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And what happens if the
entity does not have the same bond rating? [SPEAKER CHANGES] What
ultimately would have to happen is the debt would have to be retired and
new debt issued. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
And who would have to do that and would it be done before the transfer
occurred, or after the transfer occurred? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, we
would have to get probably attorneys to help us as far as to route the
exact sequence of events but the debt would be ?? by the issuer, the
city of Asheville, and the new debt would be issued by the new authority
that is created. And as far as the timing of that, we’d have to have
bond council’s advice as far as the exact sequence. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, one more follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir.
Don’t the bond covenants require that all of this be done prior to the
transfer? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Again sir, we’d have to get bond council to
confirm the exact sequence of that event. But again, I know</p>

that these documents, they do anticipate a transfer. We can verify that,
we certainly will at the time, and be certain that it occurs in the
proper sequence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can get that information for you then, Nesbitt, then you can talk
about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright. We have an amendment before us, anybody else who would like to
speak or comment on the amendment?
Seeing none, all in favor of the amendment please say &quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed &quot;nay&quot;.
&quot;Aye&quot;s have it. Alright.
I've got the House bill 488 as amended before us, and I've got- Sen.
Cook is not here, Sen. Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is this initiative toward regionalization tied to the one that Sen.
Brown is working on with regard to getting other entities together?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There would not be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So we're gonna have stacked regionalization again when the other
regionalizations were done to save money and all of that, I just- I
don't understand why they're not coordinated if they're both
regionalization projects, and why we can't get a lot of these things
together and really get a bigger bang for our buck on saving money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Rabin. I believe what Sen. Brown is working on is more
administrative in regard to state, this is establishing a framework to
where we can handle these water and sewer utilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Let's go on to Sen. Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
I was going through the what I see as contradictory information that
seems to have come from the city of Asheville on their little one, and I
wanted to ask a question about one of the first areas that they put
together. Have experience with the local government, was former mayor,
and went from the town, and that town's history, the town's taxpayers
put up the money, bottled water, shed, put in pipes, and lines, and
water treatment plant, and sewer treatment plant, and we charged after
doing all that when we expanded it outside the city limits, we charged a
higher rate for those outside than those inside to kind of make up for
those across its history. How is the situation different for the city of
Asheville? Would this process and what is the result of why they do not
charge rate payers outside a different rate than they charge inside?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Hise.
Essentially 488 is a public bill, and we're establishing a new
subdivision of the state. Now there is an example of the outcome of this
particular bill if it passes, which you're referring to the city of
Asheville, and I would defer those questions to Rep. Ramsey to answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Ramsey?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Hise. The basic history of the water system in Asheville
and Buckham county is different than what you have experienced. The
general assembly in the 1920s created water districts that formed a
portion of this system. Over the years, legislation was created in the
1930s to regulate what customers would be charged. In the 1950s, there
was a state supreme court case that upheld that general assembly action.
The county, over the years, has invested tens of millions of dollars
into this water system, and in 2005, the general assembly enacted
additional legislation relating to the water system located in our
community, and the North Carolina court of appeals in 2008 unanimously
upheld that legislation. In that decision, the court of appeals stated
it is not necessary in this case to determine which entities own which
parts of the water system, but there is a difference of opinion between
the parties in the state of- in the City of Asheville v. State of North
Carolina, of which parties own which parts of the water system. So in
your community, it was clear from the beginning that the city, town of
Spruce Pine own the water system and that's their right. That's the
uniqueness of Asheville and Buckham county, and that's why state
legislation has been enacted over the years and why we've had court
decisions that have turned out the way they have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.  Sen. Hise, you all set?
Alright, I've got Sen. Stein, then Sen. Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. It is a question provoked by the questions from
Sen. Blue earlier. As I see this, you could have an existing city water
district that if you meed these criteria you automatically get subsumed
into a metropolitan sewage</p>

water district whether you want to or not, which doesn’t seem fair, but
I also want to make sure that we don’t get swept up here in Wake County.
To create a metropolitan sewage district in Wake county, for Ms.
Churchill said there was a process under the law to do so. I was curious
what that process is to see whether one could be created and then
through operation of this legislation, if enacted, swallow up the
Raleigh water system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that a question? Miss Churchill, can you help us with that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The metropolitan sewage district is created by local/political
subdivisions, two or more in one or more counties, initiating the
creation by resolution of the governing body of each political
subdivision. And then they send that resolution to the environmental
management commission and then the environmental management commission
determines whether or not they are created.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, more of a comment. So basically if two municipalities in Wake
County want to take over the Raleigh system, all you have to do is get
two town...majorities of two town councils to enact it. And if you have
an environmental management commission which is indifferent to the
interests of the city of Raleigh and approves it, you’ve thereby created
a metropolitan sewage district, and by operation of this law, the
Raleigh system is taken over. Am I misunderstanding that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead. Excuse me, Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Stein. We actually went through that entire argument
on the House side with Representative Deborah Ross and Skip Stam and we
resolved that to where anything in Wake County would not be swept up,
and as far as the scenario that you just painted, I believe, Miss
Churchill could possibly speak to that, because we did cover that
particular item.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have great faith in the House, but not all faith in the House.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Churchill, would you...do you have anything to add to this
discussion? All right, I’ve got Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a simple question to Miss Churchill. She indicated a moment ago
that there are three metropolitan sewer districts in the state. Could
you tell us where they are?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe one is in Buncombe County. I believe one is in Pamlico, and
one in Pitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark. Get your microphone so we can...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In regards to section one they have these three criteria here. What was
the basis of these criteria? It’s almost as though they were just
designed to handle a specific water district.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moffitt, do you have comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah. Thank you , Mr. Chair, thank you Senator Clark, I appreciate the
question. You have to start somewhere. And when we’re looking at
achieving true economies of scale, these were the determinants, or these
were the factors that we determined would be the appropriate place to
start.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark, you okay? I’m planning to vote this out. Senator Nesbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chairman. There’s some folks here from the city of Asheville
that would like to be heard too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m going to give them an opportunity once the committee is finished
their questioning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a comment more than a question. I think I can get it done
quicker. Just so you understand what’s going on up in our county, I was
here and the delegation was here in 2005, passed the bill that was
referred to earlier. And restated what had been 75 or more years of
practice up there, which was that we would not have differential rates.
There was always a fight between the county and the city over this
stuff. We laid all that to rest and it went to the Supreme Court and the
Supreme Court said let it rest. Actually, the Court of Appeals did a 70
page opinion that laid out all the history. We resolved it all. Then…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is this adding, and I don’t mean to disrespect, but is this adding to
the discussion here as to try to get some clarification on this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I’m trying to, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, go ahead.

?? towards the city of Ashville to take an asset that is worth billions
from an elected body up there that we entrusted it to. It's true that it
was a city county deal but in the thirties it was entrusted to the city
of Ashville to operate and we controlled how they operated it so that
everybody got the benefit of it. It's being taken from us and it's being
taken from the citizens of Buncombe county. At the end of the day
Henderson county is going to have twenty percent of the board appointees
and they are putting up six percent- putting up a little sewer system
they got that is six percent of the sewer system. I don't know how much
of a water system they got but it's less than a percentage of that.
Being given twenty percent of the board seats. And I'm fearful that
Buncombe county is going to forever more subsidize the bill of a
Henderson county system. They don't even have a sewage treatment plant
there. We are treating their sewage now. And it's being done again
against the will of the people and it's being done in a mean spirited
way. The airport was taken last year. A bill is introduced.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt. Let's be relevant to this particular bill here because
we've got the speaker and we've got a couple more questions. I don't
mean to cut you off but we've like to get this
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one more point mister chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I had to read it this weekend in the paper where representative
McGrady had introduced a bill to threaten the city of Ashville to
conform on the airport authority and they're just beating us up over
there in Buncombe county and taking our assets.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Senator Brock you had a point here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Move for favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We've got a favorable report. We'll hold that for a moment. Senator
Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just want to ask a quick question of representative Moffitt. I go back
to this concern that both the senators and I ??. Would you have any
problem if in fact that I put a little provision in here saying if a
municipality and/or a county has over four hundred thousand people it
has to participate in the choice to form this district that resolves the
?? ?? issue. And the reason I raise that is because I'm as concerned
about the ?? transfer as ?? taking over a system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you senator Blue. I would actually decline to have this bill
amended with that. We feel comfortable we'v addressed the Wake county's
concerns. We'll be more than glad to get the Wake county house
delegation together with the senate and you guys can discuss it but we
feel comfortable for the bill as is does not affect ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, you do have an opportunity between now and the floor to
talk with your delegation and get that issue resolved.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was going to suggest that. Maybe the house will get a chance to agree
with the senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I feel compelled to make some additional
comments. This was never remedied. This has been going on since oh four.
Nathan. When the city of Ashville decided to dissolve our regional water
system and take all the assets themselves even those that have been
brought to the table by the county back in the thirties and in the
twenties. Kind of like getting a divorce and saying I'm going to take
everything honey and thank you for helping us out. That has never been
remedied. We sat through I don't know. How many meetings, Nathan and
Martin all together. Committee meetings trying to work this out so I
just want it to be known it has never been worked out. This has been a
bone of contention and let us just be honest here. The one that really
got the bad end, the one that really got jolted out of this whole
relationship is Henderson county. No obligation has been lived up to
that had been promised to us by Ashville so we just want our just due.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you senator Apodaca and I'm sure we will here more of this on the
senate floor when the time comes. Let me do this. I have one speaker.
Could the speaker come forward to the podium and identify themselves.
And then we are going- we've got a favorable report on the floor and
we're going to take it. You have two minutes sir. Please identify
yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the opportunity. My name is Gary Jackson. I'm the city
manager of Ashville. I've been in that position since two thousand five.
I have over thirty years experience in city management, twenty three as
a manager in four cities. Prior to being in Ashville I served as the
city manager of Fort Worth Texas, slightly larger than Charlotte. Also
has a regional water system that is administered as a department of the
city. I humbly believe my extensive experience in public finance and
management qualifies me to contribute a professional and nonpartisan
nonpolitical perspective.</p>

Today on House Bill 488. I will get right to it. The message today is to
encourage you to vote against House Bill 488 because it is a bad
president and bad policy. What do I mean by that? In our community in
our region House Bill 488 undermines our determined efforts to support
economic growth in the creation of jobs. In 2010 Forbes recognized
Asheville as a top ten city for business in the country. In 2012
Asheville metro led North Carolina metropolitan areas in percentage of
jobs created. And more incentives exist for exceptional companies to
come to town. Most recently in 2012 New Belgium Brewery out of Fort
Collins announced 175 million dollar investment in Bunkum county. It
will be serviced by this water utility. Also Sierra Nevada will be
locating in Henderson county 170 million dollar investment. Both of
these entities chose our region over all other opportunities on the East
Coast Why did they do that? Why are we seeing impressive resurgence to
the Asheville economy and water dependent, water dependent industries in
particular choosing to locate within this system? One, SPEAKER CHANGES
you are gonna need to be able to wind this up its about 15 seconds left
so. SPEAKER CHANGES Mr. Chair let's let the gentlemen speak. SPEAKER
CHANGES Excuse me Senator Edmonds? SPEAKER CHANGES Let's let the
gentlemen speak. We've went over before and it works. We've got the
rules chair here he can let us go in five minutes late and let the man
be heard. SPEAKER CHANGES You have another minute. SPEAKER CHANGES Thank
you very much I was prepared to wrap up within your 15 seconds but I do
have more detail I think which would be helpful for you to receive. The
sound public stewardship and ownership of this water shed is the reason.
It's the visionary leadership that guaranteed ample supply of water for
this generation and generations in the future. Can you say the same
thing about all the water systems in North Carolina? It's exceptional,
finanacial management that's been recognized by independent council and
a thorough inspection by a third party. In addition there aren't
differential rates in addition, Henderson county does have water supply
today that it did not have in 2004. I will tell you that Sierra Nevada
gets the same service, the same rates as New Belgium. We don't
differentiate between Bunkum county and Henderson county last thing I
would like to say wrapping up, I know you dont have time to look at this
study, this was a study that was commissioned by the metropolitan
steward district that was done by arcadis. It concludes, after you pour
through the hundreds of pages that 5.8 million dollars will be spent on
the start up of this new metropolitan authority. After nine years
looking at just the operation and the economies, nine years,it is 6.8
million dollars still in the red I would be happy to go into that detail
with you and show you how those numbers are arrived at. SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you sir, we appreciate you coming and we do our best to try to
welcome all of our guests to have a chance to speak. SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you very much happy to answer any questions you may have. SPEAKER

chai, I certainly appreciate the discussion my home town and Henderson
county but I would like to restate that this is a public Bill and it
contemplates that and other issues statewide and it does call for the
creation of the metropolitan water and sewer district and I appreciate
your support. SPEAKER CHANGES Thank you sir, alright we have a motion

amended and rolled in together into a new pcs unfavorable to the
original bill. We've had plenty of discussion. All in favor please say
