But with that, if you would like to illuminate those who are speaking,
I'm going to recognize you in turn. But again let’s see if we can get
through it, and let’s see if we’ve got groups of things that we can
actually drill down versus what to follow up on. Um, the lady over here
was first up. Um, actually four seats back. ???, you light's on. Did you
intend to have your light on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Shall I speak?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please stand up. Grab the mic.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Tyrona ??? Hooker ??? I was a 2012 North
Carolina Teacher of the Year --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're back on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thought I did something wrong. [laughs] What would I
like to talk about is, I was a lateral-entry teacher, so I came into the
profession after being in the criminal justice system, and I'm very
concerned about the teaching fellows program, the cadet program, those
things that are being cut where students realize in high school that
they're interested in going into the teaching profession. It's a
wonderful opportunity to groom them and to create an environment which
allows them to be proud, for scholarships to be received. Um, as we
know, teaching we don't make a whole lot, um, but the gift for us is in
the results and the outcome. But it would be a wonderful opportunity, so
I would just for it to be thought about or reconsidered as to whether or
not these programs couldn't be re-instituted in some form or fashion,
even if the name needs to change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's, uh, that’s great. I think if you follow the
press, you know, that there was, we were trying to work out with the
Senate, I think there's some merit to teaching fellows or or some
program like that, a successor program. I'm going back to my consulting
days on terms of facilitation techniques. Here's what I'd like for you
all to do so we can get to the subjects that we want to prioritize and
touch on today. We're gonna count that as Teaching Fellows and
Professional Development. So when you get up, think in terms of your
first time to speak as spending just a few seconds saying if I talked
about nothing else today, it would be about this, and then we'll see
based on the group what we should come back to. So I'd like to cover
that, uh, under professional development. Ah, the lady right here. Yes,
ma'am. And I'm sorry. We've kind of changed the seating chart, so I
would, had intended to call you by name, but you're not necessarily
sitting where we expected you were going to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, I'm Anne ??? Pittman ??? from Duplin county, and,
um, we're doing some amazing things in that county that I hope will
continue to be supported, and, um, and at the early-college high school,
our high school students in five years, they can  graduate with both a
high-school diploma and two years of transfer college credits or an AA
degree, and all of our teachers are trained very intensively through
professional development to teach a different way, and it really works
with our population, which includes kids of all different academic
backgrounds, and because of the way that we teach, I think it's really
working with a high diversity population that has a lot of
first-generation college students and a lot of low-income students, so
our county has gone district-wide from kindergarten on up --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may interrupt for a minute, how would you distill
that into a subject matter that we'll come back to? How would you put
that as a subject, under Professional Development? I heard early
college, but in terms of trying to distill it into --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Education reform, perhaps.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's a big ??? .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, early-college high schools, or North Carolina
New Schools Project
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was hopin' you were gonna say that because that's
something I wanted to touch with you all on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, an early-college high school, hopefully that we'll
have an expression of interest from the group as a whole as you come up
and make other comments, so we can kind of vote on that, but I think
it's a good area to focus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Um-hm.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And you can continue. I just wanted to distill into
something that we can come back to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll try to wrap it up. Um, in  our county,
kindergarten on up, we have started instilling in our students that
they're going to some sort of college. It may be a vocational college,
but they will go to college. So, from kindergarten on up, they take
field trips to visit colleges. They, um, have banners all over the
school about different colleges, and our teachers county-wide are being
trained in new ways to teach pretty extensively. And it's working. You
just wouldn't believe some of the kids that are succeeding who I really
don't think would have in a different sort of situation. Thank you for
your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ooo, the excitement. The lady right here. You have, I
thought I had, uh, Rep. Dockham’s. Oh, I'm sorry. The gentleman right
here. We have new seating assignments here, so I'm trying to do a quick
cross block.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My name's Jason Philips ???

<p id="05:00">
The Eastern part of the state, if I was to summarize my little talking
point I guess it would be on fiscal policies: educational spending.
Short and sweet, there's not that much money available. Certainly it's a
huge cost for the state, so we want to spend it as wisely as possible.
I'd like to suggest two areas briefly that I think we can make much more
efficient. First is the use of half days instructional days. In my
county, the kids arrive at our school at about 8 o'clock. They leave at
11:30. The state pays a tremendous amount of money to operate that
school, to heat it to cool it, to run those buses a phenomenal amount of
miles for three and a half hours of instruction. They get breakfast that
is provided - I'm in a low-income district, kind of an impoverished
district - and they're fed breakfast and lunch. In all honesty, this is
a very inefficient way that we spend money: the use of half days. Either
no school day, make it a full professional day for teachers, or a full
instructional day. If we only have a pot of money this big, the use of
half days is not a very wise way for us to spend it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And if I, if I may again, I'm glad you touched on that
topic. Budget and efficiency is an area I'd like to record this as. I
hope that we, that there is-- is there generally people kind of wanting
to know what the fiscal situation is going to be this year? Show of
hands. [laughter] Okay, so we definitely, I'm thinking once we go
through this lightning round to find the topics, we'll come back and
we'll let that be the first one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Excellent. And my second idea, or thought: in my
county textbooks are used much, much, much more sparingly than they used
to be traditionally. In my middle school, one textbook for the whole
class. Class sets. Technology certainly is a huge part of 21st century
learning, and so textbooks cost a tremendous amount of money. I know the
textbook companies have strong lobbies, but if we only have a pot of
money so large I think that the spending on textbooks and to take a very
critical look at how much need is there. Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And trust me digital conversion has a very strong
lobby in the way of the members. And I was waiting for an
&quot;amen&quot; from Representative Horn back there so we'll come back
to that as a part of our budget and efficiency discussion. The lady in
front of Representative Cotham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, thank you for this opportunity speaker. I am Erica
Tyner, I teach sixth grade language arts in Nancy County - a very
low-income district. I'm from a very high-performing school, though, 300
students. I'd like to talk about teacher tenure. I think there is a
popular belief that tenure is a license for at teacher to become subpar,
and I don't think that is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me just ask you again, though, because it sounds
like you're going to build a case for your argument, which I want you
to. The question is, is there any other teacher here who would like to
have tenure brought up for more than just a single discussion? All
right. I would say that that's very likely to be in the priority list.
So I would ask you, in terms of building your case, I'm trying to give
you some sense of the priorities. I wanna get through this and manage
our time so we can get back and have more than one teacher speak on it,
but I think you can be assured that tenure will come back and we'll
recognize you to build a case at the beginning of that discussion. But
you can continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Unlike other states, North Carolina has 15
grounds under which tenured teachers can be fired, and there's even a
fast-track in severe issues. So tenure is not in place so that teachers
can do what they want to do in their classroom. Having said that, tenure
is important for all teachers. We need stability in this profession if
we're going to keep qualified teachers in the classroom, and if we're
going to attract intelligent individuals to this profession stability
needs to be in place. And I think it can be with tenure. I would at
least ask that teachers who already have tenure get grandfathered in to
this status, and we need to keep teachers - we need to keep tenured
teachers as mentors and as educators who have seen the pendulum swing
back and forth with education. Who know the curriculum, even though it
is new, and who are there for the students. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. The lady sitting next to Representative
Johnson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, thank you. I'm late to the career of teaching -
I've only been teaching five years, but I've been out in the industry.</p>

[Speaker changes.]...and have also raised two sons, one was learning
disabled and one was gifted so I've sorta been on all sides of that
fence and then on the other side of the tables with teachers.  I also
appreciate what teachers go through. Just wanted to make a comment,
excited about the fact that North Carolina's adopted the Common Core
because our students these days, in this economy, the students are so
transient.  Not only from school to school and city to city but from
state to state and I think it gives us a lot of good stuff to know what
they're learning in other states versus North Carolina also...and it
gives us a lot of common themes.  I encourage you to make sure that the
teachers have the resources that support that common core.  It's very
rigorous and mention text books and things like that...that you can't
just &quot;google&quot; your way through teaching. So making sure that
we have the resources to support the Common Core is very important.
[Speaker changes.] I'm glad you brought it up...I do believe that it is
one of the more important things that we need to talk about today
because it effects you all.  I see a representatives from ETI???????
I've spoken with them about some of the tools that they're trying to
provide to help you so that it's not just go out to google and figure
out how you deal with it.  There tools that are available hopefully...if
there's anyone from BPI/ETI??? here that would like to speak on it, I
would like to do that at the appropriate time. (INAUDIBLE.)
[Speaker changes.] Good morning, I'm Lauren Burkes?????? and I'm the
teacher of the year from Wake County this year. Mister Speaker I just
wanna say thank you on behalf of all the other teachers here for taking
a minute to hear our voice....and for the other representatives that are
in here, that you would take a moment just to be able to hear things
that we are saying in our hearts and from our classrooms, for our
students.  I'd like to just reiterate a couple of the topics that have
already been said. I'd like to discuss the concept of the teacher
fellow...teaching fellows and cadet program.  I'd also like to discuss
the professionalism that education receives in the concept of salary.
I'd also like to discuss Common Core and the new curriculum that's
coming out.  I'd like to discuss resources as far as budgeting goes on
in the fiscal year that is required of that...and lastly, I'd like to
discuss national board certification and why that's not more of a
priority in our school system. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] That's very good and actually, again, I'm just
evolving??????, using old meeting facilitation techniques.  What I think
we'll do, just for the purpose of getting to a drill down discussion on
this....most of these topics if not all of them....I may take a poll to
see if there's shared interest in the direction stated by the members so
that we can prioritize this, maybe move to a drill down discussion.  You
covered Common Core.  You basically substantiated that everything we
said we wanna talk about, we need to talk about so it's noted. Takin'
good notes...actually....(INAUDIBLE)
[Speaker changes.] Hi, I'm Sherry ???????? from Alleghany County and I
think most of the things that I'm concerned about have already been
touched on but with the possibility of being sequestered on Friday and
the loss of more teacher positions, I don't think we're serving our
students the way we need to. I'm from a very small school, we have one
EC?????? teacher that serves 200 students.  We have an AIG????? teacher
that only comes to us once a week so we're not hitting where we need to
hit with some of our students. So my concern is how we're gonna retain
these 500 teacher positions that could possibly be cut and are those
cuts also gonna come from the Head Start Program and our Pre-K programs
cause that's where so many students really get their first steps in
education.
[Speaker changes.] We need to cover that and budget sequestration
?????????INAUDIBLE  The...which one of you...you have your light on.
[Speaker changes.] My name is Byron Jones, teacher of the year from
???????????? State School. Twenty-five years in education, fourteen as
an art instructor, both high school and middle school. Eleven years as
an administrator, which is why I'm back in the classroom. Not a real big
political guy. My principal ...work for a great principal...Mr.
Thompson,   ??????????? Great superintendent, Brady Johnson.  My big
issue is educational reform...everything that's been brought to the
table is really good but, in our school we have about 430
students...most diverse ethnic background in the county, our
current...our last year's 8th grade class, well over 30% were two to
three grade levels behind in reading...so that's one of my big things.
Even I've never taught elementary...it's ludicrous to me the amount of
salaries that are spent on other things,, other than educational reform
at the third....

<p id="15:00">
grade level because if you don't educate the kids at the third-grade
level and their not on reading level you put the middle school kids
behind the eight ball. Middle school kids are asked to, teachers are
asked to do more and more with limited resources with kids who can't
even read and then they get to high school and then you want to start
bandying about the 21st century learners and then you're promoting an
inferior product because when these high school kids get to the
colleges, community colleges, they have to take the remediation classes
because principals at the high school level are pressured by the
superintendent, superintendents are pressured by the state, to promote a
great graduation rate which is all smoke and mirrors when you really get
down to the fact of grades are being changed in high schools, teachers
are being pressured in elementary, middle schools, to promote their
kids.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for the, and please do not take offense when I interrupt you, I'm
trying to distill this down, and what would be the subject of that
discussion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Education reform and promotion standards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The promotion standard, one of the things I was hoping, as a facilitator
you try and lead people to a discussion that you want to talk about too
and it has to do with promotion standards but one question I have does
have to do with, it came out of the Education Reform Bill, and the
third-grade, the hold back for third-grade based on reading proficiency.
Is that something that this group is interested in talking about? Show
of hands? Okay. Probably the difference between elementary school
teachers and, yeah, okay. Well that sounds like a pretty significant
number so that's at least one area. I noticed when Representative Horn
introduced himself that when he said education reform I couldn't tell if
you were positively or negatively reacting to it. I noticed a little
wince or body language and one question I had about this is where or not
we should change, even the discussion about reform, because one side of
it says, &quot;Well we're here to reform all of you all.&quot; And I do
realize, now, that words matter, particularly at this level. So one
thing, not today, but one thing I'd like to talk about is how do we
really, if I were in business, where I've spent most of my career, I
would never have had a major project to improve Bank of America or Duke
Energy or other companies that I've worked with and I'd call it Duke
Reform. It wouldn't come off very well. So it's really making me think
about how we message this as a part of the process and we're going to
work on that and try and recognize that the words matter. You can
continue but I just wanted to get that-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, like I said, I'm not a real political guy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Nor am I.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which is why I always had fun being a principal. I come from a family of
educators so most of my colleagues, my friends, my wife's been a math
teacher at the same school for 29 years, when we heard the word
educational reform, generally most of us kind of laugh, go run in our
classroom, hide, and do what we do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Because that's what really matters. But really, when you talk about all
these current catchphrases, if the kid can't read, it doesn't matter
what the teacher does, it doesn't matter how much wonderful technology,
because I've got 8th-grade kids who can't even spell-check because
they're used to writing on Facebook. So when you start talking political
and educational reform, it doesn't take money. It takes, I don't know,
maybe pressuring the local people, the local superintendents or the
local school systems to actually put things in place to educate the kids
before they advance to the next level. Because everything else is just
people sitting around talking. If you don't address those issues we are
gradually educating a generation of kids who really don't know how to
learn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Now, I will tell you that we've started what I call the
brainstorming session, and when we started there were 15 lights on.
There are now 14 lights on. So one thing I just want to be mindful of,
with about 50 minutes left, that some of these topics that I think are a
priority. If you've heard something that you know we're going to come
back to I'd suggest that you hold, if you have a new topic or something
you want to bring up, in order for us to get to a point where we can
have some meaningful discussion but know the discussion doesn't end
here, it begins here. The lady right in front of Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I'm Ashley Fillingame from Craven County and we may be the
only county who wants this so I'll be really quick. We submitted a
calendar waiver because, right now, we have three different calendars in
our county and trying to get our students future ready and having high
school exams after Christmas break and not being able to have those kids
apply for early acceptance into college.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll call that calendar flexibility. There are only about 99 other
counties who are interested, in some level, of calendar flexibility.</p>

<p id="20:00">
You're not along and I would like to come back to calendar flexibility.
Lady 4th row back, yes, ma'am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Angie
Parker. I represent Cumberland County's teacher of the year and I wanted
to hit on teacher salaries. As a lateral entry teacher I started off
knowing coming into teaching I was going to have literally half my pay
salary cut. That was OK, I accepted that. I knew what I was coming into.
I love teaching, I wouldn't turn around and go back to managing
restaurants, however over the years teacher's salaries have been frozen.
They've stopped. In 2009 the average teacher's salary was about $48
thousand. This year in 2013 it's now $45 thousand, so we're decreasing
in our salary. At this point in 2013 I am officially making as a teacher
what I made as a restaurant manager back in 2003. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd
like if you would indulge me, I think budget of which teacher's salaries
is going to be a part of the discussion will be first up once we get to
drill down discussion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I also wanted to talk about the
digital textbooks, the bill that has just been recently passed. I wanted
to know what we were going to do about the infrastructure as far as
technology's concerned. If we're going to have digital textbooks, how
are we going to make sure that our students that don't have computers or
internet access at home have access to these textbooks and how will
schools be able to access these textbooks. Will every student have a
computer basically in their classrooms. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That needs to
come under the budget discussion. I think we have someone in the room
that has some expertise on that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And my last item was
standard 6, the 70/30 model. To consider whether or not teachers should
have tenure. I know it follows under tenure which was mentioned earlier,
how standard 6 is going to affect our teaching by EOG scores, I've seen
students with ELL learning issues, students that may come from troubled
homes maybe not be able to stay awake during the test. I've watched
this. I could do my very best as a teacher to try to help these
students, but there are some students that are in circumstances where
they don't do well and I want to know what the situation is as far as
that reflecting on teachers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I believe this
gentleman right here. You have your light on. I'm having to count back
real time, so I'm sorry I'm a little clumsy here, I'm trying to use this
in a different way. Your light was on to begin where if you turn your
light back on. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I am Julien Wilson, a Gaston County
schools teacher of the year. Thank you, Mr. Speaker for having us this
morning. My concern or my topic piggybacks a little bit on hers. We just
drafted for Gaston County a merit pay that we have currently submitted
and in some respects many of us are very, very excited about it. We were
curious about funding issues that you were speaking of, will that money
be available to actually make that happen in the foreseeable future.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll cover that under budget. First topic
when we get to the circle back. Lady right here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good
morning. I'm Linda West, I'm a registered nurse, lateral entry, I've
been teaching for 22 years at Plymouth High School in Washington County.
It is my understanding that there's no reciprocal licensure for teachers
from other states. This was how best to bring this to the floor,
requirements for graduate pay needs to be revisited. Is there a
disconnect between the career and technical education post assessment
required by the state and the actual workplace readiness. The CT post
assessment is not accommodating various learning styles and lastly there
is not enough career and technical education. We are not being directly
worked with when we are doing our PLC and by that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
want to know what a PLC is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Professional Learning
Communities. I realize that we have a summer conference that we attend
every summer, but actually in our school systems it may need to be
better addressed for lack of a better word. I'm going to touch on the
half days that the gentleman over here mentioned earlier. It is a, I see
it as a waste of money as well. The attendance is poor on those days, so
that's another</p>

Good morning, and thank you as well. My name is ?? Riley, and I'm
representing Ryan Salisbury schools. This is not a new topic but I too
would like to discuss the common core curriculum. I am excited about
teaching the common core, I do 9th and 10th grade language arts, and it
is an art in itself so teaching students to appreciate the art of
language I think has been captured  in the new curriculum so I'm
appreciative for that, but y question lies about the true essence of it
being common. Within our county alone, different high schools have a
choice as to which novels they teach, or which supporting pieces they
can pull in, and if we are  on a competitive level with Ohio, California
and other states, what is  it that's guaranteeing that our materials are
aligned and what's guaranteeing that teachers actually teach that
curriculum in a way that students can  remain competitive. So if we
revisit that's one issue that I'd like to look at more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we really have to, because  you all are where the rubber meets
the road on common core, and we certainly want to allot the remaining
time to discuss that. The lady who turned her light on and off a couple
of times earlier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, my name is Jody Salosi, I'm a high school teacher in Laney
High School in New Hanover county. I've been teaching for seven years,
and I'm a North Carolina teaching fellow, so I'm also a big advocate for
that program being reinstated, I definitely am interested in talking
about a lot of the different topics that were mentioned,  but one thing
that I have not heard mentioned yet is  the common exams and MSLs. That
was a top down initiative  to measure student learning, it  factors in
with our standard 6 in teacher evaluation, and the information that
we've been getting has been changing  constantly, I think every week we
get new information, the dates are constantly changing, the roll out has
been muddied, and aggravating for teachers because we're supposed to be
preparing these students and we have no idea what we're preparing them
for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
It may be the first time I've ever allowed applause to happen in this
chamber, and it's okay.
The next person I have is three rows back to the right, I believe that,
is your light on? Four rows back, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have to follow the person that got  applause? That's hard to do. I'm
Jennifer Arberg,  thank you Mr. Speaker for having us. I'm a middle
school match teacher in Guilford county, and I think my main area of
concern is teacher morale. This is my 17th year in education and I think
morale is at an all time low, and I know we can't improve it by giving
teachers more time, or probably not more money, but I know one thing
that has been really beneficial in my teaching career, has been NCCAT,
the North Carolina Center for Advancement of Teaching.  It's really
helped me improve instructional quality in my classroom, it has helped
me connect with teachers across the state to design better lessons. I
think my students have really really benefited  from the program, and I
just want to make sure it stays around. I think it's just so beneficial
for teachers and our students, and it gives  teachers an extra bit of
morale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You touched on a very important point, because you've acknowledged  that
we're resource constrained. I'm not here to tell you I've got a billion
dollars more to spend, but one thing  that I've understood talking to
teachers and principals and superintendents. Absent being able to give
substantially more money to teachers, the professional development is a
very important part of what you all value as an exchange for economic
value. You'd probably like to have both, but  if you'd like to  at least
have one, and I think that's something that we'll bring up when we
discuss professional development.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Great, and you can feel free to applaud me as well, if you want.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And actually,
Let's see, where to,  the lady in the back here.  Three rows- yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. My name is  Shauna LaGrant, and I'm teacher of the year
for Caswell county schools. My topic today, I wanted to discuss the
early childhood programs. I heard it briefly mentioned but in recent

…good education in the overall academic success of children and whether
the funding of these programs need to be cut and I just wanted to know
what the future holds for North Carolina for funding for early childhood
programs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady over here to my left.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m Pam Mills from First Flight Middle School. I
teach 8th grade language arts. I am region 1 teacher of the year. I
would like the discussion of merit pay, and by the way I’ve been
teaching 43 years so I speak to you from experience; I would like the
subject of merit pay to be brought up today. I would not like our state
and our teachers to begin to look at our students as a means of
furthering our pay checks rather take into consideration the entire
child. There are so many factors that go into that performance test that
we need to consider where our children come from on a daily basis and
our schools need to be funded and equipped to take care of those
children who have needs outside of the school building. So, I would
appreciate if that topic of merit pay would be discussed so that other
areas are included. I do believe teachers should be rewarded with merit
but perhaps for teaching in those schools that are low on staff, or
teaching a national board certification, taking on peer mentoring,
other incentives in that way but that our school wide performance not be
based on those testing, let it be a school wide, rather than, I meant to
say an individual merit pay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those are very good points and I do want to cover that in the budget
discussion...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
…which I think we’re approaching very quickly. The last person to have
their light on is the lady four rows back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just noticed that one thing wasn’t spoken, again Angie Parker, I
wanted to discuss professional work days as well. I think it’s great to
have professional development; teachers definitely need and desire to
have professional development but we also need time in our classroom
where we can get things together, structure our lecture plans,
communicate with our other educators in our building, have meetings with
other, well I’m an English language arts teacher so I would love to
discuss matters with my other English language arts but we’re not
afforded the time. Our professional development days are cut in half;
the rest of the day is a work day and it’s very quick. It goes by way
too quickly and we really need to discuss having that implemented in the
calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t mean to be smiling while you’re communicating a serious subject
but it reminded me back when I was PTA president I had these teachers
talking about duty free lunch. I said, you mean to tell me we charge
them a tax for lunch? I mean I thought that, I mean I didn’t know. Now,
I know what duty free lunch means and that’s a part of the professional
development. That’s what made me smile, it’s like when I was a kid and I
was wondering why gorillas were fighting wars. It’s just vivid memory.
Before we go in, we’re going to come back to the budget; I’ll give you
some comments, be happy to have some discussion back and forth. But,
before I do, Representative Brandon you’re still here? Representative
Brandon I think came in, he may have gone; he’s been here each of the
three days. You’ll see Representative Pierce here who’s been good enough
to come and spend some of his time with us from Scotland County. I think
is Representative Elmore is still here? He’s a teacher-in-exile; he’s a
member now. He was a teacher last year in a middle school and
Representative Murry has joined us from Wake County; the gentlemen back
here who looks young enough to be in high school and Representative
Cleveland who doesn’t look young enough to be in high school but, and
also I’ve tried to quickly introduce them, but I also have to tell you
how impressed I am that our Lieutenant Governor has been here each of
the three days to listen to you as well. He’s my counterpart in the
Senate and he presides over the senate. Representative Forest, you’d
like to make a couple of comments before we get to the discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, thank you, Mr. Speaker. As Lieutenant Governor, I’m the President
of the Senate so we had session a little bit ago that’s why I’m late so
I apologize for coming in late. I just want to say, as everybody I’m
sure has, thank you for what you do. The reason you’re here is because
your performance is exemplary and the passion that you have inside of
you for teaching comes out and so many of the topics that you’ve been
talking about I hear bantered around here in the House and the Senate
every day so people are talking about these things but as the speaker
will tell you, talk is cheap, around here we want to see action. We want
to see people do things with this talk and as the…</p>

As Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina, I sit on the state Board of
Education, the North Carolina Board of Community Colleges, I chair the
e-Learning Commission. I have 4 kids as well ages 20 down to 7, so I'm
obviously passionate about education. I'll tell you because I have a lot
of teachers come up to me and ask me questions from the campaign that
everything you heard about me on the campaign, none of it's true. So, if
you have any questions that you want to bring to me as Lieutenant
Governor, please come and see me. My door is open. You can walk in my
door either here or over on Blount Street and we'll be happy to talk
education with you. But, thank you again for what you're doing. Thank
you for making the sacrifice away from your classes today to be here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now, we have 30 minutes and to again begin the discussion. This isn't an
end. And, I certainly want to get to the budget. What I think I'll do is
remind those and get some sense of whether or not you want to continue
this discussion and maybe about 6 to 8 minute increments, so that we can
get to salaries and budget, professional development, and the discussion
of tenure and Common Core, and maybe just a sense, if you could only
talk about Common Core or tenure. If you wanted to talk about tenure
versus Common Core, raise your hand. You want to talk about Common Core,
raise your hand. Other ones, you just don't mind or you got other topics
you wanted to talk about. So, we'll probably prioritize Common Core over
tenure. We want to talk about both, just understand that I understand
from superintendents and principals like the point that was made here.
Tenure is not something that necessarily makes or breaks being able to
get the teachers that principals want in school and it also has very
important impact on you all as professionals to have that added
assurance that your contribution's being recognized. And regardless of
what you hear, I think the tenure discussion is ongoing. We have a
working group with superintendents that I'll talk to you about on the
back end that they'll reporting back on a model that we think is fair
and appropriate both as a management tool and as something that you all
many of you value and believe me to be a part of our go forward plan for
education. But, on the budget. So, we're going to start with the budget.
The budget in 2011 was one of the most difficult things I've had to deal
with with my professional career. We came in on January 26 and we had
and a two and a half billion dollar structural deficit and about 4
months to solve it and it was very difficult. And, education was one of
the most difficult, but Health and Human Services was up there too
because we're making decisions that obviously affect a lot of lives.
But, we went through it. I know it was difficult. Along the way, what we
tried to do working with the superintendents was see what kinds of
things we could do. If we had to reduce funding, then what could we do
to make it easier for the school systems to manage the fiscal crisis
that we were in. And what we tried to do was provide some additional
level of flexibility in the process. We couldn't give you more money. In
fact, we were giving you less. What we were trying to do is say that
instead of giving you money and then telling you exactly what category
you could spend it in to give you some flexibility. We only went so far
with K-12 education. We went much further in community colleges and in
universities. This year, we ask the superintendents come back and work
with our budget writers, some of whom are in the room, to figure out how
that added flexibility could provide the school systems with more
latitude on the ground to spend moneys to their best and highest use
because they may be by mandate spending a dollar here, when they'd
prefer to spend that dollar or some portion of it somewhere else. So,
the theme of added flexibility, more control at the local level is
something that I've charge my budget writers to take a look at and we're
hopeful that that framework will also be embraced with the Senate who
this year is grafting the budget. We did it 2 years ago. From a money
situation, we went from a two and a half billion dollars deficit in 2011
to about a $100 million &quot;surplus&quot; starting out with the budget
this year what we expect to receive in tax revenues. In the end, $100
million seems like a big number, except for when it's on a $20 billion
budget. So, what it really means is we're about even. We did a good job
projecting how much money we would have none of obligations. I think all
of that is said to say we're not going to have substantially more sums
of money, not substantially less. So, now it's a matter of how would we
go back and look at and obviously the budget is adjusted for enrollment,
so there will be more money being spent.</p>

<p id="45:00">
But, its because we have more students going to school and we have a
formula for trying to get that base line. But, assume that base line
goes up, adjusted for enrollment. Flexibility is one thing we can work
on to try and work through what continues to be a fiscal crisis or
really an economic crisis, right now in terms of where the state and the
nations economy is. The things that effect the budget . . . So, I'm
happy to talk about what flexibility means. But, one of the things we
are trying to encourage all of the strata of education; universities,
community college, even K-12, let's find ways to save money or to spend
more efficiently. If the half day issue is a way as a source for that,
lets go back and find ways that we save money. I was criticized,
although I think you got tired of criticizing me, but I've started
talking about this concept depressed, I should say about finders
keepers. What we're trying to do is find ways to save money, and if you
find it we want you to be able to keep it for something that we believe
is a better and higher use. The reward of the past for state agencies to
save money was to have that money taken away and spent some place else.
What we're trying to say today is that within that category, if you
assume for the shake of this discussion, will provide roughly the same
amount of money. If you find ways to save money, then lets be certain
that you be rewarded by letting you spend that money on something else.
Teachers do it all the time, I know teachers do it all the time in their
classroom, you know, I save a little money here and I can get a few more
things there. Well, imagine that sort of concept being applied at a
higher level and not taking money out of your pockets. I'm sure most of
you are teachers of the year are probably taking money out of your
pockets to do what you wanted to do in the classroom. But, taking money
out of other categories of state funding, I would also encourage you to
think about this as county funding. one thing that frustrates me is,
you'll have county folks, not you all, but elected officials will say,
well why would I save that money, those are state dollars? I've heard
that said before. Well, they should because those state dollars may be
used more productively back at their school districts. This is a very
important part and I'll just tell you conceptually, you're all well
educated people. It's $10 Billion that goes into education, is there
anyone here who as a constituent that feels that $10 Billion is being
spent 100% efficiently? Is there anyone here that thinks that, because
if you do . . . You can raise your hand if your hand if you choose to,
but lets just say for the sake of argument that we're 93% efficient.
What does that mean, we're about average, as good as it gets. That's
$700 Million. $700 Million being spent in the education category,
whether its for a teacher, an administrator, or a program $700 Million,
lets assume we only find 7% productivity that can applied back into what
we're talking about. That conceptually is how I'm trying to get our
members to think and in consultation with the governor and the
governor's staff so that we can start freeing up this money for better
and higher use. I think that goes back to the question, or the direction
that the gentleman was discussing in terms of efficiency. Other sources
of funding; the lottery, there have been proposals to cut down the
administrative costs to free that money up for education purposes, its
an example of what I'm talking about here. Lets say that the lottery,
and by most national standards our lottery is pretty efficient, but
we're going through and saying can it be more efficient? Because, when
you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars a few percentage
points of improvement frees up money to retire capital debt that the
counties have taken on to build schools and other educational purposes.
But, this legislature is steadfast in the policy that education lottery
funds are going to be spent for education, we've implemented some policy
for that purpose, but we've also want to be absolutely certain that its
being spent efficiently. But, that will most likely be tabbed for
purposes already identified. We have a bill filed, it's a great bill,
but its suggesting maybe we use some of the lottery funds to pay for it.
But, I would suggest that unless you can identify lottery funds that are
going to something else that are not as good as this new idea, then
you've got to go find another funding source to pay for it. We've got to
have this kind of concept, versus just saying, go do this, its a good
idea and figure out how you do it with the money we give you. The
salaries, this year the expectation is . . . I don't know if there's any
proposals for any</p>

<p id="50:00">
We tried to provide a 1.2% raise. I know it wasn't a lot. The main
reason for that - the thought process for that - was to just let the
state employees as a whole that they're out there and that we're trying
to-- 1.2% doesn't seem like a lot of money, but what was the total cost
of that was about $125 million? 1.2%, to provide a 1.2% raise sound like
very little, and it was in your paycheck. But it was a $125 to $150
million dollar cost at a time when we were trying to dig ourselves out
of $2.5 billion dollar hole. But it was important to us enough to try
and put something out there to let you know that we do recognize pay is
an issue. And it's not only an issue for educators, it's an issue for
police, for fire, and health and human services professional and a
number of other people. So we're trying to work through that. And in
merit pay. In merit pay you all in particular - I mean you're by virtue
of your status as teacher of the year - you're the best of the best.
You've obviously done something that has caused your school districts to
recognize you for extraordinary contribution. And a part of what we're
trying to do is treat everybody fairly. Every teacher who goes in every
classroom should be treated fairly. But there's this concept - and maybe
it's one that you all disagree with - we can't necessarily teat everyone
equally in terms of limited resources. It's trying to find a way to
reward them. But you touched on something that I think is very
important. In my business in management consulting, it's very difficult
to say that teacher deserves a bonus or pay increase because of their
individual contribution. That needs to be a factor maybe, but I think
school performance and system performance-- some cohort also needs to be
included. SO merit is not necessarily something that just directly
relates to a teacher, but it relates to a community that together is
producing above average results. So in the planned design that we've
discussed with superintendents, we've asked them to come back and think
about that conceptually, as the way that we would come up with an
incredible plan that teachers and principals feel like is fair. A lot of
local exceptions too, when you deal with the level of poverty that a
school population represents, or a classroom represents. The types of
needs that may exist in the classroom. There's a lot of of either
discounting or curving that needs to go on to make sure you have a
merit-based system that is in fact fair. And something that a principal
can look across the desk from a teacher and explained how they've
arrived at whatever compensation decision they've arrived at. And it's a
lot of work. But I do believe, at the end of the day, that the teacher
population pretty much is consistent with what you find in any
population of employees. There's about 10 or 15 percent of them that are
truly exceptional at what they do compared to their peers. Probably
another 25 to 30 percent that are above average, and probably 40 or 50
percent that are average. And there are probably 10 or 15 percent that
either have professional development needs, or may make a decision to
get out of the classroom and move into some other role. It's just a
natural part of personnel management. That's really what we're talking
about trying to get to. I think the take-away though is that we're
working hard to try and maintain spending, adjusted for enrolment that
we put into place. The one area that is a wild card - and it's dependent
upon federal policy - is sequestration. I don't know what the number is.
I've given a very wide spread. I heard between 30 and 60 million. Do we
know what the number is? We've been trying to quantify that. I think
it's in excess of $30 million that flows from the federal government
into the state for education purposes. For you all as tax payers and
citizens, sequestration to the state represents about a $300 million
reduction in annual spending from the federal government flowing into
the state. And of that somewhere between 10 and 15 percent of it appears
to be linked to education. What we're trying to do know is find out how
that money is being spent. Is it a program that will simply end and not
necessarily-- or is it a program that's funding teaching positions? Or
is it a program that's funding IT? We don't know. We're trying to
actually back into that? And as you all know if you watch the news, it's
sort of a moving target because we don't know how the president are
going to come down on that and make any changes. But right now if we
assume sequestration there's probably about another $30 plus funding
impact.</p>

<p id="55:00">
that we've got to keep in mind as we pass the budget, and a part of that
flexibility that we're talking about may be that the school systems
determine that that lack of funding from the federal government is
something that is funding something that they find more important than
some other state projects, so, to provide them with the flexibility to
remain whole, this is part of the concept we're going through.  It's
fairly complicated.  I'm trying to see if there are any other things on
the budget that I should touch on.  We've got a couple minutes.  If
there's anybody that has any questions about the budget process or
expectations.  The lady over here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My concern is- I'm from a city district, only eight total schools, and I
think that there's always, ever since I can remember, there's always
been the talk that the state wants to do away with city districts or
streamline things so that they don't have city districts, they only have
county districts, and I would just encourage you, the legislators,
before they just lump that all into streamlining or being more efficient
is to take a look at those city districts. There's a lot to be said for
a small district.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I agree.  I actually don't think that- the physical consolidation is not
as important to me.  There are some great city districts.  There are
probably some areas that could argue that they- cities in the county
could work better together if they subset at the district, so I'm less
concerned with a physical consolidation than a consolidation that
frankly, I think, is a part of driving out efficiencies. Counties need
to talk about how maybe they can pool their resources for some of the
back office functions so that they can release that funding back into
the classroom, and you don't have to do that by combining two counties
into a school system.  Businesses do it all the time, so I really
encourage the superintendents to think creatively about how they can
collaborate within regions or other areas of the state. You don't have
to be Mecklenburg County and Gaston County or Mecklenburg County and
Cabarrus County to necessarily integrate and drive efficiencies and then
figure out how you put those efficiencies back into the school. I think
some people, well-meaning, say, well if we consolidate, we can save
money, but I think we need to think about it in terms of best practices
and outside of government where consolidation can occur without changing
the on the ground organizational structure.  Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  I just wanted to make a point that part of the problem, I
think, about not receiving a salary increase on a yearly basis- and I
understand that the 1.2% was- it was nice to receive something after
having been in this profession now for six years, and, when I left the
accounting firm that I was a part of, I was making almost twice as much
as I made when I first came in, and I am still making the same amount as
a first year teacher. That's a problem for me as a professional, and if
all of the other businesses see themselves as professionals, I find a
problem with not being able to somehow dictate that I'm doing a good
job, and therefore I should receive a salary increase.  We're not only
doing that, but I feel like Governor Hunt and Governor Holshouser both
worked very hard to work on education reform in the state, as far as
salary, as far as teaching fellows programs, so, in doubling up with the
losing of the teaching fellows program and the cadet program, not only
are we not attracting our best teachers and our high flying students
from our own education system to come into education, and so it's very
hard to watch yourself stay at the same level year after year, to see
the government saying, you as a first year teacher are making the same
amount as myself as a teacher who's now been in for ten years, and that
that's going to make us continue to make us to lose professionals.  I
actually have- one of my best teachers at our school, who just won the
teacher of the year, she just told me she has to leave, because she's
going to go to Ohio, because they offered her a much higher salary,
almost double what we're offering her here, and I feel like that as
teachers is a huge, huge problem in the way that we are seen as
professionals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that it is, and I think that- that actually is a great prompt to
segue into professional development, which is another topic that we
wanted to talk about.  We're trying to work during the budget process.
It's a twenty billion dollar budget.  It's a 300 page document with a
200 page money report.  There's a lot of negotiation that goes on in
between. I, for one, was trying to find a way to preserve the end cap
program and teaching fellows program with something that I understand
for most of the teaching community, they found value in it as a part of
the professional development offerings that they feel like the state
offers, and I was not successful in securing support for that in the
last budget cycle. We are going back again</p>

Taking a look at other professional opportunities. Finding ways to maybe
leverage private sector contribution. Businesses who think very highly
of you all and other ways to try and create funding for that purpose. It
is something that I’ve asked my budget writers to keep in to mind. We’ve
talked about something on innovation education requests trust or fund.
Something where the state could maybe cede something from the private
sector. Other foundations that could potentially help us create more
money than the state is capable of giving and figuring out how we would
use it. Know that. I know that those tow programs are important. Other
professional opportunities we are trying to find. That’s the
non-monetary compensation that I think you all as education
professionals value. And, on the salaries again. Imagine, if we’re only
93% productive or efficient. What could be done would bring up 700
million dollars on a reoccurring basis to try an provide a
differentiating compensation model for teachers. I know it’s very
important because right now with the relatively limited amount of
competition. The reason we need to get compensation right now, is
because when the market turns, and it will, and business becomes more
competitive. That accounting firm you work for may give you a call back,
and convince you that not only will they double your salary, but maybe
triple it. Because the market demand is such that they want to pay these
extraordinarily well educated capable people who could work in the
private sector if there heart wasn’t in teaching. Take them back into
the private sector. It’s imperative for us to do it now so we don’t have
that problem. I saw it when we were in the uptowns for the economy. I
heard stories everyday from my superintendent and my principal back in
Meckelberg County. About, look I got this teacher that’s doing all this
stuff down in their day to day school and they could go work on the 40th
floor of the Bank of America Center and triple their salary and actually
have a lunch. We need to know that’s a future problem that we’ll have to
deal with. The sooner we get to it the less vulnerable we’re going be to
the sort of recruiting away of our best and brightest. The gentleman on
the floor. Did you have your light on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Touching base a little bit on what you were talking about. I mentioned a
moment ago that we did a plan, drafted a plan for merit pay for our
county. One of the things we stress is that merit pay will have no bite,
it will have no effect if the base pay doesn’t come up.  I think many
folks in our county get very excited about merit pay but…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re Gaston right? City of Gaston?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. I don’t think we’re even overly concerned about the steps, as long
as we get the base pay up. We went from 20th in the country a few years
ago now I think we’re back at like 48. We’re watching those numbers
fall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m watching those numbers too though. We’re going to get a normalized
set of numbers that we’re all working from the same page. The direction
is wrong, I’m not sure I quite sure I agree with the absolute
assessment. Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was the main concern as we were drafting that resolution. The merit
pay comes first. I’m sorry, the base pay comes first before the merit
pay. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. And, right in front of me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think a lot of teachers are in the same situation. I teach with an
amazing language arts teacher she has been teaching for five years. She
actually makes less now than she did when she started. We keep trying to
encourage her that the only way to crawl up that salary scale is
National Board Certification and Master’s Certification. Now, there’s
has been discussion of cutting pay in both of those realms. I think I
may be on begging for that not to be done. It helps you as a teacher
become a better teacher. That bonus, the extra money is an even better
initiative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lady back here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Lisa Stats. I’m from Bogart County, northeastern region,
teacher of the year. My concern with merit pay. Moral is so low this
year. It’s the lowest…16 years this year. I’ve never seen it this low.
It’s very frustrating to think that we’re competing amongst ourselves.
There’s no collaboration at my school because we feel like we’re against
each other. It’s very frustrating. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady who said she’s a fifth grade teacher. Did you say fifth grade?
No, Oh, middle school. I think you mentioned moral too earlier in your
comments. I think moral has been a problem. I think moral, is in part,
just because…</p>

<p id="70:00">
Have to go through to try and manage this right now, because if we did
double down and we were wrong - not because you're right in an ideal
sense - but we have this less than ideal democratic process we have to
go through. We may not have realized that and the process we could have
created other challenges along the way. That's why it goes slow in the
process, and I know it's hard for others from the outside to understand.
But, just to let you know I'm sympathetic to it, but I'm also
sympathetic to similar arguments that have been had by others who were
trying to manage this complex process we've - for whatever reason -
volunteered to get involved in. I'm afraid that we are-- because I'm
just afraid members are going to start coming through that door - We
have session starting at 1 o'clock today, that we're not going to be
able to continue the discussion.  But I did want to tell you a little
bit about the process forward. We have, I've got all the subject matter
up here, and we didn't get the common core. But I'll tell you about how
we may be able to get back to common core and some of the other things
that we wanted to talk about. With the superintendents we've had working
groups established around much of these subject matter areas. And what I
will task my staff with doing is trying to find a way where this group
finds representation in these working groups. So that, from the group
that was invited today and those who attended, we can potentially have
you paired up and have you become a part of the process that the
principals, the superintendents and teachers, will report back on the
subject areas. We'll figure out how to do that. But we will share with
you all anything that we share with the other two groups, so you can see
what's going on. And then we will find some sort of a process framework
where you feel like you're a part of that process. And it may be
identifying those who can speak for the group or find ways to
communicate. The other thing that we're doing is we're putting together
a web tools, and we will have web tools on different focus areas. One of
them will be education. And the purpose of that will be to provide you
all, either with a direct feedback - as in I don't like NC Falcon I
think it should be cut, and I'm perfectly proud to put my name next to
it - or to I really don't like this, but I don't want to be known as the
person who said I didn't like that. So a web portal-- I see some knowing
looks in the room so I'm guessing you've ideas that fit into both of
those categories. But it would be a way for you to give us feedback.
Because we want to treat this like a regulatory reform process for
education. One of the things that the state or DPI is requiring of you
that you from where you set see no value. And then our responsibility is
to either communicate back to you why we think there is a value, or you
may have identified a darn good thing that we oughta stop doing. So this
is an iterative process, and I would expect us to have the first version
of the website up over the next few weeks. I'm pushing our IT staff and
others to do that. But that would give you feedback mechanism. And in
the meantime, first off you should definitely have Joe's e-mail address
- we'll send out a follow up to this message - but his e-mail address is
Joe.nolan@NCLAG.net. Anytime you hear something that comes up, feel free
to communicate back to us. I would encourage you - if you haven't
already - to go on the legislative website and at least sign up for
e-mail updates on matters that come through the education policy
committee. If you go to NCLAG.net and you drill down on committees - and
we can provide you with some instructions if you have trouble finding
it. It's fairly straight-forward. Then you can be notified when the
education policy committee is meeting. You can be notified what bills
are coming up. And actually you can even listen in on the internet to--
I think education is in 544, right? So it's broadcast on the internet?
So you can actually listen to it, and I think that it may even be
available after the session. But that's a way for you to feel a little
bit more engaged in this process. And if you hear about a bill that's
filed and you can't find it, contact my office and we'll find out where
it is, and we'll give you some sense of whether or not it's just a bill
that's ?? filed or a bill that may move. There's a big difference. And
again, let's create a process that just grows and has more teachers and
more principals and superintendents involved in the process. And, you
know, if we-- I think if we harness the combined power capability
mind-power in this room, and another of others in classrooms today, then
we can really do something different than has been done in the past. And
that really is my goal.</p>

I appreciate you all coming today and I know that many of you had to get
substitutes. How many of you had to get substitutes to get out of your
class? Did any of you have to pay personal funds to do it? See my staff
afterwards. I don't intend to make you have to personally pay to come
here. I suspect that there were a few of those so, if there was anybody
that personally had to take a cut out of their already small paycheck to
be here, I want to figure out what we can do, within the rules, to
compensate you for that. I appreciate you coming. I hope you know that I
sincerely want you involved and you'll make us better at what we do.
Thank you.</p>
