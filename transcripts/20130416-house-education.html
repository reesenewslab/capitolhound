very briefly on the Amendment he just changes the title to more
accurately reflect parts one and two where as originally we had a little
bit more in there so with that I ask, yes.
[speaker changes] Representative Glazier? Representative Glazier has
moved for an option on the Amendment All those in favor?  All opposed?
Ayes have it. That's fine go ahead and continue.
[speaker changes] I will simply conclude with, I will stand by for
questions, but I ask for your support with House Bill 588. Thank you.
[speaker changes] Do we have any questions?  Representative Lucas.
[speaker changes] Madame Chair at the appropriate time I wanted to move
in favor of a report to the PCS unfavorable to the original bill as it
is amended.
[speaker changes] Thank you, Representative Lucas.  We have one other
person, alright, he decided not he must have been making a motion.  So
Representatives Lucas motion is before us, oh yes, Representative Lucas?
[speaker changes] Yes, we need to roll the Amendment into the PCS,
favorable to the PCS, unfavorable to the original bill.
[speaker changes] All those present in favor of the motion say
&quot;Aye,&quot; all opposed, no?  Well it passes. Representative
Whitmire congratulations on your bill.  The next bill we are going to
have before us is Representatives Starnes Bill, House Bill 269.  This is
also a PCS, do I have a motion?  Representative Brown makes a motion
that House Bill 269 proposed committee substitute be before you.  All
those in favor, all opposed?  Alright, go ahead Representative.
[speaker changes]  Thank you Madame Chair.  Colleagues, we are here
today on House Bill 269, Children with Disabilities Scholarship Grants,
because our children are not interchange able parts.  They all have
different needs and children with disabilities have particular long
lists of needs.  This particular bill will create special education
scholarship grans for children with disabilities.  In the last session
we past House Bill 344 which was tax credits for families with children
with disabilities.  This is an extension of that.  We are repealing that
previous tax credit and turning to a scholarship grants for a number of
reasons, some of which you will hear from my colleagues today.  We have
current law for the tax credits, this PCS is going to set up this
special education scholarship grant no more than three thousand dollars
per semester for reimbursement of tuition and special education
expenses.  The eligibility is in the bill as you can see if you follow
along with me, it's a child with a disability who is under the age of
twenty two who meets all of the following requirements.  They've got to
have an IEP, an Individualized Education Plan.  They've got to receive
special education or related services on a daily basis.  They have not
been placed in a non public school or facility by a public agency at
public expense.  They have not spent any time in enrolled in a post
secondary institution as a full time student taking at least 12 academic
credit hours.  They have not received a high school diploma.  And then
they meet at least one of the following requirements.  They were either
enrolled in a North Carolina public school during that previous
semester, they received special education or related services through
the public school as a preschool child with a disability during the
previous semester, they received a scholarship grant or the tax credit
through last years program in the previous semester or they are eligible
for enrollment in kindergarten or the first grade in a North Carolina
public school.  So those are the eligibilities and in effect these are
the exact same children that our tuition tax credit, that got ninety
four votes last session, it's the exact same children that that tax
credit applied to as well.  If you'll notice there is a fiscal impact,
there is going to be no impact for 13-14 and then it will go to
approximately 2.2 to 2.5 million for each year from there on.  At this
point I would like to turn it over to my colleagues.  Representative
Brandon.
[speaker changes]  Thank you Madame Chair.  Thank you committee members.
 I raise to support the bill.</p>

<p id="10:00">
I am a sponsor of the bill because last year we did a similar bill, but
I talked to representative stam and others to let them know that, most
of the people that I needed to be able to have access to this
scholarship, was not actually eligible, due to the fact that they did
not actually pay income taxes. This eliminates that problem and those
people that we really targeted and that we got 94 votes last year on,
the ones that aided the most actually now will be able to benefit from
this. I had one parent that called me, one that I really wanted to be
able to have it, because her kid has special needs and he was in the
public schools and it was clearly just not working out, and she was so
excited about the bill being passed, and I had to tell her the bad news,
that she did not qualify, and I can imagine that there are probably
thousands of other families just like that, who are under the poverty
lines and really looking for choice, looking for somewhere where they
can have an adequate education for their children. I would like to say
also that this is not saying that public schools do not adequately serve
some children with special needs, but this is a bill about choice, and
if the parent, especially a parent with special needs children, no one
pays more attention to those children more than those parents, if those
parents decide, if they make the decision, that they want to be able to
have their children educated in the institution of their choice and I
think that it is incumbent upon this body to create the opportunity and
access for them to do so, thank you and I urge you to support the bill
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, madam chairman, members of the committee, I just want to say
briefly, I want to thank my colleagues for allowing me to be one of the
sponsors of this good bill. There’s not so many pieces of legislation
where we can truly say it’s a win, win, win situation, but this is. It’s
a win for the public schools, it saves them money, it’s a win for the
taxpayers of North Carolina, because it saves them money, but more
important than anyone else it’s a win for the child, the child with a
disability in this case, because that child and that child’s family can
make the decision that best suits him or her, and that’s really what
it’s all about, we’re here to serve the citizens of North Carolina, and
we’re here to make sure that they have the opportunity to get the best
services that they need, and that’s exactly what this bill does, so it
is a privilege to be a part of a win, win, win bill. I had the
opportunity the privilege if you will to be one of the sponsors of the
tax credit bill that passed in the last session, and I will tell you,
that of all the bills that I had the opportunity to be part of, bills
that I think were good bills that became laws, I don’t think that I got
any more personal satisfaction of any one of having families, parents,
hardworking families from all over the state of North Carolina that
contacted me personally to thank me for that bill, just to be able to
see the lives change one life at a time of a disabled child that was
able to access the services that their family felt like they best
needed, so members I would urge your support of this good bill, it is a
privilege for me to be on it and I would like to thank my colleagues for
allowing me to do so.
[Speaker Changes]
Do you want to speak first representative stone?
[Speaker Changes]
Very briefly
[Speaker Changes]
Okay
[Speaker Changes]
I’m here to answer questions both technical and not and I just had this
one thing, like Representative Jones, for passing this bill, I received
love letters from parents who used it. I also received hate letters for
parents who did not qualify saying “why not? Why because I’m too poor
did I not qualify?” we have to rectify this. Thank you, all of us to be
glad to answer questions
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, before I go any further I did want to explain the format, and
that is, we will have our legislators ask the questions they wish to
ask, I have some one here for DPI that would like to speak and I have
five other people in the audience that would like to speak, but before I
do that even, I did miss someone very special or a group that’s very
special here today. We have the representatives of the student
government association of the community colleges, if you will stand
please, let us welcome you
[Applause]
Thank you, we expect you to soon be sitting in our seats, alright, let
me give you the list of the people I have to speak in case I have missed
your name</p>

Fisher, Graham, Gill, Presnell, Adams, Speciale, and Whitmire, and
Luebke.
Alright, Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chairman. I think I have a bogus mic. I'm going to ask
this really loudly. Can you give me some examples of how the award is
being used or will be used?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. A paradigm example, a matter of fact the case that brought this to
the attention of the Assembly. The Petrooks in Mecklenburg actually
testified a couple of years ago. Their child was of average intelligence
but had a disability wherein he could not learn if there was any noise
or distraction. So Charlotte-Mecklenburg hired a aid to go around with
him, and I'm estimating about $30,000 a year with benefits, to go into
regular classes. He still couldn't learn. With this bill, he's able to
go to a private school that costs $9,000 a year. This covers $6,000 so
his parents are able to pay 3, but not 9, and he's in a class with four
kids and learning tremendously.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher, does that answer your question? Representative
Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, madame Chair. As someone who's been in the trenches and
fought the battles and worked for parents and worked in IEP meetings and
had several conversations similar to what Representative Stan has talked
about, we know we have children who are in our public schools that the
IEP has not been effective for those children. And we just talked about
the IEP. An IEP, obviously, is put together by a multidisciplinary group
that's been reasonably calculated put in force to allow that child to
have benefit in his special education program, in his education overall.
Public schools do a great job. I was privileged to have worked 31 years
in the public school system. I do know there are children in our public
schools who are receiving special education services that may benefit
from a different type class setting. I think this bill gives that parent
an opportunity as an IEP team member for their child to explore those
alternatives and options for that special education and education
program. I like the bill because it does give the parent an option to
persue other alternatives for their child. That's why I support the
bill. The parent, as an IEP team member, they can disagree with the IEP
team. This opportunity allows that parent an option to look at a
different classroom setting. Of course, coming from a rural county, we
don't have a lot of private schools in our county. In the urban
settings, parents have many more options. Saying that, I do support this
opportunity for a parent to have this option and I will support the
bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Graham. Representative Gill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning and thank you Miss Chairman. I just wanted to ask a couple
of things. I notice that you're saying $3,000 per semester per eligible
child and that's a total of $6,000 a year. I guess I'm wondering what is
going to happen to the parent who cannot afford to pay the difference
between the cost of the non-public school and the amount of scholarship
that is available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are two answers. First of all, that parent could not have afforded
it anyway. This bill doesn't solve all problems. It just gets them
$6,000 a year closer to a solution. But, the second answer is this:
there are many schools, practically all private schools are non-profits
and if you get close enough</p>

<p id="20:00">
To what you need, they'll provide scholarships of their own. And I have
actually written commitments from the supervisors of some of the major
organizations to encourage their schools to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I noticed that when we were in the appropriation, education
appropriation subcommittee, they talked about the ADM that are being
provided to schools, and they list them as three different categories:
mild, moderate, severe. I think the mild, I think the state allocation
is about $2,000, and the moderate is 5,000 and the severe is 10,000. I'm
wondering, the monies that are going to be used for scholarship
purposes, are they coming out of that ADM for the students with
disability funds?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would attempt a brief explanation and then ask staff to finish it. My
explanation, my understanding is that the federal money comes, sort of
lags 27 months behind, so that you don't actually lose it to start with,
but of course understand that if the school loses the, if the money is
spent, so is the expense. Those expense is lost as well. Madam chair,
can I ask staff to further explain that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Stam. Okay. Go ahead, Nordstrom.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hi, Chris Nordstrom from Fiscal Research staff. The current formula for
children with disabilities is they receive the, we call the normal base
ADM amount, but they also receive the additional amount of $3,709 per
student, up to 12.5% of that LEA's population. So this, if those
students are reduced from the roles of that LEA, then they would also
lose that $3,709 per student. Assuming that LEA is under that cap. If
they're over the cap, then there would be no, no reduction to their
total disabilities allotment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Representative Gill, was that. Was she satisfied, Representative
Gill? Were you satisfied with your? Okay. Representative Presnell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I just wondered, approximately how many disabled children is this
going to benefit in a year time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's in the fiscal memo, but Chris Nordstrom would have the answer at
the tip of his tongue, Madam chair. Probably.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chris, Chris Nordstrom, can you answer that for her? Representative
Presnell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one moment here. Can I get back to you in one second.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, we'll, we'll hold that. I'll go back to her. Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay well, on page four of the fiscal memo. Anyway, we'll come back to
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair. I guess I have the same concern that
Representative Gill raised, and that was the question I was going to
ask. I have a concern about those parents who would not be able to ??
those $3,000, and I think when you're talking about the poorest of folk,
$3,000 is an awful lot of money for them to come up with, so I have a
concern about that, but I, let me just ask you about the sections of the
bill that were repealed. Section one and section two, and let me make
sure that I'm clear about it. What was in section one addressed children
who were moderate to severe, is that correct, Representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The statute being repealed has exactly the same criteria as regards to
the disability of the child as the new bill. And there were, it did not,
it was not based on moderate or severe, but the criteria in, the same
criteria as in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What is being repealed is the tax credit. The Senate is allergic to tax
credits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, follow up, madam chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So it's not a tax deduction now, that's what's been repealed. It's a
refundable credit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No ma'am, it's not a credit at all. It was a non-refundable tax credit
as passed by the House last session.</p>

<p id="25:00">
What this bill does is create a scholarship grant that's operated
through the SEAA, the state education assistance authority which has
been around for decades, mainly handling or only handling college loans,
and they'll get a 2% administrative fee for this, but there are no tax
credits, tax deduction, tax exemptions in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One more question madame Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So as I read it, so how do they acquire the $3000, the
$6000 dollars then?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The parents acquire it by submitting receipts to the
SEAA for tuition actually paid and or educational and other related
expenses, and that is a defined term under the code of federal
regulations, it goes for many pages as to what those expenses are. They
present their receipts to the SEAA and the SEAA can adopt rules of how
to do that, and that's why they get 2% for administration, is to give
them the opportunity to make sure the money was actually spent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair, just one more quick...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, one more follow up, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So getting back to the child whose parents don't have
the $3000, they qualify for the $6000, what happens then?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well the example I gave to Representative Fisher was
only an example. If they can find the educaiton they want for $6000 then
they owe nothing extra. If it's $20,000 they'll either come up with
$14,000 or nothing. But whatever it is they're $6000 closer to being
able to afford it than without the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do want to remind this bill does go to finance and I
believe appropriations so maybe we can have a little time in there. Was
that satisfactory, did you get your questions answered?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well it wasn't quite satisfactory but I'll yield at
this point, thank you madame Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale [??]. I'm going to get that
name right before the two years...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's [??], but my questions have been answered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair. Question for Representative
[??] and I think you got an answer. On line 16 where it requires an
individual educaiton plan some discussion about whether or not that IEP
requires special ed related services on a daily basis or a non-daily
basis. And could you just talk to that please briefly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, if you look at line 16 and 17 on page one of the
PCS, they have to have an IEP and receive the services on a daily basis,
but the IEP does not have to require that it be on a daily basis and
there's several reasons for this. First of all that's existing law in
the existing tax credit situation, that's not a change. Secondly if you
required that, that the IEP do that then that can become incredibly
expensive for your LEA's if the kid decides not to go to a private
school. Understand it's the public school that is the gate keeper for
this, the IEP is obtained at the public school not at a private school,
and it even has to be renewed once every three years at state expense,
not at LEA expense.
So number one it would be potentially it could be too expensive for the
local, but secondly you may well have a situation, let's take speech
pathology for example where the IEP, the multidisciplinary team says,
okay, this kid needs speech pathology and we've got a teacher who will
go around once a week and help him, that's what we've got. But the
parent sees that it really helps and so the parent says I want to get
speech pathology every day of the week and the my kid will really do
well. That's what we want, we want parents to be able to make that
decision. They have to provide the services in order to be reimbursed
but we don't want that to have to be required in the IEP. Madame Chair
it turns out I have an amendment for a typo. So whenever you want to
take care of it [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's just go ahead and take care of it if you want
to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have someone? Representative Pittman moves that we-  in favor of
the amendment. All those in favor? Opposed? The amendment passes. Now,
our next speaker is- I mean, our next representative is Representative
Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. I guess my question is for the senior sponsor of
the bill, Representative Stam. Well, in terms of seniority and probably
who really wrote it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We all wrote it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah. Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have seven grandchildren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, and this may be for staff if not for you, the bill
on page 1 and 2 references what the bill's summary on page 1 nicely
characterizes as scholarship grant eligibility, and I think that's very
helpful. My first question is, what about school eligibility? In other
words, what characteristics have to be- programs have to be at the
school in order for the parent to enrol her or his child in this school?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, they have to meet the requirement, so on page 1, lines 32 to 34 of
non-public rules, and then they have to- and this is between them and
SEAA. They have to actually pay for the services. Now, they don't have
to get all the services at that non-public school, so for example, the
student could go to XYZ private school, pay $3000 tuition, and then get
special needs services like a psychologist once a day for the other
money. So that's the answer to your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am, absolutely. So, I can go to- I can send my child to- my son
is 34, so I wouldn't send him to school- but I could send my child to
XYZ academy which has absolutely not a single program or employee who
can deal with disabilities, I can nonetheless be eligible for this
grant?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you also paid for and received the defined special educational and
related services defined in federal law every day, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I follow up, Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, my son is at XYZ academy, no services are provided by staff, there's
no program at the school, but I spent $3000 a semester on a psychologist
who is a private psychologist. Does that make me eligible for the grant?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you receive that on a daily basis, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I speak on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke is recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. Well, members of the committee and the public
out there, do you see what we have here? We have a bill in which a
parent can receive $3000 a semester and this is really nothing to do
with schools. This is a $3000 grant for the parent to use where she or
he wants. I guess the student could be home-schooled. It just seems to
me- first of all, I just find that extraordinary that the school doesn't
have to have any plan with respect to the disability of the child,
number one. And number two, why are we taking this money away from the
public schools? I mean, this is a &quot;cheap one&quot;. I'm saying that
in quotation marks. It's 3.4 million. I think you had one yesterday,
Representative Stam, that's near 90 million, if I got that right, but I
think my larger question in why I can't support this bill, besides the
first thing that a school has no obligations to have a disability
program, is that you are taking this money away from the public schools.
90%, as I understand it, 92% of the children in this state-</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, I wondered that at the beginning.  The purpose is
two-fold.  Number one, voters now get developed for two people, two
school board members, instead of one, so they can be assured they will
be voting for a school board member representing their child's school.
That's number one.  Number two, voter turnout has been abysmal in these
school board races.  I just read you the numbers.  Basically a million
votes county-wide for county commissioner race and less than 50,000 for
a school board race county-wide.  So they're the two reasons.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Why couldn't we just change the date of the election cycle, if that was
the goal, rather than changing the districts themselves.  And if the
districts are going to be changed, why don't we give that control to the
school board itself so they can hold appropriate hearings, receive
public comment, and come up with districts that they feel are
appropriate for Wake County, the way we would typically do it in any
other of the other hundred counties in this state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Basically, Senator McKissick-
Here is the transcription for this HIT:
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
-attend public schools, and the governor's budget actually hurts public
schools by taking away teaching assistants.  You are on your way here to
underfudning public schools and I just think it's wrong to be on this
campaign against the traditional public schools, so, members, I'm not
supporting this bill.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I hate to say that I do agree with at least one thing Representative
Luebke said in his remarks.  This bill is indeed extraordinary, and it
is extraordinary in that the focus here, folks, is on the child.  It's
not on the institution.  It's not on who is providing the services.  The
focus is on the child and the fact that the needed services are
provided.  As opposed to some of the other things that he said as far as
where the money is going, what we are actually doing here is allowing
the family of this child to make the choice to put their disabled child
in a situation that best helps his or her needs while going to school
and getting an education.  As Representative Stam said, if that means
actually going outside the school setting to be able to obtain the help
that they need, then so be it.  We want to focus on the child here, not
on the institution.  We're not taking money away from the public schools
in the sense that we are defudning public schools.  What we are doing
is, when money follows the child, it is going towards their education.
But as has been pointed out already, in most cases, it costs more for
the public school to educate this disabled child, so in the long run
we're actually saving the money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, m'am.  A couple of questions, one to Representative Jordan.  You
indicated in your remarks that you said that this was not going to cost
any money for the 2013-14 school year and I'm looking at the explanation
here that says that 3.6 million is incorporated ?? for the 2013-14
fiscal year.  Am I not seeing ?? correctly or what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, are you looking at page one of the fiscal notes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, sir, I'm looking at page three of the explanation, bill explanation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  On the fiscal note- does everyone have a copy of the fiscal note?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, we do not have a copy of the fiscal note.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The impact to 2013-14 is zero we have on our fiscal note.  You're
referring to page three of the description, Representative Michaux?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.  ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, we have the current tax credit in place that is
offsetting that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, would you like me to come back to you?  I'm
having staff go get the report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  I got another question about something Representative Stam said,
which sometimes is muddled.  Representative Stam, you said in order to
get this grant, that tuiton actually paid should be shown and that it
would be based on that.  Tell me how you get a poor kid in a private
school with tuition paid and then that's going to help that person get
that $3,000 grant or whatever grant you got there.  Now, what you said
was that you were shown that tuition actually paid by the receipts and
whatnot, which means that that child would go to that school and whatnot
and have to pay before they get in, and then, once they show that, then
they would be about to refund that money.  Did you mean to say that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it depends on the policy of that school.  The answer is yes.  Not
every school will do that, but certainly the schools that want to
receive these students will do it.  As I've said, I've talked to the
heads of Catholic schools and the ?? School Association and the
Independent School Association, which covers most of the private schools
and they're perfectly happy to work with parents if they know the money
is coming.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, one more follow up.  We'll come back to you too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? I'm just trying to figure out a kid gets into that school having to
get into that school and then being reimbursed or whatever or given a
grant after they show the receipt that tuition's been paid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And you say that-</p>

You have talked all these schools but we don’t have any assurance well
that’s gonna happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, Representative Shaw that’s no different than the current law where
you have apply a year later for a tax credit. Your argument and the
argument of Representative Luke is with the existing law not this bill
I’m with this because at least this bill will cover the poor children.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I didn’t vote for this because…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let’s go to the Chair here, Representative Mitchell will get back with
you as soon as we have the Adam will let you speak again. Let me go
through the list again to make sure I have everybody that’s Lucas,
McManus, Warren, Shepard, Cleveland and Collins. And then for speaking
at second time I have Glazier, Gram and Mitchell. Oh, I’m very sorry put
Glazier after Warren, alright, Representative Lucas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair, question initially for Representative Stam,
Representative Stam I believe on line 16 of the bill that indicates that
an IP is required for each child to be eligible for this program, is
that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you concede that if an IP has been developed by school officials,
psychologists, social workers, teachers and the parents that this IP is
sufficient enough to serve that child’s needs that they determine,
professionally that this will suit the child’s needs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, Representative Lucas I have spoken to way too many parents here in
Wake County and Wake County does a great job on special aid kids, I have
spoken to way too many parents who said, “This IP does not work for my
child.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand what's another question, is that only from the parent’s
prospective not psychologist, not social workers, not teachers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s right parents and the child, right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, you need to follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do need to follow up not with Representative Stam but with
Representative Adam perhaps Representative Brandon and perhaps
Representative Jones. I heard Representative Brandon mentioned that
students or parents who pay no taxes whatsoever are eligible for this
bill then I heard Representative Jones say that they are hard working
parents and I’m trying to determine where you find hard working parents
who pay no taxes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We are talking about income taxes Representative Lucas and I do pay
taxes that I pay taxes everyday and when they go by food and drinks and
all of the things that they do to help to stayed up which is a lot of
our arguments with the people who say that these hard working people
don’t pay taxes, they actually do pay taxes. But we are actually talking
about the income tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comment on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, let’s say…Okay, for comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I’m from the conservative prospective and many of you may not
believe that and sometimes I get confused what's conservative and what's
liberal here? Now, we are going to allow students who have a sufficient
program provided for the educational needs and we are going to allow
these parents who decide that, “Oh, I don’t wrote that.” Simply because
they decided that they don’t want this but they want the chair pick and
get something new. They gonna have ice cream rather than the potatoes
that they need and I have a problem with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas, it was fine, you are right, this is a very
progressive issue and it is very progressive to think that the parent
and stakeholder would actually know what is actually needed for their
child and because they go to bed with them every night, they spend more
time than any educator does, and if you can name one parent who does not
know what's best for their child.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can get it but this is a progressive policy, yes it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative, Representative McManus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mic on…Mic.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that going?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s better.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It just get really close, I had an appointment…

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This question's for staff. Chris?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Chris Nordstrom, fiscal research. Yes, LEAs receive a flat amount
per student up to the 12.5% cap. The system that was described earlier
was an alternative in a 2010 report from a consultant of something for
the fiscal- for the general assembly to possibly consider but is not
current policy. Current policy is the flat amount up to the 12.5% cap.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You want to speak on the bill? You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? the child and if that's what this is still about, but if we were
really concerned about serving the child and the child was truly not
getting its needs met in the public school system, then would ?? get ??
funding? I feel like this is serving the parent by reducing their cost,
we're still leaving a lot of people who would not be able to afford to
put their child  in private services, particular private EC type
services which tend to be more expensive than regular private services.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that you are absolutely 100% correct, and I would love to have a
bill that would do that. I do think that if we- you know, sometimes we
get here and we play these games but if we had a bill that gave full
funding to poor folks, everybody would be up in arms talking about how
much money we're taking out of public schools. So but now that we don't
have it people say it doesn't go far enough, so we can go back and forth
with that, but I've certainly would support any bill that would give
poor parents the 100% funding. And I hope that if that happens that we
won't hear from the usual crowd that it takes money out of public
schools and would support that bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. McMannis?
Yes. Rep. Warren, and then Rep. Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair. Rep. Stam, if I could ask you a question, when it
was brought up just a second ago that if a child has an IEP, wouldn't
that be adequate, but wouldn't an IEP at a public school be based on the
school's ability to address those needs specific to the resources that
the school has available, which may not be comparable to a specialized
school.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's the problem, Rep. Warren, and IEP is a collaborative document,
but it has to be done within the rational resources of that system. And
often times, it's just not adequate for every child.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Additionally, earlier there was a concern that if the grant or
scholarship was around $6000 but the tuition of the school is maybe 20-
$8200 or $9000, where would that $3000 come from? You said that you
would talk to three different branches of private schools. Don't most of
them offer some type of scholarship program themselves that reduces it?
I know for a fact when I first got elected here, I had to take advantage
of that because of the reduction of our incomes at home, and the school
that we had for our daughters was flexible. So they do have, you find
that they do have payment plans, and scholarships that they offer that
reduces that for folks in need.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Many but not all have those policies and funds. And it'll be much more
achievable with this bill than without it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
I like the bill and I like what you're trying to do, and I haven't seen
any bill come out of the general assembly that's absolutely perfect and
addresses every individual scenario that could possibly conceivably come
up, but I think what your bill does is widen the door and increase the
opportunity for a lot of folks, and Madam Chair, if no one's offered, at
the appropriate time I'd like to be recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Noted.
Rep. Glazier for the first time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair.
I've got 2 questions and then a comment, brief questions. I'm on the
funding issue, Rep. Stam, is there a cap on the number of students which
scholarships are available? And then in that sense, how do we arrive at
the figure for the next academic year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The cap is the amount of the appropriation, which is in the bill in
section 5a. So if they run out of money,</p>
  
  
  <h3>50:00</h3>
  <h3><audio src="audio/chunks/20130416-house-education.50.00.mp3" preload="none" controls></audio></h3>

<p id="50:00">
they run out. That's a good estimate based upon the last two years what
staff thinks will be adequate. But, even though there is that
appropriation, that's not the cost because it is offset by the repeal of
the tax credit. So therefore the fiscal memo which you are getting shows
no cost in thirteen fourteen and about two and a half million in
subsequent years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up on that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So just I'm clear and I know this goes to finance and maybe all this can
get worked out there. But, if you end up with a thousand more kids than
you expect applying for this, you are stuck with the appropriation
amount, does that mean it's first come first serve or does that mean
that overall the scholarship amount gets reduced per person. I'm just
curious what you do if there's more. Or does the bill address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I forget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's the other bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chris Nordstrom.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does mister Nordstrom what we put-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe there's prioirity to those who recieve the tax credit the
prior year otherwise they're provided on a first come first serve basis
or the order which the applications are recieved.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry that's lines six through eight of page two. Sorry I forgot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. My last question, madam chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is a couple lines right down from that. And I just want to be sure I
understand. So if I'm home schooling my child, I do have to provide
documentation that I've put in place special education related services
that I then essentially get reimbursed for. Am I correct that I can't
just get a three thousand dollar check for having home schooled my kid
and saying I'm specially educating them. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct. The home school gets no reimbursement for tuition or for
being in the home school. Only for actual therapeutic services as
defined.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then my final comment. This has been an issue that most of you have been
here long, like representative Johnson and representative Stam know that
I've been involved in a long time and tried to figure out how to handle
what I agree with representative Brandon is not the best easy services
for a lot of kids, in my view, particularly for high school, I think
they do a better job in elementary and middle school. And I did not vote
for the bill last year because of my concern of where it's going to go
and how uncapped it is and because it involves every potential kid who
has a disability. I had sponsored a bill with representative Stam a few
years prior and representative Lucas that was tied in to the more
serious disabilities. I still think that at some point we're going to
need to do that to control the cap and the money. I think the public
schools are fully capable of serving most special needs kids particular
those who are A D D or A D H D. They are less capable of serving those
who are cerebal palsy, who are autistic, in some cases, more severely. I
mean there are real issues and because, and this is going to surprise my
colleagues, but because as I am sitting here, I did vote against the
bill last year but this bill is a fix to what is already in law to
create some capacity to get to some of the more need students who are
poor. Because I view that is all it is doing, with my reservations about
the first bill and my reservations about the need to put in a cap on the
most serious concerns, I'm going to vote for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I answered my own questions. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam ask that I remind everyone that it goes to finance
and I'm not sure if it goes to appropriations, we'll check.
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question has been answered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First time representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to raise a comment, madam chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Never ceases to amaze me the arguments I hear around here in committees
and on the floor. One of the arguments I usually hear is that the public
schools don't- are at a disadvantage financially because they have to
take everyone that comes and that they have to educate people who have
special needs that require extra expenditures and that the private
schools and other schools can cherry pick and can take the best
students. And therefore the public schools are at a financial
disadvantage that way. Now I'm hearing, now that we're trying to take
some of these children who are more expensive to educate and take them
into another setting, I'm hearing that somehow is taking money away from
the public schools. I don't know how you get on both sides of that
argument. But it looks like to me financially, the more successful this</p>

<p id="55:00">
The program is. The more we're doing financially for the public schools.
So I certainly support this bill as a supporter of our public school
system. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you representative Collins.
Representative Bail, I believe your first time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes. I
just wanted to say, this is sort of a turn from what I'm accustom to.
Cause usually in the schools that I'm familiar with. The private would
always would send their special needs children to the public schools for
help because we had the psychologist ability where they did not have.
And every time we'd receive money we had to offer it. ?? So I was just
wondering. Private school were gonna have all these special person's all
of a sudden. [SPEAKER CHANGES] More and more will. And with this bill
even more and more and more will. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Adams, would you like to speak before Michaux addresses this. Fiscal
note? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I would. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Adams. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you madam chair. I am one of those who
believe in public education and the fact that a larger majority of our
children are gonna be there. And we must educate them but I just have
some problems. I'm still wondering how, you know, we're talking about
poor children. Children live in poverty because of their parents live in
poverty. And so I have to be concerned about the parents who I know just
cannot afford this.  So whether we would agree that it takes funding
from the public schools I can guarantee you that its going to create
some flight from public schools and I think that's what this bill is
designed to do. But I think that in spite of all of that, we have got to
have some guarantees that if these are the children that we wanna help,
there must be an opportunity for them to take advantage of this and if
there's no money. If their parents don't have it, they will not get this
opportunity and we just need to be clear about that and honest within
ourselves about it. It's not going to happen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you representative. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I respond to that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes representative Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mrs
chair. Representative Adams, I totally agree with you 100%. But I would
disagree with the fact that it's not gonna happen. Because most of the
time, and students in ?? County where we both serve.  I've talked to a
number of them and they both agree that they would use the scholarship
program to offset most of the cost and that they would guarantee those
spots. I think that the case that's least likely to happen is someone
not being accepted because they cant afford the additional 2, 3 thousand
dollars. I think that's the exception and not necessarily the rule.
Because I think at the end of the day, without even what we have right
here right now. And if anybody, if a parents come here. You have to
remember that people are in this business to educate. No one's in the
business. I mean we have all types of accusations. Why we do things. But
a person that is in school and they run a school, they're in the
business because they care about kids. Most of them. They care about
kids and they want to educate them. And most, and we talk about the
parents and what that can do. Most parents, you can always find one or
two parents that could, might wanna do something crazy. But 99% of the
parents are not gonna send their kids to a school that's not gonna
address their needs. If they're out there looking for solutions, it
would be mind boggling to me that you would go and spend extra money to
a school that does not address the needs. To me it's almost a false
argument. It's just a hypothetical that might happen 0.5 percent of the
time. But 99.5 percent of the time, the parents will choose a school
that best suits their needs. And schools that are in the business of
educating folks. Will work with people to make sure that they can
educate those folks. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you representative Brawley.
Representative Michaux, I have representative Hall. Would you like to
defer to him before we go to.. in case he might forget during our period
out. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll defer to representative Michaux. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Okay. Representative. First, members, do you have your fiscal
analysis. Do you have that? okay, representative Michaux. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Okay, thank you madam chair. I'm still going back to the
explanation of the bill as it was sent out by staff which indicates that
3.6 million dollars is appropriate...</p>

The SEAA for 2013 fiscal year and this amount refers to this bill, but
in more particular. After looking at the fiscal note, I still have a
problem. On page 2 of the fiscal note, right at the top it says, the
scholarship grant may only be used for the reimbursement of tuition and
special education fund and related services. Now, what that tells me is
that you're going to have to pay some money up front and then you will
be reimbursed up to a particular point for those special services and
that tuition of what it is going to cost to go to that school and I say
that that is going to cut a whole lot of people out to start with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you representative Micheaux. That is an
important point, however I would look at the reverse. If we were
standing here and we were advancing three thousand dollars per semester
before any services had been provided, I think we would have other
concerns from folks, potentially yourself as well. The issue here that
we have discussed throughout today is that schools will work with folks
on tuition if they know that money is coming from the state. It's not
just hoping that the parent has the credit worthiness to pay for it
later on. They know that something is coming. They will advance that,
they will work with the families to get those students in and so I think
that that's probably the best way to handle this kind of situation as
opposed to granting three thousand dollars outright at the beginning of
the semester. At least this way we know tuition and services have been
provided for the benefit of that student.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Champ, May I-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I know you make a good argument for the bill. My
argument is saying to you that you hope some schools will do this.
Nobody- I don't know any school that has given you a guarantee that they
would do this, number one. Number two is that you were only talking
three thousand dollars a semester, which is six thousand dollars a year.
If that child has a school in their area that provides those special
needs. And that tuition is twenty thousand dollars a year and I take
issue with representative Sam, somebody who is going to do it for nine
thousand. But, even at fifteen thousand dollars a year, or fourteen
thousand dollars a year, you don't have any guarantee that even the six
thousand dollars is not going to pay that full tuition, nor for the
special program. I don't know anybody who is going to go out on a limb
for that, which means that you are cutting out a whole lot of people
other than those who have the means of which to afford this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Representative Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am. I'll share just very briefly. I
believe that Representative Micheaux, your argument is with the
underlying bill as opposed to the improvements that we have made- and
this is the marginal analysis- we are saying that the families that can
not afford now afford it, if they are given an additional three thousand
dollars a semester or six thousand dollars a year, they can then decide
for themselves if they have the budget and can provide for their child
to do that. I think that's wonderful. Is it a one-size-fits-all? No. Our
children are not interchangeable parts. We cannot have a one size fits
all bill that will fit every single situation. The ones on the margin
who can take advantage of this and get better services for their
children are the ones who will benefit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Jordan. I have Representative
Hall and then Representative Speciale and then we're going to hear the
speakers from the audience.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you madam Chair. And I have a couple of
questions, if I could, for any of the bill sponsors. The initial bill
requirement that's being reduced from two semesters to one semester in
2016-Is there a reason why we decided to have a lesser qualification
period?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, the bill said if they can get- Remember the
public school is the gate keeper by providing the IEP. If they can do it
in that first semester, why not? Curiously I spoke to a public school
teacher a week ago who has several IEP students in their class and never
even got the IEP until two months into the semester.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up: so this was intended just for them to get
the IEP, not to see if the IEP works as it is applied through the public
school where the child is getting services. This is just to give the
public school time to help them develop an IEP.</p>

<p id="65:00">
Go and get the private services.
[Speaker Changes]
No, Representative Hall.  If that was the only purpose we could require
them to get the IEP from the public school without even actually
attending the school.  We actually thought about that, but no they have
to attend it and see how it works for at least a semester.
[Speaker Changes]
Follow up, Madam chair?
[Speaker Changes]
Yes
[Speaker Changes]
The priority procedure that you have in place.  Is there a reason why
priority is not being given to children who have somehow a greater need
or some other factor beyond giving priority just to folks who have
previously received a grant?
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Hall, the main purpose of this bill is to put the
children who need it the most whose parents need it the most financially
into the pot.  Under underlying law if you defeat this bill the children
whose parents only pay sales tax, property tax, and 18 other kinds of
taxes will still be non-qualified.  If you want to propose a different
bill to improve their situation even more I’d be glad to look at it.
[Speaker Changes]
Follow up?
[Speaker Changes]
One more, yes.
[Speaker Changes]
But again the sole priority that’s articulated here says they previously
were in the program.  Is that correct?  Is that the intent?
[Speaker Changes]
That is a priority.  That priority is an existing law.  It will be there
whether you vote for this bill or against the bill.  The idea there is
that you don’t want to disrupt the education of children and move them
from school to school to school from year to year unnecessarily, but
that’s not an argument for or against the bill because that’s an
existing law.
[Speaker Changes]
Final follow up Madam chair and then a comment.
[Speaker Changes]
Yes, you want to make both of those together.  You’re on your fourth
follow up and I have people in the audience.
[Speaker Changes]
Ok, well I’ll just make my comment then and skip the follow up question
Madam chair for sake of time.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank You
[Speaker Changes]
I am concerned about the bill about how the priority is set about the
time that families would get the IEP and in fact have time to see if the
IEP works if they’re interested in doing what’s in the best interest of
the child.  And finally I’m concerned about the financing this seems to
set up.  It is an improvement over the previous bill and I don’t think
because we’re doing a bill now we can’t try to improve it as much as we
can.  And understand, Representative Stam, I’m saying that existing bill
is the baseline, but there is no limit on the upside of what we could do
if we could agree on it.  So, regarding the financing for parents where
we’re saying they’re going to be reimbursed, I am concerned that
everyone keeps saying that the schools in good faith will work with the
parents and I hope that we’re not setting up a situation where parents
in essence become, because of a modified IEP requirement, that parents
become sought after and recruited to bring their children to a school
that they can’t afford so then somehow financing is arranged through
some other third party of service and the parents end up being on the
hook for the money that’s supposed to be reimbursed because they signed
for the loan.  And what happens down the road with that, we’ve seen
those abuses and problems in education financing before and specifically
with traditional private schools in the State of North Carolina as well
it has become a problem now.  So, I am concerned about that, I hope as
we go forward we can put some guarantees in the bill to insure not just
the best interests of the children are served if they decide to go to
one of these institutions, but on this issue of having to be reimbursed
that they have an opportunity to get financing without becoming victims
themselves.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, Representative Hall.  I appreciate the fact.  Let me explain
to you that we have a transportation meeting in this meeting which does
not allow us to go all the way to 12 o’clock so we’re moving along a
little further.  We’d like to get to Holloway’s one more bill out of the
committee.  And Representative Speciale this is you’re second time
speaking if you’ll be brief so we can hear from the audience.  OK, now
we’ll hear from those who have asked to speak.  I’ll start with Karen
Dequet, Parent’s for Education Freedom, and then Christopher Hall if
you’ll get in line please.
[Speaker Changes]
Good morning Madam Chair and distinguished members.  I’m Karen Dequet.

<p id="70:00">
To state. I wanted to thank you for the opportunity to speak in support
of HV269, the children with disability scholarship grant. Similar to the
initial tax credit for children with disabilities we are happy to see
that this measure already has strong bipartisan support. And while the
original program was a great start unfortunately as several of yuo have
mentioned, several low income and working class families could not take
advantage of this program due to the refundability issue. Every child
deserves access to the school that best works for them. The scholarship
grants under house bill 269 will provide access for all children with
disabilities to attend the school that best fits their unique and
individual needs. It is certainly a step in the right direction and I
thank you for your leadership on this measure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Christopher Hill and then Donald Bryson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Chair, thank you committee. My name is Chris
Hill, I'm with the North Carolina Justice Center. We oppose house bill
269. It's a voucher program that will drain much needed resources out of
our public schools. The program is capped at $3 million dollars and
there are about 190,000 exceptional children in North Carolina. If every
eligible child received the maximum amount of the voucher per year only
500 students would be served. If that money however was provided to
LEA's and our LEA's it's likely that they can already help more
exceptional children and it actually does take the money from the LEA.
The department of public instruction must adjust allotments based on the
amount of students that receive the grant, so the bill takes money
directly from the public school budgets of an LEA. This voucher will
only serve people who can afford to send their children to private
school already. Low income parents will not be helped by this voucher
program since $6000 is not enough money to send an exceptional child to
any school worth attending and it's likely that any parents who can use
this grant probbaly don't need it.
$6000 dollars is not enough money to educate students with severe
disabilities. The bill requires to say that it's not realistically
available for students with all disabilities because private schools can
choose their students and may refuse to admit students with severe
disabilities. I would just like to say that there was a mention of it's
a win, win, win because we save money. The general assembly has the
constitutional mandate to provide from taxation or otherwise a general
uniform system of free public schools. It does not have a mandate to
provide money to private schools, particularly private schools we don't
know are going to take these children. And so I would say that the issue
is not with giving vouchers, the issue is making sure that this body
lives up to its constitutional mandate to provide funding for public
schools and also that it can provide a sound basic education for all
children. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Donald Bryson, American for Prosperity.
Next will be Tammy Fitzchair [SP].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair, members of the committee, thank you very
much for considering this bill and thank you for the opportunity to
speak. we support house bill 269, we think this is a great bill. The tax
credit is already in place but we think that this is an improvement on
that bill. If anybody who was here a couple years ago remembers the tax
credit received overwhelming bipartisan support. This is an improvement
on the tax credit actually and makes it more accessible for poor
families to get the educaiton for the children that they want. So we
urge you to support the bill. Opponents to this bill will say that this
will create flight from the public school system and children are just
going to leave. There are underlying problems with that argument.
The first assumes that every child with a disability their parents think
that they're getting a terrible education and they will all flee the
public school system. And that assumes that the public school system is
giving a bad education. That's probbaly not the case. I think if you
believe that about the public school system then you probbaly have a bad
opinion about the public school system in the first place. The second
argument is that in states like Florida, there are eight other states
that have similar programs, Florida has the most expansive and the
largest, there's not even a cap on the amount of the scholarship down
there. Of the children that are eligible for that scholarship, less than
4% of the parents are taking it. That means that the parents that really
really need better education for the their children are taking it and
everybody else is generally okay with the education their receiving in
the public school system. That's what's going to happen in North
Carolina. Yes, there is a public, there is a constitutional mandate for
the general assembly to provide good sound public education here for the
children of North Carolina but the first thing that the constitution
says about education in the state constitution is that educaiton should
forever be encouraged. You should encourage better educaiton for all
children. This bill makes it more accessible.</p>

against allowing more access for poor families for access to better
education for the children. We urge you to support the bill. Thank you
for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Brisson. Tammy Fitzgerald with North Carolina Values
Coalition and Julie Adams Arc of North Carolina
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairwoman and members of the committee, I urge you to
support House Bill 269. We believe this is a fair and just use of tax
payer funds because it gives parents more choices. It puts control back
in the hands of the parents, and it removes the state created barrier of
success to children with disabilities. We believe that it allows
opportunity and hope for children who don't presently have that and we
urge you to support the bill. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Julie Adams, Julia Adams. I got the last name right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm just gonna stand her and be quiet.
Thank you Madam Chairwoman and bill sponsors, committee members. My name
is Julia Adams. I am the assistant director of government relations for
the ARC of North Carolina. We are a non-profit organization built on
members whose children with disabilities we serve. We serve them both
within the public school system and within the private school system
currently. This bill in its original format that was passed in the
previous general assembly was brought to us by a concerned parent. That
parent was very active with their pubic school, had their child enrolled
in a public school. Their child had multiple diagnoses including Autism,
intellectual disabilities, and mental disabilities. And after working
very diligently with the public school system they just simply realized
they cannot have everything they really needed for their child, and
their child's academic future was put at risk, and they chose a very
difficult decision to enroll their child in a private school and to seek
their own services outside of the public school system. The original
bill assisted that family and we support this current bill especially
with the changes that have been made that will allow access more readily
for students who are in our low income economic brackets and we
encourage all of you to support and vote for this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. If anyone was present and did not get an opportunity to
speak, if you'll just have your comments written, we'll add them to the
??. Representative Warren, we're ready for your motion. Would you like

I have the proposed committee's substitute before us all those in favor
say I all opposed no. The proposed committee substitute for house bill
719 is before you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam chair, members of
the committee this is house bill 719 this is the house version of the
education reform and I was going to try to go over the entire bill but
I'm going to let representative Glazier go over the remaining parts and
I'm going to cover the two heaviest lifts in the bill in an all out him,
he to go over those parts in more detail if he'd like but I'll let him
cover the remainder of the bill. What this bill does and the two heavy
lifts and before I start with that I do want to say that I'm very proud
to bring this bill to you in the bipartisan format. A lot of work has
been put on into this bill and also I wanted to say that again a
reference to first two parts are two heavy lifts it's two things that
this legislature has talked about for a number of years and that is
performance pay, merit pay, alternative pay, it has many names whatever
you want to call it and career status routine reform and it achieves
both of these, these two ideas. And I'll start off first with the career
status, and what the bill how it changes teacher's career status and
what the bill does is it follows the Colorado model, it creates rather
than have the concept of ??, which is our current law is permanent and
once you achieve it after four years being in the same school system
you've got it for the life of your career. This bill creates the concept
of probationary, non-probationary. All the teachers that today have ??
under this plan would start out with a non-probationary status. They
would not have to earn it they would keep their career status, if you
will, by starting out as non-probationary. But for those teachers who
currently have ?? how this bill changes the game for them is they have
the ability to lose their non-probationary status and how they would
lose that they would lose it by one, having an observation that was
negative and they would have one year to fix it and in one year if they
do not fix it they can then be kicked down to probationary status.
However once being kicked down to probationary status they can be
removed or...</p>

<p id="85:00">
If the school system decides to allow them to continue on they can be
restored to non-probationary status after 2 solid years of good
observations. That's what changes the model for teachers who currently
have tenure. Again, they would start out as non-probationary but they,
under this plan, would have the ability to lose it. This establishes a
performance model: you perform, you stay non-probationary. You don't
perform, you could become probationary. All teachers who are currently
striving to get their career status and it takes 4 years, your first 4
years, you have probationary status. What this bill does is if you are
year 2 of your teaching career then you start out in year 2 toward
achieving non-probationary status. We are not resetting the clock on
anyone and if you're year 3 then you're year 3. So it allows people to
continue with their natural progression under the current model that we
have set up with career status today. Again this bill still requires a
person that takes 4 years to get to that non-probationary without
penalizing those who already started teaching and striving toward that.
The second heavy lift that this bill achieves is it actually comes up
with a way to truly get to an alternative a merit-payer performance
payed plan. We're setting up a commission that the Speaker and the Pro
Tem of the Senate would each appoint 9 members from each chamber that
includes all the stake holders from the education community. From
attending conferences and listen to other states and seeing some of the
things the mistakes that they've made with performance pay. It's a tough
concept, it's a tough plan to implement and I think the most important
thing is to have buy-in from all the stake holders. This bill achieves
that by putting together this commission to say &quot;Bring us a plan,
bring us a plan that we can all agree to, that the state can agree to,
that all the education stake-holders can agree to, and let's move
forward with something that we all can put our name to.&quot; And this
bill does that. In my opinion this is the first real initiative or first
real step to move us towards some type of alternative pay in the state.
And again, the commission is designed and including all education
community so that we have buy-in which I think is very important. There
are 8 parts to the bill. I covered the first 2 but for the sake of time
and have questions and we have 3 others who want to speak, I'm going to
turn it over to Representative Glazier and let him cover the remainder
of the bill and he can touch on anything else that I've already covered
as well if he chooses. Representative Glazier. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you very much Madam Chair and Representative Holloway and Representative
Holloway I think has summarized the key portions of the bill. I call
your attention to page 2 of the bill to the 10 items the task force has
the cover which are on compensation from base compensation all the way
through effective teaching compensation systems and so it's a pretty
comprehensive look at the issue of pay. I will tell you the PCS also
responded to a number of concerns with regard to how the career status
evaluation process would work and tries to tie it into the model that's
being developed through DPI equally weighting all of the standards and
you'll see the changes that are made there. For the remainder of the
bill just to briefly point out part 3 increases professional development
credits 7.5 to 10 and includes competencies relating to digital learning
and innovating and alternative methods of teaching. Section 4 or part 4
of the bill is what we passed already on the House floor. It is a
modification of the A-F standards of that what we're hoping at least do
a little bit a better job of that issue than what came out of the Senate
last year. You'll see part 5 includes school improvement team and school
improvement plans to make sure that those are actually strengthened and
followed and parental input is truly what it's supposed to be. This
language tracks what we've already passed in the school safety bill so
it's in both places. Part 6 of the bill is an academic credit. This is
an exciting project out of Rhode Island to create digital capacity for
extended learning options that students take in clerkships and
internships and summer jobs and this gives DPI a year to put that
together and it is really assisting students and getting credit for
real-time experiences and also therefore accelerating their pace through
high school in rigorous and relevant courses. Part 7 was requested by a
number of different agencies, DPI and our public school</p>

are a member of a medical team at a school, you actually have to have
training so you know what you’re doing because we don’t have that in the
current law. That’s the core of the bill. I’ll turn it over to
Representative Hall and Representative Blackwell and be glad to answer
any questions, but what I will say is I think that this is one of the
best looks at the major issues in a real way that will strengthen public
education, not harm public education and will get teachers that we need,
teachers who are performing and recruit and retain teachers without
hurting the profession. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall and Representative Blackwell, either of you want to
speak? We have an amendment here. Representative Glazier has an
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. Madam Chair, this is really more technical than
anything, but the first two parts eliminate the term beyond the school
term and makes sure we’re very clear that when an employee doesn’t meet
that second year of their time that they’re trying to come back into the
system after losing their career status, that they will be an at will be
employee, hireable and fireable at will at that point, so that’s really
clarifying that. The second part of the amendment is simply adding the
words ‘local school board policy’ so that our whistleblower protection
includes, not only where there’s a violation of law, but also of policy.
I know of no oppositions to these changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do I hear a motion or a discussion? Representative Horn and Iler move
for a favorable report on the adoption of the amendment. All in favor
say aye.

continue at our next meeting. Representative Whitmire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will try to be as efficient with your time as possible. House Bill
587, also like thank my primary sponsors here with me. Representative
Holloway, Glazier, and Blackwell. The objective of 587 is to exempt our
occupation course of study students from mandatory ACT testing. Very
briefly, the occupational course of study…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a moment, Representative Whitmire, I’m sorry, in my speed, I forgot
to get a motion to have this proposed committee substitute me and
Representative Jeter so moved, all those in favor. It’s before us, I’m
sorry. Now you may continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Anyway, the occupational course of study, to give you an idea
of what it is. If you look at our population and you look at it from
term of cognitive ability, we certainly have a broad scope of
intellectual capability. The occupational course of study looks, and is
defined, to serve the students that have an IQ that is between 55 and
70. That is a mental disability, a term often we don’t use as mildly
retarded, but that’s what this occupational curriculum serves. To put
that into more perspective, 2.75</p>
