Senate will come to order. Sargent arms will close the doors. Members
will go to their seats. All members and guests in the gallery will
please stand for our prayer. Let's pray. Dear Heavenly Father God, we
give thanks to you God and we take comfort today God in your word that
tells us where only 2 or 3 are gathered together in your name that you
are in the midst also. God we give you thanks here in North Carolina
for, while there is so much chaos going on in the world, that you have
granted us a season of peace. Dear God we ask that you pour out your
spirit, God, upon this state. That we may be at the forefront of
insuring that your purpose comes forth in this earth. We ask for you to
bless us today, God, as we move forward and as hopefully this session
begins to come to an end. And we offer this prayer in the only authority
given under heaven, the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Senator Stein is
