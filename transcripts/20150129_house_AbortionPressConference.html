  <p id="00:00">
  Good morning, everybody. Let&#39;s go ahead and close the door, if we
could. Good morning, we begin this Press Conference today with members
of the House and Senate and medical experts by praising the Secretary of
Human Health and Services and her staff  for her due diligence with
regard to patient safety in women&#39;s reproductive health clinics. As
demonstrated by the proposed regulations that were promulgated by her
office. After an 18 month review process that fully engaged medical
experts and providers, the proposed regulations improve patient safety
and continue the expert long term care that has been given at these
facilities across North Carolina and,  the regulations are consistent
with the providers own unwavering commitment to patient safety. The new
regulations include among other provisions  on site recovery after
surgery, requirement of the defibrillator at these facilities, written
agreements with nearby hospitals for emergency transfers, a 24 hour
telephone number if complications arise which must be staffed by a
person, not just a recording, a quality assurance board for each clinic
that must have at least one physician who is not the owner, CEO or
designee and finally, annual inspections rather than the past State
practice of inspecting every 3 to 5 years. All of these recommendations
were vetted and approved by those in the medical community as a
responsible policy and furtherance of patient safety. But now, in the
13th hour of this process, several Republican members appear ready to
pull the plug out from the feet of everyone  involved, including the
Secretary of Health and Human Services and their Governor. All of us
standing here and many more in our caucuses had hoped to begin this
session with issues that mattered to all citizens in North Carolina. We
would like to be speaking to you about the vital importance of
addressing our education system and teacher pay and the economy. But
instead, some in the Republican majority, begin this session where they
left off the last time with women&#39;s reproductive health and issues
of marriage. Yesterday, Democrats conferred on jobs with business
leaders. While the Republicans planned a conference to talk about
everyone&#39;s private lives and intimate decisions. Who do you think
was doing the public&#39;s business yesterday? We have sadly formed a
legacy over the last session which we hope will be broke in this session
of ignoring obvious Constitutional limitations and creating laws based
on personal beliefs and preferences rather than,  legal and medical
foundation.  I would point out to you that there are 14 bills that are
currently, in Federal and State courts being litigated. Most of them
have a common denominator of prohibiting citizens of North Carolina from
exercising their rights as  provided by Federal and State law. In the
area that we are talking about today, to set the tone, the Supreme Court
in the case of Planned Parenthood versus Casey long ago held that the
State may not prohibit a women from making the ultimate decision to
terminate her pregnancy. Nor may a state impose upon the right an undue
burden which exists if a regulation&#39;s purpose or effect is to place
a substantial obstacle in the path of a women seeking an abortion before
the fetus obtains viability.Simply put,  the changes that are likely to
be brought in bills before this legislature by Representative Stan and
other colleagues would presumably violate these rulings. Based on
testimony that Tammy Fitzgerald, the Executive Director of the North
Carolina Values Coalition, gave to the commission. Those bills are
likely to include the following provisions: requiring these facilities
to meet surgical center standards, creating a requirement of admitting
privileges for all providers, requiring board certified medical
personnel and OBGYN, having on board at each staff an anesthesiologist
or CRNA and requiring that a physician stay with the patient for one
hour at least post-op among other provisions. All of those provisions
have no medical basis in fact or in theory were rejected clearly by the
commission itself, have been opposed in other States as simply
ideological preferences and are being litigated across the country
including at the Supreme Court of the United States. The State has a
legal basis to ensure a  women exerts her right to choose safely and
under

  After medical care. The proposed regulations by the secretary ??
inconsistently do so consistently with the best practices in the country
in medical standards. The problems that  i fear  and my colleagues here
fear and  we will talk about  now is that the bills that are about to be
submitted by some of  our republican colleagues. Instead seek
governmental intrusion in to intimate personal liberties, politicize
medical processes and impose a set of ideological standards on
women&#39;s reproductive health services in North Carolina. I close my
comments by noting that most North Carolinians do not want their health
care regulations written by politicians. They want them drafted and
implemented by doctors and nurses and medical professionals. It is time
for the legislature to stay in its own lane and let the medical
professionals do their job. indeed that is what the constitution
requires.
Joining me in this discussion today  will be Representative Susan Fisher
as well will be Senator Angela Brynt, Dr Matthews Erden, an OBG ?? from
Chappell Hill who was instrumental in testifying as well before the
commission and then Senator Mike Woodard and then we stand ready for
answering any questions and also any comments any other member of the
legislature might have. Turning it over now to Representative Fisher.
Thank You.
[Speaker Changes] Good Morning. I am Susan Fisher. I represent  District
114 which is a portion of Buncombe county. North Carolina Legislature
has imposed unprecedented restrictions on health care. In recent years,
state elected officials have opposed Medicaid expansion, restricted
public funding for family planning services and pass new laws  seeking
to restrict access to safe and legal abortion. It is in the rural parts
of this state which themselves disproportionately impacted by these
barriers to accessing healthcare. Ashville, a part of the Buncombe
county that i represent is the largest city in Western North Carolina
and yet it has been without an abortion provider since last summer,
seven months ago. After nearly thirty years of serving  women in western
North Carolina and surrounding states, Ashville only provider was forced
to close after realizing that the clinic was not positioned to
effectively fight North Carolina&#39;s legislative atmosphere. The facts
are that one in three women will have an abortion before she is 45. This
means every women needs access to safe and legal abortion care in her
own community. For almost a year , women in my district have had to take
time off  work , arrange child care, scrap together travel  expenses and
deal with transportation challenges in order to travel  hundreds of
miles to act on their own deeply personal reproductive health care
decisions. One thing is clear for me in this process. The only people
who care about women&#39;s health and safety are those provide the care
that women depend on everyday and the women themselves. Those
legislatures who want to bypass the process that themselves created are
motivated by politics and their ultimate goal shutting off women&#39;s
access to safe and legal abortion in North Carolina. I am pleased that
soon women  in my district and across western North Carolina will have
access to high quality non judgmental  abortion care at the new ??
parenthood Ashville health clinic health center. But we are here today
to make clear that politics must be kept out of Women&#39;s healthcare.
And now I would now like to call on Senator Angela Bryant. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Good Morning and Thank you Representative Glazier and
Fisher. I am Senator Angela Bryant representing Senate district 4 Nash,
Wilson, Halifax, Vance and Warren Counties. I am here to emphasize the
fact that women&#39;s rights to reproductive health care are a part of
our civil and constitutional rights. One of the unique things about the
United States and our founding principles and the documents is that
there was this recognition of the importance of individual rights and
there was some rights.

  That the government was bound to respect even if they were asserted by
one person and that is a strong aspect of the constitutional principles
that we believe in and that this country was founded on and I think
it&#39;s important to emphasize that the reproductive rights of women
and the rights of women to have reproductive healthcare in the privacy
of their relationship with their physician and within the context of
their own spiritual and family values is a civil and constitutional
right that we are bound to defend and stand up for and that I surely
will stand up for and have since being a teenager fought for that civil
right along with other civil rights that we now respect, celebrate and
accept and it is unfortunate that like in other regions we are exposed
to this shell game of let us make a law here and a regulation here to
try to narrow these rights and if that doesn&#39;t work let&#39;s move
and take a different approach here, that we&#39;re constantly faced with
this shell game of attacks against our right to privacy and to the
reproductive health care that we&#39;re entitled to as human beings and
as a part of our civil and constitutional rights. It is also important
to recognize that while ostensibly those who would, again, try to keep
moving the playing field or changing the rules of the game and either
moving the playing field around, would say that they are concerned about
our own health and safety, we know that underneath all of that is also
an interest in curtailing these constitutional rights, and it&#39;s
important that we continue to make that clear. That the reproductive
health services that women, that are an issue here and the right and the
procedures for terminating pregnancy when that decision is made between
a woman and her doctor are services that rarely result in complications
and that are similar in terms and comparison to other procedures that
are done within the context of the rules and regulations that have been
recommended here by those experts and practitioners who are involved and
stakeholders who are involved in this issue and we ask for support of
this process and we ask that women and their families and men who
support our constitutional rights become a part of the 6,000 women and
citizens, men, women and citizens, who have filed comments in support of
these regulations and that you have, I think, one more day to offer
comments and support and we suggest and advise that that be done by all
that would support our constitutional rights. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Good morning. My name is Dr. Matthew Zerdan and I&#39;m an
obstetrician/gynecologist who provides the full spectrum of healthcare
and reproductive services for the women of North Carolina. I&#39;m here
today to speak in support of efforts to improve patient care and to
inject some facts and clarity to the North Carolina Department of Health
and Human Services proposed abortion regulations. To comply with
legislation passed in 2013, the Department of Health drafted regulations
for clinics that provide abortion care. Over the course of a year they
sought input from physicians and other medical professionals to craft
proposed regulations based on science and medical evidence and not on a
political agenda. I am encouraged that the Department of Health included
medical experts in drafting the proposed abortion clinic regulations and
it appears that the right balance was struck between protecting access
to a critical reproductive healthcare service and overseeing clinic
safety standards. As a physician, my number one priority is my
patients&#39; safety. Abortion is already extremely safe. Studies as
well as data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
CDC, shows that abortion has a safety record of over 99% with a less
than 1% complication rate. Even with this exceptional safety record,
reproductive healthcare professionals are continually studying ways to
ensure that patients receive the best possible care. Doctors are very
much in favor of evidence-based measures that improve safety, but
politically motivated regulations have become a serious concern. Across
the country, we&#39;ve seen political regulations that have forced
clinics to comply with burdensome ambulatory surgical care standards
that were just mentioned. These are requirements that the most respected
organization of our field, the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, has found to be medically unnecessary. The main effect of
these laws have been that good, safe clinics were forced to shut their
doors

  <p id="15:00">
  In Texas for example, these medically unnecessary requirements will
leave close to a million women without any access to essential
reproductive health services. And I’m here today to try and make sure
that doesn’t happen in our great state. Today, I urge North Carolina
policy makers to continue to keep this process free of political
interference. I am deeply concerned that state legislators will
intervene next week and override the expert recommendations that were
made. It would be wrong to substitute their political agendas for the
expertise of reproductive health care leaders and medical professionals.
And in fact this would be a grave, grave mistake. Far from improving
patients’ safety, politicizing this process would jeopardize access to
reproductive healthcare for thousands of women. We must let health care
professionals and medical experts continue to keep patients safe, let
good clinics keep their doors open, and let doctors practice medicine
without political interference. No doctor should have to stop providing
care because he or she is unable to comply with regulations that lack
any basis in medical evidence. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good
morning. I’m Mike Woodard and I represent North Carolina Senate District
22. We are all here today because we want North Carolina women to be
safe. As you just heard from Dr. Zerdin, abortion has a 99 percent plus
safety record. ** the law that forced these regulations on women’s
health clinics were clearly based on politics and not medicine. We
recognize that the Department of Health and Human Services engaged in a
thoughtful, reasoned process in crafting the proposed regulations. For
over a year, the department worked hand-in-hand with medical experts, to
draft a set of regulations that comport with relevant medical standards
and will appropriately protect the health and safety of North Carolina
women. And for that reason, eight reproductive health care experts
testified before department hearing last month, that these regulations
reflect sound medicine and science. Despite the overwhelming support for
these regulations from the medical community and from the public at
large, leaders in the General Assembly have signaled they plan to
introduce legislation to substitute their judgment for that of medical
experts and the Department of Health and Human Services. Let me be
clear. Politicians are not medical experts. When it comes to the health
and safety of the women of North Carolina, we need to listen to the
experts. More than 6000 North Carolinians have submitted public comments
to the Department of Health and Human Services over the last 30 days,
calling on us to do just that. And there’s still one more day we
continue to expect that North Carolinians will support these proposed
regulations. We have to ask ourselves, “Who is more competent to set
medical standards? Doctors and medical experts or politicians?” It’s
time to stop playing politics with women’s health. That’s why we are
here today, calling on our colleagues in both chambers to put women’s
health first. And we’re also calling on Governor McCrory to keep his
campaign promise, to stand with his own Department of Health and Human
Services and put a stop to the blatant interference in women’s personal
and private health care decisions. I’ll return the podium back to
Representative Glazier. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We are now open for questions
and if you would kindly direct it to the person or combination of people
you’d like to ask, and certainly are open then for any other
Representative or Senator who is here and we appreciate them to make any
comments. Gary. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  This is for law makers or
representatives of abortion rights groups. Given what we have seen now
by the rules, and given the vehement opposition to the law in 2013 and
the opposition when Governor McCrory signed it, do you believe you’ve
misjudged Governor McCrory on his intent, with these abortion rules?
Because he said, “I won’t make abortion rules more restrictive than they
already are.” [SPEAKER CHANGES] We certainly hope that the Governor will
live up to that promise. He is going to have that opportunity,
apparently. Some of his colleagues in the Republican Party are bound and
determined to give him that opportunity, where he is going to have to
make a decision fairly soon. And so we will see an answer to your
question. We are optimistic, given the Secretary’s work, I specifically
am pleasantly

  Surprised and happy at the process that was used by the secretary.
Don&#39;t know that I would&#39;ve thought that would&#39;ve engaged
last year, and so I give her great credit and her staff and the rules
that have been promulgated are exactly as the doctor described, I
believed, fair and reasonably balanced and improve what is already an
excellent patient safety record to a new level. Where the governor ends
up being, we will all know shortly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just [??]
that that bill was, or that law was a combination of a series of bills
that passed that have many other abortion care restrictions in them, so
this is part of that law and part of the law that we care very deeply
about, but there are restrictions on coverage or coverage bans or
restrictions on city, state and municipal employees, whether they can
get abortion care coverage, there are restrictions on physicians and how
they provide care that are outside of this law, so, you know, regardless
of what happens on this process, I&#39;ll only speak for NARAB but we
believe the governor has already broken that campaign promise and this
is an opportunity to make sure that he doesn&#39;t do any further
damage. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just think, as a follow up, that there are
people who believe that he had sinister intentions by signing this bill.
Sinister, I&#39;m being a little facetious here, but exaggerating that
he wanted to somehow restrict abortion further through these rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, let&#39;s be clear and follow exactly what
Suzanne said, this is as it relates to the surgical, as it relates to
the center, reproductive center guidelines that have been promulgated.
That&#39;s not to say that that bill didn&#39;t have a number of bizarre
and still in most of our minds unconstitutional provisions like, as I
remember, requiring the doctor to be present when someone swallows the
pill. They don&#39;t have to be present for any effects later, but they
had to be present for the following of the first pill but not the second
pill. Someone will one day have to explain the legitimacy of that. There
were other provisions in the bill that were certainly ones that were not
at all intended to protect women&#39;s health, but really to follow an
ideological pattern, but we&#39;re not talking about that. That bill is
done, it&#39;s here, what we are talking about are the present
regulations and in that sense I think the secretary deserves due credit
as do all the people that participated in that process. Other questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Have you seen any proposed bills or [??] what
they&#39;re going to be doing? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ll try to answer
but other colleagues may want to answer as well. I think we certainly,
probably would&#39;ve heard more yesterday had their conference not been
canceled at the last minute. I would&#39;ve expected to have heard some
details, but there&#39;s clearly been some information sent privately
and quietly that there are multiple potential tracks right now to derail
these regulations. One of them will be to file objections on the rule
making process. Another will be bills that we believe are already in
draft form with regard to the provisions that we talked about today to
simply override the regulations. I have little doubt that one or both of
those methods have been planned and are ready to be implemented.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you have a sense for, say, how that might play with
the House leadership, say Speaker Moore, or the Senate leadership?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do any of my colleagues want to? Again, I think again
we&#39;ll see. The House and Senate leadership will apparently be given
whether they want it or not the obligation to make that decision by some
of the bills that are likely to be prepared, so I don&#39;t want to
prejudge. I hope, again, that they will follow their Secretary of Health
and Human Services, a medically sound process, and will not engage in
the unconstitutional, the likely unconstitutional determinations that
some of these bills would, the path that it would put us on, and, you
know, it&#39;s interesting, I think. It&#39;s hard, it&#39;s going to be
very hard, I believe, for the majority to craft a bill in this case that
overrides, what amounts to, really, almost an 18 month process that is
supported by medical experts on all sides, a process they created as
Senator Woodard said, but now that it didn&#39;t come up with quite the
ideologically determined result that they thought they were going to get
to override their own process and substitute their own personal
judgement. I cannot think of a better, sadly, a better constitutional
case that would, I think, immediately lead to those regulations,
overriding regulations being struck down in court, and I can&#39;t
imagine that current leadership wants to continue to engage in that
litigious path.
