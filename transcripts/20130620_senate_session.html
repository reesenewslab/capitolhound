The Senate will come to order, the sergeant at arms will close the door.
Members will go to their seats, members and guests of the gallery, will
please silence all electronic devices. Leading this Senate in prayer
today is the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain, all members and
guests of the gallery will please stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's pray.
Blessed be the Lord, who in his mercy visits us like the day spring from
on high. Bless you Lord, for being a light to those shadowed by death.
Bless you Lord, for being a guide for our feet on the way to peace. For
today in 1782, congress adopted our great seal in this nation. A seal of
hope, and a seal that witness to your providence and may that providence
favor our undertakings and give us hope. And may you, Lord, and Father,
give us proper humility in our own lives, as we, the members of this
historical body of a great nation, honor you, in Christ's name we pray,
Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca is recognized for a motion.

houses that the only way we can do roll call votes as a block vote is if
everybody is going to hold hands and vote exactly the same way on every
one of them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I haven't heard an objection yet. Senator Nesbitt, you okay with this?
Note that the minority leader has nodded his objection--I'm sorry, his
consent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry, Senator Nesbitt, force of habit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I still had one or two friends left in here until you
said that. I know of no objection on the back row to any of these. If
so, the members ought to make a motion to pull them out of a block vote,
and then we can do the rest of them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So ordered. I think the clerk is happy at this point. So at this point,
House Bill 261, House Bill 302, House Bill 412, House Bill 421, House

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 328: Solid Waste Management Reform Act of
2013.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Wade is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. This is an attempt to do
something about the decreasing  capacity of landfills in North Carolina.
If you talk with the industry, they'll say there's 15-20 years left. I
know some say there's 30. It depends on the area you're in. If you have
a landfill that has 40 years of life left on it, and let's say you're in
the mountains, and yet you're at the coast, and you have five years left
on your landfill, certainly it's not going to be realistic to truck the
waste from Maneo ? to the mountains. So we have to look at it as a
whole, and the industry says that we have 15-20 years left of space. And
this bill is put forth in hopes of letting the landfills be created in
strategic places where the community wants them. I will emphasize that
you cannot site any landfill without having a franchise [CUTS OFF]</p>

Agreement with the local government. So any of you that are worried
about it going into your area, the local government will have to agree
to a franchise, and in that franchise they can say what capacity you can
- how much you can put in there, and they can make other stipulations.
So there is a safeguard in place and I want everyone to know that. But
we haven't cited any landfills in North Carolina in the last 15 to 20
years and especially since 2007. This is an attempt to look towards the
future and make preparation for our children, instead of waiting until
we don't have any space anymore and we don't want to end up like our
Northern neighbors and put it on a barge outside on the coast. This bill
has gone through ag [SP] and it's also gone through finance. And [??]
fully supports it and I'll be glad to answer any questions. And I would
ask for your support today. And I will say there will be opposition to
third reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Pate what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the lady would yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, if a landfill - you say the local
government has to approve it or grant some sort of approval for that
landfill, if it's going to be near the border of one county that has
jurisdiction but is very close to the border of another county would
they have any jurisdiction or any say so whatsoever in the siting of
that facility?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It would be the franchise agreement in North Carolina
that we have control over, we wouldn't have any control over another
state, and I would imagine if they were also going into that state then
their state government would have control over that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The question was about in the corner of a county where
there are several bordering counties within North Carolina, would the
other counties have any say so?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would imagine if it touches in other counties they
would also be included in the franchise agreement because you're in that
area and I would say local governments all have a say in that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You say there's gonna be objection to third reading?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry sir, follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Senator Cook we have an amendment we're working on
and we're gonna have opposition in the third reading so there will be a
chance to douvble check on that for you Senator Pate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would move for the record that this is a role call
bill so it will be set on another day for a third reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, Mr. President. Senator Wade spoke
about New York and New Jersey having trouble disposing of their garbage,
in 2007 that's exactly what was going to happen to North Carolina. The
garbage form New York and New Jersey was going to come down to five
sites that had been selected by the industry to take this garbage. Now
we couldn't prevent that because of the commerce clause of the United
States Constitution, anything coming across borders cannot be prohibited
from coming into that state because it's commerce, and garbage is
commerce unfortunately. So when these five sites were selected and we
heard what was going to happen, enjoying this garbage form New York and
New Jersey we found that the description of these would be that they
would be 300 feet tall, several football fields wide, and they do this
by the way in Florida and I understand from my intern who lived there
that you can see these for miles. And more disturbingly two of these
were at sea level which means that any [??] could possible contaminate
those areas.
Well we do not want to truck our garbage from Manteo to Murphy, but we
also do not want to take all of this garbage in. So in order to try to
protect our neighborhoods, our schools, our nursing homes, our parks,
our wildlife areas, our hunting areas, we were able to provide buffers
that protected that. Now in this bill we are removing all of those. I
heard in the committee...</p>

After another, &quot;repeal this&quot;, &quot;repeal that&quot;,
&quot;repeal the other&quot;, and so all of these measures that were
protecting these places, these sensitive places, are repealed in this
bill. And of course, what happens is these end up in low-income,
minority communities. They're not going to be built in your neighborhood
and my neighborhood; we know where they're going to end up. And when I
talked about that, the answer was, we do not want to deprive these
people of jobs. A landfill is a job? First of all, there are very few
people who actually do a landfill, work on a landfill. But besides that,
are these the jobs we want for our communities? Why not high-tech jobs,
why aren't we looking for high-tech jobs? Why aren't we looking for
MetLife? So, I think that this is really a very big step backwards. We
need to be reducing waste. In Orange County, we have reduced our waste
such that we have 64% of our waste is recycled. We're about to study
&quot;pay as you throw&quot;, so that that further incentivizes people.
And I'm very concerned over what this will do to our beautiful state and
to our sensitive areas and especially to our neighborhoods and our
communities. I urge you to vote against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, first of all, want to say thank you to the sponsors of this bill, I
think this is a needed bill. I used to work for an electric utility and
it always amazed me that everybody wants electricity, but you try to
build a substation and see where you're gonna to put it. Nobody wants
it. That's the same way with this bill. We have to get rid of our trash,
we gotta do something, so to stick our head in the sand and worry about
pie-in-the-sky future possibilities where there won't be any trash
doesn't seem to me a viable option. However, I represent several
counties, one of them is Camden, and they have a concern with this bill,
and the sponsors of this bill were gracious enough to allow me to work
with them and come up with some sort of a compromise for the folks of
Camden. And so, towards that goal, I will object at third reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Kinnaird, I wanted to address a couple
issues that Senator Kinnaird had on the bill. The heighth and area of
these landfills that were in the 2007 bill do not change in this
particular bill, those are still in place. So I think that addresses one
of the major concerns that you had about the bill. I think, too, an
important piece of this is the safeguards that are put in the bill that,
in order to get a franchise, you do have to go through local government
to get that franchise. So local governments will make that decision on
whether to allow these landfills to take place. And, as you know, this
isn't a three or six month proposition; it normally takes five to ten
years to get through the process to even put one of these in place. And
I think that really addresses the key issue that we're talking about, is
as space becomes less and less available because of the bill we passed
in 2007 with the buffer requirements that were put in place, you've seen
that there's no landfills been permitted since that bill was created.
Because it was so stringent, you can't permit one in North Carolina any
longer, because the buffers were so tight. We worked with DENR on this
bill all the way through. They were at the table, working through it to
make sure we had safeguards in place. In committee, they talked about
supporting the bill, when we ran it through committee the other day. I
think we've done everything we can to address the issues on this. I
actually have an issue that the military has brought forth to me that
we'll continue to work on as we move this bill forward. But doing
nothing I don't think is a solution to this problem. Again, I think
we've tried to be careful as we've crafted this bill, we've listened to
all the concerns as we've moved forward, and we'll continue to listen to
those concerns, but I think we have to do something to allow some of
these landfills to be built in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Brown a question.

I do.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What if the industry wants to bring garbage from New York and New Jersey
on those barges?

Senator Kinnaird, I think that is an issue that's a local issue. To be
quite honest. I think if a local community or county</p>

sees that as an opportunity for them, you know I think that's a decision
they would have to make. I think most counties in this state would
probably decide not to do that. I know my county probably would. I think
your county would. But I'm not so sure that I can speak for every single
county. Plus with the commerce clause I'm not sure you can keep that
from happening anyway. So, you know, that's an issue that's a little bit
more difficult to address completely but at the same time, not allowing
any landfills to be permitted surely isn't an answer.
Mr. President.
Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
Thank you sir, to ask Senator Kinnaird a question.
Senator Kinnaird do you yield?
I do.
She yields.
Senator Kinnaird , you said in Orange County that 62% of the trash that
you have or waste is recyclable. Do you have a landfill in Orange
County? What do you do with the balance of that 38% of the trash? Or is
it like Union County and shipped to another county in North Carolina?
Mr. Chair, Mr. President.
You have the floor to answer.
You are right. We do not have one. Which is why we are going to 64%. And
the reason we are closing our landfill is that it is in a poor minority
neighborhood that have lived with it for 30 or 40 years. And what we're
looking at is pay as you throw, so that we can reduce that to perhaps
10%. And you are right, we are sending it to, unfortunately, Durham,
which sends it unfortunately to Randolph County. And I think this is
something that we as a nation and especially as a state have to start
committing ourselves to. How much can we reduce our waste so that we're
not-- and especially we don't want to take waste in from New York and
New Jersey. They produce a lot of waste.
Thank you Senator Kinnaird . Just, Mr. President.
Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
Just to speak to the bill.
You have the floor.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been about 15 years since we have put a
landfill anywhere in North Carolina. Wanna make you aware that there is
technology available, the term is called gassifier. And what they're
doing is with the exception of two materials, they can burn all of our
trash. They have technology available to scrub the air, to clean it up.
And the gas off of burning the trash is uh, put back on uh, the grid.
They, they can put a generator beside it and generate electricity. So I
think with the technology moving forward, the likelihood of another
landfill in North Carolina, without going to this technology because
nobody wants it, is gonna be there. And they are high paying jobs, they
are running high tech equipment that um, will burn our trash and will
create energy. And so, I will certainly support this bill because we
gotta take these measures now, but in the future I don't think we're
gonna be discussing landfills that much. Thank you.
Mr. President.
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
To speak on the bill.
You have the floor.
I'm disappointed to see the bill before us this time. Uh, we certainly
don't have any shortage of capacity in landfills that presently exist in
the state. I hate to see us going in, revising our regulations, and
doing it in a way that essentially incentivizes the creation of
landfills, particularly in some coastal counties, that will become
dumping grounds from trash, large cities in the Northeast. I don't think
that's what we wanna do. It's not gonna create any kind of magnet for
growth and development and it certainly isn't going to create any high
paying jobs of the type and quality that we want in some of these rural
areas. We look at the buffers that are being compromised. There's really
no reason to do that at the present time. If we look at the length of
the permits being increased from 10 years up to potentially 30 years,
there ought to be a more frequent cycle for periodic reviews. When we
look at compromising the type of liners that are required today and
putting in liners that will not perhaps provide the protection for
groundwater. And particularly we're talking about coastal counties where
their water table is higher and the aquifers are there. We need to take
a deep, long, hard look at what we need to do. I'm not saying we might
not wanna update. I'm not saying we might not wanna mend. If we wanna do
that, then there's a right time and there's a right way to do it. But to
go out there and to increase the length of these permits 300%,
compromise the buffers that protect surrounding neighborhood,
developments and in areas. Put in liners that may not be as strong and
resistant</p>

I don't know what we're doing. I think it's going for two months in the

on page seven in the complaint, the strike paragraph that limits it says
the department shall, but non- application. if the department finds
that, and that says this among the finest construction or operation, the

natural resources, cultural sites recreation areas are short sites

River system, wildlife refuges, reserves and management areas, areas,
and provide habitat for threatened species. it's a him, including
critical fisheries habitat designated by the Marine fisheries

Do it, but you’re taking out the prohibition about permitting when this
would occur. And I think any review by DENR ought to make sure that when
they put one of these mountains, especially down on the coast, that
somebody’s looking at all this to make sure we’re not destroying the
things that make this state great and the things that we ought to
cherish. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, for what purpose
do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] First, there’s
an environmental impact study done before any permit is given by DENR.
Second, every five years, that permit comes up for a review and they
actually go out and do an inspection of the site to assure that the
environment is safe. The other thing I would like to say is, there’s a
saying that we all want our trash picked up, but we don’t want anybody
to put it down. Well I have to say it’s our responsibility and it’s our
responsibility for our children coming behind us to make sure there is a
place and in this bill you will also notice there’s some inference to
that they have to do, the landfilling industry has to do studies on gas
to energy. They have to also see if they can use the methane gas and if
they do, they have to pay some of that money back to the local
government. There’s also waste energy research that has to be done, that
certainly wasn’t addressed in the 2007 bill. I think this is a very good
bill. I think this moves us forward for the future, and I would
appreciate your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator ??, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
ask Senator Wade a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, do you
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. On page 7, line 23, the
department shall deny an application for a permit for a solid waste
management facility if the department finds that, we get down to 47, the
proposed facility would be located in what a, and would obstruct what is
a flood plain. Can these now be located in a flood plain? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator, I’m assured by the department that all those
environmental impacts are addressed in the impact study that is done in
the beginning. And it did not change anything about wetlands. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion or debate. Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose
do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. I think I
want to assure everybody that it’s not covered by this other stuff. We
put a prohibition in and said we were not going to destroy these
treasures that we have in North Carolina, with landfills. I’ve used this
example a long time ago, if I were freezing to death, I’d probably start
burning my furniture. But I’m not going to do that tomorrow. I’m going
to wait until somebody can tell me that’s what I need to do, before I
start burning my furniture to stay alive. We’re not to the point in this
state where we’ve got to start destroying wildlife refuges, natural
heritage areas, the rivers that flow through this state, to build a
landfill. And I don’t know why we can’t say we’re not going to do that,
until somebody can come over here and prove to us we have to do that. If
we get to the point where we’ve got to do that, we ought to know that as
a body and make that decision. Okay, the rivers are going first, and
then we’re going to give up the wildlife refuge, and we’ll find which
ones we don’t need anymore and we’ll give them up. But just to strike
this whole provision that is a prohibition against damaging any of these
areas doesn’t make any sense to me at this time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have
the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I can, first let’s take a look at page
11, line 10. This might help Senator Kinnaird. Waste disposing in a
sanitary landfill shall not be constructed within A, or excuse me 1, a
hundred-year flood plain as shown on current flood plain maps, prepared
pursuant to national flood insurance</p>

This program.  Alright, let’s go to page 12.  Let’s come down to line
five.  No permit shall be issued, within 1500 feet at outermost boundary
of a national park, state park, other component state park system,
segment of natural and scenic river system, national wildlife refuge,
critical fishery habitat created by designed by marine fisheries, and
outstanding resource water designed by NC.  I think that answers a
couple of questions we had earlier, it is contained within the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate?  Hearing none, question
for the senate is the passage of the committee substitute to senate bill
328 on it’s 2nd reading, all in favor will vote Aye all opposed will

record the vote. 28 having voted in the affirmative and 18 in the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 18, Amend locksmith license act, raise fee
ceiling
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bingham is recognized
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the
senate.  This is basically a consumer protection bill, what it does, it
does some minor changes and allows the locksmith group to increase their
fees if they wish or at least the ceiling, and this is an option.  It
will help the DA’s in prosecution of locksmith’s who do fraudulent acts,
etc. in fake advertisements.  I urge your support.  I do believe Senator
McLaurin wants to speak on this bill Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McLaurin, for what do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, Thanks Senator Bingham.  This
is a good bill, I have talked to several locksmiths in my district, who
support this, it raises the standards for locksmiths, a lot of them are,
of course, involved in having access to confidential information. Health
records, drugs, various other places, where we want to make sure that
anybody that is performing these services is doing it in a way that the
standards are high for those performing that service.  So I commend
Senator Bingham and I support the bill.  Thank you.

Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate bill 305, DMV commission contract changes.
Senator Tillman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill attempts to rectify a situation that was
brought about by recent legislation saying that property taxes would be
collected at the time of registration changes and any transaction you
are doing with the DMV, contracted tax agents.  What was failed to be
accounted for, was to pay these contract agents for doing this work that
the counties had be doing.  They will reap a huge benefit, because going
from ninety-some percent of collection you will go to nearly 100
percent, because you don’t get your registration, you don’t pay your
taxes, and somebody’s got to be there to answer the questions about why
my property taxes are this that or the other, why are we doing it now,
why are we doing it this way? It’s going to take time from all of those
agents, they’ve not been compensated properly, many of those are on a
thin margin already and some would close their doors</p>

Now the county commission association earlier opposed this bill well I
took it upon myself to call several county commission chairman and I
said you’ll net a hundred million dollars approximately when we do it
this way, you won’t need all the tax collecting people in your offices
and you’ll come out with more money you’ll have to kick in a few
million, very few, five or six million to start with, so your net gain
is going to be great, I didn’t have a single one to say they were
opposed to it after they understood that. So if you heard from the
league of municipalities and the county commission association saying
they were opposed, they were. You explained the bill to them and you
will see them coming from a different direction. I’d ask for your
support.

using this sub can’t find one or whatever, and they’re just splitting
