&lt;h3&gt;The Senate will come to order. Sergeant at arms will close the
doors. Members will go to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery
will please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer
is the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain, all members and guests in
the gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let us pray. Gracious and steadfast god, we stand before you today in
this chamber with a call. Lord, there are two things that we need today:
inspiration and wisdom. Inspiration and wisdom. Inspire us, we ask, so
that we might be like ?? to them. So that we might be like Frederick
Douglas. So that we may be like Abraham Lincoln, Helen Keller, Beatrice
??. That we might live our lives under the bright blue sky of your
praise and your grace. And then 50 years from today we might be seen as
a generation that's decided to live with integrity. You are our
inspiration, Lord, and may we be not ones to beat the tepid drum of
insecurity, but instead listen for the drum of your righteousness. May
we need your wisdom, we need you to show us how to run companies, how to
pave roads, how to run schools, how to work together as a community for
the good of all our citizens. We also need your wisdom in this session
today. We plead with you for the ?? of your perfect wise counsel. Fire
us with your holy spirit that we might be full of a wisdom that's from
on high. Because if you're child James said, every good and perfect gift
is from above, coming down from the father of lights, of whom there is
no variation or shadow due to change. We ask these two things in the
name of Jesus. My fountain of wisdom, and our inspiration. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ?? is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President the journal of Wednesday February 6, 2013, has

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Senators we have…the doctor of the day with us today is John Willerford
from Charlotte North Carolina, John if you'll please stand. And our
nurse of the day is Persephone McNeil from Fayetteville North Carolina,
if you'll please stand. Thank you for joining us and thank you for your
service to our state today. [applause]. Ratification of bills, the clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ratification of bills. Enrolled Bills, enrolling clerk reports the
following resolutions due to be ratified properly enrolled, and
presented to the office of the Secretary of State. House joint
resolution  64, the joint resolution honoring the 50th anniversary of
the state legislative building.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senators, we're going to move right in to the calendar. Public Bills in
2nd reading, Senate Bill 14, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 14, increase access to career technical ed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, members of the Senate. What this bill does is provides an
easy transition and better access to vocational courses corona ting
closely to high schools and community colleges. Governor Foley has been
pushing this idea that we need to get people ready for the jobs that are
already out there. We have 8 to 9 thousand jobs in the technical fields
that are open right now. We are educating all the people, some have
degrees that won't provide any access to the work place, and that's
good, they get a great liberal arts education, nothing wrong with that.
We have other kids that pass wanting to go to a four year university but
they aptitude and abilities are in the technical areas. We believe that
there's a great opportunity to expand our vocational courses in the -
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

Representative: ..the vocational school and at the community college
working closely together. We need to provide an opportunity to get
teachers into the vocational areas, and we are making it easier for them
to do that in the interim period until we get this [xx] out of the way.
Two things will happen, I think: you will see the drop out rate
decrease; I think you will see more kids [xx] paying job after two years
in the community college. Those jobs are out there waiting now. All we
need to do is to get them targeted and the right courses starting in the
junior year and senior year in high school, then going onto the
community colleges. I would like to thank Senator Bryant particularly
in?
Speaker: Any further discussion or debate? Senator Brown, for what
purpose do you rise?
Representative: To speak to the bill.
Speaker: Senator you have the floor to speak to the bill.
Representative: Again, I would like to thank Senator Tillman for working
with me on this bill. It is something I think all of you know that I
have been preaching in my nine years up here: career tech education and
the importance. All the stats show that four more CTE classes drop out
at much lesser rate than the typical kid in high school. Anybody in
business can tell you that these jobs are hard to fill today. This bill
moves us in the right direction. It does not get us all the way there, I
will be quite honest. I think there is some more room we can grow in
this area. One thing I mentioned in committee the other day is that it
does not open the path for freshman, it does not allow sophomores to go
to community colleges in these areas. Hopefully we will have it fixed
before the end of session to take care of that issue as well. You know,
we lose a lot of kids in that freshman/sophomore time frame. I think if
we can get them exposed to career tech education at that time, we will
save those kids as well. I think it is just important. I know in my
business, it is tough to find these kids. Hopefully, this will help in
the job areas that these kids are needed the most. So, I just ask for
your support on the bill.
Speaker: Any further discussion or debate? Senator McKisick, for what
purpose do you rise?
Representative: To ask a question of Senator Tillman, pertaining to the
bill.
Speaker: Senator Tillman?
Representative: Yes sir.
Representative: We briefly discussed this bill on my way in this
morning. I just want to get some clarification. First, I want to commend
you and Senator Brown for your leadership in coming forth with some
option here that will help us decrease our drop out rate. What was
basically discussed, earlier in our meeting, was having basically three
different types of high school diplomas, where one would be for
technical education, one might be for regular academic course work, and
another technical. At this point in time the way the bill is drafted it
was not clear to me – it looked like there were going to be some
options, but the regular high school today – it looked like the kids
would still continue to be one of the options open, or how this would
actually work, or whether those are details that will be worked out in
the future.
Representative” Senator McKisick, you are on the committee and remember
that we have three endorsements on the diploma now: one will be
technical, one will be your college bound kid, and one will be both –
many kids will opt for both because it will keep the option of college
open and they will have this vocational track. They will be endorsed
that way on the diplomas and will begin this coming school year. That
was discussed in committee, and I believe you were a part of that.
Representative: Okay, so that part remains part of the bill we see
today?
Representative: Yes it is in the bill.
Representative: Okay. In terms of choices, I guess the kids will make
those choices later on? I am just trying to see how this will work. I
know a lot of the kids, when they are in 8th, 9th, even 10th grades, do
not know what they want to do. So I just want to make sure we get them
into the right track for them without being excluded from tracks.
Representative: Senator, your point is well taken. With proper
counseling, working with the community colleges, all we are doing is let
them set</p>

bill, this amendment is very simple. What it does is it just to give you
a little bit of history at the Board of Transportation. For quite some
time The President pro tem of The Senate had a member of the Board as
well as The Speaker of The House who appointed to at large positions. I
had the good pleasure serving on the Board of Transportation for ten
years. And most of that time we had appointees from both The Speaker's
office and The President pro tem's office which I think is beneficial to
both of those offices. And what this amendment does is simply add those
two positions back to the Board of Transportation. I'll be glad to
answer any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or
