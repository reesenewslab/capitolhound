The members will go to their seats.  Members of the gallery will please
silence all electronic devices.  Leading the Senate in prayer is the
Reverand Peter Milson, Senate Chaplain.  All members of the guests of
the gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Please pray with me.  Heavenly Father, it's an
incredible privilege to close our eyes, and be able to hear from you in
the is moment, in this chamber.  Seek the shalom of the city, where I
sent you, says the Lord.  Seek the peace of Asheville, South Court, Old
Oak Rapids, Old Fork, Charlotte, Beaufort, Kingston, Oriental, Ahoskie,
Winston-Salem, Manteo, Lexington.  And we play the Lord, that you would
bless us, and bless these cities.  Because as you said in scripture, in
its peace, in its welfare, you will find your welfare.  But keep us from
selfish gain, encourage us to pray for our cities, encourage us to pray
for our people.  And you say that in 70 years, you will visit and
fulfill your promise and bring us back to our homes.  You say that you
have a plan for us, and we believe you.  Help us believe in the midst of
our unbelief, and help us believe as we pray to you, you hear us, and
that, that is all that matters, you hear us.  In the name of Jesus, the
very one that taught us how to pray, and how to love, Amen.

I just want you to ask yourselves that.  I think we would err on making
sure that fairness is afforded to every person that's in our courtroom
and particulary in capital cases.  'Cause once you kill someone, we
cannot go back and get a bill to bring them back to life.  With that,
Mr. President I'd like to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do members have copies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  Send forward your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, we have it up here.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Parmon moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Parmon has the floor to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and members.  This amendment would simply allow
the racial justice act portion  of senate bill 306 to be removed so that
members that's in favor of the death penalty can vote on the death
penalty, and support the racial justice act.  I've heard time and time
again that people support the death penalty, but also support the racial
justice act, because they want to ensure that people we may kill in the
future was given a fair trial.  I ask you to support the amendment thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on amendment one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to point out in this section of the law that it does reiterate
all the rights available, and I've heard two of the members the last to
speak about unfairly convicted, about minorities being excluded from
juries, and again, as I question senator Connaird, all RJA does is
attempt to take a cold blooded, convicted killer off death row and give
them life in prison.  RJA does not address in any way the murder.  And
the people that have totally been forgotten about in all of these
discussions, as I heard senator Connaird talk about how wonderful it was
to deal with the death penalty, and to do all that we could in the grand
debates, I keep thinking about the families of the murder victims that
I've met.  I met Fayetteville police officer's Roy Turner's family.  He
was murdered in cold blood.  His murderer appealed under RJA, and right
before udge Wakes made his ruling have retired, never to face the
voters, he took of the murderer of Officer Roy Turner, Fayetteville
police department, off death row.  Now here's the ultimate irony.  Roy
Turner was black.  His murderer was black.  And that's a result of RJA.
One more even crazier, for those of you who were at the ??  committee
meeting last week.  When senator Harrington's district attorney, Lot
Bell appeared and stood up and said I'm accused of being a racist.  I'm
a white district attorney.  And the three people I put in Gaston county
are in death row, have accused me of being a murderer.  I mean, have
accused me of being a racist, the murderers have.  All three of them.
And the evidence is that I put only people of one color on death row.
Guess what the color of the three murderers accusing Lot Bell, a white
man of murder, I mean of, forgive me, of racial discrimination.  Those
three murderers are all white.  They're accusing the white district
attorney, under the racial justice act, for only seeking the death
penalty against white men.  And Lot said, I looked at all the cases, and
the only people that I thought warranted the death penalty, black or
white, were these three white men.  Racial justice act, because it uses
frequency, allows those individuals to appeal under the racial justice
act and claim that they've been discriminated against.  Folks, the
racial justice act is bad law when you have those kinds of results.  The
last person I will tell you about his Marsha Howell.  She was the mother
of murder victim Yvette Howell.  Those of you at the ??  meeting, you
heard her mother's impassioned plea to please put this to an end.  It is
time for my daughter's murder to meet his maker.  He was sentence back
in 1994 to death row, and he has appealed under RJA.  Yvette Howell</p>

Mr. President. Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen of the Senate. The
senatorial statement I just sent forward recognizes the town of Edenton
in Chowan County, for its 300th anniversary. Edenton was the first
permanent settlement in North Carolina. It’s known as the mother town of
North Carolina. It was a colonial capital, a very busy seaport, thriving
agricultural community back then, and Edenton followed its sister city
from way North, Senator Rucho, with having its own Tea Party, just like
the Boston Tea Party. In celebrating now, Edenton is doing an excellent
job in promoting itself as a destination for tourism and in their
celebration this year, their 300th anniversary, the North Carolina
Supreme Court is going to convene a session of court in Edenton in May.
