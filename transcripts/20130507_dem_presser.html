<p id="00:00">
Alright folks, good morning. We are going to go ahead and start. we
appreciate everybody coming in and we got some issues we want to talk
about and certainly the one most expressing on folks ?? this morning is
the safety of North Carolinians wherever they go and wherever they are,
out of the society in their daily lives. North Carolinians want common
sense gun safety legislation and those of you who were here last night
saw, the republican majority in leadership here in the state legislature
moved in the opposite direction from common sense gun safety. They
brought forward the bill that allows guns in bars and there is certainly
no ??, we haven't heard anyone in public saying we want guns in bars.
Everybody knows alcohol and guns don't mix. It's against the law. And we
are creating a situation where we out them together and almost encourage
it intentionally. Republic gun bill allows concealed weapons on
university and college campuses and virtually every chancellor, security
official, police chief, representative from universities and colleges
said we do not want these guns on campus. They opposed, they strongly
opposed but still the republican leadership decided not to listen to
them. Last night we tried to speak up for the majority of our state and
90% of the North Carolinians, the voters support background check and
whom we tried to speak up on common sense gun safety legislation and
offered amendments for this bill, to keep them off, to keep guns off
college campuses and to have universal background checks and even
increasing the penalty for drinking while carrying the concealed weapon.
We were denied the opportunity to have those amendments heard. They
voted in lock state five different times despite an agreement with us
before session that they would let these amendments be heard. And you
saw those votes are violation of those agreements, violation of the
trust of the citizens of North Carolina. We should have an open and
honest debate about it. This is going to be the legislation if this
passes. We should held the debate in front of the people and have it
debate in the chamber and let the members have their say. We all
represent our districts, we all came here on the vote of the people but
procedural tricks wont save their members from taking a position on
these five issues. Their votes last night made their positions clear and
they are on the record so these schemes to keep those amendments from
being heard at the last minute despite the agreement we had will not
trick the people of North Carolina. If they voted to table universal
background checks then they voted against universal background checks.
If they voted table removing guns from our colleges and university
campuses then they voted against removing those guns. And if they voted
the table increasing the penalties for those who break the law and put
lives in danger then they voted against increasing those penalties and
making the North Carolina citizens safer. Now voters are smart enough to
see through these tricks, we understand and we know if you table it, you
are voting against it and we know that's what happened five times last
night and they are aware. They are trying to run from their records and
trick the people of North Carolina. We had a chance to adopt common
sense gun legislation last night but instead they went the other way
instead let's be less responsible, let's be less safe and let's ignore
those 90 percent of North Carolinians who favor background checks and
87% of those reported on gun arms. So, it's an over reach on their part,
it's certainly a denial of the rights of the North Carolina citizens to
have their representative discuss major policy issues like this and
certainly the background checks and guns on campus are the things that
the public have said they want addressed in this legislation. I want to
turn over to Darren Jackson, one of our members from Wake county who
have some of the amendments who were even died to be heard last night.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. ??. A lot of people asked me last night that I calm down.
That's mad and i tried to explain, I really wasn't mad but disappointed.
This is an issue that I don't think is any less important than voter ID.
We had a lot of public hearings and ?? heard were</p>

80% of the public thinks we should do this, we should hear this.  Well
here's an issue with background checks.  We have 90% of the public, I
believe it's over 90%, the U.S. Senate even considered it. But we're not
allowed to even debate it.  A little bit of the history of the bill is
this provision about restaurant ?? was in another bill earlier in the
session.  Had a Committee hearing scheduled, had a lot of people show
up, testify and speak about it that day, the restaurant provision was
pulled out.  Those people were not allowed to speak and so then this
bill was re-calendared. Unfortunately the people who showed up on that
particular morning were only the proponents of the bill. They got to
spend an hour and 20 minutes of the Committee hearing talking about the
bill and then we were forced, I was forced, to try to run as many
amendments as I could before time was called. Background check was one
of the amendments I had submitted. I had given it to the Committee Chair
the day before, I told the Committee Chair that I had put the amendments
not in just any old order but in the order of controversy, ones that I
thought were less controversial to the one that I thought would take the
longest debate which  was the background check.  Wasn't allowed to have
a vote on it.  Thought we might at least have an honest debate  on the
House floor last night.  Very disappointed that we didn't. I don't
expect that we'll get to have that debate again today.  I think that's a
shame. Whether you're for the bill or you're against the bill I think
everybody ought to have a chance to debate the bill and be heard,
especially from the feedback that I've received from constituents over
the last few days about the educational property.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to briefly emphasize the fact that what
happened last night, denying those five amendments to be heard, was a
denial of the process of the House, it's a denial of the rights of the
people of North Carolina.  They elected not just Republican members but
they elected Democratic members as well and we reflect their desires,
their concerns, and you've seen the poll numbers, you've seen what has
happened in the past when we denied the folks the right to have
representation and now we see it again.  So we don't know what's going
to happen today.  We had an agreement yesterday that those five
amendments would be heard and we asked about it last Thursday.  We were
assured again yesterday before Session that those five amendments could
be heard and we had agreed that we would not object on third on the
condition that those five amendments get heard. As you saw it transpired
last  night, none of the five were allowed to be heard based on rulings
from the Chair and then the motion to table those amendments.  So again,
they voted against those amendments, they voted to table them and not
consider them, they voted to deny the people of North Carolina their
right to have an open and fair discussion about an issue that's
important to them.  Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Leader.  Representative Hall. I want to
say just to underscore what Representative Hall has just said.  We
presented these amendments in good faith. Last week we indicated to the
House Leadership that we had five amendments, that we would be happy to
present three on one day, two on the other.  They went back and forth
and finally said last night that we should run all five last night.  It
is really incomprehensible that we would be told by the leadership, by
the House leadership, that we can run our amendments without their
adding oh by the way we will be tabling all five of them.  To me it
undermines, totally undermines, any notions of transparency.  That has
been a word much touted by the Republican Leadership. This is anything
but transparent. It undermines the opportunity of the people of North
Carolina to see where their representatives stand and we had
Representative Insko with her amendment about safe storage of guns,
Representative Jackson's ?? regarding safety in restaurants,
Representative Alma Adams tried to put in the very important amendment
with respect to the college campuses.  As we all know, President Ross
and the Chancellor of each of the 16 campuses, campus police forces,
have all asked for this to come out of the bill.  It's just really,
really incomprehensible to me that we cannot get an up or down vote on
something where the President of the University of North Carolina has
asked this be reconsidered. I think that the contrast that
Representative Jackson drew to the voter i.d. bill is important. I have
always applauded Representative Lewis, David Lewis, for his willingness
to have</p>

Tough nuts, send a message and strong safety is not that under
consideration to the DS-footed--this is the data bank that was the fifth
in the deputy of a tremendous effort that much of the dissipation was
that you just mentioned, cannot but the Manson and seven screws, for the
people of this, after the need for this make you can do that with a
questions and comments as of today could commit a felony and sometimes
as high as 90% believe we should have the background checks so goes the
weasel machine that these have a good bet that covered in the diplomat,
give them a percentage discussed this is something that we can do this
is something that should be done with background checks and even the
question of those off campus we've had a statement from barley is only
university campuses and we could have added this to us,(SPEAKER CHANGES)
 for despite assurances that we would have an opportunity to do these
issues, again like unsuitable for the Woodall and two this house to the
respected people have of the house of representatives and deal with the
great issues and this would leave a question you should consider the
size of the discussions were with the speaker and the old rules to users
of living here longer-term ?? (SPEAKER CHANGES) Stephen king people
ever-present layer of them are fine where knowingly and analysts say the
majority of them can send a shiver its way home from a year on a-half,
very long, tedious income they have happened a long time ago when they
buy it is very evenly divided it was a favorite, and five men knew her
novels chairman of Richard Martin, by letting the interesting thing
about this news from you clearly have the votes to whenever you want a
lively and today he just said Harkes believes something to get hats and
sell, lying there has been a clear majority we can clear until ready to
get what you want generally there has been more gracious nest in respect
to the process and ¬other people that following that could be used by
the SEC is that same bed number of motion to table or basically good
number of plants and people minutes were refused to be given an
opportunity third and sat in the state arrested as a studio for weeks:
you nothing is done that for this specific issue but in general,
republican, said this again the same as saying that the dismantling
bellman we will even do with the ideas of any Health Care,(SPEAKER
CHANGES) we wanted me to explain with two alternative comedy is only
alternative proposal as would like to shed two down and stop even
defamation come into the record will come into the public for the
discussion so would it we live in the concern that this won't be a good
political move, and as a pinch it was identified as such a thing we see
us live from ??.....</p>
