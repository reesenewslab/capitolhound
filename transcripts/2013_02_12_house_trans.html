[0:00:00.0]
For the Southern let southern lag at 540, let’s call the Orange Group.
Now, DOT and local transportation planning people and Mayors and like
they did a really good thing many years ago and that they laid out the
route for 540 for the whole big loop and so the southern part of this
has been known for years and years and years and years and years and
everybody knew that, all of the towns along that section the same as the
other sections but whether you are talking about Apex or Holly Springs
or Fuquay Varina and Garners as well, they were all planning on that
route and going to certain route and off course because we were planning
ahead the Federal Government punishes us. So, the best plans but
somewhere along the way in the planning process and alternate route call
the, ‘Red Route’ was put out there because you have alternate routes. It
was to my knowledge, it was never anybody’s intent that what's call the
Red Route would ever be used for this road, it wouldn’t make sense
financially, it’s not as Representative Stam said, its simply not a
build-able route because if we go through about 16 or so neighborhoods
or if we go through parks it would be horrendous on the town of Garner.
And I wanna digress for a second and simply say to our friends in Garner
that if for some reason following the environmental studies that the
Federal Government is required us to do, they came up and so the only
route that it could be would be the Red Route then you will see people
like myself and others, well first of all it couldn’t be build
financially but if there was any threat of that you would see myself and
others stick forward the legislation saying, “This is not going to be
build, we will just prohibit from being build.” So, the folks in Garner
should not feel threatened. However, if we wanna get this route build we
have to allow the Federal Government to…We have to comply with the
requirements to study as the Federal Government has set them forward and
I wish you didn’t have to be that way but that’s the way it is but we
need to move forward on this and the reason why need to move forward on
this is jobs, this will be huge for jobs in Wake County once we get the
studies done and we hopefully get the road built along the route that’s
already been identified, the Orange Route, there will be tremendous
force and it will also free up those people who’s land has been planned
for this route for a long time, the Orange Route, the good route. They
have been held up they can’t do anything with their property. So, in
fairness to their property rights we need to move forward is essentially
a local bill although it’s not in a technical sense. So, one of the
quick things, the folks in Garner and their expense along with the RTA,
and their expense they went to Washington to see if they could find,
they engage some pretty skilled people and experienced people in
Washington to see if there was someway to get around all of this where
we wouldn’t have to backtrack on this legislation and it just simply
couldn’t be done. So, all of the efforts basically have been made. So,
we are here with the legislation, we wanna move forward to get this and
taking care have done, get the studies done and get this road build
where it needs to be build. So, I will be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question from the committee this time, Representative ___[04:14].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. What it gonna cost is to do the study?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m not sure if someone is here from the DIT, they may have I think Mr.
___[04:24] is here and if the Chairs direction…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. ___[04:30], I would like to answer the question, if you like?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We don’t have a final cost estimate but typical for an EIS of this
magnitude and a lot of the money has already been spend already with the
alternatives that have been study but you are looking at anywhere from
12 to 15 million for the studies along and the engineering that goes
along with the study so that ends up being studies preliminary…

<p id="15:00">
designs on all alternatives that get you to the space where you can
compare alternatives. About 15 million is my estimation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you. Is any of this coming from the federal government?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Practically all of it would be from the federal government. In the
planning stage, it’s all federally aid eligible and this would be a
federal EIS that we would be pursuing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before I recognize anybody else, let me point out we have an elected
official, or more than one elected official from Garner. We have the
Garner mayor here. I apologize, I don’t know his name.
Mayor Williams. And we have talked about it a little bit and decided
that if Mayor Williams would like to speak for up to and no more than
three minutes, he may do so. Has he prepared? Mr. Mayor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you’ll approach the microphone and identify yourself. The Sergeant
will help you over there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hi, I’m Ronnie Williams, the mayor of Garner. Garner is the home of
Scotty of McCreery and the home of Miss North Carolina. It’s home of
this red route. I’ve lost a great deal sleep over the red route. Matter
of fact, I’m only 25 years old. It has given me some gray hair. But as I
stand here today, I’m still against the red route and I’m still against
the effort to remove the bill. However, what I’ve heard in discussion
since we’ve been with many of you this morning, the explanation that
Nelson Dollar gave earlier is probably the best that we can do right
now. So while we dont’ like everything that’s going on we are going to
accept it if you promise that things will be expedited and happen
quickly. Thank you for your time. God bless you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Back to the committee for further questions.
Representative Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m wondering what the time frame is for doing the study and how long’s
that going to delay moving forward on the project?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that another question for Mr. Trogden?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Trogden might be able to give the details, but we have to do the
study before we can move forward with the project at all. That’s our
problem really.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, yeah. I understand that part. How long’s it going to take to
do the study?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can answer from there, it’ll be fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be dependant on there are several alternatives that were
looked at in the past 2 years while this bill was in place, so we may
have to add some of those alternatives to continue study as well. It
really depends on the number of alternatives, but the estimate right now
is probably 12 months to no more than 24 months. 12 would probable be
fastest, and I’ve heard ranges that it could be 8 to 10, but I feel
comfortable in saying 12 to 24 would be a good planning estimate at this
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We like 8 to 10, is a good range. But in part, in response to
Representative to your question and the comment by the mayor, section
two, specifically says that the department shall strive to expedite the
federal environmental impact statement process so that is certainly the
intent of the General Assembly and I think the department as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions form the committee? That answer your question sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, for a motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to move a favorable report to House Bill number 10.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’ve heard the motion. Any further discussion? If not, for the motion,
all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed say no? The bill is given a favorable report. Thank you.
Committee members, at this time we have a transportation one on one
overview for some committee members that may be new. We’re up to 44
members this year, which is a dramatic increase over the last session.
Want to be sure that everybody’s together on some basic concepts on
transportation. I’d like to recognize the CEO of the Department of
Transportation, Jim Trugden.</p>

<p id="20:00">
but the Chairman, and members of the committee, thank you so much for
the opportunity to be here. And first I'd like to say on behalf of the
department, we really appreciate the wonderful relationship we had with
the general assembly and especially all the transportation committees.
So for all the folks that are new, well the ones that are returning
thanks so much for all the things you've been doing to help us in the
areas of transportation in the past and the new members, certainly we
look forward to working with you and you have our pledge to help you in
any way possible, to answer any question you may have and diligently
attempt to solve transportation problems across our state. A few areas
that I was asked to cover today was one, really a systems overview,
which will be the first couple slides which talk about-
There we go.
Systems responsibility. On the left side of this slide, it basically
shows the state lane miles of responsibility as compared to other
states. The top is the US average, North Carolina is second to the state
of Texas in state responsibility  for lane miles, we're first in road
mile responsibility, but this will be lane miles.  As compared to other
states. And then the right side is total distribution of dollars, and
that would be all dollars that are reported in expenditures on the state
maintained system. So we're 49th in our total distribution of funds on
our system, and second in the size of the system across the nation. And
you'll see that as compared to other states, especially in the
southeast, Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia and Florida.
And then the next slide talks about public ownership, which is
essentially so why are we different, and it really goes back to the
1920s following the depression when the counties got out of the
transportation business and road business and the state took full
responsibility for that. And so you'll see that depicted in this slide,
which shows basically the percentage of state maintained system in North
Carolina, which is about 80,000 road miles followed by the local road
system which is about 20,000 for a little more than 100,000 and the rest
is federal, which is primarily national park, ?? and military
installation and those that are solely federally owned but still public.
As opposed to South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida and so the basically
the thing that changes most is the county responsibility in other
states. But you'll see that we're very very close to Virginia in our
percentage of ownerships. The only difference between us and Virginia is
that Virginia does have one county and ?? county around Richmond that is
responsible for its own public roads.
I wanted to talk a little bit about funding and the first slide is
basically an overview of our state revenues, the dollar depicts every
dollar that comes in  in state revenue and where it comes from, 60% from
motor fuels tax, 15% from highway use, and 25% from fees that are
charged from the DMV. And that will be compared to our federal dollars
that come in for each federal dollar,  92% of that is from the federal
motor fuels tax and 8% is from fees.
And then where does that money go? You'll see that predominance goes to
the highway fund which is 46% of our total funds, followed by the
highway trust fund, which is 25%, and then 28% is federal funds. And
that number, 1.2 billion is all federal funds which will include federal
rail and federal transit as well.
That all of that equals 4.4 billion, which is what we have in our
current fiscal year. That does not include the North Carolina turnpike
funding that's coming from bond sales for turnpike projects.
And then the source of funds and distribution, so for the state dollar
as you see as it comes in, 60% motor fuels, and that 60%  motor fuels
tax is distributed based on the general assembly formula that said
statute 75% of it goes to the highway fund, 25% goes to the trust fund.</p>

<p id="25:00">
And then the DMV fees, which is twenty-five percent of our total, ninety
percent goes to the highway fund, ten percent to the trust fund, then
the highway use tax, which is the fifteen percent of our total state
revenue, one-hundred percent goes to the trust fund. And then how are
those funds distributed? Two-thirds of the total state’s revenue are in
the highway fund, one-third in the trust fund, and then within the
highway fund, one and three-quarter cents are distributed to secondary
roads and then to Powell Bill in separate accounts. That will be one and
three-quarters cents to each.  And then the remainder is distributed
based on allocation rules. And I’ll get to those in just a moment. The
remainder of those will be distributed through appropriations and they
will be distributed within the department based on our allocation rule.
And then the highway trust fund, you will take the items off the top,
which is 172 million, which is transfers plus the turnpike gap funds,
which is off the top from equity, as well as the mobility fund, which
now will be getting close to 58 million a year in the coming year, and
then administration, 44 million, and then the remainder, which is
sixty-two percent to the interstate system, twenty-five percent to the
urban loops, six and a half to secondary roads, and six and a half
percent to Powell Bill, and then the remainder is the federal match. And
debt service – all of that in the remaining column is what is
distributed in the next slide that I’ll show you. And then so how will
those fund be distributed? The highway fund, which the primary component
is maintenance, but you can see the other parts that are coming out of
the highway fund as well. That is distributed based on these formulas
following the general assembly appropriation. The maintenance account –
ninety percent of it is based on mileage with ten percent population.
Contract resurfacing is fifty percent, needs thirty-seven and a half
percent mileage in twelve and a half percent population. And then
secondary roads based on the secondary road mileage with a population
component in there.  And then Powell Bill, seventy-five percent
population and twenty-five percent mileage. And then the trust fund -
that’s all the accounts within the trust fund.  The trust fund will be
distributed to those that remain equity-eligible and will be distributed
based on the formula fifty-percent population, twenty-five percent
remaining mileage to complete and twenty-five percent equally shared. I
can tell you in my twenty-one years of experience at DOT, the last two
slides are some of the most important that you can keep in your office
to maintain and understand because although you are serving a policy
committee, you know policy without resourcing, is hope and we always
like policy and strategy be linked and the only way that is through
resourcing. Here’s how our resources are allocated and that’s very
important to know. I try to memorize most of these and I will tell you,
if you can memorize these, these two and then the next slide, which
basically shows all of our funds, to conclude the federal funds, we will
award you an honorary degree from DOT and the doctor of
transportationology. These are some of the most important slides you can
understand from a funding perspective with the department. So once you
have all of those funds, even though they exist to those accounts,
here’s how basically all of it is ultimately distributed with the TIP
portion here which still remains. Of the TIP, one-third of that is
distributed through equity.  The highway maintenance portion, here. And
then the remainder which will be ?? municipal aid of a construction
transfers, admin, other modes, down to the smallest slice there which is
0.3 percent, which is governor highway safety program. And then our
remaining debt service. So that’s all the dollars that are spent on the
Department of Transportation in this current fiscal year. This is that
data and you’ll see the breakdown. Equity formula because we constantly
see questions about how it’s applied, where it’s applied, what it means,
and I covered sixty percent based on population, twenty-five miles to
complete, and twenty-five percent equal share.  The population
percentage is distributed based on the regions, and the regions are the
regions that are shown on this map.</p>

Region A, which is in the Northeast, is Divisions 1 and 4. Region B is
Divisions 2 and 3. Region C is Divisions 5 and 6. D is 7 and 9. E is 8
and 10. F is 11 and 12. And G is Divisions 13 and 14. But you can look
and find your county and region and ultimately the division that those
counties would be in. And then funds that are not eligible to be
distributed through the equity formula are these that are listed.
Number one is urban loops, but that’s been that way since the law was
established in 1989. And the original law, some have been added through
the years.  Competitive awards and grants – these are primarily federal
competitive awards and grants. For example, any grants that come to us
through rail public transportation or even highways through like the
most recent tiger program to receive a 10 million dollar grant to ??
Bridge.  That would be equity-free as well because it would have been
through the federal grants program. Federal congestion and mitigation
and air quality funds fondly referred to as CMAQ which will be a portion
of another pot of federal funds under MAT 21 or the new federal
authorization, but those funds are not eligible or not distributed
according to the equity formula.  They’re distributed basically for
non-air attainment or quality non-attainment regions, which are
basically those that have not been well-performing in air quality
monitoring.  And then the ?? River Bridge phase 1 and it’s Garvey bonds
payments were excluded from equity.  That was part of the Mobility Funds
Projects of Mobility Funds Establishment in July of 2010 as well as the
Appalachian Development Highway System Funds which are part of the
Appalachian Region Commission, but there are federal funds that come
through Congress through USDOT specifically for projects in the ARC
eligible region.  Next topic I wanted to talk about is strategic
prioritization so after we have all these funds in these pots, they are
distributed to all these accounts, how do we program projects across our
state to make sure we are achieving the maximum effect of our
transportation dollars and how they are being spent? One of the
challenges that the department faced prior to 2009 was that we did not
have what I would call a public process for prioritizing or programming
projects and our delivery rate was not what we wanted it to be.
Generally averaged somewhere between 54 and 55 percent per year but
that’s because a lot of projects were in the pipeline being studied.
And a great example was talked about was the kind of studies that you
were just debating at 540.  How long does it take? What needs to be
done? Some projects take much less time because of the size and
complexity of the project.  Others, very complex projects, takes much
longer. So if you have, for example, at that time, we had about 12
billion dollars towards the projects in say for example, 2008, 12
billion dollars’ worth of projects shown as funded in our transportation
program, but only 6 billion dollars anticipated worth of revenue.
That’s because so many were in studies trying to get through the study
process to be eligible for funding that we were over-promising and
over-committing transportation projects for available funds.  The
solution was we had to have a more open and transparent for selecting
projects for even entering to the study process to make sure we were
evaluating projects on good sound criteria that everyone can understand
and then even if you didn’t meet the required priority points in that
process, you would at least have understood why in comparison to other
projects in your region and across the state, and then know what to do
to make your project more competitive. That process was undertaken in
2009.  It was led by strategic planning and office of transportation or
what we call the SPOT office. And they work closely with groups across
our state to develop our prioritization process, to refine the
prioritization process, and to make sure that…</p>

One that's both open and transparent but also people have confidence in
and it's replicatable. No matter how you ask the questions you get the
same kind of answers. The work group had some very key external
partners, and I'll talk about those in a minute. Those are the ones that
help us understand issues, not just the transportation issues, but also
the local issues across our state. Because as you're aware, there's no
one solution that can solve every challenge in transportation across the
state. Then it's always good to have folks that understand the
challenges in each region helping to develop the process that we can all
be satisfied with. The scope of the prioritization process in North
Carolina currently measures about 85% of the projects within the trust
fund, that's delivered through the trust fund. The reason for that is
some of our projects that are funded through the trust fund, and I'll
give you the examples of our signal systems improvements, our state-wide
traffic offices, our road striping program. Some of those are more
maintenance and operations, and so they really don't belong in a
prioritization system where you're prioritizing capital projects. Our
system really focuses on the capital projects across our state that
improve transportation across all modes. All modes are prioritized, and
the work group partners are listed there, but have been invaluable for
us in getting feedback. The objective that we had when we started this
was we wanted a process to prioritize projects and a program at the end
that's not just a North Carolina DOT program but a State of North
Carolina program. Something that everyone across our state says, I have
an interest in, I have input into. And I can clearly show the challenges
in the region that I live and work, and have input into how we solve
transportation projects not only for our state but for each of the
regions across the state. So where does prioritization fit in? This is a
great model of, first we have long-range transportation program, which
is our 30 year program that basically looks at the needs of our system.
So it's really not about projects at this level. It's about, we have an
80,000 mile road network. We have 340 miles of passenger rail service.
We have ferry systems, we have aviation. We have all of these great
capabilities. How will our state grow? And what will be the future
challenges? And how will we maintain the capability of our existing
network to meet those 30 year objectives? That's really the focus there.
It's not about projects, it's more about, what resources will we need
and how will we address these growing challenges with the 50% population
growth that we anticipate we'll see over the coming timeline. That
information really looks at what are the needs, and what are the big
programs that we need to address these. And then what's the right
balance? Because in the end, you'll always find many things that you can
do. But then in the end, you've got to decide what do I have to do and
then what do I need to do? Because that's generally where resources run
out. So that helps us get to, now the hard resource decision making
comes in at that 10 year. We know we're projecting to have this level of
revenue. We know we're to have this level of challenge and demand based
on what we see in the long range. So how do we start identifying those
programs and then projects? So the 10 year program is where you first
start seeing projects in our program show up, because we want to make
sure that they're staring to queue up so we can deliver them in a timely
manner. And this is basically why our strategy was important. We want to
get away from 50% delivery, and our objective is a 95% delivery in that
last five years. Because we want to make sure we have the right mix of
projects and programs in that six to ten year period. That's the period
that's the most important for prioritization. What do we have in the
queue in the years six through ten that we know will be important for
our state so we can deliver that in a very timely manner? And not only
does it include projects. The wonderful thing that, I believe, and one
of the most significant things that we changed in our 10 year look is,
is it's not just</p>

It’s every dine that we spent because even though as you know, we have
these in separate funds, this body and the Senate has this question and
so in the short term do we need to make some immediate adjustments and
one of the things that we have been very appreciative with both the
house and the Senate was the support of reprogramming some money for our
Bridge Program but that’s a perfect example of how we are able to take
critical needs that we see work together as partners and drive solutions
but our 10 year program has every dine what we anticipate spending
trying to balance level of service across both.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanna…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize interrupting, we do have another meeting at morning here so
we gotta three or four minutes left, I would like to take a request…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I have done about one more slots I will be through very quickly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, that’s really what's important is to make sure we have all our
dollars in there so not only the General Assembly sees what we are
spending our money on but also the public sees that, our partner see
that, everyone can see where we are investing each transportation
dollar. And I will not cover scoring other than to tell you we try to
look at everything that’s important both congestion, both payment score,
safety, economic considerations, benefit cost of projects and all of
those who are considered as well as local rankings and multimode points
as well. The most important think I can tell you is that because of the
collaboration, because of the confidence that’s been build since we
started this process, the General Assembly ____[01:52] our
prioritization process, it is now law, session law in 2012-84 and we
certainly believe that’s because of the wonderful partnership that we
have not only with this body but also with all of those partners across
the state that make it like I said a state transportation program not
just like DOT transportation program. And we are still working on the
next phase, we are collecting all inputs from groups across the state
and that is a public process just collecting ideas where we need to
improve but I can tell you we don’t stop we wanna look for every way to
even gain more and more confidence and be more and more efficient with
our transportation dollars and so with that…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I have got time for one brief question and we are just about out
of time, Representative Shepherd had his hand up sometime ago.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Sergeant, should it purposes in funding categories within the
highway trust fund, highway fund even in ___[03:00] this time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You said the purposes, well the trust fund right now is a mix of
purposes we have Luke’s interstate power bill, secondary road trust
fund, and a mix of others. I think one of the things that we have been
talking about is first that the Governor has given us how do we take our
long range plan which is for 30 year but make sure we are tiny into
other things like commerce, economic development region, a comprehensive
and coordinated plan across the state. We really need to decide where we
are gonna go before we decide the best way to resource. So, the big
challenge is where we are going, one of the simple things though that we
have look that is one of the tough parts about how we program all these
dollars as we have a very unusual mix in each of our accounts and the
highway fund we have an unusual mix of maintenance operations,
construction model and then in the trust fund we have an unusual mix of
capital, maintenance operations I mean all kinds of things and sometimes
that creates a competition across the state is not very healthy, maybe
if there is a way to focus one of them on, this is our maintenance and
operations fund and then the other trust fund this is our capital fund
that may help start addressing some of those questions about now what's
the appropriate things in each slice of those? That would be my personal
opinion is, how we work to really focus on highway fund…

on operations and it's not just highways because we have a lot of
operations and maintenance accounts. And then trust fund, how do we
address capital needs across the state in all modes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK we're gonna have to cut it off and possibly Mr.
Charlie can come back for a question and answer session later on. But
there's another committee coming in. We've got to wrap it up, so meeting
is adjourned. Thank you very much.</p>
