Let&#39;s all bow our heads please. Heavenly Father, today we have come
together once again to work on behalf of the people of this wonderful
state, that you have blessed so abundantly. You have entrusted us with
the responsibility of caring for the majestic animals, fertile ??,
beautiful coast and waters that you so generously provided. Father,
there are many among us today that believe with their whole hearts that
we are here by your design, that you have called us to be here for your
purpose to do your work. So Lord, on behalf of this body, I beseech you
to open our hearts and minds to one another, that we might work in
harmony to address and resolve the issues before us in a manner most
pleasing to you. Help us Lord, to use the patience, understanding,
tolerance, compassion and humility that you have given us, strengthen us
to suppress our vanity, our egos, and our pride, that we may govern
fairly, reasonably, and honestly in the best interest of those who we
represent. And finally Lord, we ask that you bless those men and women
around the world who at this very minute are at the watch, in battle,
away from family, friends and the comfort of home, defending our very
right to be here, exercising the freedoms of self-government that they
and so many before them have, and are sacrificing for our posterity.
Bless them and protect them and us we pray, in Christ&#39;s holy name.
Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representatives Riddell, Ross; House Bill 58, a bill
to be entitled ‘An act providing that the Alamance County Sheriff’s
Office may contract for the purpose of food and supplies for the
county’s detention facility without being subject to the requirements of
certain state purchases and contract laws.’ The General Assembly of
North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Alamance, Representative Riddell rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The House will come to order.
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Friends, this bill comes to us with the unanimous
support of our county commissioners, and it’s a request to allow our
local Sheriff’s Office to do what every LEA, every school district is
currently allowed to do, and that’s to engage in the purchase of food
locally for service in the cafeterias at the schools. Currently the
state has a bidding process that’s required, and what we’re seeking with
this local bill is to allow our Sheriff’s Department to purchase food
locally to keep our dollars locally in Alamance County. We have some
very talented grocers and farmers in Alamance County and we’d like to
keep our money there. It’s also a cost saving for our county. The last
state-bid price that we had per meal in our detention facility was $1.41
per meal. We have a current bill from a local provider at $1.17. That’s
a 24 cent saving for a facility that serves over 15 hundred meals per
day, so we’re talking about several hundred dollars in savings for our
county over a year. That’s over $100,000 in savings. And finally, the
quality of the food would be much improved. We can get local fresh
produce. We can bring that and serve it in our detention center. We
currently use the detainees for the food preparation service and
cleanup, so this is a good operation that we want to do in Alamance
County. I’d be happy to answer any questions, and Mr. Speaker, we do
have a friendly amendment to follow. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For
what purpose does the gentleman from Alamance, Representative Ross rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I won’t go back over all of the attributes that my colleague
from Alamance talked about, but I will say that as someone who spent 20
years in local government, this is a good example of how sometimes we
can do some things on a local basis and in this case save some real
dollars. I think the figures are somewhere up around $100,000, and for a
county like Alamance, that’s a lot of money, so I ask you to support the
bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] For
what purpose does the gentleman from Scotland, Representative Pierce
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative Ross a question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Alamance yield to the
gentleman from Scotland? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to ask you a question about
that. When growing season is over… is this all year long or just growing
season? How long would this process work for your Sheriff to do this? Is
this growing season for certain fruits and vegetables, or could you
explain it to me and help me understand that please? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually this is year long. Growing season only enhances the quality and
freshness of the food. We have figured out in Alamance County through
the use of our co-op and our local farmers how to really manage and have
fresh, good local food pretty much year round. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman
from Cumberland, Representative Floyd rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forth
an amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd moves to amend the bill on page 1, line 2 by
deleting the words, the Alamance and substituting the word a.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Cumberland, Representative Floyd is recognized to
debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, I&#39;ve spoken with our sheriff and our sheriff
attorney, and they would like to be included in the bill, so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m sorry, if the gentleman would please restate his question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ve spoken with our sheriff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, the gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, I&#39;ve spoken with our sheriff, and he would like to be included on
this bill, and I spoke with the bill sponsor and he has no objection to
add Cumberland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further discussion, further debate? For what purpose
does the gentleman from Randolph, Representative McNeill rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to say that it, also Randolph County is added on this also
and for someone that administered the budget for a jail for over 20
years, this is an excellent thing and will allow the sheriff&#39;s
office in Randolph and these listed counties to save some taxpayer
money. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Rockingham, Representative
Jones rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Riddell a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Alamance yield to the gentleman from Rockingham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, my friend. A friendly question. I cosponsored the bill. I
certainly support it. Are you aware of anyone in this general assembly
that represents a county that has conveyed to you any reason they would
like to not see this be a statewide bill? I see it&#39;s being opened up
now to several counties besides Alamance and I can&#39;t think of a
reason why someone would not want for their county to be included with
this. And so, are you aware of any opposition for this being statewide?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, I&#39;m not aware of any opposition in this
chamber for, for that idea. However, we would like to keep this a local
bill, and I&#39;m happy to add on the counties that have requested be
brought on with the amendment, but I would like to keep it under 15 so
we remain a local bill, so this particular part of it can go through. If
anyone would like to run it as a state bill, I would certainly be a
happy sponsor, cosponsor such a bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, does anyone yield for another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Alamance yield to a second question from the
gentleman from Rockingham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, my friend. I wanted to ask you, if you would have a problem
if I objected to, for a third reading. I might like to add my county to
this, and there may be a few more that are less than 15.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, what I&#39;d be happy to do is after we can get this
first amendment voted in is displace the bill, I&#39;d be happy to take
on any other counties as long as we don&#39;t go above the threshold to
move this from a local bill to a public bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, the, two things, one, a perfecting amendment may be done to this
one. Additionally, the, because the bill changed the title, third
reading of this bill will not happen until tomorrow so depending on how
many counties get added to it, it might, this bill might be hanging out
with us a while. So we&#39;ll see.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the, further discussion, further debate on the, on
amendment one sent forth by Representative Floyd? If not, the question
before the House is the passage of the Floyd amendment to the House
committee substitute to House bill 58. So many favoring adoption of the
amendment will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open
the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 116
having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative, amendment one
is adopted. Does the gentleman from Alamance wish to temporarily
displace this bill to see if there are any additional amendments at this
time, so we don&#39;t have to have a third reading or potentially
another day on it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. I&#39;d like to get it wrapped up today, if we could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Does the gentleman from Durham wish to speak to the displacement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, sir, I wish to go speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. The, it&#39;s the intention of the chair to just displace this
bill at this time. All right, the bill is displaced at this time. House
bill 41, the clerk will read.

North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Wake, Representative Dollar, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the
House. This is a fairly straightforward bill. All it does is add North
Carolina State University to two other institutions, the North Carolina
School for the Arts and UNC at Chapel Hill, as being able to do these
public exhibitions of fireworks on their campus under the supervision of
their university fire marshal and as always the state marshal, so all
it… the net effect of it is – and this just applies to NC State in Wake
County – the effect of it is it just eliminates one of the permitting
steps along the way for these pyrotechnic displays to be conducted. So
we’re simply extending to NC State the same thing that’s been in place
and working just fine over at UNC chapel Hill, so be happy to answer any
questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? The
question before the House is the passage of house Bill 55 on its second
reading. So many favoring passage of the bill will vote “aye”; those
opposed will vote “no”. The Clerk will open the vote. Representative

For what purpose does the gentleman from Sampson, Representative Bell
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to be
recorded as voting “aye” on House Bill 41. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman will be recorded as having voted “aye” on House Bill 41. House
Bill 71. The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representatives Hurley
and McNeill; House Bill 71, a bill to be entitled ‘An act to clarify
with whom the oath of office taken by members of each board county
commissioners should be filed.’ The General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady from Hurley, Representative Randolph
is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Ladies
and gentlemen, this truly is a clarifying bill. The clerk to our County
Commissioners Board asked me to run this because some of the people, the
Sheriff’s deputies and other people in the county, have to take oaths,
and they make copies of them and file them, and some of them thought
they needed to be filed with the Clerk of Superior Court, but this is to
just clarify that they’re to be filed with the Clerk of the County
Commissioners. This is just explaining that. Thank you. Appreciate your
support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not,
the question before the House is the passage of House bill 71 on its
second reading. So many favoring passage of the bill will vote “aye”;
those opposed will vote “no”. The Clerk will open the vote.

amendments to House Bill 58. Let me ask this, are there any members who
intend to seek an amendment to House Bill 58 to add their county. If
there are if you would please turn on your light. Alright then. It looks
like Hardister can’t make his mind up back there, he keeps turning his
off and on. Alright, thank you, you can turn your lights off.
Representative Rydell, would the gentleman simply wish to, actually the
House will be just at ease for a moment. Members it appears there will
be an amendment to add 12 counties to the bill which still keeps it as a
local bill. If a member desires to have their county added to this bill,
the Chair would encourage those members to touch base with
Representative Rydell. I believe staff is actually working on an
amendment now and it’s the chair’s intention probably just to do one
amendment adding all those counties and then go ahead and do second
reading today and then we can bring it back tomorrow for third reading
and get the bill on over to the Senate. A few lights on, I don’t know if
these are folks. I see Representatives Terry, Representatives Graham and
Representatives Johnson. Do any of those members desire rising for a
particular purpose or is just to, okay, alright. [gavel bangs] The House
will come back to order. Members, in the interest of time the Chair is
going to go ahead and open the floor up to notices and announcements and

  And we also have a school group from the Forsyth Academy in
Winston-Salem if you all would please stand. Thank you for being with
us. And school groups are wondering what we&#39;re doing. We&#39;re
waiting on an amendment to be prepared. It&#39;s sort of like when you
show up for school and you had, forgot you had some homework to do and
you&#39;re having to do it real quick before the teacher comes back in.
So that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing right now. For what purpose does the
gentleman from Pitt, Representative Brown rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For another announcement, mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, I just previously noticed that the committee on Health will be
moved to noon in respect for a Chapel that takes place at noon,
we&#39;re going to renotice the committee once again for 12:30. So the
committee on Health will be renoticed for 12:30 tomorrow. Thank you.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Rowan, Representative Ford
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. The local government committee scheduled to
meet Thursday at 11, we will not meet. We put it off for another week.
We&#39;ll meet next Thursday for local government. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the majority leader, Representative Hager of
Rutherford County rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege, Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a moment. The House will come to order. The gentleman from
Rutherford is recognized to speak to a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. I couldn&#39;t help but notice, I wanted to
compliment you on your selection of your reading clerk this year. Mr.
Reggie Seals. Reggie has served us great in my committees, and I do
appreciate him being there. So thank you mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m sorry, the chair, the gentleman had his microphone a little far
away. I was just trying to send a signal. I didn&#39;t do a good job to
say that I couldn&#39;t hear. And I can&#39;t hear. This is great. For
what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative Faircloth
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister speaker. The joint appropriations, justice, and public
safety committee will meet tomorrow morning, room 415, 8:30 AM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Surrey, Representative Stevens rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to state an inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, I was concerned you said session would meet at 10
tomorrow and 10 on Thursday. Question is on Wednesday, will we be
finished in time to continue the judiciary 3 meeting at 12:30, and are
we gonna have a brief enough session that we can still meet our regular
time for children, youth, and families at Thursday at 11?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that both of those committees will be able to meet. I know the
rules chairs are working on putting a calendar together at this time, so
I believe the lady is safe on both of those meetings. The gentleman from
Cumberland, Representative Floyd is recognized to send forth an
amendment. Members, the House committee substitute for House bill 58 is
back before the House. Representative Floyd is recognized to send forth
an amendment. Clerk will read the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd moves to amend the bill as amended by amendment one
by rewriting section two to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Cumberland has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, what we&#39;re asking, since we have a little small
break, is those committees, is it on the dashboard, mister speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, the amendment is on the dashboard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If, if you would look at those counties that added, and we ask for your
support on those counties that were added. Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Wake, Representative Holley rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To, well I guess, well, no I have a comment about the amendment. I&#39;d
like to speak on the amendment. It looks like it&#39;s so many venders
now and having done contracts, one of the things that does when
you&#39;ve got 58 exceptions to the contracts it makes, changes the
flavor of the initial contract. We might need to take a look at that
before we vote on it because 58 is an awful lot of people to now get off
of a term contract. Don&#39;t know who to put that to, but I think we
might need to take a closer look at that before we do 58 people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Michaux
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, to speak on the amendment which will fix the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The way I read this bill and adding all of these other counties to it is
that if you are taking out of all of these counties with this amendment,
them being subject to chapter 143 section 129, and chapter 143 section
130, which will allow, which will allow all of these folks to sole
source contracts for food for their jail. In other words

  It&#39;s going to be left up to whoever&#39;s doing it, to give anybody
they want to that contract, and I&#39;m more concerned about opting out
of 143-131, which says that all public entities shall submit, solicit
minority participation in contracts.  And that&#39;s, if you pass this
bill, that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s going to happen, it&#39;s going to
be a sole source contract that goes out, and I would oppose not only the
amendment but the bill, too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Alamance,
Representative Riddell, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor the debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you House members for
your indulgence as we work through this.  Folks, this is a good
amendment, and what it does is allow your sheriffs, your local detention
facilities the right to purchase food locally, to keep your local
dollars in the pockets of your local citizens, your grocers, and your
farmers.  That&#39;s what this is about, it&#39;s about providing
flexibility, the same exact flexibility that every single school
district in North Carolina currently enjoys.  it has nothing to do,
absolutely, absolutely nothing to do with what my friend, Representative
Michaux just spoke on.  This has nothing to do with trying to avoid
minority contracts, it has everything to do with better quality food
which resolves problems in our detention facilities.  When the inmates
have better food, there&#39;s less problems for the people trying to
keep them in detention.  It provides savings for the counties,
substantial savings.  I&#39;m not sure about your county, but $100,000
plus savings  per year for Alamance County is $100,000 that can go any
other number of places.  And again, it&#39;s simply local flexibility.
There will be contracts, there will be oversight by the duly elected
county commissioners.  This is not slipping under anybody&#39;s radar,
this is still duly reviewed and there will be accountability and
transparency.  So, I encourage you, please vote green on the amendment,
and thank you again for your patience as we work through this.  I
haven&#39;t been this popular, Mr. Speaker, since third grade when
DeeDee Mall was my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Glazier, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the amendment, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor the debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]And I&#39;m going to support the amendment because I
think it aids the counties it needs to, but I&#39;m going to do that
with the recognition that there really is an issue to talk about before
people vote on the amendment, to talk about the Section 143-131,
that&#39;s in the bill as well.  So, I&#39;ll hold my comments on 131
until we get to the bill, but I would say to my from Alamance, because I
think the purpose of the bill and the amendment are really good, and I
certainly understand the abrogation from 129.  But, 131 does exactly
what Representative Michaux said, it contains the minority contracting
provisions, so there really is an issue about that, but I&#39;ll vote
for the amendment to add all the counties that want, but I think before
we do a third reading on this bill, we ought to get at least some sense
of what&#39;s happening to 131 requirements.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
Representative Michaux, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I just wanted to ask the gentleman from Alamance,
Representative Riddell a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the  gentleman from Alamance yield to the
gentleman from Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Riddell, do you realize that with the
wording in your bill as it is now, that it opts out whether you intended
it or not, that it opts out 143-129, which requires that minority
contracts be sought out and these types of things?  Are you aware of
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Am I aware that it exempts?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That under the bill that you have here, that it would
take out Section 143-129, would take that out, and that section says
that you have to solicit minority contracts in instances like this.  Are
you aware that this what that bill would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Have we voted, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman from Craven is recognized to a point of
order.  The gentleman will state his point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Are we on the amendment or are we on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Is the gentleman from Durham directing his question
relevant.

  To the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To the amendment, yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman from Alamance has the floor to debate the
amendment, or excuse me, to answer the question proposed by the
gentleman from Durham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you propose the question
one more time, please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
restate the question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The question is under the
amendment that’s added to the bill, do you understand that those
counties that are being added would in fact be opted out of section 1,
GS143-129 which requires the solicitation of minority contracts?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that the status currently for the school districts?
Can they opt out of minority contracts as well? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, it’s certainly not the purpose of this bill to
avoid any kind of minority setbacks like that. It will still have the
oversight of every single county commissioner aboard. There is still
oversight. There will still be the requirement of accountability and
transparency. This is not an attempt to circumvent any kind of minority
set asides, this is simply an attempt to put the purchasing power back
in the hands of the local government where I believe it belongs in this
instance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does
the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative Floyd rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, for time’s sake, the bill will have a third
reading tomorrow. Could we go on with. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If the bill
will in fact have third reading tomorrow. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So my
question is since this is my amendment I would like to call for the
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his motion. The
gentleman may state his motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I call
for the, I move that the question be before the House. That we vote on
amendment H58H2. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Cumberland I
believe has moved the previous question. The question before the House
is the motion for previous question made by the gentleman from
Cumberland. So many favoring the motion for previous question will vote
aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The clerk
will lock the machine and record the vote. 96 having voted in the
affirmative and 18 in the negative, the previous question has been
passed. Subject to the rules, do either the minority or majority leader
desire to comment on this bill? Strike that, on the amendment? Seeing no
lights illuminated, the question before the House is the adoption of
amendment 2 set forth by Representative Floyd to the House Committee
Substitute of House Bill 58. So many favoring the adoption of the
amendment will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open
the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote, 111
having voted in the affirmative and 5 in the negative, the amendment is
adopted and we’re now back on the bill. Further discussion or debate on
the bill as amended. For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash,
Representative Collins rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative
Riddell a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Alamance
yield to the gentleman from Nash. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Riddell, there’s
only one thing that popped up in my mind when I read this and that it I
notice that the law, that it becomes law effective, in other words it
becomes effective immediately, what we’re passing. As a business person
my only concern with that is would that cause us to be breaking any
contracts that have already been signed if we make, if we make this
effective immediately. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My understanding is contracts
in existence would be determined by the county commissioners who entered
into the contracts. This is not a contact entered into by a sheriff.
This is a contract entered into by the county governing body and they
would have to sort through what they want to do with their contracts
from this point. It just gives them the opportunity, it gives them the
flexibility to go local. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question from the gentleman
from Nash. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I think what you told me is that we’re not giving the counties
permission to break any contracts they’ve already entered into, is that
correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It would be up to each individual county’s,
county’s attorney to make that kind of decision for you. I couldn’t
begin to hazard a conjecture on that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose
does the gentleman from Burke, Representative Blackwell rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’d like to ask a question of my friend Representative Glazier
if I may. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Cumberland yield to
the gentleman from Burke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, I’m
concerned about the concern that you and Representative Michaux raised.

  One, I’m wondering if I’m maybe reading it incorrectly. It appears to me
that subsection a doesn’t have anything to do with minority contracts at
all but that the reference and application to minority contracts is in
subsection b and it says that all public entities shall list minority
participation in contracts for the erection, construction, alteration or
repair of any building or [??] pursuant to this section and the rest of
the subsection I read as referring to that limited type of contract
which would not be encompassed by this particular legislation which is
dealing with purchasing food and I’m wondering if you see that as an
incorrect reading on my part? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I actually agree
with that reading as I’m going. That’s just what I was talking with
staff about in the back. I’m wondering frankly if the thing to do here
is to amend the bill to say that it applies under 143-131a because b
clearly has the minority contracting provision but in my view, I agree
with you, does not apply, yet it’s encompassed in the bill. It might
solve the problem by simply specifcying that we’re talking about
subsection a which is I think what it’s getting at and takes us out of
the b problem or creating any opportunity for there to be a b problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenberg,
Representative Bishop rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the gentleman from
Alamance a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Alamance
yield to the gentleman from Mecklenberg. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My popularity
continues. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have said
on a couple of occasions that this allows for local food service in the
jail, but isn’t it true that local governments, counties and
municipalities, let bids all the time locally for contracts that they
need? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, but there is a, you know, a statutory
amount of I think $500,000 for things that must be let out to bid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In the absence of this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
gentleman wish to prepare a second question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I
could, yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And does the gentleman from Alamance yield
to a second question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do, [SPEAKER CHANGES] He
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In the absence of this bill would this
contract be subject to the core requirement of public bidding and the
award to the bidder, the low qualified bidder. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If this
bill passes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If it doesn’t pass. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If
it does not pass. If the bill does not pass than current law would
remain. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And that, may I ask another question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for an additional question. Does
the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The current law is then that this service
would be required to be publicly bid. [SPEAKER CHANGES] There is some
legal disputation to whether food as a commodity comes under the
definition of equipment, apparatus, things like that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I’d like to ask one more question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
the gentleman from Alamance yield to an additional question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there
something about the provision of food in particular that makes it
appropriate to exempt from the requirement of bidding that is usually
applicable in contracting. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that’s a question
for 115 local school districts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does
the gentleman from Randolph, Representative McNeill rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Having been involved in the process of purchasing food for
jails for over 20 years I just thought I’d throw my two cents in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Apparently it seems to me that everybody has been
trying to paint this that if this bill passes that the food service
manner to jail will just be able to do willy nilly what they want. Now I
don’t know how every county in the state does it, but in Randolph county
the food service manager has several layers that they have to go through
to purchase food. You know, there was a supervisor at the jail that
those purchases had to go through and then after that they came through
me and then they went to the Finance Department at the county. The
Finance Officer worked for the county commissioner, so it goes through
several different processes. It’s not just like the lady that’s
preparing the meals just picks up the phone and says I want to order
this stuff, so there is a process. Also, those of you that have been
involved in county government before, I think you know that the state
purchasing law allows that commissioners some flexibility in laws that
are the way that they do apply those rules and regulations. Not every
county, some counties are stricter in how they apply these and some
counties are

  <p id="50:00">
  More lax in how they apply them but they are allowed a lot of latitude
on the local level as to how to do that. And just piggybacking on what
Representative Riddell said, there is a lot of debate when you start
dealing into these purchasing laws, and as to whether food falls under
the category whether you have to get competitive bids. I&#39;ll just
give you an example, and it has nothing to do with food but when we
bought used vehicles at the Sheriff&#39;s office, we didn&#39;t have to
go out for competitive bids, because how do you get a competitive bid on
a used vehicle? So there are exceptions to all the purchasing laws. I
think it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a good bill, and I recommend passage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Wake, Representative Holley rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d like to address the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are some things that I can answer. First of all, for used
equipment, for used vehicles, used equipment are by statute exempted, in
the laws saying used equipment subject to prior sale. You can also sole
source venders but you have to have good, strong reasons for going to
sole source. Buying local is really well intended and in many instances,
it is what is needed in, in some cases. We need the opportunity to buy
local. But when you buy local, you mess up existing contracts. When a
contract is based upon the volume of maybe ten counties, and you take
maybe nine out of the ten counties out, then the vender who has that
contract now has a pricing mechanism in effect, but his pricing
mechanism in effect is for ten counties, and then he&#39;s unable to
fulfill the obligations of that contract. I personally feel that this
bill needs to go back to a committee and we need to look at it a little
bit closer, because the adding, the exemption of one or two counties is
one thing, but when you&#39;re talking about 58 counties, you&#39;re
talking about changing a statewide procurement system that we really
need to seriously take a look at.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Cumberland has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much mister speaker. I think this solves part of the
problem, I hope. So, I agree with Representative Blackwell&#39;s
interpretation and what this does, if you look at 143-131, there are two
subsections. A is what I think the Representatives from Alamance and
those who are involved want to be exempted from, but that doesn&#39;t
deal with minority contracting issues. B does. This doesn&#39;t, this
amendment means they&#39;re not exempted to the extent it applies from
the minority contracting provisions. That issue at least, is taken out
of the debate. People may still have their agreement or disagreement on
the sole source issue on 129, but I think this amendment resolves the
minority participation issue in 143, and I would encourage adoption of
the amendment.

Riddell rise?

For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Michaux
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House, this amendment is good
for, as far as it goes, and what it does is leave in the minority
contracting portion of 129 of 131, sorry. 143-131, but GS 43-129 allows
them to do a sole source contract. Period, in the report, whether or not
they solicit minority participation or not, they can still do a sole
source contract without, without opening up bidding at all, and that is
one of the things that many of us have fought for over the years is a
sole source contracting situation which does what this does, and this is
why the, all intents and purposes, the amendment is good as far as it
goes, but when you look at the whole situation, you still have a sole
source problem involved.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Glazier would yield for a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Cumberland yield to
the gentleman from Union. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m trying to follow you and I too picked
up on that this deal with minority contracting regarding construction
issues. Could you explain again to me the effect of the amendment on,
because I understand what you’re trying to say but I’m thinking that the
amendment actually, your amendment actually has no effect on the bill.
Does it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It may or may not depending on how you read
131b. I read it as Representative Blackwell does, so I don’t think it
was involved to begin with, but since the bill as originally written
encompassed both a and b, to get any doubt out of there that we’re doing
anything with the minority contracting provision, this simply takes that
subsection out of the debate so that it’s not an issue and therefore
you’re left with a decision of the gist of the bill plus Representative
Michaux’s concern on 129, but it gets the minority contracting provision
on 131 out of the debate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate on the amendment? If not, the question before the House is the
adoption of amendment 3 offered by Representative Glazier to the House
Committee Substitute to House Bill 58. So many favoring the adoption of

further debate? If not, the question. For what purpose does the
gentleman from Mecklenberg rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Competitive bidding is an annoyance but it is
something that the state has required adherence to, has required
municipalities and counties to adhere to for good and sound reasons. You
may in a particular circumstance not get the low bid or the lowest price
by having a competitive bid process, but over the long haul you will and
more importantly over the long haul public bidding and the requirement
to advertise for competitive bids, accept bids and award a contract to
the lowest qualified bidder provides protection against ultimately in
some place, in some part of North Carolina, exercise of influence in
contracting. The question it seems to me arises, even if you have a
situation in which you could now replace a contractor for a lower price,
what happens in the future? How long will that contracting relationship
exist? When will it be exposed to competitive bidding in the future? How
will you know that market circumstances haven’t changed such that you’re
still getting the lowest price? There are many other circumstances. As
I’m at a disadvantage as a new member. I do not know why the school
systems have been exempted and I concede the point, they appear to be
exempted from article 8 that all other political subdivisions are
required to follow. I don’t know how that’s wise. I don’t know how the
provision of food service is different and they justify that and we
haven’t heard that in this debate. What I do know is there are many
other circumstances that I’m familiar with in which these same laws
govern contracting processes and difficult questions could come to pass
if propositions come forward to exempt those from the public bidding
process. It is good policy for a clean government and I’m gonna have to
oppose the bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
lady from Mecklenberg, Representative Schaffer rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To request that my vote be changed on the Glazier amendment. I
accidentally voted no. I’d like to change it to aye please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady will be recorded as having voted aye on the Glazier
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Randolph, Representative McNiell rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor, Representative Rydell a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Alamance yield to
the gentleman from Randolph? [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a world record in
popularity. Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If
your bill passes would the commissioners of your county still be able to
require your jail to get competitive bids for food if it’s even required
to get them? [SPEAKER CHANGES] When the bill passes, yes. They still
will have the oversight that they currently enjoy on all bidded
contracts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Debate the bill

  The gentleman from Randolph has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s a good bill. There&#39;s still a lot of layers of supervision
there. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Hall
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker, and just a quick analysis to say we could
certainly bid, or open bids for local food at our jails and have a bid,
and if there was no competitive bid then a different situation would
take place. But I agree with Representative Bishop from the standpoint
that when possible, having a bidding process is valuable and it helps
keep your price down. We all would hope and the opportunity for the
county commissioners to have oversight. It wouldn&#39;t be required
necessarily that they examine this particular issue regarding the bid.
So I have to agree with what he said about the fact that competitive
bidding is helpful, and if we could do it at a local level, and say we
have two producers or providers of food at the local level, they can
bid. Whichever one is the best bid, we restricted it to the local area
and took the best bid. So I would oppose the bill as it is now, but
certainly if we could modify it to say it allows competitive bidding
limited to local area suppliers or producers, I think that achieves what
we&#39;re trying to get done here, both bilocally as well as ensure we
have a competitive bidding process where available. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question before the House is the passage of House committee substitute
for House bill 58 on its second reading. So many favoring passage of the
bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. Representative Speciale, does the gentleman wish to record on this
vote? Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 94 having voted
in the affirmative and 21 in the negative, the House committee
substitute for 58 passes its second reading. The chair orders the
amendment engrossed into the bill and much to the pleasure of the chair
and most members, the bill will be on tomorrow&#39;s calendar for a
third reading. Representatives Catlin and McElraft are recognized to set
forth a committee report. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Catlin and McElraft, environment committee report, House
bill 157, amend environmental laws. Favorable committee substitute.
Unfavorable original bill, and rereferred to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee substitute is referred to the committee on finance. Original
bill, unfavorable, calendar. Notices and announcements? For what purpose
does the gentleman from Transylvania, Representative Whitmire rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just want to advise everybody on the homeland security, military,
veteran&#39;s affairs committee that is scheduled for noon on Thursday.
As circumstances dictate and we will see, I guess we never cease to be
amazed at the surprises. If Thursday is a non vote session, we will meet
at 10 and standby for further changes. The reason for the insistence on
finally having the committee meet is we&#39;ve had every meeting
canceled thus far, and we have a very pertinent topic that we&#39;ll be
briefed on, and I hope those, I hope to get it in, and that&#39;s why
we&#39;ll plan on having it 10 Thursday unless other circumstances
dictate. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Orange, Representative Insko rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Democrats who have been planning to meet with Dr. Cummings to
review some issues in Medicaid, if you&#39;ll watch your emails,
we&#39;re trying to change that meeting from 12:30 to 12 because there
have been two committees scheduled for 12:30, and the reason I&#39;m
doing this is because every meeting I&#39;ve tried to have scheduled so
far has been canceled. So please watch your emails for the final
announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further notice, notices and announcements? If not, the gentleman from
Harnett, Representative Lewis is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, I move that the House adjourn to reconvene Wednesday,
March 11 at 10 o&#39;clock AM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that motion subject to receipt of messages from the Senate,
rereferral of bills and resolutions, and appointment of conferees?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, it most certainly is. I, I misstated it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I knew we were on the same wavelength there. Representative Lewis moves,
seconded by Representative Stam, the House adjourn subject to messages
from the Senate, rereferral of bills and resolutions, and appointment of
conferees, to reconvene Wednesday, March 11 at 10 o&#39;clock AM. Those
in favor, please signify by saying aye. Those opposed no. The ayes have
it. We stand adjourned.
