your character, that you chase after us, even when we're like Jonah and
run to Nineva. Lord, we thank you that you meet us where we are. Lord,
we thank you for the service of Zeb Alley? today and how he served this
place, and we ask you to comfort his family in his loss and comfort
those in western North Carolina, especially Waynesville, where he served

the only one who can comfort us in loss. And it's in your name, Jesus,
that we pray. Amen.

period. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator ?? for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President announcement, please sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator ?? has the floor for announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me try to give you some indication of where we are and where we're
going. The folks will be working over the weekend to deal with the
budget issues and we're working diligently on tax reform, hopefully, and
I will underline hopefully, we can get these things worked out by the
first of next week. Hopefully stay here next week and get wrapped up, so
we can go home fairly soon after that, maybe next weekend. That's what
we would love to do, or what we are going to try to do, so maybe we can
all get together and get there. Mr. President if we could, OK we're
good, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
?? for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a personal
privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator ?? has the floor for a point of
personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, members
of the Senate. We have three very special individuals who are with us
here today who are some of the finest of State workers who work for the
department of transportation in Marion. Particularly, just shortly back,
they were laying asphalt on a street in Marion called Lucky Street. And
for some people that day it was quite a lucky day because they happened
to notice smoke coming out from a house nearby. And individuals who
indicated from the front porch that there were people trapped in the
house. They were able to break out a window to get the father and son
out of the house and help individuals after calling 911 and instructing
them to cut off  the propane from the house so that everyone could get
out safely. And so, I know the President is going to do a recognition
formally but Ricky, Chris, and Jason who are with us here today, just on
behalf on the State, thank you for your service, thank you for being
alert, and thank you for exemplifying the best of those who represent
the State of North Carolina. And I will send forth the senatorial
statement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator. And those individuals in
the gallery are Ricky Bradely, Chris Paner, and Jason Way and they are
DOT employees from ?? county. Thank you again for your heroism and thank
you for being here with us today. Is there any other announcements or
any further business to come forth the Senate? If not, the chair
recognizes Senator Pate for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
President. I move that the Senate is now adjourned in memory Zeb Alley.
