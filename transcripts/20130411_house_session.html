Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion pertaining to the calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, House Bill 370 which is on page 10. It's
titled Shortened Review, period, State Property Sales. If that Bill be
removed from Today's calendar referred to the committee on rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection so ordered. Ladies and gentleman of
the House, that again is on page 10, House Bill 370, it's been
re-referred to the committee on rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 488, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We just ?? for House Bill 488, a bill entitled An Act
to Remove the Provision of Regional Water and Sewer Services by
Transferring Ownership and Operation of Certain Public Water and Sewer
Systems that Do Not Function is ?? Regional Water or Sewer System to
Metropolitan Water and Sewage District. General ?? in North Carolina
Acts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I thank Mister Speaker. Members of the House, the
legislation before you provides for a framework for orderly
consolidation of multiple public enterprises providing either water or
sewer services. The process of that consolidation creates an additional
subdivision of the state. That subdivision will be called Metropolitan
Water and Sewage District under Article 5 of the general statutes. In
regards to the systems that are eligible, on page 1, a minimum threshold
of 120,000 water customers in a county that is also served by
Metropolitan Sewage District and if you meet that qualification then a
public sewer system interconnected to Metropolitan Sewage District. If
you're wondering whether or not this would apply to you, if you do not
meet with me in my office today, then it does not apply to you. At the
bottom of page 1, the appointments to the board are going to be the same
that are currently populating the board of the MSD until all the
appointing authorities can determine who their appointments are going to
be from an oversight capacity. On page 2 section 2, the definitions are
set forth in regards to what the Metropolitan Water and Sewage District
is going to look like from a statutory standpoint. Page 3 outlines the
board and its authority. Page 4 discusses the general powers of the new
subdivision. Its authority to issue bonds. Its authority to determine
tax rate by the district board for the levy and collection and
remittance of those taxes. It also discusses its authority to establish
rates and the charges for those services. Continuing on page 5, it
discusses the rights-of-ways and easements authority that this new
subdivision will have. Additionally on page 5, we have an explanation of
the authority of governing bodies of the political subdivisions. Page 6
discusses expansion of the system and the requirement that the new
entity work with planning groups and cooperate with planning agencies on
lines 34 and 35. On page 6, section C it states that the approval of any
such plan of the districts shall be required from the governing body of
the county or municipality prior to the start of construction and
essentially that allows the elected officials to participate in land use
planning in regards to the extension of water service or sewer services
based on the desires of the Metropolitan Water and Sewage District.
Additionally on page 6, the adoption and enforcement of ordinances is
outlined. And lastly on page 7, since we're dealing with assets of the
public, privatization is strictly prohibited. And that is in on page 7,
line 12. Members, one are of our state will initially take advantage of
this new subdivision...</p>

require legislative act to participate for those of you who are not
familiar the metropolitan sewege district this is a set of statutes that
were created in all of places bunkam county in the sixties that helped
provide for the orderly consolidation of multiple sanitary districts and
metropolitan sewage district statuary frame work has been used in a
couple of other places throughout the state it's my hope that once we
adopt the metropolitan water and sewage district statutes that it would
be available for other places throughout the statutes to use if they so
desire to do so thank you Mr speaker.
representative Mcgrady please state your purpose.
to debate the bill but I believe Mr speaker representative Ramsy would
like to speak in front of me and I would refer to him.
representative Ramsy please state your purpose.
speak on the bill and I think there will be a amendment presented by..
gentleman's recognized to debate the bill.
representative Stam but I want to debate the bill often time when we're
in the general assembly things get cast in a partison view and it's one
party versus another party any of you who served in local government
realize that when the river makes the road issues are always partisome
and they cross idealogical boundaries and the issue we're talking about
today is not a partisome issue back home it may turn out to be a prtison
issue down here that remains to be seen but back home I had the
oppurtunity to serve 8 years as chairman of the buckingh county board of
commissioners from 2000 to 2008 and I served with four other wonderful
people who happen to be members of the other party and from 2005 to 2008
that board of commissioners unanomously agreed that the effect of what
this bill will allow us to do at our community is to consolidate our
water system sewer system and work over some regional problems that we
faced over many years and I will not give you the full history of the
water system and [??] bucking county there's a handout placed on your
desk and you have the oppurtunity to read that and if you have any
questions I will try to answer those but this is an effort to bring our
community together I know the city has some concerns about this bill and
are opposed to this bill at the end of the day this bill will have the
effect and [??] for [??] county and [??] county are solving a lot of
long term issues wanted to quote from August second of April 16-2003
from the citizen times and at that time is article states member of the
water authority that [??] wrote to the chairman of water authority and
for 25 years asked if bucking county had a water authority and in 2005
the city chose to terminate that water authority</p>

<p id="020:00">
...the members I served with on the Board of Commissioners--many of
them--several of them--were City of Asheville residents--felt like this
was the best solution for our community.  So, I want to make it clear
this is not a partisan matter.  The recent history of this matter--in
2005, the City of Asheville and the city council terminated the water
agreement they had with Buncombe County, and they had the legal right to
do that.  What happened was, this General Assembly enacted some
legislation that affected our water system.  The City of Asheville sued
the State of North Carolina, the city and the county spent about a half
a million dollars in legal fees in that litigation.  And, the appellate
courts in this state ruled unanimously that the General Assembly had
that authority.  So, that was at a time when the General Assembly was
controlled by the other party.  So, as I stated earlier, this is not a
partisan matter.  The city has expressed concerns about the financial
impacts to the city budget by this legislation.  And, there are ongoing
discussions with the county, and others in our community, to address
those impacts.  That's what our 1981 water agreement that was between
the city and county did.  And, you know, I'm confident our community can
come together to address that to treat those who live within the City of
Asheville, and those who live outside the City of Asheville in a fair
manner.  I would also note that for the past approximately 20 years, we
have had a regional sewer utility in our community that all the small
towns, the City of Asheville, Buncombe County, have participated in,
have had--it's been transparent--been financially accountable, and
there's no one in our community that serves on these elected boards will
publicly [sic] state that the regional sewer authority that we have has
been in the best interest of our community.  About 20 years ago, we had
sewage overflows into our rivers, we had moratoriums on development
because we had a very dilapidated structure, and over the last 20 years,
our regional sewer authority has spent hundreds of millions of dollars
to repair that.  So, if this legislation is passed, this will allow for
the orderly creation of a utility that where [sic] we can all work
together.  We can solve this long history of contention, and I commend
the bill to this body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Effective lawyers, when faced with bad facts or bad law, re-frame the
debate.  And, that is really what has happened here, particularly from
some of the opponents within the City of Asheville.  To read your email
or your--the resolutions passed by various municipalities around the
state, you'd believe, probably, that the legislation is only about the
City of Asheville.  That, this legislation, when passed, every
municipality in the state needs to fear that public utilities run by
those local governments will be seized.  And, finally, that the equities
are with Asheville and that it has acted in good faith and is being
treated unfairly.  That's poppycock.  And I rise to dispel those
mis-impressions.  First, this legislation isn't about Asheville; it's
about the creation of a regional water and sewer authority.  Just as the
legislature created a municipal sewer authority for the greater
Asheville region to address failing sewer systems that had turned the
French Broad River into an open sewer; the legislature is creating a new
entity known as a regional water and sewer authority to address some
issues faced in the greater Asheville area that could be faced in other
parts of the state.  To read the papers, you might think that only
Asheville and Buncombe County were interested in this legislation.  But,
there is another party:  Henderson County, that I represent.  Henderson
County's sewer assets are being combined into the regional authority,
too. Rather than going off and building its own sewer plant, so that it
can be in control, Henderson County's sewer assets are combined with the
sewer assets in Buncombe County along with the water system managed by
the City of Asheville.  The idea of having a combined regional water and
sewer authority has been a dream for decades.  In the mid-1990s,
Henderson County gave up its water rights to the City of Asheville in
exchange for 1) an agreement that Asheville would provide water to
Henderson County upon demand and at the same prices as it provi--[end of

<p id="025:00">
…water to its residents. Two, for representation on the board of the
then existing water authority. And three, an expectation that it would
be able to join a regional sewer authority. In fact, Asheville
transferred property it owned in Buncombe County to Henderson County for
a new sewer plant. Well, unlike the authority formed with this
legislation, the Water Authority back then was one created by contract
and contracts can be broken or terminated. This contract was both broken
and terminated. Henderson County had to threaten to sue to get water
resources provided in the northern part of the county. It had to
actually sue to get Asheville to transfer the property and honor its
commitment to transfer the property that was expected to be the site of
the new sewer. And then Asheville terminated the agreement after 10
years, leaving Henderson County with no voice in water and sewer issues
in the region, but having lost its water rights. In fact, under the
States Watershed Protection Rules development is restricted in Henderson
County to provide water primarily for Asheville in Buncombe County. So
this isn’t just about Asheville. Second, you need to understand that
other municipalities need not be concerned about some sort of precedent
being created. This isn’t about some precursor to forced mergers across
the state. There are really unique facts here and I like –
Representative Ramsey have been working on water and sewer in the area
for over 20 years. The water system has generated two Court of Appeals
decisions. And you ought to read the last one and it sets out the facts
in great detail. The water system managed by the City of Asheville is
not as sufficient and it leaks over 30% of its water. Now, there are
some reasons for that being in the mountains and all, but still it’s the
largest system in the state leaking anything like that amount of water.
And finally, I tell you that Asheville has a history of using water as a
weapon against its neighbors and that has precipitated several
interventions by the legislature. Most recently about eight or nine
years ago, the water system isn’t Asheville's water system. It came out
by consolidation of a lot of other systems. Finally, I don’t believe – I
hope you don’t believe, all you hear about the good things Asheville has
done with the water system and with its neighbors. The equities are not
with Asheville. In fact, the city has been a bad neighbor. Let’s look at
the facts. Asheville has said that it is being treated unfairly that its
assets are being seized without compensation. But just go back to recent
history, two years ago, Representative Moffitt filed legislation to
create a regional water and sewer authority, but the legislature chose
to study the issue and a year later after hearings, a Legislative
Committee recommended the creation of a regional water and sewer
authority. Bowing to the request of the City of Asheville that committee
didn’t recommend any specific legislation, rather it told the local
governments to work things out. What did Asheville do? City leaders
sought to reframe the issue by raising specter of privatization of the
water system. It put a referendum of ballot focused on privatization and
try to make a political issue of it, when the referendum passed even
though it didn’t have any relevance to the issue at hand. It pursued a
political strategy that failed when Representative Moffitt won
reelection by a greater majority than before and another advocate of
regional water and sewer Nathan Ramsey was also elected. Even then MSG
which had been studying merging the systems, offered tens of millions of
dollars to acquire Asheville's interest in the water system. Did
Asheville respond or make a counter offer? No. Asheville's response was
to try to make the…</p>

I think Representative Luebke’s question clarified part of it. I just

to Ashville?  Is that correct?

Well it applies, it does apply to Ashville, Bumpkin,  Henderson, but
then it would also be available all over the State to places where it
applies but only if the governing bodies want it to apply. Notice they
would not, it would not apply by operation of law. So example, since
you’re from Wake County, we had at the table Representatives from [??],
environment natural resources. We happen to have the Mayor of Apex, who
had the same concern you did. Make sure it didn’t apply to Apex and Cary
and Raleigh. And I’m convinced that it does not apply to anywhere in

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I am concerned that this amendment is coming
forward at this time and I think that it’s fairly obvious the reason
why. It is because of the concerns raised in finance committee that this
Bill would have a detrimental effect on towns and cities across the
State of North Carolina. And so my question and I think that it’s
something that we all need to think about as we vote on this amendment,
is whether or not this amendment now turns the Bill back into a local
Bill rather than a statewide Bill? And in that case are we, are we, are
we miss applying the rules of the House in doing so. So I, I plan,
actually plan to vote no on this amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment. If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by
Representative Stam for the House Committee Substitute of House Bill
Four Eighty Eight. All those in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. All members wishing to record please do so at
this time. The clerk [??] machine will record the vote. One hundred and
three voting in the affirmative, five in the negative. The amendment
passes. We are now back on the Bill. Representative Fisher, please state
your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the Bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is the Bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all, Mr. Speaker, with your permission, having thought that
this Bill would come before the body yesterday, I had placed items on
the desk of all the members. And in case there are members who no longer
have those items, I have some additional copies and with your
permission, if the members would raise their hands, I would be happy to,
or if you can have those pages pass them out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection. Lady may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, let me just
take a second or two to respond to some of the things you’ve heard so
far this afternoon. One thing that I did want to, I did wonder about is,
I did not have a meeting in Representative Moffitt’s office so I’m
wondering now if the Bill applies to me, or Ashville? I’m, I’m hoping
that because I was not asked to come have a meeting in Mr.,
Representative Moffitt’s office, that the Bill no longer applies to
Ashville but we’ll, we’ll, we’ll wait and see how that goes. The next
thing I would like to mention is that, in regard to representative
McGrady’s comments about Henderson County, Hendersonville has three.</p>

<p id="045:00">
My point in calling your attention to any of these questions on the
sheet that I passed out to you is that the Sullivan Acts, first of all,
allowed the city of Asheville to take 5% - up to 5%, to do the necessary
repairs and improvements related to water service, but last week we took
that ability away, and so my point in calling your attention to that is
to say that this is a piece of legislation coming from people who live
outside the city of Asheville and primarily based on distortion of
facts. So the real impact of this bill is that with the way the board
will be made up, the authority in this bill, the way the new board
authority will be made up, it gives the power to raise taxes and to
raise water rates to an appointed board, not an elected board, that is
not accountable to the voters. The new board will have the authority to
borrow money. Those debts would presumably be the responsibility of all
the citizens who are on the water, who use the water, and the bill is
inconsistent and confusing about whether the system will end up being
privatized. We don’t know. That may be the real goal in all of this. We
now have a stable system in Asheville that guarantees that citizens
outside the city pay the same for water as those living in the city.
We’ll be throwing all of that away and giving all the power to a
nonelected, non-accountable board that will not properly represent the
citizens. The city of Asheville already does things that are in
cooperation with the metropolitan sewerage district. They work with
shared billing and other functions, and you may be throwing all of that
away. The city has made improvements over the past ten years and a lot
of money has been spent to make those improvements. The proof of that is
that two prominent west coast breweries, New Belgium and Sierra Nevada,
both selected Asheville as their east coast sites, and as everyone
knows, one of the most critical factors in selecting a brewery site is
the availability of clean water. These two business decisions to locate
in Asheville resulted in hundreds of jobs and hundreds of millions of
dollars in investment in the local and regional economy. We do not need
to tear down this economic engine that is obviously working. This is not
about Asheville, finally. This is not about Asheville. This is about the
entire state. It may be Asheville’s water system today, but tomorrow it
could be Greensboro’s or Winston-Salem’s… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] …or Jacksonville’s. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative,
the lady will yield. Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanted to see if the lady would yield for a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] When I’m through, Mr. Speaker. That is why over 60
cities have adopted resolutions opposing this bill. These cities include
Concord, Conover, Kannapolis, Havelock, Jacksonville, Goldsboro,
Lexington, Newton, Smithfield, Statesville, Greensboro and
Winston-Salem. It is why there are concerns that bills like this may
impair the ability of towns to borrow money in the future for
infrastructure and other needs because there will be no guarantee that
the city or the county will be able to keep an asset long enough to
satisfy the debt. I’m not a lawyer, but this bill was hastily written.
Poorly written, hastily drawn. It is extremely difficult, as was
evidenced in Finance yesterday, for even the best lawyers, and we have
some of the best lawyers in this chamber, to understand what it means in
its full impact. I submit to you that this bill is really about all of
our people. It’s not just about the city of Asheville. I know that there
is a threat to all the</p>

the city of Asheville. More than two and a half times than in the
previous six years when the systems were governed under a regional
agreement.  This is a bad bill.  That in the long run will cost city tax
payers while not providing any significant cost savings to water rate
payers. I will be voting no if it isn't become obvious to you already.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to thank my colleagues and everything for a good robust debate
the other day. I'd like to make sure we're clear on what this bill does.
 We're not talking about parking tickets that are unpaid.  We're
preventing fugitive felons from getting financial aid. We're not talking
about people who have served their time.  We're talking about parole and
probation violators that are absconders from justice.  The simple truth
is that federal law does not allow financial aid to go to a fugitive
felons and parole and probation violators.  We have to make a commitment
to hard working families who are willing to spend their tax dollars to
help people in need, that that aid must first go to law abiding
citizens.  Our system of aid and people in need must be effective,
efficient and accountable.  This is a common sense bill to make sure our
aid goes to law abiding citizens first, and all state agencies work
together to keep us safe.  We had a strong vote 96 to 22 on our second
reading.  I've worked to solve your concerns.  And now I ask you to work
with me and vote for law abiding hard working families and people in
need struggling to make it.  Not fleeing criminals seeking to take away
money from the people who truly need it.  Thanks and I ask for your
support.

Members, we had a very vigorous debate on this bill two days ago and I

like to offer that both Senator Goulsby and myself have reviewed and
have no objection to.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]

Representative Stam moves to amend the bill on page one, lines 5-9 by
deleting those lines and substituting the following language.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Speaker, members of the House, there was a former leader of this
body who told me it was unethical to amend a bill you were going to vote
against and I disagree with that. I think since the bill passed second
reading I had some obligation to try and tweak it a little bit and so I
presented this amendment to Representative Daughtry and Senator Goulsby.
 What it does, and Mr. Speaker, I have identified one problem with
dashboard, and that is you have to lift your computer to read your
amendment. There are two parallel sentences that are changed.  The way
the existing bill reads an employer couldn't ask anything because the
employer doesn't know whether something has been expunged but under this
amendment an employer who requests the information has to first advise
the applicant that the state law allows the applicant to not refer to
any arrest, charge or conviction that has been expunged.   I think that
was the intent of the bill to start with and this just makes it say
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Further discussion or further debate on the amendment?  If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by

The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Since it is only one sentence and you may not have pulled it up, it will
say each state department or agency receiving lottery funds shall use
its established communications channel to inform the public about
amounts received and activities supported by lottery proceeds.  This is
a way to do it without costing a lot of money.  I think it would cost
the Lottery Commission a lot of money the way it was in the underlying
bill so I offer this amendment.

the bill. Representative Stan, Please state your purpose.[SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. To debate the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Yesterday I passed out a four page hand out, and since you
all read it out last night, I don't have to read it all to you today I
do recall about 2006 to whenever it was seating in seat 117 I was saying
objection, objection. A very loud objection, objection as Speaker Black
was without objection the bill would be read a third time and no debate
anyway, that's how the lottery passed here. I have a paper you can read
8 little rules that the house broke to pass the lottery, but
nevertheless we have it. this bill does not repeal the lottery, it just
makes it a little bit more honest. here is what it does, advertising
that states a total of payment is to be payed over a period of time must
also state the present value of the prize. If you've ever gone down the
highway and seen that billboard that says 606 million dollars power-ball
estimated annuity. Well the value of that prize  is about 400 million. I
think betters who are gonna put their dollar down should have a
proximate idea of what the value of that prize is.  Lottery's because
they are operated by the state are not subject to the Federal Trade
Commission. If our lottery  for advertising, If our lottery was  subject
to the Federal Trade Commission rules on advertising, it would be shut
down, ended and probably the people indicted for doing it, because it's
systematic misrepresentation to the people. Secondly, and I've given you
an example of some of the ads here. You can 200,000 dollars, a little
later in the ad one chance in eight you'll win. I can put a dollar down
and I have one chance in eight at winning 200,000 thousand dollars. That
sounds like a good bet to me, but they don;t tell you in that ad that
your chance of winning that prize is maybe another ticket or five
dollars or something like that. They are mixing the ad, the
probabilities with the wrong prize. All in an effect to deceive the
betters. So what the main purpose of this bill is to make sure people
have accurate information before they place there bets. It also says
that we are not gonna advertise at high school or college events. now
there's been some question raised about that. That does save the state
about half a million dollars a year and all the net proceeds go to
education. So that actually will be pro-education, but you may have
heard from some colleges you are taking money from our sports athletic
scholarships. Well i have researched that and found out that if the
money goes that way, that approximately and I have a memo here from
fiscal research to that effect about 40-70% of those sponsorship funds
are received by the athletics department after marketing firm fees are
deducted in other words they don't get 100% on the dollar they get about
half on the dollar whereas the bill as is education will get a 100% on
the dollar. We don't want advertisements to be referred to the role of
accountants and auditors, we do want accountants and auditors involved
to keep it on the up and up and I'm sure that the lottery commission
accounts for every dollar to the penny. That's not the problem. We want
them involved, we wanna make sure that the process of picking the prize
done accurately, but we don't want to give potential betters the idea
that just because an accountant is there that the whole operation is
actually on the up and up, because the operation as a whole is scam, and
we know that. We don't wanna encourage  people to do it, but by giving
them false advertising. So a couple other things I would like to say, I
have several..in this handout. I have several academic statements from
people very well.. very knowledgeable on mathematics and probabilities
who..</p>

Speaker: Let me explain for the 57 of you who were sponsors of this
Bill, we prepared a booklet about 50 pages of these things that you
could take home and read and it's true, this, we want to get the
advertisements accurate. There's also a provision that ask the
University of North Carolina to prepare a curriculum available to public
schools that want to use it; it's not a mandate to put on their website
explaining probabilities and odds. They might want to do that in a math
class, or in a consumer education class, just so people know what they
are getting into. Before the Lottery we had a Lottery, it was called the
Numbers Racket, run by the mafia, or whatever our local equivalent of
that is. But the differences are this, the mafia they'll give you
credit, they only take about 10% off the top, and they don't turn you
into the IRS. You actually have better odds with the mafia then with the
North Carolina Lottery. Well people need to know what their odds are,
and I encourage you to vote for this Bill, you can feel good that you
straightened up a dishonest institution, and at least made it honest.
Thank you.
Speaker Changes: The Chair often times anticipates a lesson in the Magna
Carta, but never on the mafia from Representative Stam. Representative
Glazier, please state your purpose.
Speaker Changes: To debate the Bill Mr. Speaker.
Speaker Changes: The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
Speaker Changes: Thank you very much Mr. Speaker, and I think that
Representative Stam's comments highlight what I was going to start off
saying, and that is people sign Bills for different reasons, and in my
language, and in my profession I'm signing on as a concurring judge. I
agree in the result, but not quite in the rationale, I think. I think
that Representative Stam has accurately though portrayed the fact that,
and here's I guess where I disagree a little bit, I think that the
Commission has done an incredibly good job, in fact, a better job than
any of us would have ever expected at doing what we asked them to do.
The problems Representative Stam highlights, and where I do agree with
him are that they're doing the things the way the Statute asks them to
do it, and I agree with him that's not the right way. That in fact we
need to be in making the corrections this Bill does, to create
advertising that gives the full picture, and that provides the public
with a full understanding. And for that reason I'm very much supportive
of the Bill, and what Representative Stam has, but I want to direct my
comments a minute, and I know we're on Thursday, and I'll be brief. But
I think it's an important issue, and I think for me very important,
because I was one of those people that voted to create this Lottery and,
and had been a big believer in it. And I am still a believer in the
people who are doing it, what I have real concerns about is my vote to
have ever created it in the first place. And so while this is not a
Repeal Bill, and that is not before us, when this Lottery was created
the argument that came against it that I rejected, and a number of my
colleagues was that this would not be us planning of funds. It really
was meant to supplement educational funds, and that it would not hurt
bond issues that come, it would not hurt the political will of the
General Assembly to fund education, outside of the Lottery. I have
turned out to be wrong I think on all of those counts.
I think whether under Democratic Administration or Republican
Administration we have fallen prey to some degree to using the Lottery
to now supplant, and to use the Lottery, in a way that helps fund the
education system while we abrogate our responsibility to really do it
the right way. And because I also believe it has hurt back home, and I
think half the population still doesn't believe that all of education is
resource problems can be solved by the Lottery, we've created
difficulties for County Commissioners, and created difficulties for
ourself when we actually want to give the public the facts about
resource needs for education. And so I am, I go back, and I wonder if it
may have been the worse vote I passed as a member of the General
Assembly. But it is here, and I only hope that this Bill provides an
extended time over the next few years of discussion of better ways to
improve it if we're keeping the Lottery, better ways to get the
information out to the public of what it does, and doesn't do, what it
can and can't do. And for us to really look at...</p>

The fact that again we have maybe aggregated some of our function here
about how we fund the public schools by relying on lottery funds to do
that and rely on a form of gambling, and to rely on our population
wanting to increase their ability to gamble as a way to fund the schools
strikes me as simply spiritually and immorally a bad position, and so
because of that I have signed on to Representative Stam's bill and
fundamentally agree, even though he and I might have to talk a little
bit about the cosa nostra and the mafia. Thank you Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Bell please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman's recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker and Members of the House. I
very seldom get up to speak, but just like representative Glazier said,
one of the most difficult votes I've taken in this chamber was to vote
for the lottery. i voted for it, and I did not vote out of ignorance
thinking it was not gambling. i knew what it was and that's why i was
reluctant to vote for it. But I thought at that time, and it has,
brought in a lot of revenue for education, which I supported
wholeheartedly. But then you some of you have heard me say before that
my dad always had that little quotation that says 'Once a task you have
begun never leave it 'til it's done; Be the labor great or small, do it
well or not all.' And so that's the way I am about the lottery since we
have it. If you're gonna have it, you need to advertise it because
that's part of it. And if you're going to do away with it then that's
another vote for another day. And that's what we should be thinking
about, either doing away with it or if you're going to have it then we
need to do it all the way and get all the revenue that we can from it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative John Bell please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. I think this is the first time in
the chamber that the Bell brothers have spoke back-to-back so thank you
for that. If I would have been in the chamber when the lottery was
passed my vote would've been against the lottery. One of my biggest pet
peeves of the lottery is I hate going into the gas station and having to
stand in line when somebody's scratching off tickets and picking numbers
and it takes 15 minutes. But at the end of the day we have the lottery,
and we have a good lottery, matter of fact  it's one of the best in the
entire country. And my fear is that if we continue to do bills like this
we're going to limit the ability of the lottery. I don't know where we
can find the funds to replace what the lottery's putting in to our
system today. so if we vote for bills like this and bills that i know
are coming in the future, we're going to limit the success of it, and i
don't want to see a successful lottery get jabbed to the point where it
becomes ineffective, because it if becomes ineffective then we might as
well do like Representative Bell said and which is file a bill to get
rid of the lottery altogether. So I would encourage you to vote against
this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister speaker and I'll try to be brief. I
just wanted to take this opportunity, really the purpose that I'm rising
is just to show my respect and appreciation for my friend from
Cumberland, Representative Glazier, just for his comments and what he
just said. You know, it takes a big person to stand up and say sometimes
'You know, i made a mistake. I did something that i wish i'd done
differently' I know I've made plenty of mistakes in my life. I was a
county commissioner when the lottery passed and I made many of the
arguments that he mentioned that he now states that he believes are
true. and i don't stand at all to say &quot;I told you so,&quot; that's
not it at all. But I mainly just wanted to say how much I respect my
friend and his comments and i do ask for your vote for this bill, I
think this is a good bill, I think we need to be honest if we're going
to do the lottery and we are, we've voted to do it, I think what
Representative Stam said is exactly right, we should be straightforward,
we should be honest with our citizens and this bill seeks to do that and
for that reason I commend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pittman please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. I'm gonna support this bill, even
though I'm a little disappointed that it's not going to repeal the
lottery. I think it's a step in the right direction; I'd like to see us
cut out all t.v. and radio advertising. You can't go anywhere in this
state to get gas and not notice the lottery, everybody knows about it
already and i think it's just a lot of money being wasted on it and all
this</p>

That may be good for education. I certainly would not have voted to
support the lottery and, because I understand gambling to be in my
estimation at least, you may not agree with me, I understand it to be a
sinful thing because it’s a rejection of godly principles, of
stewardship, and it’s a mutual attempt to steal from each other. And so
I would object to that anytime. But at least by trying to get a little
more honesty in advertising, I think Representative Stam is hitting in
the right direction so I urge you to support this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. Representative
Collins, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak very
briefly on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
support the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I support this bill as well and kind
of for a different reason than people have said although I agree with
most of what’s been said today by Representatives Stam, Glazier and
others. To me, this is kind of a transparency bill. I tend to be in
favor of transparency no matter what we’re talking about. I get in
trouble with a lot of people a lot of times when I put in bills they
don’t like. But I’m for transparency across the board and this is just,
just like I have to in my profession, tell people what their risks are
when they’re getting ready to put their money on something, I think we
need to let people know what their risks are when they put their money
in the lottery. So I’m supporting this bill and appreciate it being
introduced. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate. Representative Stone, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER

CHANGES] Representative Collins, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I would. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Would I have a 1 in 8 chances of winning with you? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Can I answer that question? Most of the things I do have a much
greater chance of winning than 1 in 8. If it’s only 1 in 8, I think I
would have been probably fired a long time ago. Thank you. [SPEAKER

clerk not reading the full title of the bill. I was going to say you
can’t tell a book by its cover but you can tell a bill by its title.
That may not apply but this is an agency bill that was brought to us
from the North Carolina Department of Insurance. The bill is lengthy and
tactical in nature, but it has 22 different sections to it and each one
was vetted very well in the Insurance Committee. I’ll be glad to go over
each one of them if anyone has any questions but Mr. Speaker I recommend
the bill to the body and I believe Representative Ramsey has an
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ramsey, please state your

technical amendment. I shared this with Chairman Dockham and the
Department of Insurance. This would just provide in the case of a
property insurance dispute, under current law a party can go to the
Superior Court Judge that’s the resident judge in that particular county
and that judge would report an umpire to try an avoid litigation and for
the parties to settle the matter. This just allows that both parties
would have the notice and opportunity to be heard and if a party wanted
to have a hearing just on the specific matter of selection of an umpire,
they could choose that so there wouldn’t be, it wouldn’t be based on a
unilateral basis. So that’s the amendment and I would ask for your
support on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dockham,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, and members of the House.  This
is truly a bi-partisan jobs bill, and it's a bill that will promote a
healthier economy for North Carolina.  It lead to a, I could tell you
the reasons why we need this bill, but in a nutshell, it's very simple.
When industry in coming into North Carolina, and they want to perhaps
locate here, they have 90 day, sometimes up to 120 day window, that they
want to be under roof with their facility.  So as they start looking at
property across the state of North Carolina, they particularly look at
property that has already been zoned properly, hopefully has a lot of
the infrastructure in place.  And in talking to our economic developers
across the state, this is Number 2, on one of the reasons North Carolina
is quickly eliminated from being one of the states that's selected for a
sight selection.  So, this is a fairly simple bill, simply addresses the
property tax.  I have worked with the county governments, and also the
city governments, and everybody's on board with this bill.  I don't know
of anybody that objects, but it allows the property tax for the
qualifying properties to be deferred on the amount of the property value
in excess of its present use value.  The property would continue to be
valued as agricultural land in the present use value system.  And the
difference between the true value, and the present use value, would
represent a lien on the property and this lien would be deferred until
the building permit is issued and the property is rezoned, or have
another reason why it would be disqualified from being in the program.
Basically, what this will do is allow all 100 counties in this state to
have the opportunity to do shovel-ready projects, and be competitive
with our neighboring states when there is job site selection being done
by major corporations.  I would ask for your support, and I'll stand to
answer any questions.

[Speaker Changes] Talk about this. This came to us through the city of
Greensboro and was brought by some ladies who were very concerned by the
mammography reporting being done for ladies when they go tot have their
annual examinations. I'm certainly not an expert in this field, but
being the spouse of a survivor, I jumped on the opportunity to be a part
of this. The Ladies that brought it, one of them is actually  a medical
doctor herself, and they both are survivors, it is backed up by our
entire delegation and by the city of Greensboro. So I would ask that you
would consider this bill, there is no opposition that I know of. Dr.
Fulgin will be glad to explain a little more technicalities about it.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, as Representative Faircloth
said, this bill is supported by an entire delegation, it did come to us
through the city of Greensboro. And really when you think about it,
knowledge is power, power is what makes the difference in lives and
communities. And what we wanna do, what this bill will do, is to provide
the information and the knowledge to women who have the mammogram, they
will get additional information that they can use to have additional
tests if they feel that is necessary. But It will let them know about
the breast density level, and that is information that currently is not
provided, and when they don't get that often times there are additional
issues related to their breasts, and if they don't have this information
then other things kind of come come up, so we want to make this
information available to women so that they can make informed decisions
and hopefully we can live very long and productive lives. We will ask
your support for the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Representative ??, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, I've found in the treatment of
patients that respect for someone's intelligence can get you a long ways
in regard to their corporation. And also the respect of the fact that
people have choices to make. Density involved in mammography clouds the
issue when you're on the last two grades of the density problem. When
you're at one and two grades and are fairly straightforward where you
can the tissue that you need to see to make the diagnoses with about
85-90% accuracy. Higher two density levels make it difficult, you have
about a 50% accuracy rating, therefore cause in most cases for other

House Committee substitute for Senate Bill 117 a bill be prior to that
codify the common law that is murder where a child who is born alive
dies as a result of injuries inflicted prior to the child’s birth and to
provide that the act shall be entitled, “Lily’s Law,” General Assembly
of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members this bill comes to us from the Senate, this is Senate Bill 117.
It’s titled, Lily’s Law. It’s named after Lily Grace Broom who was an
infant in Alamance County which is the district that I represent.
Basically what this bill does is it will codify the common law that
holds it to be murder of a child is born alive and then dies due to the
in utero injuries inflicted prior to the child being born alive. The
bill specifies that it constitutes murder where child is born alive but
dies as a result of injuries inflicted prior to the child being born
alive. The degree of murder, first and second degree will be determined
in accordance to applicable law. Now a little bit of history on Lily
Grace Brown. Went back to 2001, this comes from a case out of Alamance
County. Robert Broom, Dana Broom were married in 2001. In 2003, they had
their first child. In May of 2008, Dana Broom informed her husband that
she was pregnant with a second child. He became very agitated, as it
turned out, he was having an extra-marital affair. He was actually
considering leaving her at the time. So for some time they continued to
try to work this out. The mother obviously did not wanna go the route
that the husband was suggesting. And so this went on until the mother
was at 28 weeks pregnant, almost full term. At 3:30 p.m. in the
afternoon, Mr. Broom came in, told his wife that he wanted to talk. She
thought that things were going well. That they were actually going to
work something out. He told her that he was going to leave, he needed to
leave the room for a minute. Left the room, came back in and started to
approach her. She thought he was actually coming to give her a hug. He
shot her in the abdomen with a .45 caliber handgun. After that. he let
her lay there for 12 hours with no help and she continued to plead with
him to call 911. Finally after 12 hours, and her telling him that she
would say that it was an accident, he finally did call 911. As a result
of the injuries, Lily Grace Broom was born by cesarean early, developed
complications from the injury, lived for a number of days. The doctors
actually thought at first she was going to be okay. But after about four
days, the complications got worst and they had to put her on life
support. Ultimately the decision was made that there was nothing that
really could be done. The injuries were too extensive and then she was
taken off of life support and died shortly thereafter. So as I said this
is a bill that just simply codifies the common law. Mr. Broom was
convicted of first degree murder under common law. And the case went on
from there. So this is a sad tragedy and this something I think that
this bill will address.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not. The question before the
House is the passage of the House Committee substitute to Senate Bill
117 on its second reading. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no.
The clerk will open the vote.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It's a distinct privilege to ask the members of this House to join with
me in adopting this resolution to acknowledge a true almost undisputed,
I would think, asset of our education system in the state of North
Carolina. One of the pleasures I had was serving for eight years on the
board of trustees at the community college at home. I previously served
as a member of the school board school board for eight years. It's a
different experience. There's contentiousness from time to time, both
with the county commissioners and the school board and other people, but
on the community college board I found it's a case of mutual respect-
that's not to be derogatory at all toward K-12, I just think it's a real
feather in the cap of the community college system across the state that
as I've learned more and more, after coming to the legislature a little
over four years ago, it seems to be true of most of your community
college as well in serving on the board at home, you can't help but
becoming more and more aware of the critical ?? that the community
college system plays in aiding efforts toward economic development. I
couldn't possibly remember the frequency with which articles are in the
local newspaper anytime there's an announcement about a business
expansion, the community college system is at the heart of what is made
or will help to make that possible with job force re-training. It's a
highly respected part of our community, as I know it is yours. As
politicians we all get out and move around in the community, and maybe
attend an occasional church breakfast, or a fundraiser, or go to the ??
club ham suppers. One of the things that I've also discovered as I go
around Burke County, and I suspect it's true for your counties, is that
among the young adults and people who are still in their late teens or
early twenties, if I'm engaged in a conversation and I say</p>

genitals and police major purpose resolution. it is recognized great
resolution I can mistake the members of the body. I had a good fortune
of spending about twenty seven half years of one of our community
colleges, and it was indeed a jolt will career because we had so many
opportunities to change people 's lives, and thinkers looked hello those
years with the income community college. I have really been pleased to
see the results of the training that we've now that has been done by the
system not on edge come across the state. what really does impress me
know as I travel from college to college and I have had the pleasure of
visiting many campuses is here and the stories that that the young
people talk about what the community colleges is meant for them. one
that really stuck with me as a young lady and I have forgot the college
that she was offended, but it was one in the photo Western part of the
state. she went to that cat has four times stopped not get out of her
car and go in. she left on the fourth trip to that college. she finally
got the courage to go out, go in and talk with someone and as a result
of talking with that what someone she ended up going to school there get
her degree and I believe she is now on the staff of that college as an
instructor. those are the kind of stories that you can hear all across
the state. as you travel from community college to community college and
the rule is that there is one within thirty minutes of every citizen in
the state. the we think North Carolina's and the leadership that without
the need to college system could really be proud of what they did by
making the decision to establish the many, many of our citizens have an

opportunities because of the young early colleges and all the progress

strong and in healthcare I am thinking about the number of people that
we put into the workforce and are seen are respiratory care, or an x-ray
technician at all the other healthcare programs. they've added the

become John, fellow colleagues here in this body and now it has been a
real life for me to be a part of time to make sure that the system got
his fair shake in the budgeting process. we have a great asset in this
estate with the system and I hope that we continue to support and do the
things necessary to provide the education front, people that maybe don't
want to go to a four-year university or maybe get the two years of home

Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Members, since coming to
the General Assembly, I have had a special place in my heart for
community colleges. I was a student and an instructor at one time at
Forsyth Technical in Winston-Salem and I have taken enough hours at Wake
Tech to have the equivalent of a PhD, which they haven't awarded me yet.
But, I just wanted to ask each of you, I know that if you have a
community college in your area, you're probably interacting with it
already, but always keep in mind when you're meeting students, parents,
business people, to keep the community colleges first and foremost in
your mind because they serve a wonderful purpose. For some, they are
that road onto a career, as Representative Tolson enumerated. For
others, they can be a bridge between high school and college. But they
are a jewel, I believe as Representative Blackwell referenced them, and
is something that North Carolina can be extremely proud of. We just need
to make sure that we place them in the right priority for our citizens
in this state. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Fellow members of the

resolution, and I ask your support in voting in favor of the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, it'd be hard to imagine what North Carolina would look like if we
didn't have the community college system. When I read the resolution and
saw that it was started in 1963, I was in the first grade. And it took a
lot of vision for the people to see what the community college system
could become, but I don't even think they had an idea of what it would
have turned out to be and I know that they would be proud, but it's gone
far and beyond what they ever envisioned. I think it has exceeded
everybody's expectations. And I can only tell you in Caldwell County
what Caldwell Community College and Technical Institute means to us
because we've been one of the counties who have been hardest hit with
unemployment because of the loss of furniture and hosiery manufacturing.
And they've been a lifesaver in helping to retrain people and give them
an opportunity to be able to make a living for themselves. Not only are
they retraining unemployed people, they've been one of the most vital
tools that we have in economic development because our community college
is able to partner with new and existing businesses who want to grow or
come into Caldwell County, and they can train the workers and they can
provide what it is that they need. So it has been a great economic
recruitment thing. And then in addition, you forget they make going to
college affordable. They make it easy. Everybody who graduates from high
school, or maybe not everybody, but the majority of students who
graduate from high school, if they have the dream of going to college,
they can't always afford a four year college degree. But you can go to
the community college and they make it affordable. And then of course,
they do a good job in helping our high school students. You know, it's
amazing that 60 percent of the students that go through the community
college have to go through remediation. They're actually teaching our
students to read and write and do basic math. I have said in the past to
my community college President that maybe we just need to turn the high
schools over to the community college. I think they'd do a good job at
it. But Mister Speaker, I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Like many of my colleagues
here, I come from a rural county and of course I was just a mere infant
back when Representative Starnes was in the first grade, but I am just
old enough to remember when Rockingham Community College was a brand new
college. And I just wanted to say how much it has meant to our county
and our community, and we think about what it means to our young people
getting an education, but I think of so many that I know also that are
adults later in life that have gone back to school and advanced their
education in such a way, and it has been...</p>

serves our adult population. When I worked with the Orange County
Commission for Women, we were at a state where women were entering
non-traditional jobs. And we arranged with the community college to
teach a course of women welders, which I thought was a very great
contribution. I also needed to brush up on my accounting course myself,
and so I took an accounting course. So our community colleges really
serve many, many populations and are really a, I think, a jewel for
North Carolina. I support the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

travelled this state in the community college programs. But I am very
grateful that I was able to do that because it did prepare me for what
was coming. I went on and did get my Associates degree after going to
those community colleges, and was able to later do distance learning,
which a lot of colleges do now, distance learning for adult students. So
I am very, very proud and thankful that the community system existed
because it gave me an opportunity to take my life and my education to
another level, at an inexpensive cost. I commend the resolution to you.

Where as Americans celebrate the national day of prayer annually, on the

observance, places its historical origins to a mandate by George
Washington. The first president of the united states. And were as this
is a day where Americans are encourage to turn god in prayer, an
meditation. And where as our state constitution begins, “We the people
of the state of North Carolina grateful to all mighty god the sovereign
ruler of nations. For the preservation of the American union and the
existence of our civil, political, and religious liberties, and
announcing our dependence upon him, for the continuance for those
blessing to us in our posterity. And where as we join the authors of the
constitution. Being grateful to all might god for the resistance of our
liberties. And we acknowledge our dependence upon him for the

Our state. Prayer to go has been an integral goal in the life of our
nation and state since our founding. The diary of Christopher Colombus
records his reliance upon God and prayer. When the settlers first came
to Jamestown and then to Plymouth Rock among their earliest recorded
acts was to pray and to thank God and to dedicate their mission to him.
The Jamestown prayer states that if thou our Lord are on our side we
care not who be against us. In other words as scripture says if God be
for us who can be against us. At Plymouth Governor William Bradford
proclaimed a designated day of thanksgiving and prayer. I believe this
was the first such proclamation by a governor in the new world that was
recorded. some 166 years later when the constitutional congress meet to
form the constitution of the United States after weeks of intense debate
with the outcome in question. It was the the elder statesman Benjamin
Franklin. Not known for being a very religious man that issued a plea
that they pray and they did pray and that prayer continues in the halls
of congress today. Just as it does in this general assembly. George
Washington our first president the Commander in Chief of our first
continental army and the one often referred to as the father of our
country if you will. Many times reiterated publicly the need for prayer
and the sovereignty of God in allowing a rag tag army to withstand the
greatest army of the world at that time. President Washington who we
also honor with this resolution issued his own proclamation for prayer.
That would help pave the way and lead to the observance of the national
day of prayer. At a dark time in our nations history one of our most
honored presidents Abraham Lincoln, Representative Alexander's favorites
quoted scripture in reminding us that a house divided against itself
cannot stand Psalm: 127 tells us that unless the Lord rules the house
they labor in vein who build it. The word of God reminds us that nations
rise and nations fall under the sovereign hand of God. So I would
respectfully suggest that although we do many important things here.
None are more important than what we do here today in renewing our
dedication to God and to prayer as our founders have from the beginning.
The constitution of North Carolina begins by mentioning almighty God .
The sovereign ruler of nations and acknowledges our dependency upon him
for  our blessings and those of our posterity We stand here today as the
posterity of those founders and framers of our constitution and we say
yes we agree ad we honor God in prayer. This nation and this state have
been bathed in prayer from their beginnings. And with this resolution
the 2013 session of the North Carolina General assembly. We are setting
publicly and for the record that we agree with these founders of our
nation and of our state. We believe that rights come from God not the
king not the government and we can open our meeting everyday in prayer
and we pledge allegiance to one nation under God Members of the house
today we stand together with our governor recognizing that the things
that bind us together are far more important than those things for which
we agree to disagree. We thank the governor and we follow his lead and
we support his proclamation for this week of prayer for our state. Which
will be held April 28th through may 4th in conjunction with the national
day of prayer which is the first Thursday in May. Ladies and gentlemen I
commend this resolution [SPEAKER CHANGES} representative Boblee please
state you purpose . Speak on the resolution SPEAKER CHANGES The lady is
recognized t debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker very briefly I want to say that even though we are endorsing
this resolution it does not prohibit us from praying anytime any place
or anywhere a number of yo are very sincere when you pray. That does not
negate those who tend to pray form or fashion it is interesting that
most of us probably remember the prayer that our parents taught us and
that is now I lay me down to sleep and that is.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, I made a commitment to my constituents that I
would leave Raleigh with no unspent devotion, no unspent energy to
serving them, but doing that also realize an awesome responsibility. It
was one that was also realized by King Solomon. And if you would allow
me to please to read because I can't even paraphrase better than that.
This is found in first kings three through fourteen. And God said ask
what I should give you, and King Solomon replied, so give your servant
an obedient heart to judge your people and discern between good and
evil. For who is able to judge this great people of yours. Because you
have not requested long life, or riches for yourself, or death of your
enemies, but you asked for discernment for yourself to understand
justice, I will therefore do what you have asked and I will give you a
wise and discerning heart, so that there has never been before anyone
like you, or ever will be again. And again I find great comfort in the
passage found in Deuteronomy seventeen where a principle governing kings
over the nation of Israel. And it said that they should write for
themselves a copy of your word, and they should be with him, and they
should read it all the days of his life. That he may learn to fear the
Lord, his god, and be careful to observe all the words of this law and
statute. That his heart may not be puffed up above his brethren, and
that he may not turn aside form the Commandments to the right or to the
left. And that he and his children will live long and prosperous. I
understand that my devotion and duty is to the Lord, and I understand
that I need his help, and it's through prayer that I access that. And
with that, I commend the resolution to you.

of incorporation of planned community form the basis for the legal
authority for the community. This common sense bill will make
maintenance and repair more efficient and effective, will increase
accountability, and will bring peace of mind to those who dwell in
planned communities. It represents a commitment to hard-working
taxpayers who live in such communities. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, before we go to Notices and Announcements,
Representative Pittman's inquiry earlier about the time for bill filing
raised the legitimate concern that there are a lot of bills filed and
that members may need a bit more time to go through them, so the
co-sponsorship for bills that were introduced today will be through
Saturday afternoon at five P M. Similarly, we don't know, we don't think
that we'll have quite as many bills on Monday, but we will also extend
the co-sponsorship for bills introduced on Monday.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen of the House, it is with a heavy
heart that I tell you that in the early hours this morning,  Mrs. Marcy

own Representative Roger West, passed away. Arrangements are incomplete,
at the Ivy Funeral Home in Murphy. Watch your email for further
information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen of the House, Representative West
indicated yesterday that his mother was 101 years old, was on her way,
not too long away now from 102, and that she had lived independently in
her home for all those years. Let's keep Mrs. West and Roger's family in
our prayers. Also, by way of update, Representative Womble's condition
appears to be improving. Apparently he did go in for a surgical
procedure for his knee, but he contracted an infection once he was in
the hospital. But we hear he's improving. I hope you'll keep him in your
thoughts and prayers as well. Representative Arp, please state your
purpose.
