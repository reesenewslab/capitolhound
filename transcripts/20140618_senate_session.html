1158 has passed its third reading and will be enrolled. House bill 1031,
the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House bill 1031, NC Economic
Development Partnership Modifications. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown
is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and
gentlemen, this is the P3 bill that we heard in commerce also heard in
appropriations this morning. As you heard, we passed the Senate version
a couple weeks ago. This is a House version that came over with a few
changes that I think made the bill a little better. Again I made this
comment in appropriations this morning, this bill is probably still
something that we'll continue to work on in the long session, but I
think it's the best we can get it at this point, so I'll ask for your
support and try to answer any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there
further discussion or debate on the committee substitute to House Bill
1031.  Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the passage of
House Bill 1031 on its second reading. All in favor will vote aye, all
opposed will vote no, 5 seconds will be allowed for the voting, the
clerk will record the vote. Glock, aye. Clark, aye. 49 having voted in
the affirmative and none in the negative House Bill 1031 has passed its
second reading and without objection. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President,
I'd like to object to third reading. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick
objects to third reading. Senate Bill 574, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senate Bill 574, Groundwater contamination, modify response.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, this is on for a motion to concur. Senator
Goolsby is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. This
act clarifies our product liability statute as proposed, confirming that
it does not apply to latent groundwater contamination claims. The
product liability statute proposal was enacted back in 1979 as part of
an omnibus products liability bill designed to address the sudden wave
of product liability claims against manufacturers of durable goods. As
the State Supreme Court explained in Tetterton v. Long Manufacturing
Company, a case back in 1985, the legislative intent of the 1979 act was
to limit a manufacturer's ability for a product's tail problems after a
certain period of years had elapsed from the date of initial purchase
for use or consumption. Clearly this General Assembly never intended for
the act to affect claims arising from unknown exposures to unknown
elements at unknown times with latency periods that are decades long.
The General Assembly must clarify the text of the statute in order to
protect the original intent of the 1979 act's drafters. I would ask you
to concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator Goolsby a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, do you yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, I was in J1 with
you and I just want to reiterate my understanding is after we had the
discussion, we are not really changing the law, we're just clarifying
the law because it was made for goods and that everyone will get their
day in court, it will just be based on the merits of the case when they
get there. Is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Senator, what we're
doing today is we're just making sure that we as the General Assembly
clarify the text of the statute to protect the original intent of the
1979 act's drafters. And what we're dealing with in a couple of parts of
the state are groundwater contamination claims, and what separates them
from the original intent of the bill that was passed back in 1979 is
that groundwater contamination claims, unlike product liability claims,
arise from unknown exposures by unknown elements at unknown times and,
Senator, they can have latency periods that can be decades long unlike
products, and that the intent of the bill back in 1979 was to deal with
products. They never conceived that</p>

[Speaker] Dealing with groundwater contamination and he claims our way
of doing is clarifying that for anyone who might look at our law. Thank
you Mr. President.

committee senate bill 574. Senator Gosbee asked that you vote to concur
all in favor of concurrence will vote aye all oppose will vote no. 5
seconds will be allowed for the voting, clerk will record the vote. 49
having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative the motion
carries and the bill will be enrolled and sent to the governor. Senator
Rikisi what purpose yours
[Speaker Changes] I just objected a third reading on the preceding bill.
Had a chance to speak to Senator Brown about my concerns looks like it’s
an issue we can work out with the secretary so I will remove my
objections to the third reading on the economic development board bill.
I forgot the bill number since it was not on the calendar for the day.
Believe that’s house bill 1031 is that, that would be correct. So I
remove my objection to the 3rd readings.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Rikisi having removed his objection to house
bill 1031 is there any objection to voting that voice vote on 3rd
reading? Hearring none, clerk? It’s been requested that we voted on 3rd
reading electronically so house bill 1031 3rd reading clerk will read.
[Speaker Changes] House bill 1031 North Carolina economic development
modifications.

1031? Hearing none is the senate on passage on 3rd reading of the
committee substitute of house bill 1031 all in favor will vote aye all

[??] for that feat. Served on the UNC Board of Governors from 2003 to
2012. He has been a member of the Sentential Authority of the PNC Arena
since 1995 of which he is serving his second term as vice chair. He's
also the former chair of the Carey Chamber of Commerce. Not withstanding
all of those outstanding public service record, when asked about the
awards committee, “What was the most rewarding experience he has ever
undertaken?” he quickly and unequivocally responded “The ten years of
service as a therapeutic foster parent for the Methodist Home for
Children.” I appreciate the opportunity to share this with you publicly
because in typical Brent fashion he has declined to attend the awards
ceremony in favor of sitting in a hot and dusty baseball field at the
University of South Carolina to watch our son, John Charles, pitch.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I reluctantly move that the words spoken by Senator

privilege. Senator Barringer, congratulations!
Mr. President?

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to ask the Augusta Senator from Mountains,
Apodaca a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Reluctantly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Having not been on the committee, the ox-meter
committee, nor having ever received that nor ever wanting to receive it,
I have a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is anyone other than members eligible?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not at this point. We'd have to have a rules meeting
and change the rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Our reading clerk came awful close. If he's
not eligible, but the other day...I think we need to add him to the
list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there further business come for the Senate? If not,
the chair recognizes Senator Pate ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I move that this senate now
adjourn subject to messages from the house of the Governor. The
introduction, re-referral and referral of bills and resolutions, the
receipt and re-referral of committee reports, ratification of bills and
appointment of ?? to reconvene on Thursday June 19th at 11:30 A.M.
