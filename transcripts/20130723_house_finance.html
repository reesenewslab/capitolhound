<p id="00:00">
Good morning. We have only two bills this morning so hopefully we can
move swiftly. Senate Bill 523. Senator Rucho and Rabin. Gentleman,
welcome to the Finance Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chairman, thanks very much for allowing us to be here. Senator
Rabin is enjoying a cup of coffee right now but he’ll be available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, let me interrupt you. Representative Carney is recognized for a
motion that we have a PCS before us for the purpose of discussion. All
in favor will say aye, all opposed no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, madam Chairman. Just to give the committee a quick briefing,
we don’t want to delay this. The department is introducing the TIM
system, hopefully sooner than later. The existing law is very onerous
and what we were trying to do in this case was to make it simple so that
the department and the TIM system would be able to comply with what is
supposed to be the law. The issue of income tax is a small part of it,
the real issue is on sales tax. We have a number of companies in the
state that just refuse to submit sales tax returns, even as bad as the
penalty is, upwards of 25%. The problem with that is the fact that when
the department gets the money, it can’t disperse it until it has a
return to be able to say, this is where the money is collected from what
counties and the like and in essence sits in limbo. It just accumulates
there and it does no good for providing monies to the municipalities and
the counties. That really is the crux of this bill to try to make it
perfectly clear. On the part dealing with the income tax, the belief in
the Senate was that if you are a taxpayer in this state, you have a
responsibility to file your taxes. You can either file it, you can ask
for an extension, there are a lot of other options in there. But the
fact is, if you don’t file, there has to be a penalty. If you speed
going home on I-85 or I-40 there is a penalty because the law says there
is a penalty for not filing, for not speeding. What that is, is it
introduces a very flat $100 penalty that if, under circumstances the
Secretary of the Department of Revenue can actually say, no this is not
going to be that way. There was a lot of confusion about a penalty with
a refund. The department does not understand that there is a refund due
until a tax...until you’re taxes actually submitted for them to review.
That’s why it’s very important for everyone to file their taxes. It’s a
simple $100 penalty. Madam Chairman, if I may, the folks from the
department can be here to explain in more detail about the TIM system
and why this change is necessary. This was a request from them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely. Someone from the Department of Revenue? Sir, if you will
give us your name and your position please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Eric Wayne, Director of Sales Tax, Department of Revenue. This
originally started back a couple years ago in preparation of the design
for the TIM system and more specifically to the problems that the
department faces for sales and use tax because both the state and local
taxes paid on one return and how we would go about splitting the
penalties and applying the 5% minimums. It was 5% state and 5% county,
so that was where this originally started from was how can we avoid or
alleviate the problem for the separate minimum penalties. Along the same
time, we were also doing a number of things at the department to try to
obtain tax returns that were not filed by large businesses. What we did
was mandate that all taxpayers that file on a monthly file with
prepayment of $20,000 or more were mandated to file electronic returns.
What often happens is taxpayers would send the tax payments in and they
would not send the returns in. If the return is not received then we
cannot distribute the money to the local governments because there is a
question is how much is state and how much is local, so that was kind of
the backdrop for how this initially started. We also had the same
problem because the unfortified and fortified line is on the same
return, there’s not a separate return for those. It had the same problem
that the sales and use tax had. We did request that they remove the $5
minimum penalties and we were going to do it on a per return basis,
however, during discussions over the last couple of years, what we
determined is that the fair to file penalty is being applied as an
additional failure to pay penalty, meaning if you had not filed...if you
had paid...</p>

<p id="05:00">
…tax due by the due date but you have not filed the return, basically
there wasn’t enough there to file a penalty. So the Department asked for
direction from the General Assembly. You know we identified this.
This has been done for the most part, I was not in the current position,
but when we converted to the ITAS system back in like 1993, for
instance, for income tax purposes, it’s my understanding that the
decision was made that what we did for individual income tax had to
apply for all tax types because there was not a way to do it per tax
type. So, the default was to do it on the net tax due or there would be
no penalty if the tax was paid by the due date.
So the cost of that decision, all the other tax types followed. So,
again in an attempt to try to ensure that we can distribute the money to
the local governments that was the backdrops for the discussions for
this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee do you have questions for Mr. Wayne? Mr. Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not a question for him. I have an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Holley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. My question is about the personal penalty of $100 for someone
who hadn’t filed but is owed money. What if they’re owed less than $100?
The balance they still have to pay or how does that happen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Wayne.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you repeat your question? I’m sorry I was thinking to reach an
answer to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. The $100 penalty for not having filed even if you’re owed taxes.
Well if you’re owed less than $100 is the fine still $100 and now you’re
in the red?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Based on the current draft of the bill that would be that you would owe
an additional $100 penalty. That was something that we discussed
yesterday with Senator Rucho so he probably could speak to that. Because
for the most part A came from leadership, B was more for the Department.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chairman, Representative Holley, we looked at trying to draft
language if it was less than $100 that the penalty would be whatever the
refund that was due. The problem is getting the language drawn where you
could simply do it.
But it goes back to the original intent that if everyone has to file, if
you’re required to file then you should file it. If you don’t file it
there is no penalty. Everyone who abides by the law there is no penalty
for. We couldn’t get the language and Ms. Finnell might be able to
explain what some of the concerns are or challenges are on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Heather Finnell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Part of the concern with tying it to the amount of the refund if the
refund is less than $100 is the amount of your refund is partly due on
your actions and partly due on your employer’s actions. So for example,
you could have an individual who has a tax liability of a certain amount
and another individual who has a tax liability of the exact same amount
but one receives a refund because their employer withheld taxes
correctly and one did not.
So we were trying to tie the penalty to the amount of the taxes due. If
you tie it to the amount of the refund you actually are going to end up
treating two similarly situated taxpayers differently based on actions
that are outside of their control.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Other members of the committee, Mr. Wayne has left the podium.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, if you’ll just stay right where you are until we get our questions
answered. Representative Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairman. A question for the bill’s sponsor for the Tax
Department. Would the Tax Department still have the right to waive that
penalty under extenuating circumstances?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The secretary still does have the right. The circumstance is they say,
“Hey, that’s not what we intended to do.” They still have that ability.
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee. Mr. Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Wayne.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the Department of Revenue intend on waiving the penalty if there’s
a refund owed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have not at this point heard that that would be the plan. The
Department does have a penalty policy that is applicable to any
taxpayer. They get a one-time waiver on a tax type. One time every three
years that would be available for a taxpayer to ask for a penalty
waiver.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What that means Representative Brawley is don’t screw up more than once.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair. In regards to Senator Rucho’s comments, on line
11, the word “shall” is in that line and I’m not sure that gives the
secretary flexibility to actually waive. Do we need to change that to
“may”?</p>

<p id="10:00">
There is a different statute that gives the secretary the ability to
waive those penalties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair thank you, my question was about shall
[??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, Madame Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe we'll hold the motion for just a few minutes
Mr. - further questions from the committee? None. Mr. Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,  I have an amendment which Ms. Fennelle [SP] says
she can explain and it's on behalf of the tax council and the CPA's if
they could be heard on it to give you a little background before she
does it. A couple weeks ago we had a bill where we stripped out a
section that tried to do something like this, and this makes it worst.
This committee stripped it out and this makes it worse. And before I
further explain could Ms. Fennelle [SP] read the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you have copies of the amendment Mr. Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We don't have copies, can we get the copies made?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we better because I see it's quite lengthy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll be at ease until the amendment is brought back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Other amendments? Mr. Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I would just - since we're waiting. On the
explanation on the amount of the refund I heard ms. Fenelle's [SP]
explanation, it still seems unfair to the taxpayer if the penalty is
$100 dollars and the refund is $50 or in other cases it might be $60. It
seems the taxpayer's being held responsible because of potential actions
by the employer. And why not simply make the penalty what the refund is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First of all, the issue of failure to file is the $100
dollars. Okay? That no matter whether you owe or don't owe, if you don't
file your return and you're required to file your return then there's a
penalty. That's nothing to do with any other charges afterwards. And
there was a problem that Ms. Fennelle [SP] either explained or may
explain better, the fact that to try to say you only owe $50 dollars,
you got a refund of $50 and you should only owe pay $50. We thought
about that, we tried to work it through but apparently we couldn't get
the language to work to make that happen and maybe Madame Chairman she
can explain that in more detail.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Ms. Fennelle [SP].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll go back through what I was describing before. The
amount of your refund is due on all your tax credits ad payments as you
know. Whether or not you file is something that the individual taxpayer
controls. So just for an example say if the general assembly fails to
withhold the correct amount of money for me, I would basically if I
failed to file I could owe a significant amount and I would pay a
penalty of $100 dollars versus if they withhold too much from Cindy and
she has a refund and she fails to file, she will no longer now have a
penalty even if she fails to file. So you have two similar situated
taxpayers who owe the same amount of money who did the exact same
actions but one of them gets a penalty and one of them does not. So we
could draft language that does that but that's the concern we raised. So
we could draft you something to do that but I'm still not sure you
overcome the problem that you have two similar situated taxpayers and
you're treating them differently.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chairman. My question is I think
similar in nature but I have a little different philosophy behind it. If
someone is owed a refund and they fail to file their return on time
aren't they in essence giving the state a bit of an interest free loan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chairman, Representative Hamilton, if you don't
file there's no way of knowing you were owed a refund or not owed a
refund based on whatever is in there. So that's why it's essential that
filing occur. If you don't file then there's no way of knowing if you
actually do a refund or not do a refund, if you have a tax liability. So
that's why it's critical to be able to require a person that everyone
should and must file their tax return in a timely manner or ask for an
extention. Okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair. Just to kind of straighten out
a few things that are rolling around. First it is the policy to waive
penalties on individual taxpayers once every three years. So as a
practical manner if this is the first time you've done it you're not
gonna have a penalty whether you do a refund or not. The small refunds
are going to tend to be people like teenagers that have had a summer
job, they've made a little money, they've paid a...</p>

what I- a lot of money. I paid over $10,000 in tax, so I was due a
refund. Under this bill, if I filed my return late, under the current
law, I would owe no refund. I mean I would owe no penalty, but under
this, I would still owe that same hundred dollar penalty. I would've
paid over $10,000 of tax and I would have paid the same hundred dollar
penalty that my nice would pay under this bill. And I just do not think
this is right. Plus to put this into perspective, a hundred dollars is
5% of 2000. So to have a tax liability of $2000 requires a taxable
income of somewhere around $31,000 and so that would roughly- median
income is around $44,000, and so you can see that a lot of the taxpayers
in the state would be affected.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Ms. Ferris.
Members of the committee, you do have the amendment before you at this
time. Sen. Rucho, on the amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stam, if you'd like to explain your amendment we'll have comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, I think it's fair, I think it's more consistent with federal law,
and not that we have to be consistent with federal law, but in the tax
preparation it just reduces complications. This is unfair to lower the
bill as it is without  the amendment, it's unfair to lower income
people, and they shouldn't have to go through that requesting the waiver
procedure when hundreds of thousands of them are just going to bother.
So I would urge adoption of the amendment, and then I can support the
bill with- and as I say, we did this 2 weeks ago, we fixed it we
thought, but here it comes again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairman.
A couple of points Ms. Ferris was talking about. There's 2 separate
actions. There's a penalty for not filing, and then there's a penalty
that- and then there's whatever the tax liability is for that. What we
tried to do, and let's not get confused, the income tax is only one
small part of this. The part that really matters is the one that's
significant, and that is the sales tax, because it puts money in limbo.
I'd like to hear, Madam Chairman, from the department regarding this
amendment if possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Wayne, would you like to address the issue? Yes.
On the amendment, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Eric Wayne, Department of Revenue. I would just as far as on the net
tax after credits and payments, that does not alleviate the problem that
we have today relative to distributing the local sales and use taxes to
determine whether it's state tax or local tax. So that would be very
problematic for the sales tax perspective and also for the fortified and
unfortified wine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Bill Brawley on the amendment, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. This amendment addresses the idea of whether or not someone do a
small refund would end up paying a penalty. And I was absolutely
convinced, I heard the department say that they were going to waive it.
Now I'm hearing the tax people say they're not going to waive it, you're
going to have to apply, and I want a clear answer. What has to
happen-Becky, let me ask my question.- I would like the department to
please address that issue clearly so we know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Wayne, if you would like to take that question please. We're getting
tested here this morning, so let's see if we can get this taken care of.
Mr. Wayne.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To reiterate, the current penalty policy does allow for an automatic
waiver. However, the taxpayer would not- must not have any delinquent
returns or any other taxes outstanding. One thing that could be done
would be to change the penalty policy in order to grant a one time
waiver if this should be enacted. To identify that, it would be an
automatic waiver for the first time around. That would certainly be at
the discretion of the secretary for that penalty policy to be changed.
I'm not speaking on his behalf, I do think it's an option,  I think we
hear your concerns, I do think that there is some middle ground that
could be met on that issue regarding the waiver.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Brawley, did that answer your question?
Mr. Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, a question to the department and Sen. Rucho after he speaks.
If the amendment only applied to the income tax part and not to the
sales tax part would that be acceptable?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We believe that it will- that we can administer, we can distribute the
sales and use tax. There would be a reason for a taxpayer to be
penalized for a payer to file the return for sales tax, which was again,

initial things behind this. It would put the income tax back to the
current administrative practice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Rucho.
Miss Stam are you finished?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If that's agreeable with Sen. Rucho, I'm having prepared a perfecting
amendment if that would be acceptable. So my amendment would only apply
to the income tax part and not the sales tax part.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question to Mr. Wayne, and again, my main concern was the sales tax,
because that's really the onerous part of this deal for the state. But
Mr. Wayne, will that allow us to solve the problem that we had with
where the law stated one specific requirements and the department over
the last number of years used some kind of other practical way of doing
it? Are we clarifying that so that the law is actually what you're going
to implement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Wayne.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, I think that from the department's perspective we were basically
assess an additional fair to pay penalty. If it's clear that for income
tax purposes that the fair to pay penalty is based on the net amount of
tax, that can be implemented. The concern was that what the statute said
and the practice that was implemented years ago was not consistent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Sen. Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Wayne, with this amendment, if it's perfected will this allow you to
operate under the law without any special practical solutions and not
legal solutions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm looking to the assistant for corporate income tax, and we believe
that is correct, that we can operate under the law without any problems
and implement it in the new system without any problems.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is it perfecting, or separate amendment?
I withdraw my previous amendment and ask Miss Finnell to read a
substitute amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe we're gonna get copies again, Rep. Stam. Rep. Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to support the Stam amendment now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I was going to support the perfecting amendment, but he just
withdrew the perfecting amendment, so I'm on the amendment. And the
reason why, is that
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke, I believe the member has withdrawn the amendment that is
before you. And he is getting ready to be recognized to offer an
amendment that's being copied now. But you have the floor and you may
speak on
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Whichever amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I'm gonna speak on the bill hoping some amendment comes along the
way. Members of the committee, everyone's concern here is about the
income tax for lower income people. And Sen. Rucho's concern is about
the sales tax. And so the amendment just seems perfect to move us
forward. And I support the amendment, Madam Chair, whenever it appears.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It'll be here shortly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm just being told that the amendment that is going to be before you in
just a minute is one sentence, so hopefully we do not have to have
copies. So, Heather is going to explain the amendment.
Rep. Stam makes motion to have the amendment before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are copies being made but in the meantime I'll explain what the
amendment does. If you look on page 1, line 14, at the end of that
sentence it adds the following language: So for individual income tax,
the penalty is $100 if the net amount of the tax due is greater than 0.
And then it defines the net amount of the tax to include the tax imposed
after credits and tax payments. And so what that would mean is basically
that the penalty would only be imposed if there is not a refund due. So
if there is a refund due there would be no penalty. Or if your tax
liability is 0.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee on the amendment, Rep. Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair.
I want to do the right thing, and somehow can't believe that we're
flying by the seat of our pants, can I ask Mr. Ayler with the CPA
association to weigh in on the amendment, and does this address the
concerns that they have or have we hit the target or have we missed the
target?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir if you'll give us your name and your position for the records.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will do that. Good morning.
Jim Ayler, CEO of the North Carolina association. I appreciate the

doesn't matter the amount of the refund, all refunds, no penalty.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee on the amendment. Representative Stam moves
that we have the amendment before us. All in favor will say,
&quot;Aye.&quot; All opposed, &quot;No.&quot; I believe the amendment
passes back on the bill as amended. Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chairman, I accept this, and as a friendly amendment. Hopefully,
we'll get the Representative Brawley's motion, for a favor report would
be wonderful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, you're recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair. Move that the proposed House Committee substitute
as ammended be rolled into a new committee substitute, favorable to the
new substitute, unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee you have heard the motion. All in favor will
say, &quot;Aye.&quot; All opposed, &quot;No.&quot; Senator Rucho...
