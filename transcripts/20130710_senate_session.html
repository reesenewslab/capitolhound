will close the doors. Members will go to their seats. Members and guests
in the gallery, please silence all electronic devices. Leading the
Senate in prayer is the Reverend Peter Millner???, Senate Chaplain. All
members, guests in the gallery will please stand.
[Speaker changes.] Almighty God, Lord, as we settle in to work again,
we're thankful that you bring us order out of chaos, that you bring
beauty out of nothingness. Each person that stands here today has a
story and that story is either going into chaos or it's movin' into
beauty. But Lord, you have mercy on those that seem not able to get
themselves even moving out of chaos. Even those that are mentally ill
and those that just can't get going, you have mercy.  And so we ask that
you change us from being people that judge and retaliate and overpower
into people that are filled with your compassion and with your wisdom.
Bring us back to the place where as a people, we trust that you have our
back. Why can't we trust you, Jesus?  You are our strength and our
portion.  There's now no more condemnation for us.  Move us today in
little ways from overpowering others to listening to others.  Give us
grace to accomplish these things. Give us the strength to build up the
citizens of this great state and help us to have wisdom in all we do. In
Jesus' name I pray, Amen. (Group responds Amen.)

phenomenal spas, resorts, that you will find in North Carolina and we
are very proud of it, it’s been with us a hundred years and I believe
every president since… a hundred years ago Senator Allran when you first

pleasant experience. I think most of yall have been there, so there’s
nothing we can really tell ya about this place. I will tell you this,
there’s something magical about our mountains up there that inspire
people to do very wonderful things. You’ve been to visit the ?? Estate,
how in the world did that thing get there? That fellow sat down and
looked and said “this is the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen” and he
bought everything in sight. Everything he could see to the west he
bought. They gave the ?? National Forest I think it was, one of those
national forests, to the federal government. When they started having to
pay tax on all that land.</p>

The Grove Park Inn is probably one of the most impressive of all those
things that have occurred up there, and one thing that's always struck
me, if you ever go up there, they've got a little history of it out
there that you can see.  Most of you have seen that.  They hauled those
rocks up there one at a time on the back of a pick up or van pool, by
mules or something, to get them to the top of the mountain.  And, at the
time it was built, it was considered a modern marvel.  It was considered
by the people all over this country as the epitome of modern
architecture at the time.  And the, the ability of this country to build
something.  The most impressive piece of it was Grove designed it,
commissioned his son-in-law to build it.  From the time they broke dirt
until they opened the doors was a year and a week.  The place was build
in a year, and open to the public.  We're very proud of it.  I've, back
when I could still play golf and travel some I.  Golf is the one thing I
do for fun, or used to do for fun, and I don't even do it anymore, but.
And I've played golf courses all over this country, and if you never do
anything else, if you can still play golf, go play that golf course.  It
is the most pleasant experience you'll ever have.  I've told people I'd
rather play there than any place I've played in this country.  You can
kind of hit it all over the place and enjoy yourself.  The air's good
and fresh.  About every other hole you get to look west and see those
mountains.  And it is just an absolutely glorious place up there.  We're
extremely proud of it.  It's been sold twice now in about a year.  Both
times for an upgrade, and we're pleased about that.  But come and visit
us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you Mr. President.  It's good to see Senator Nesbitt and Senator
Apodaca agree on a bill today.  If you're familiar with the Grove Park
Inn, they have an annual Christmas gingerbread house competition that's
very amazing.  People submit entries from across the state, and it's
just a beautiful display.  So today I'd like to challenge these two
Senators from Buncombe County to enter a gingerbread house in the
competition, and I want to see which senator has the better gingerbread
house.
