act to extend time for local forensic science labs to obtain
creditation.General ?? of North Carolina in action.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To the members of the house, we have to pass this bill. Because if we
don't, the local forensic labs, their results won't be admissible after
July 1. And that is sure of a disaster. Criminals would have free
reigns.The big issue was to what date the extension would go, the senate
bill said 20-18 and judiciary bill says lets make that 20-15. On the
theory that if you give any governing body like five years to do
something, they are not gonna do it until the year before. So this will
help the sheriffs and the local crime labs to convince their country
commissioners to spend a little money to get their labs up to date. Our
urge is to support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions, further debate. If not, the question before the house
is to pass to house committee substitute to senate bill 200 on it's

Speaker1: Currently is not in session. The  LEC has 20, business states
to determine whether to commence a preliminary hearing. Number four: it
allows the LEC to stand the preliminary investigation if it does not
have enough information to dismiss or find probable cause. Number five,
it postpones notification to the complainant of the charges against the
legislator until the legislator has had the opportunity to respond to
the charges and LEC has had the opportunity to consider the response;
and since then finally it specifies that the LEC may issue a [xx
]admonishment without holding a hearing, this is partly implied but not
specified and basically that’s what the bill does and now I stand to
answer any questions. I would ask for your support on the bill.

Speaker changes: The substitute committee present a bill 411 to violate
transportation bye law committees and all planning organizations, all
rural transportation planning organizations,all subject to standard
ethics, of provisions.
Speaker changes: All in North Carolina Act.
Speaker changes: Representative xx please state your purpose.
Speaker changes: To debate the bill.
Speaker changes: The lady is xx to debate the bill.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the House, this is
another clean- up bill. The bill would basically remove the application
of the State Government Ethics Act to PMOs and RPOs, and for your
benefit xxx metropolitan planning organizations and rural transportation
planning organizations. And with substitute ethic requirements are
pertinent to the function of those two organizations. All members with
voting authority are xxx in the MPO and the RPO will need to do the
following and there’s five things. Not to mention any acts if the member
knows or the member’s  or member’s extended family or business  with
which the member is associated may incur a reasonable foreseeable
financial benefit that would impair the member’s independence of
judgment or from which he could reasonably be inferred that the
financial benefit will influence the member’s  actions. Number two:
Promptly disclose in writing any conflict of interest or potential
conflict of interest . Number three: File a statement of economic
interest with the State Ethics Commission that will be evaluated for
possible conflicts and potential conflicts. Number four: follow it up
with State Ethics Commission a list of all real estate and fully owned
by the member and the member’s extended family or business with which
the member is xxx located in the jurisdiction of that particular MPO or
RPO in which the member is currently serving. And last not least: to
disclose public or nonpublic information gained in serving the MPO/RPO
that would affect a personal financial interest. The violations with the
conflict of interest will be a class1, misdemeanor, may I know by
concealing information on the SEC or real estate disclosure would also
be a class 1 , misdemeanor, providing false information on those two
statements would be a class H felony.  That’s what basically the bill
does and members, I stand to answer any questions and I would  ask for
your support of the bill.

cheers for mentors, a member who may have had an amendment, then they
would like interior December third reading tomorrow so that we will not
take their greetings and diagrams, and would you please take your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I see verbs in our review of the question presented Howard is lighting
up Mister Yadav 's lives and how it in your just when he began speaking
about this bill you refer to it as a clean up bill. how is the clean up
bill. it sounds like an exemption bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
actually what I was told by the Senator on hand on him then admit that
I'm not the most knowledgeable person on whom this field might not
possess. I think that there were some provisions that date, MP has an
RPI remembers were required to do some sort of things, and they were not
really on our Apple ball to their job said what they were doing was
trying to fit this group of April in a particular category that all of
the things that are now required would be relevant to the job that they
did follow a facility of the asserted yields or ribs and Howard
Goldstein is bulimia. this way, now
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
it seems that these folks in the MPO is the IPOs were subject to all the
provisions of the state ethics act that a lot of people are. and over
time I've had a lot of different people in these kinds of appointed
organizations complain about all the paperwork they vow to fill out so
my question is, is this not just trying to singling out a couple groups
to let them avoid filling out the paperwork for the state of exact
version of our version of Howard via the how does a representative Sam.
maybe I will respond. I question this lady was the over is ideal to read
safety standards examined as amount redraft the same as recognized that
look my understanding is that this dog. this part was requested by the
state ethics commission because they are being inundated by paper from
people who technically a fit under the statute, but really were not met,
having make heavy decision-making authority is the public policy as my
understanding of it. yes, it's an exemption, but it's a rational
exemption so were not asking the whole world to follow SES, that's where
I'm wrote on the street of mass murders and stand with this gentleman
you at it. Junior Lorenzo Sam, are you saying in effect, this is what we
often call in agency bill that the state ethics commission has requested
this new. they've reviewed it and support
on Thursday because one more question presents presented famous German,
you don't you well as you know, you've been around a long time, and so
by that the state ethics commission does not object to the bill is a
little bit different than, say, what's the origins of the bill and do
you think that the MPO Zen and rural comparable rural organizations are
to be exempt from the requirements of the state of exact do you  believe
that I think the way it's written. it's all very well balanced in its
proper
speed. remember Jennifer has written a nervous the house. I don't hear
any explanation for why the MPO 's in the RPO Zoology exempt from the
ethics regulations. I think if you're like me you gotten complaints from
people people don't know why they shouldn't have to fill out these forms
to serve on the community college for I've gotten will the Jerry from
someone is appointed to the board of governors who was furious that he
was asked to fill out all this stuff. I'm just not convinced and
understand written power of them spam our innocence carrying water for
the billets. the Senate bill, but I haven't heard anyone tell me why
it's fair to exempt these two groups. women got always other groups that
are equally unhappy with the paperwork, so I can't support the bill and
I hope you have hourly things are purpose to calculate. he is a raid
your for Christ. yes, resolutely, we'll publish it generally yields
refugee lady and the staff has just pointed out to me that these graves
are not being eggs they did, they are just making change is a type of
documentation that they file, but they are still in included. if you

Y'all. Line 1 through line 15 clarifies that these are the forms that
they are still required to file, and they are under no circumstance
exempt from the required documentation.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
May I continue, Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Representative Howard for pointing that out. Notwithstanding, it seem
that they're being put in a special category. No one's explained to me
how they are different from others. NPO, community college board member,
what's really the difference? I'm not persuaded, and I'm voting no.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. This bill is an attempt to clarify who is covered and
what they have to disclose. It's an attempt to bring some openness into
the MPO system, where now we've had some MPO members this year say,
&quot;We'll just pay the fine. We're not disclosing anything.&quot;
Because the revision was weak, this is an attempt to narrow the focus of
who has to fill out the paperwork and what they have to say and give
some teeth to people who may or may not feel like doing it. And we
members that are elected here all have to fill out this paperwork, and
it's an attempt to show and bring into the open who's doing what and why
they're doing it and what their possible motivations may be and just to
bring some clarity and openness to the process. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
see if Representative Stam might yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm
working on four other bills over here. You probably know the answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
Mr. Speaker, if I could ask my question or redirect to Representative
Howard, that may be easier. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard,
does the lady yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, I hope you know the
answer to your question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't. But I agree with
actually a significant portion of the bill, but I was informed and I
wasn't on committee. My question is, understanding or forgetting the SEI
issue, is there any provision in this bill that abrogates or eliminates
the gift ban requirements on these folks? That's my bigger question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, staff to the committee just
tells me that they remain under the state gift ban. That's the criminal
statutes, but they are no longer under the state government ??. [SPEAKER

Representative Ford, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To

bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I served on the Cabarrus
Rowan MPO for two years. And we didn't get any pay, and we met about six
or seven times per year. And it's a totally voluntary board. They're
made up of elected officials, so you're already taking ethics training
as an MPO RPO member. We didn't vote on any contracts on the MPO, so
we're not awarding anyone a contact. So there's nothing involved when it
has to do with money. I think this bill actually goes a little too far,
but I'm going to support it because it does scale it back somewhat. In
our local MPO we already lost two members because they had already taken
ethics training as an elected official and they didn't have the time nor
the want to do it all over again and add more to what they're already
doing in their service to their community. So I think it's a bill I can
get behind and I can support, but this is still a little too much in my
opinion. But I will support it today. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

?? one of the things that I'd focus on for those that are just looking
at this for the first time is that this relates to all individuals with
voting authority serving on the NPO.  The legislation that was
originally passed broadly applied to these two entities, but the
entities also had these advisory committees, and so people that were
simply there to provide advice but had no voting authority are getting
sucked into the whole set of ethics regulations that are here.  I'm all
about supporting disclosures and the ethics but I agree that this is
very appropriate narrowing to exclude a small portion of people who
probably shouldn't be caught up in this debate, they don't have voting
authority, and I would urge your support for the bill.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Representative Floyd, please state your purpose.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  To debate the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker when I first
heard this bill and also heard some comments in general government from
the board of elections.  My concerns have always been that I think that
the board of elections has enough to do and to add about seven NPOs to
that responsibility is a little bit too much, so I have questioned that,
and it is my understanding from many ?? that it was part of the statute
that they should do it.  I don't want to support the bill, because I see
no need in having the NPOs to do this, but however is here, but, to me,
it's giving the board of elections additional work, that they're already
understaffed, in which to do.  So I'm still wondering now, why when in
government there was two municipalities which to be exempt from this,
and some way they was unable to do it out there.  To me, the board of
elections has enough to do, to give them at least seven to eight more
NPOs to evaluate, and many, to my understanding, they may not have the
time in order to do it.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Iler, please
state your purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  To debate the bill.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  I was concerned a little bit about the paperwork factor
because this is actually less paperwork than what would be under the
existing law.  These advisory people and staff people are caught up in
this, they don't have voting authority, they're not elected officials
who've elected the NPOs and RPOs, representative McGrady had it exactly
right.  Linked with that is actually less paperwork from all these other
folks who shouldn't be filling these out anyway.  Hopefully that
clarifies a little bit, this is the way the bill was originally
explained to me, and I'm not sure what all it went through since then,
so I wasn't going to speak until that came up.  But it is that these
advisory folks are not voting, not to have to do this.  [SPEAKER

SPEAKER CHANGE
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just to remind the body of some of the things
that we talked about yesterday, this is a consumer finance loan that
really does take unfair advantage of military families, the elderly, the
poor. It preys on these folks and it is opposed by the Attorney General,
by the AARP, which I figure is one of our larger constituent group, both
republicans and democrats have a lot of AARP members in their
constituency, as well as the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy
Attorneys, and it’s just a bad way to do business in North Carolina, and
I hope that you will join me in opposing this bill. Thank you.

Representative Queen. Please state your purpose.

SPEAKER CHANGE
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGE
I’ll just speak briefly on this bill. To me, we’re in economic times
when interests rates is the lowest in my lifetime, and what we’re doing
here is allowing interest rates to be raised on those constituents of
ours who have the least capacity to pay these predatory rates. We open
this session each day with a prayer, and I think of the Lord’s Prayer in
this regard. This is the foundational prayer of most of our faiths in
this room, and the version in Matthew points out the two planks of the
Lord’s program, to provide food for all and to forgive debts, because
debt has been a way to play on people from the first century til today.
We want to be very careful in this regard. We are really opening
predatory lending in a bigger way in North Carolina and …
SPEAKER CHANGE
Mr. Speaker?
SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Czoka, please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGE
I’d like to ask the Representative if he would yield for a question?
SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Queen, does the gentleman yield?
SPEAKER CHANGE
I sure would.
SPEAKER CHANGE
The gentleman yields.
SPEAKER CHANGE
You keep mentioning the word predatory. Are these companies that we’re
talking about? Are they engaging in illegal activities as defined by
North Carolina statute?
SPEAKER CHANGE
Repeat your question once again. I’m having trouble catching it.
SPEAKER CHANGE
You’re talking about predatory lending.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Yes.
SPEAKER CHANGE
You’re talking about companies in North Carolina doing business. My
question for you, sir, is are they conducting illegal business,
according to the North Carolina statutes?
SPEAKER CHANGE
I am not sure if I know the answer to that question. I do know what
predatory lending looks like, which is when people have few choices and
the lenders come to this legislature to limit those choices or to open
up opportunities to prey upon them in their limited base, the least
among us, then their economic opportunities just get withered away and
they get preyed on by the powerful financial interests.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Mr. Speaker?

Representative Czoka?
SPEAKER CHANGE
I would ask the speaker to yield for a follow-up question?
SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Queen, does the gentleman yield?

choice?

In my opinion, the direction we should be going in this General Assembly
in these times, is trying to help those who have credit needs get
lower-priced credit not higher-priced credit. So I think we're just
going in directly the wrong way with this bill. So that is my point. The
final phrase in the Lord's Prayer is &quot;lead us no into
temptation.&quot; Just because you can take advantage of a man doesn't
mean you should and I think this General Assembly oughta be looking
after its citizens rather than allowing the expansion of high-priced
credit to the least among us.  So I will be voting no against this bill.
[speaker change] Representative Szoka please state your purpose.
[speaker change] To debate the bill. [speaker change] The gentlemen is
recognized to debate the bill. [speaker change] Ladies and gentlemen,
we've heard several things so far on the floor debate today that we
heard yesterday and we had a good debate hearing all the issues ??. I'd
like to remind everyone here on both sides of the aisle, that this bill
did pass unanimously out of banking. Republicans and democrats voted for
it. It's been stated that this is discriminatory and predatory on
military members. That issue has been specifically addressed in the bill
to take care of that as I explained yesterday and I won't repeat myself
on that.  I think that what this bill does it offered people a choice.
They have many choices. They can choose to get credit cards, which as I
explained yesterday more frequently traps people into much more longer
instances of making payments and many tens of thousands of dollars more
before they get it paid off. The goodness of these loans is, is that a
person who decides of their own free will to take it, no one's forcing
them to do it, is that they can determine their own payments. Whether on
12 month repayment schedule, 24, 36 month. They know they can plan. And
as I mentioned yesterday, many of the people that I have seen their
credit reports and talked with them over the years involved in the
mortgage industry, they like that. They like that as a matter of their
choice.  And when it comes to the total amount of dollars that they
spend repaying these loans it is much much less over time than if they
did some other option such as credit cards. I still think this is a good
bill and I ask your support for it. [speaker change] Speaker, may I ask
a question. [speaker change] Representative McManus please state your
purpose. [speaker change] Representatives, I'd like to ask
Representative Szoka a question. [speaker change] Representative Szoka,
does the gentleman yield? [speaker change] I do. [speaker change] The
gentleman yields. [speaker change] I'm curious, if we built in things
into this bill to protect certain members of the military so that they
are not abused by this bill, then why would we not build in those same
things to protect low income individuals? Why would we feel a need to
protect the military but not a need to protect the public. [speaker
change] Thank you for that question. The military has a chain of
command. A private, or a specialist or a corporal has a duty and a
responsibility that is much different than someone who isn't in the
military. Particularly in a wartime situation with them deploying it's
important for them to make good choices. A member of the general public
doesn't have a chain of command. Who would we call to ask if Mr. Jones
or Mr. Smith if they wanna do it. That may or may not answer your
question but I don't know who ?? would call. I think that the protection
is there and it comes back to personal choice for an individual who's in
a civilian economy trying to plan their life and finance their needs to
the best of their ability. [speaker change] Follow-up? [speaker change]
Does the gentleman yield? [speaker change] I do. [speaker change]
Gentleman yields. [speaker change] By that means, I mean, why not have
to ask their employer if they're able to pay this? It's the same
principle to me as asking in the military, you're asking their employer,
their supervisor if they're gonna be able to handle this kind of debt.
And obviously we know that this is going to be debt that a lot of people
can't handle. Why would we not ask an employer then, is your employee
able to handle this kind of debt? [speaker change] That's an interesting
question. A civilian working for whatever company can quit anytime they
want to. A soldier, marine, airman, coast guard person, they don't have
that option. There are other considerations when you're in the military
and you're preparing for deployment. Things that folks have to do.</p>

soldiers have to do that civilians don’t have to do because they’re not
deploying off to a combat zone somewhere, and one of those things is the
chain in command helps those individuals make sure that their financial
affairs are in fact in order. They’re provided financial counseling.
Another thing is wills, powers of attorney. It’s the military’s
responsibility to make sure that the military members prepare to go
overseas in the event that something happens when they’re overseas, that
their prepared for. Storage of automobiles – the military gets involved
in that. If you’re a civilian, you want to take a vacation for six
months, there’s nobody to care about your car except you, so there are a
number of, in my mind, key distinctions between military service and the
general civilian public which… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER

the gentleman will yield until the discussion between the two members

believe that that would be… Well actually I can answer that, yes,

and members of the House. I know this is third reading and we had a vote
on this yesterday, but I did vote no and both times, this year and last
session, I came in and thought maybe I might just vote for this, and I
ended up not, mainly because I just didn’t feel right about it. I like
to feel good about my votes and I don’t know, but maybe this happens to
you, but this is a vote that if you’ll remember two years ago a member
changed his vote two weeks later on, so this is an issue that can sit
with you whether you voted right or not, but someone asked me why I
didn’t vote for it, and part of it is because the firm I’m with does a
lot of bankruptcy, so I see debtors and creditors a lot. Now I don’t do
much consumer. We have people that do a lot of consumer. I do a lot of
trustee work, so I help pick up the pieces and pay the creditors, and
I’ve just seen a lot of people who get trapped in debt. Also it’s
because of a military background, and I didn’t command a company, but I
was a Battalion S1 in Korea, meaning I was the Battalion Commander, the
Colonel’s right hand person. I could sign papers for the Commander that
had the force of order, and we had… In the military you’ve got two
overriding concerns: accomplish the mission, take care of the troops,
and sometimes those intertwine, and I cannot tell you how difficult it
was dealing with problems of the service members. We’d have… we had a
ville outside, and we’d meet with club owners and we’d tell them “Please
don’t give our men credit,” and yet payday they’d come around wanting us
to collect the money for them, among other problems with the ville, and
I’d seen these men and they’re great soldiers. They’ll be somebody who
might get drunk and beat somebody up Friday night, but he’ll be busting
his tail to help his unit accomplish its mission during the week.
They’re heart and soul, but many times the E1s and E4s and maybe even
above don’t use good judgment, and it is a constant headache for
commanders to try to keep their soldiers in line and keep their personal
problems – financial, family – from interfering with that overriding
accomplishing the mission, and these kinds of things do get in the way,
and I have mixed emotion because I think there’s times when these loans
might be the only way someone can go, but I still just don’t feel this
is good, and finally perhaps an overriding reason is we’re told that
well costs have gone up and this hasn’t changed in 30 years, but 30
years ago the cost of lenders for their funds</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Representative Hanes please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I just want to, reference my comments.  First by
saying that I have certainly worked with Representative Szoka on a bill
earlier this year I sat on the banking committee.  I respect the work
that the bill sponsors have done on this bill.  I'd also like to say
that consumer lending and finance companies are certainly legal and they
are legitimate business organizations.  They have a right to operate in
an ethical manner and I honor  their right to do so but I stand today to
say that I'm going to oppose this bill.  Two consumer advocacy groups
have taken a neutral stance on this bill in the last few days.  Well we
don't get to take neutral stands in here.  We have to vote red or green
and most of us walk and we answer for the votes that we take.  I believe
in my heart of hearts that this bill will place an unnecessary rate
burden on distressed families already struggling to make ends meet.
They'll allow  loans that would be packed with multiple expensive credit
products and these legitimate and legal business operations do have less
than a 6 percent default rate.  I don't think anybody can deny that.
Everything tells us that but they accomplish it by keeping their
audience captive by refinancing the loans over and over again and that
unfortunately  leads to a never ending cycle of debt for those people
who are already in highly volatile and sometimes generationally
distressed positions. Free markets, consumer choice, free choice, people
making their own decisions, I get all that.  I understand.  These
businesses while legal and legitimate and are certainly, pursue the
loans, the loans are certainly pursued by free choice are directly aimed
at individuals, many of whom I represent in my district and I  have seen
what can happen in these circumstances  and they are people who often
times that we in this chamber, this session, in a somewhat bipartisan
fashion, these are people who we just cut unemployment on.  We cut the
earned income tax credit on them.  We're denying Medicaid in some
instances and we cut pre-K enrollment so in a very  bipartisan fashion
we have reduced  poor people's ability to pay their bills and made it
more difficult for them to afford healthcare and afford to educate their
children and now we are supporting lenders with a substantial rate
increase.  It's legitimate.  It's legal.  I understand that and ?? will
certainly choose to use these lenders but I wonder if we are doing the
right thing with this bill and that is why I will be opposing it.  Thank
you.

Changes) &quot;The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.&quot;
(Speaker Changes) Mr. Speaker, members of the house, we debated this a
long time yesterday, and we learned of course that the so-called racial
justice act... Section five.  If it's repealed, a capital defendant
retains all of the rights which the state and federal constitutions
provide to ensure that the prosecutors, who selected a jury and who
sought a capital conviction, did not do so on the basis of race. That
the jury who hears his or her case is impartial, that the trial is free
from prejudicial error of all kind, and yet ninety percent of the
debate, from the opposition, assumed that that wasn't still the law. It
is. I saw a newspaper report today that said Quote &quot;the Racial
Justice Act, allows a defendant to prove that race infected his
case.&quot; Actually, they said &quot;their&quot;, bad grammar, but his
case. It doesn't. Other laws do that. I encourage you to vote again for
the bill. Get justice back into the death penalty scenario.(Speaker
Changes) &quot;Representative Jackson, please state your purpose.&quot;
(Speaker Changes) &quot;Send forth an amendment.&quot; (Speaker Changes)
&quot;The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk
will read.&quot;(Speaker Changes) &quot;Representative Jackson moves to
amend the bill on page one, lines eight through ten, by re-writing the
lines to read.&quot; (Speaker Changes) &quot;The gentleman is recognized
to debate the amendment.&quot; (Speaker Changes) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and Gentleman, yesterday, I ejected a third reading so that I
could prepare this amendment because I do support capital punishment.
But I am also, and proud, to have voted for the Racial Justice Act four
years ago. You can say how I voted four years ago but you cannot say
why. You don't know what was in my mind, nor do you know what was in my
heart. Many of us that voted for the Racial Justice Act, did not do so
because we wanted to see an end to the death penalty as stated yesterday
by proponents of this bill. We voted for the RJA because we wanted the
death penalty to be applied uniformly and without regard to race. Be it
the perpetrator, the victim, or an individual juror, race should play no
part in the process. Now you don't need my vote to pass this bill, so I
know what kind of support I'm gonna get from my amendment, but it's
important to let my constituents know why I voted the way I did on this
bill. I would absolutely vote for this bill should my amendment succeed.
My amendment would delete section five of the bill while allowing the
remainder to move forward in an effort to re-start capital punishment. I
agree that healthcare professionals, that choose to participate in a
state sanction punishment, shouldn't be at risk of professional
discipline. I certainly believe that lethal injection is a better more
humane alternative to the electric chair or gas chamber. This more
humane method requires the assistance of professionals, and so I support
it. But let me tell you why I think deleting section five will actually
result in capital punishment re-starting sooner, and why many of you as
proponents of the death penalty should support deleting this section.
Passage of section five will have the un-intentioned consequence of
giving one hundred and forty convicted murderers at least two additional
claims to litigate in state and federal courts. You heard Representative
Stam say that section five spells out all these rights that these people
already have, but by deleting section five your actually giving them two
additional claims based upon constitutional doctrines that were not
discussed on the floor yesterday. At least not in detail. The first is
equal protection. Judge Weeks has made decisions already in a few cases.
These cases are on appeal to the supreme court. Now we are going to come
behind him and say that the Racial Justice Act cannot be used by over
one hundred and forty other defendants. How do we tell other defendants,

edition against ex post facto, or retroactive laws.  And that's
something I was actually surprised not to hear about yesterday.  In the
United States, both Congress and the States are prohibited from passing
ex post facto laws by the US Constitution.  No criminals laws regarding
punishment may be retroactive.  When it comes to a criminal law or
punishment, you don't give someone a right, allow them to assert it, and
then take it away.  To do so, I believe, is a violation of the ex post
facto clause.  It certainly would raise the claim that would have to be
litigated in court for years to come. Which brings me to my final point.
 There's no fiscal not to this bill, and you should expect the high\t
cost of the passage of Section 5 of this bill, because you are gift
wrapping even more avenues for appeals for these murderers, and the
state is going to have to defend those cases, and those actions, and
maybe even pay their attorneys to prosecute them.  But regardless of the
cost.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To see if Representative Jackson would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentlemen yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Jackson, do you have any idea how much
the Racial Justice Act has already cost us in court costs in North
Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, if I could respond.  I looked at the
fiscal notes of Representative Collins, last night back in 2009 and it
was an indeterminate amount, and I don't have anything to add to that.
But regardless of the costs, like it or not, the Racial Justice Act gave
these 140 murderers an avenue of contesting their death sentences.  Now,
many of these claims are probably not legitimate or valid, and they're
probably going to be dismissed soon, when the Supreme Court makes this
pronouncement, or when some prosecutors actually start to make and
schedule motions to dismiss.  So where we are currently less than a year
from closing many, if not all of these claims, passage of Section 5 will
add new constitutional claims that will add many more years of
litigation in the state and federal courts.  It may sound
counter-intuitive to those of you who fought the Racial Justice Act
since its inception in 2009, but if you were actually for support of
restarting capital punishment anytime soon, then you shouldn't support
Section 5 of this bill.  It will add 5, 10 years more in the delay to
executing anyone.  Deleting Section 5, as my amendment does, is the only
way to truly way to restart capital punishment.  I would as for your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the amendment, and then to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, members of the House, at the conclusion of
my remarks, I'm going to do a motion to the table and I informed
Representative Jackson I'd do this after givings him a chance to explain
it.  The reason I do this is, of course, is that we've debated this
exact same issue an hour and a half yesterday, and this is the 5th time
we've debated this in the last 3 or 4 years.  And one thing that's not a
reason is the fact that when it was passed in 2009, the question was
called without allowing the minority leader even to speak on the bill,
if you can imagine that Representative Arp.  But I would like to address
these 2 claims.  First of all, ex post facto law doesn't apply.  we had
a very good memorandum from staff help hill, in the North Carolina
constitution, it's Article 1, Section 16, if you want to open your
books, if you have it there. Retrospective laws punishing acts committed
before the existence of such laws, and by then only declared criminal,
or oppressive or unjust, or incompatible with liberty, and therefore no
ex post facto law should be enacted.  Well, the reason I mention that is
the only person who can claim ex post fact on this would be the murderer
who committed the murder after 2009, but before Senate Bill 416.  That
would be an interesting case, but none of the people on death row are in
that category, or if they are, maybe it's one of them.  Secondly, equal
protection, this is interesting.  Just because Judge Weeks applied facts
many of which could be asserted without the Racial Justice Act, but he
shoe horned it into the Racial Justice Act, I think he thought we were
kidding with the 2012 law.  Just because he picks out 4 out of a queue
of 154, therefor you have to apply to all of 150 others that same law,
well that would constitute Judge Weeks the law giver of North Carolina.
If you want to apply equal protection to that claim, you would apply it
the other way, and get his 4 people back in the queue.  So I think we've
debated this at great length, it's a serious subject it, needs to be
debated at great length, and we've done that, so therefor Mr. Speaker, I
move the table the</p>

The motion by Representative Stam has been duly seconded by

upon the table the amendment set forth by Representative Jackson to the
House Committee substitute for Senate bill 306. All in favor vote 'Aye.
All opposed vote 'No'. The clerk will record the vote. The clerk ???

To debate the bill. [Speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill [Speaker changes]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I, too like Representative Jackson, believe in
the death penalty. I believe that certain crimes are so hideous and so
despicable that capital punishment is in order. But I also believe that
we in society, we the collective society, must be moral in administering
whatever judgment that we administer.  There's no question that all of
the instances that I listened to yesterday in terms of perpetrators of
hideous crimes deserve the death penalty. I don't feel sorry for any of
them.  But my problem, like that of Representative Jackson is with
Section 5 -  how we go about our jury selection. Yes, I wish we had
another bill, and perhaps someday we'll get one.  This is what Judge
Weets??? was alluding to.
In our society, we have to and we should, if we're going to stick with
our moral fortitude, do it the right way.  We all want justice. We all
want to see criminals who commit despicable crimes receive justice for
their immoral acts. But you know, District Attorneys that we saw
yesterday, and I will say also defense attorneys, are given liberal
latitude when it comes to recusals or strikes in jury selection. And
that's a problem. We all admit that that's a problem.
We shouldn't want it either way, for the DAs or for the defense. We
ought to respect our citizens' rights to serve as jurors. I understand
that there are needs. There are needs at times for strikes, but these
strikes should not be arbitrary or capricious, or in some instances,
immoral strikes. Let's do it the right way. And we can, as legistators,
do it the right way.
If we could fix this section 5, you have my unequivocal support for the
death penalty. I don't think we need to confuse the two. Let us do the
right thing. And until we can do the right thing, I have to vote no.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. I had intended on making some remarks yesterday

certainly understand and respect Representative Daughtry's remarks
yesterday, and can certainly relate to Representative Michaux's
sentiments regarding his experience as an attorney in our state.  As a
former Assistant District Attorney in six different counties spread
across two prosecutorial districts, I believe we have good district
attorneys in our state. I believe that</p>

By and large most of them are good, and fair, and try to dispense
justice in a neutral fashion. But just like over the years, this body
who, by and large, have been filled with good members who follow the law
and do things the right way, from time to time we've had members here
who didn't follow the law, and didn't do things how they should have.
There's no difference in any other aspect of society. Now, we all are
moved by the stories that we heard from Representative Moore and Dollar
yesterday; acts so heinous that they almost are unimaginable. Now, the
Racial Justice Act is not designed to overturn the jury's decision
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the gentleman yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Baskerville, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Baskerville, is the gentleman familiar
with the notion of Motions for Appropriate Relief?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the gentleman aware that a Motion for Appropriate
Relief can be filed and is filed before the existence of and exclusive
of the Racial Justice Act to address exactly the kinds of questions that
the gentleman is speaking of?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm aware that individuals can file Motions for
Appropriate Relief in very limited circumstances. The avenues to file
the motions were just limited last session, I believe. I am not aware of
a Motion for Appropriate Relief that allows individuals to look at their
jury selection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One additional question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the gentleman aware that under the Motion for
Appropriate Relief Statute that one of the grounds upon which that a
defendant may assert is prejudicial error?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am aware that yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Once again, RGA, RJA is not
designed to overturn the jury's decision regarding guilty or not guilty.
The RJA is designed to ensure a fair, equal treatment in jury selection
process. Now any trial lawyer worth their salt is gonna tell you how
critical jury selection is. It's perhaps the most critical juncture in a
jury trial. Those are the twelve people that are gonna listen to your
side, and listen to the other side, and render their decision. Selecting
the twelve people that are gonna decide guilty or not guilty, that's a
critical juncture in the proceedings. The RJA provides the vehicle to
ensure that that selection process was executed properly. That's why
when I hear stories recounting the heinous, horrible crimes that occur,
or stories that detail a racially equal jury, six blacks and six whites,
I respect those stories, but the RJA does not mandate you have to have
black folks on the jury, the RJA does not mandate that you have to have
equal blacks and whites on the jury. The RJA is a process that allows,
to make sure that that selection was done without imparti- with
impartiality, and not done in a discriminatory fashion. It does not
prohibit executions, just like my other colleagues, if the RJA would
prohibit executions in this state, I would not be able to support it,
'cause there are certain aggravated crimes that are so reprehensible,
that person has made it clear that they do not want to participate in
civilized society anymore, and they've got to go. And I support that.
But I also don't see a problem when we hear stories about white folks
availing themselves of the protection of the RJA. The RJA is for to
eliminate racial discrimination in jury selection regardless of whether
its a black person or a white person. I think it's a great idea that
white North Carolinians, black North Carolinians, Hispanic North
Carolinians, all of them are gonna be entitled to a jury that was
selected properly. I wonder if we had a bill that said only black folks
could avail themselves of the protection of the RJA, would that pass
this house? Of course it wouldn't. That's a completely specious
argument. I wonder what the proponents of
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?

[SPEAKER CHANGES} Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} To see if the gentleman would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} And Representative Baskerville, on your same argument,
how do you feel about discrimination based on gender?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} How do I feel about discrimination based on gender?  I
think it's a bad thing.  I don't think we ought to discriminate based on
gender.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Do you know how many women are on death row as
compared to men?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} I would imagine it's less women on death row as men on
death row.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Does the lady wish to ask another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} And would it be substantially less women than there
are men?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} I would, I don't know the answer to that but I'm
willing to venture the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} One last follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} So based on that, statistically don't we have gender
bias on death row?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Once again, once again Representative Stevens, I
appreciate your question.  The issue is not who is on death row, whether
they're male or female, whether they're black or white.  The issue is
the selection of the jurors. I mean I think we're getting off tangent
here.  I don't think we ought to discriminate against women, I don't
think we ought to discriminate against anybody when we're selecting the
12 people who are going to decide whether someone lives or dies.  There
is no rectifying a situation after you pull that switch. So I think
that's the wrong argument. If there was a bill that said that, I just
think that's not the issue here with the Racial Justice Act. Justice.
The Establishment. Or determination of rights according to the rules of
law and equity.  Justice.  We heard a lot about justice yesterday.  The
rule of law says there shall be no discrimination in the jury selection
process.  RJA allows that those rights are protected.  The rules of
equity ensure that victims of crimes, they know that our government, the
prosecutors, will protect their interests and pursue those responsible
individuals in a legal fashion. It's not just justice for the victims.
It's not just justice for the criminals.  It's justice for all. I think
that the RJA is a just bill and ask that you all vote against this
particular bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Representative Richardson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I would like to ask a question
of Representative Stams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Representative Stevens?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Stams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Reprentative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Yes. I'm sorry.  I think he is one of the sponsors of
this bill and that's why I'm directing this question to him.  As a
freshman
[SPEAKER CHANGES} The Chair assumes the gentleman yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} As a freshman naturally I do not have the history of
the RJA and the issues surrounding the passing of it.  But in Committee
meetings we were presented with information and quote evidence as the
reason why we have RJA and it was because it was proven that
discrimination was been done in jury selection. So when I lay down at
night I think about this bill and I think about the fact that we have a
bill and now we want to repeal the bill and I wonder what kind of impact
does that have on me as a voter here in this body that because the bill
may be written badly or because people don't like the bill we want to
repeal the bill.  So what kind of consequences do I as a voter have to
face based on whether or not this bill passes today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Thank you for your question Representative.  You heard
a speech by Representative Glazier and you thought it was evidence but
Representative Glazier is an advocate.  For example he gave you a
Michigan State survey.  I went to Michigan State.  School of Criminal
Justice. And I had little juvenile delinquents that I took care of as
part of an, and you may sit down if you want to, as part of an
independent study.  Thank you for the  opportunity. And this was in 1971
and 1972 and I guarantee you that every one of them thought that the
death penalty for murder was that you got the electric chair.</p>

Speaker: Because they watch, what is that FER Show? [ Drag Me Up?]
Speaker changes: You know what Michigan has not had the death penalty
since it was a territory in 1843.The deterrent factor of the death
penalty is not what you have in the books but what actually happens .Now
if you think that some professor at Michigan State University is going
to get in here when the public policy of the State of Michigan is
opposed to capital punishment for almost two hundred years, he is doing
a rational study, you are not thinking the way universities think. There
were so many problems with that study that was cited as evidence and the
biggest problem was this. They compared murder versus murder but not
with the same aggravating circumstances. In other words, only..  you
have to almost volunteer to be executed, or else kill six people, or
slice people up; but that study did not adequately take into account
aggravating circumstances; in other words you heard evidence but you
didn’t hear the cross-examination.
Speaker changes: Now, you can follow up.
Speaker changes: Have an answer for Germanio?
Speaker changes: Yes. I do.
Speaker changes:  Germanio.
Speaker changed : Excuse me for up and downing, somebody says stand up
and somebody else says sit down, but also I am still not sure that my
question was answered; because I thought there was a case and maybe I
misunderstood that have been taken to court that some evidence would
come out of that ; am I  incorrect on that.
Speaker changes: Yeah Yes. Robinson case, Judge Weeks, one judge found
that they were then prejudiced and in other cases in North Carolina , in
other places, other years, other decades, other cases, then in
Robinson’s case, where there were three minority people on the jury
which at that time was roughly proportional  to the population in xxx
county, we decided that therefore Mr. Robinson was discriminated
against; but that’s not what the law should be, the law should be
whether Mr. Robinson was discriminated against not whether other people
had been discriminated against in other cases.
Speaker changes: Can follow up
Speaker changes: Mrs. Germanio,
Speaker changes: Yes, I do
Speaker changes: Germanio .
Speaker changes: So this is the law that we are repealing. My question
again is, as a legislature, and we vote to repeal that law, what
consequences will this body face by doing away with a law that was a
law, to make..
Speaker changes: As far as I know, it’s been four hundred and fifty
years since the legislature was actually punished for its legislative
acts. So, no, you can’t be punished for anything you do here; except you
can be unelected.
Speaker changes: Thank you.
Speaker changes: Representative Stevens, please take your papers.
Speaker changes: See if you.. Representative more, you have a question.
Speaker changes: Representative More, it’s Germanio.Germanio.
Speaker changes: And Mr, Representative More you heard me ask the
question about the differences on the death row?
Speaker changes: I did. Yes.
Speaker changes: And Representative More, did you enquire and see how,
what the general make up was? on the death row?.
Speaker changes: I did.[xxx/]
Speaker changes:  I was taken to[ Provenant?] Corrections, there were
presently a hundred and fifty six people on death row, a hundred fifty
two were men, four were women.
Speaker changes: One last question.
Speaker changes: Yes.
Speaker changes: Germanio.
Speaker changes: Representative More, are you aware that anyone  xx
bring in an issue of general discrimination?
Speaker changes: No one.   The same with the whole concept of this bill
no one has, I think if you .. if you take some of the arguments used for
the RJA, just working up wrong numbers and nothing else. You would have
come to a conclusion that their agenda just as it is based on the
numbers are wrong, I think it is not wise  to floor in this bill and
excuse me , there is no necessity for this bill to roll over back.
Speaker changes: Representative   please take your papers.
Speaker changes: To debate  the bill very briefly.
Speaker changes:    xxx to debate the bill.
Speaker changes: Thank you very much Mr. Speaker, I have had my say on
the bill yesterday and don’t  want to abuse the body again today, but I
did rise to answer a couple of questions because they weren’t answered
;they were raised and it is such an important bill, I think at least

<p id="090:00">
ought to be available to people. First, I wasn't planning to address
this but since the last go-round of questions I agree completely with
Representative Stevens and Representative Moore on the data. Of course
that's like comparing apples and oranges and suggesting they come from
the same tree. I mean in the end the question is how many women are on
death row versus how many murderers there are versus how many men versus
how many murderers so sex discrimination may or may not be there but it
has nothing to do with this and we're not even comparing the correct
data.  But that being said I'll move past gender discrimination which by
the way is also unconstitutional and we know that from Supreme Court
decisions. The issue that was interesting was raised by Representative
Jordan yesterday. Representative Jordan asked the question and I think
it deserves a really full response as to why Judge Weeks looked at and
found race discrimination in jury selection in the Waters case when the
Waters jury had six African Americans on the jury and six white members
of the jury at least at that appears to be based on the record. Well I
think there are a couple of answers. First, the Supreme Court has made
it very clear as Representative Jackson and Baskerville and Michaux have
said, that racially motivated exclusion of even one juror is
unconstitutional. Atson said that. And so whether it's one or it's ten
doesn't really matter.  That violates the law. But in the Waters case
there really is a much more interesting answer and since it's from my
home county I actually wasn't sure of it but I went back and read the
record last night.  The prosecutors and Waters struck 10 of the 19
eligible African American jurors.  That is they made their discretionary
challenges to ten. That's 52.6% of them. They struck only 4 of the 26
white jurors who were potential for a strike rate of 15%.  Secondly,
they excluded many of those African American jurors but they couldn't
exclude them all because the prosecutor ran out of challenges and some
of the additional jurors who got on the jury because she had no more
challenges to exercise were black and if she could have struck them she
might would have. But she couldn't because she ran out of challenges.
The interesting third part of this is if you go read the judge's
findings and then the record in this case the judge found that the
reasons that that prosecutor in that case struck 10 of those 19 African
American jurors were so &quot;transparently pretextual&quot; that he
found she came close to finding she perjured herself on the witness
stand.  And just for the record let me tell you three things that came
out and this is of many findings.  So the State struck black ?? member
Jake Whitfield &quot;because in part he knew some gang guys from playing
basketball.&quot;  The record showed that that juror had potential
limited contact with certain individuals during a pick up game and he
overheard them talking about potential gang activity. He was asked by
the prosecutor would that  affect his decision and he said that that
exposure wasn't going to affect him at all but the State struck him.
However, they didn't strike a non-black jury member named Tammy Johnson
who'd gone through basic training and become &quot;good friends&quot;
with a gang member and also testified she knew people in high school who
were in gangs. That was one example said the judge.  Second example,
said the judge, the State submitted an affidavit asserting that in this
case the prosecutor struck a black juror Ellen Gardner because her
brother had been convicted of drug charges and received five years house
arrest. And by the way, that's a legitimate reason to strike a juror. I
mean in and of itself. The problem of course is, said the Court, that
her explanation that that's why she struck the juror was implausible for
a couple of reasons.  One, the transcript revealed that Gardner wasn't
close to her brother, that she testified that she believed he'd been
treated fairly by the system and that her experience wouldn't affect
jury service. Okay, you may or may not believe her. Her brother's
experience was six years before jury selection. Well, that may or may
not be sufficient. But here's the problem.  The prosecutor then went on
and accepted a non-black, a white jury member, Amelia Smith, whose
brother was then at the moment she testified in jail for first degree
murder.</p>

she was talked with her brother through letters, you don't explain that.
and finally, this is again to several examples, the state struck lack in
our number. Calvin Smith because he was seventy four years of age. this
right, but in other cases tried in nearly the same county same area upon
by the same prosecutor. she accepted white jurors were seventy seventy
and seventy three years old. either there's a difference between seventy
three seventy four. I appreciate each year at my age that one year, but
those are what were talking about. those are transparently pre textual
reasons for strikes. I don't know. I was the judge decided this, but he
found that among many others were so obviously a based on the sheets
that you, the prosecutor had her she was checking on using anything she
could to get black jurors off the bat violated the Constitution. our job
here is to say whether he was right or wrong, whether she was in our job
is also not to cut off the process
of another close my comments am with a very personal, and I take this
accurate personally because I don't think it was, and I've never said it
was written in the best way and I am a pretty deep believer like
represented Jackson actually in capital punishment. I would have had no
problem voting for the death penalty for every single defendant, at the
Nuremberg trials, and I wouldn't have any problem voting a lot of
egregious cases, but I also probably know more than anyone in this
floor, having been appointed by the court to defend defendants in a
capital cases and eight on appeal sometimes we get it right. sometimes
we get it wrong. I said this, my caucus and in our committee, I know
some of these prosecutors. some of them are good friends and they in
many cases, no race-based owns in my view, and thereby
but they also were a product of their culture and their training and
their time. I'm a product of my culture and training. I grew up and my
mom grew up in a very white area, Pennsylvania and I love you very much
twenty five years ago, but my mom grew up teaching me when I was a kid,
I was allowed to go in the swimming pool. the black person was in that
pool
should be a long time to realize as a kid, a wrong, my mom wants to
never stop loving her. she's wrong and I had to face that include
passive and the prosecutors you make the stripes are good people, but
they were wrong
and we have to would knowledge that, and then try to make sure that we
get better. we can not ignored by throwing away the racial Justice act

Now the person that did all that.  When it come to trial.  He plead
guilty.  So he was found guilty.  The only...the trial was the
punishment phase whether he would get the death penalty or not.  He did
get the death penalty and he's on death row now. Now he was officially
listed as an American Indian.  But I don't believe that jury found him
guilty because of his race.  I think that jury found him guilty because
he was a hard-working deputy sheriff out trying to do his duty.  Because
he committed the crime and he deserved that punishment.  I don't think
any law is fair whether it was passed last week, today, or next week,
that allows anyone to cite statistics, state-wide statistics, in their
appeal.  if something was done wrong in that trial, it should serve on
its merits and it should be investigated and if a District Attorney or a
judge or somebody did something wrong in that particular trial, that's
fine.  They should have to stand for that and the right should be made
wrong. But the use of state-wide statistics, to overturn or to look at
some of these convictions, in my mind, is totally wrong and it will
never be right no matter what anyone says. Thank you.

First of all let me say that, to Representative Jackson, that I
empathize with you extremely and I would never try to define what your
motives are in anything.  But welcome to my world. I can't tell you how
many times in the last three years I've had people from the other side
of the aisle tell me what a horrible person I am because they can read
my mind, tell exactly why I'm voting for a bill.  So I have great
empathy for you on that.  I would never try to tell anybody what their
motives are because I simply am not a mind reader.  I've never been good
at it, don't claim to be.  I do know that I and most people on my side
of this issue believe that the racial justice act, regardless of what
the intent was, has basically been a de facto moratorium on the death
penalty.  I didn't realize though that the public on the other side of
this issue also feels that way until I began to get an email earlier
this week.  The very same one, at least five times, and it's only two
lines long and my response is only three lines long so I'd like to read
it to you.  That email says, &quot;Dear Representative Collins, please
vote against S306.  The bill will amend the capital punishment law and
will effectively re-instate the death penalty in North Carolina.  I
believe that capital punishment is wrong and I urge you to oppose this
legislation.&quot;  My response was, &quot; I agree that the bill with
re-institute the death penalty and thank you for your honesty on this
matter. Most proponents of the so-called racial justice act will not
admit that is is in fact a moratorium on the death penalty.  For my part
I believe the death penalty is reasonable justice for those who wantonly
take innocent human life so I plan to vote for this bill.&quot;  I would
encourage you to do likewise so that we can relieve our state from this
de facto moratorium on the death penalty.

you may be recognizing.  We had this bill last session and we passed it
out of here pretty easily over to the Senate.  It did not pass in the
Senate and they spent the time between then and now working with the
various parties who had concerns about this bill and created a bill that
actually, by the time it passed the Senate, landed in banking, had been
amended slightly in banking, not only did it receive no negative votes

of these railroad limbo ordeals. But they want to make a rail trail out
of it, but they want to keep it so that if they ever want to go back to
using it, they can go back to using it. All the businesses and
industries that the rail line used to serve are kaput, gone. It’s a way
for people to get from Belmont Abbey College, which is on the east side
of Highway 74 and 85, I might add, back over to town and they can build

much of the calendar as we can tomorrow; we’re not quite sure how long
it will go. It will not go any longer than 3 p.m. But we will begin at
noon. At the current time it is possible but not probable that we will
not have a session on Friday. I did say that it is possible, but not
probable. We should be able to report to either later today, first thing
in the morning.  If we do have session on Friday, it will be from
probably 10 p.m. to noon.  The appropriations committee intends to meet
I think on Saturday, maybe Saturday morning, but certainly Friday
morning.  And later Friday afternoon.  Notice this is announcements
Representative Dollar please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The Gentlemen has been recognized for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]This is for everyone that is on appropriations, just
try to clarify where we are.  The Subcommittees will be meeting at 8:30
on Friday morning.  8:30 on Friday morning and the Subcommittees Chairs
will be presenting the Subcommittees packages staff will roll out in the
various areas. If there is a session at 10 o’clock, then obviously the
Subcommittees will break at that time.  Through the session, after the
session Subcommittees will reconvene. Some Subcommittees always move
faster than others, so it will be at the direction obviously of the
Subcommittees Chairs. There will be opportunity obviously to purpose
amendments to the Subcommittee package, to have votes on those
amendments and then to the Subcommittees to vote out their packages.
So, basically what we had hoped to get to tomorrow. We going through the
budget, trying to make sure we got all of our T’s crossed and I’s
dotted. We feel confident that we will be ready. Subcommittees feel
confident that they will be ready Friday morning to conduct those
meetings.  That is what we anticipate. If you are on a Subcommittee
obviously watch your e-mails for the notices that you will receive from
your Subcommittees Chairs.  Next week, just to give you a little bit of
a preview. We anticipate the full appropriations committee on Tuesday.
Everything will run with the same rules that we run with, and the rules
that are reflected in the Rules of the House.  And, hope to have the
budget bill on the floor of the House next Wednesday and Thursday for
action by the body.  And, if anybody has any questions, come ask me
later and I will be happy to talk to your.
