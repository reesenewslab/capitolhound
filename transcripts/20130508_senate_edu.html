I might scold others and thus However what i says is student who can
make the sessions according to that ?? machine and that can controls
internal affairs of the organisation according to that od system.  I
think its a very common sense something that seems like ??  to the one
stoody groups having with that  that is favoubly with the truth i
conclude that  and so that is the impression it goes trying to clarify
that i to see is the that i see discrepancy in understand between the
looks and then continue to have the compensations with the students and
with the the leadership in the  universities to work towards the
resolution this narrow and everyone wants the students to be protected
to organise according to the beliefs as i support.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Audio Starts
1st Speaker:
University ???? administration can you repeat the question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The question is how is this statue differ from current
practices for UNCE system universities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ??? groups to lead their on affairs that really the
??? upon us
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr, Brain
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I have 2 questions is this consistent with and this
maybe to Mr. Merit or the sponsor is this consistent with current anti-
discrimination policies that the campuses have already. Is there some
inconsistency which maybe ??? be good to what is it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Anyone want to tackle that staff for Drew.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can follow up my assumption is this would come up
where as campus would say you can's discriminate against x groups
whether its gays, lesbians, or some immigrants, far students i don't
know what it might be and there might be some group whose mission would
be not have those people in their group   is that where conflict comes
up and if so how do we currently address that and if not than somebody
can correct me on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff you want to tackle that
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Again its a campus by campus policy, so we have to go
trough each campuses policy on how they adress student groups and the
membership and leadership of those groups.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One more follow up Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow Up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff is there any case law federal or case law on
this kind of issue where people have brought lawsuits about who can be
in the group and what is  the status of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff you happen to know that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There was a Supreme Court case couple years ago in
2010 that involved the University of California Hastings Law School,
they had what its called an all comers policy which said that groups in
order to get official recognition could not discriminate or require any
member of their group to sign a belief statement. They were challenged
by group on campus who wanted to have members of their group sign a
belief statement and the Supreme Court said that it was permissible for
the university to have an all comers policy but that was whether or not
they could have one, it doesn't address this specific issue whether the
university could say in fact it's okay we we grant official recognition
if you choose to it the other way . So this didn't precisely address
this issue but it's the only Supreme Court case we know that's close to
this issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. i am going to move to another member
Senator Bryant, but we may come back to you. Senator Rabin
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just would like to put a comment on the bill in
favor of it. I can's think of a better way to develop our young people
in schools than they have this demonstrated ability for self
determination in front of them so they can go ahead and learn the
processes that we are supposed to participating in this body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] i will take one more question. ???? Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks Mr. Chair. I am trying to understand it in
terms of how various campuses have handled this and MAYBE ITS ME BUT IT
SEEMS LITTLE VAGUE  AND MAYBE COULD STAFF JUST SHARE some ranges or
examples of how different campuses have handled this considering that
this determined campus.
﻿﻿[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chairman i might comment on that quickly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] SENATOR Soucek it's your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One of the purposes of this is to create some guidance
and little uniformity because it can be done in lots of different
places, there are some campuses that have no issues and others that have
had some and i thought this was very reasonable of what ??? appears to
be and i wanted to clarify that so there is less confusion as to the
rights of the students do gather.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To begin, i am trying to understand, some campuses
take it may have no policy how have those who may have had issues arise
how have they dealt with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me make a comment there.  one of the problems that
brings this bill to the forefront is that they all have very
interpretations of what they want the policy to say but what we are
trying t do is make some..... End of Audio</p>

clarity about students who wish to organize in a civil manner and do
things according to the outline of their charter and so forth they would
be able to do that unless their stepping over bounds and were trying to
give some clarity to that issue which has no clarity right now.  There's
no state law at all and if you want some specifics I'll ask staff to see
if they can put some more light on that. That's why were doing the bill
Senator.  I see somebody in the back. Tammy your hands been up. I
thought you needed to go to the bathroom do you want to speak? I think
she may have an answer.   Name and your organization please
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Tammy Fitzgerald with the North Carolina Values Coalition.  We support
this bill.  The purpose of the bill is to guarantee that students dont
lose their first amendment rights to association to free speech and to
freedom of religion just because they step on to a university or
community college campus.  Universities and Community Colleges are
routinely promoting bigotry against Christian groups duly recognized on
their campuses by threatening to kick them off campus unless they
abandon their core beliefs this has happened. The first known violation
of this happened at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill in 2003
when UNC Chapel Hill threatened to ban inter varsity fellowship from
using campus facilities and strip them of university funding because
they chose to follow the basis of their religious beliefs. This threat
would have effectively banned the group from using campus facilities and
kick them off campus. Inter Varsity opened its membership to all faiths
and individuals but they reserved the right to select leadership on the
basis of an agreement with their religious mission and this bill would
accommodate that situation. There have been numerous other examples but
that's what started this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank You Tammy very much.  I'll take Senator Newton then Senator Allran
then were going to do what the motion says were going to take a motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank You Mr Chairman. Thank you senator Soucek for bringing this bill
forward I think it's going to be a really good addition to our state law
to clarify the situation on our campuses as is already been eluded to
the first amendment clearly gives us the right for assembly and it may
be an extreme example but I do believe that if you have a socialist
political student organization on campus they ought to have the right to
restrict their membership to keep out the right wing tea party folks and
I think it cuts both ways and I think this is an excellent bill it
applies to politics, it applies to general leadership it applies to
religion we can envision numerous circumstances where an overly
politically correct campus policy would infringe upon the first
amendment rights of students and I applaud your effort and I've made a
motion for favorable report and I thank you and I look forward to this
being passed into law
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you I got a motion from Senator Jenkins, Senator Newton and
Senator Allran for a favorable vote did you have a comment Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I do I have a question. Senator Soucek from the stand point of why you
put the bill in I definetely understand the need for it and support the
bill my question though is on line 12 when it talks about new
constituent institution that grants recognition.  Doesn't that mean
though that they woudln't have to grant recognition and then my other
question is what is granting recognition?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman may I respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Soucek
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
It's university policy on how who they grant organizations recognition
to. What recognition is it allows them to be on campus to receive
student funds for all the student organizations can get funds from that
they can use priority for facilities on campus they can use the campus
logo when promoting them. That's what campus recognition is and were
really looking at that. Were not disputing their decision making in
that. It's once its granted for the organization to actually be able to
exercise their beliefs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
so in other words
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
even if you didn't get that type of recognition you could still have the
group you just wouldn't get priority and place to be and funding and all
that
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
correct
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you very much Senators thank you very much guests and we will now
have a motion for vote</p>

couple of things wants up this is not advocating prior in schools and
students must initiate and lead this prior  and so the bill came before
me because medical schools bards education and somewhere else to claim
to met some policy about prior and that what this bll is about and that
what i became so intered in the ?? and senator Daniels ??? is unusual
true and clever he is and be issue d i couldn't answer him and i
certainly appreciate senator strengthen and his point of view ?? this is
just basically an opportunity for a group of students who wished  prior
get that opportunity and with that being said Mr chairman be hapy to try
to answer any question and ?? continue o debate senator ??,
Speaker Changes: i think we have gone further amendment senator ??,
Speaker Changes: thank you sir i think this is a really heated
legislation very good piece of legislation i certainly supported online
fourteen on page 1 it says slightly to mediate  i think we gotta
probably meditate publicly say meditate not mediate i think,
Speaker Changes: i thin medicate is not ??
Speaker Changes: it says mediate so you might want to change
Speaker Changes: ?? if we could ask staff i think there was a type of i
think there are indicating ??
Speaker Changes: without correction it will be made if it is approved on
without objection will do that thank you ,thank you member ??
Speaker Changes: A question for staff just to correct my understanding
that in many ways this legislation is ? of current new that ?? creating
new right does it elsewhere
Speaker Changes: the vast majority of the law is restating current law
the only think that would not be  current law or without effect current
case law would e with regard to student I'm sorry school employees
adopting respects for postures that's something ?? current case law
right now the majority of rest of it would be fairly reflective either
have guidance ?? has put out or other supreme court case law
Speaker Changes: follow up question to the bill sponsor so I'm looking
at 82 such an 82 on page 1 line 16 318 we have an assembly were student
are running for ?? office and everybody gives a two minute speech I'm i
right that you were intend because this the word say that somebody else
is allowed t go up there and pray for ?? two minutes because somebody
else is spoken for two minutes on the non legislative topic
Speaker Changes: which line ??
Speaker Changes: it's line 82 line 16 on page 81 says you are gonna
express legislative view points to the same extent under same
circumstances as the student is permitted to extend for view points on
non legislative topics so two minute speech ?? so two minute speech all
my thing thta could be a ?? and then their staff would have opinion on
that,
Speaker Changes: that would be correct and that would be consistent i
thin ?? as long as that is a neutral criteria that the students and the
school have not over like this before that students can speak whatever
in these legislative forms,
Speaker Changes:follow up question,
Speaker Changes:follow up,
Speaker Changes: student sections ?? to speak somebody on non religious
matters ?? on talking in matters so they are talking in class just
matters about how it saw a quadratic formula somebody else can stand up
and give two minute prior of that answer up to two minutes because they
are audibly pay to the same extend under same circumstances students

[Speaker changes.] ...student-initiated prayer can completely reverse a
negative turn of events in a public school.  Moreover, it can inspire
students who are struggling to new heights and better performance. It
can provide comfort and hope in a time of grief when students have lost
a fellow classmate or a beloved member of the faculty to death.
Unfortunately, however, some educators, many times out of ignorance,
sometimes out of base motives and certain outside groups intimidate
students into silence or inaction on matters of faith and practice.
They've either directly told them or given them the impression that
schools are supposed to be completely religion-free or God-free zones
but nothing could be further from the truth. The first amendment to the
Constitution, as you know, protects a student's religious freedom.
Students don't shed their constitutional rights when entering the school
house gate, and tho' teachers in a way are an extension of the state,
they don't lose their constitutional freedom of religion rights simply
because they are employees of the state. The legislation before you
today meets constitutional muster and it's within the parameter of US
Supreme Court rulings regarding students' religious expression.
Furthermore, there's nothing in the proposed initiative that should be
presumed as a teacher or faculty member endorsing a religious belief or
proselytizing, only demonstrating respect and free to acknowledge that
respect by posture when it's student led and initiated.  It is most
unfortunate that hostility to religious expression in the public square
has reached an all-time high in this country. And this legislation,
providing clarification, can help eliminate some of that aggression
while also emboldening both students and teachers not to be
unnecessarily alarmed or bullied into suppressing their expressions of
faith
[Speaker changes.] Thank you...thank you, Mark.
[Speaker changes.] Support the legislation.
[Speaker changes.] And I believe Tammy Fitzgerald, you have two minutes.
Tammy, time keeper will let you know when you're time is up.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman.  I'll be very brief. I'm
Tammy Fitzgerald with the North Carolina Values Coalition. Thank you for
enduring me twice in one committee. But we do support the bill with the
changes made by the PCS and the amendment and I know that this is a
problem that is occurring in our public schools. Senator Allran is
right. Teachers, principals, and administrators are confused about what
the rules are and this will just clarify the situation and allow them to
exercise their first amendment rights so we do urge you to support the
bill and I thank you, Senator Bingham, for bringing it forward. Thank
you very much.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Tammy. We'll come back to the members.
Senator Davis?
[Speaker changes.] Thanks, Mister Chair.  I do not believe this is an
endorsement but I do believe it's a much needed clarification and
therefore, I move for ????
[Speaker changes.] We already have a motion from Senator Cook. We'll
have another one from you, Senator Davis and I would ask the Senator
Stein.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chair.  I was wondering if a
representative from the school board association could speak to the bill
to see how that would effect their....
[Speaker changes.] Leeann's??????? back there...
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman, if I might, for a minute...go ahead
?????
[Speaker changes.] I have worked with Leeann and have agreed with some
of her comments and not agreed with others but...
[Speaker changes.] Let's let her make her comments, Senator...and then
you can rebut whatever you'd like.
[Speaker changes.] Leeann Winter??????
[Speaker changes.] Good morning, I'm Leeann Winter????? with the North
Carolina School Boards Association. We have worked with Senator Daniel
on the bill. We are fairly comfortable with most of the bill. There is
one section we are still taking a look at. And then, there is another
section dealing with the grievance section that I think Senator Daniel
and I are still talking about. Boards already have a process for
grievance procedures and we like to keep everything kind of consistent
and we have shared with him what that procedure looks like for most of
our school districts and I believe he is currently reviewing that. So we
hope that in...as this bill moves along that we can get that section of
the bill a little bit closer to what we are already doing but we are
continuing to look at some of...one other piece of the bill. So...thank
you.
[Speaker changes.] Just a quick follow up.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you. Follow up.
[Speaker changes.] What is the other piece...other than the grievance
piece? Do you know or are you just forgetting?
[Speaker changes.] The other piece of the bill that we are continuing to
look at is at the bottom of page two and top of page three, that
subsection B, where it talks about school personnel not being
prohibited.  We just wanna go back and look at....

The case law again to make sure that that language is as, as clean and
as by the line for school personnel as we can possibly get.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and we have to vacate this room for another meeting at eleven
o'clock. Senator Daniel, do you want to make a closing comment or
Senator Bingham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just, just one quick closing comment, just really for the benefit of the
committee is that we did take a hard look at this and studied it. With
the help of staff, we looked at statutes from five different states,
Tennessee, Virginia, South Carolina, Utah, and Texas. And so I think a
lot of work has gone into this and I appreciate staff's help in drafting
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for all who participated. I have a motion for a favorable
report. As to the PCS as amended, unfavorable to the original, all in
favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any opposed? Bill passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chairman and members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe, Senator Soucek, I believe that concludes our business for
today. Thank you.</p>
