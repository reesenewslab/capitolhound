  Speaker changes:Good morning we are finally going to call the meaning of
transportation join ?? we are probably trying to put this meeting in
half we re going  ?? good to see everyone this morning like to
acknowledged ??  from paging force we have mark ?? from Stanley county
?? Malcolm can you please stand and acknowledge from ?? Alexander so get
started with meeting this morning our transportation in brand new
options we going to hit persons today we are probably ?? today
department of transport ?? for the member&#39;s of the committee thank
you
Speaker changes:good morning thank you members of the chair friends of
the committee members of the committee ?? I&#39;m from north Carolina
department of transportation for the next 30 minutes i&#39; m gonna so
spend some time with the transportation reviews and giving  recap on
some information that you have herd and concentrate mainly on new ides
here is  quick outline that i gonna be talking bout this morning ?? and
ten yer time frame and i expect why  ten yer time frame is well also
keep sup the fees structure that we how we reallocate north Carolina and
we ?? i was asked to bout  brief update bout the electric vehicles north
Carolin ?? what are the states for we have doing in transportation
revenues funding options her is the brief recap i want to share with you
?? won this comes from state revenue and the one that comes from federal
revenues ?? in the federal funding over the last 2008 the federal tax
has not been ?? in the 2008 so therefore since they transverse from
where the ?? 905 and so you see there since 2008 ?? from the federal
government we do want it is bout 20 % of our total expenditures ??  of
north Carolina and the little ?? if you go back and couple the fact that
?? there is not  by congress are always hopeful but in the meantime the
meantime the ?? and started to look ?? revenue sides and i would like to
share bout what happened in the country here is the quick snap shot that
three  sources of revenue that we talk place ?? but these re effecting
columns that you see in there individual components that you make up
those revenues and the motorize tx is not the motor field tax rte  few
consumptions ?? and the number of transactions n the highway used tax ??
those are key variables

  Actually affected where those revenues have been and will be into the
future. Where do we get our sources on the rate? We get those, we look
at the US government. We put those up against global insight, which is a
private company that does forecasts for a lot of different variables
that are used in revenue forecasting and other forecast as well, and we
also have to be cognizant of the changes that happen in the policy here
in North Carolina in the General Assembly about gas tax rates. The DMV
fees I have mentioned before, they&#39;re set in statute and the
transactions we derived from historical regression analysis. We look at
historical changes and we also look at the population growth, because
those together are the ones that make the multiplier on which to apply
against the rate. The highway use tax is a little bit more complicated
because it&#39;s not just based on the rate but also it changes with
vehicle prices, and what do I mean by that? If you go back in time about
10 years ago and you just look at the type of vehicles that were out on
the road, those were your SUVs, your high end pickup trucks that were
costing about $45,000, but that has changed because of some economic
conditions that now we&#39;re a little bit more frugal about the amount
of money that we buy or spend on a car, so that certainly affects the
amount of revenue that&#39;s derived from the highway use tax, and on
the federal side we rely on the Congressional Budget Office to kinda
project what the revenues of the federal government are going to be into
the future. this is a historical perspective that if you look at
transportation, state transportation revenues over time going back to
2001, the color coding indicates the source of revenue. The blue down at
the bottom is motor fuel taxes, the green in the middle is the DMV fees
and the red is the highway use tax. You can see that over time this
kinda goes up from one year to another. You can see that there was kind
of big increase relatively speaking between 2006 and 2007 and that was
mainly driven by the changes that occurred in the DMV fees that occurred
in the 2005 session. Then you see a drop off that happened between
2007-2008 and more pronounced through 2009, and those were the impact
from the economic changes that we had when the economy tanked. We
gradually over the last seven years have started to rebuild those
revenues in total to where by 2014-2015 if you were to draw a horizontal
line it almost levels off with the amount of revenue that we had in
2007. So this is just a quick snapshot to say that sometimes
transportation revenues are slightly predictable but they can change and
they&#39;re very much tied into economic conditions. Now, the next slide
is basically the same as what I&#39;m showing here except that I have
gone and put a line through the middle of them and reorganized them to
kind of illustrate the amount of monies that get deposited into the
highway fund and into the highway trust fund, so although there&#39;s
been increases in transportation revenues during that time period, the
two funds that we have for carrying out transportation functions have
not increased equally. Sometimes the highway fund has been a benefactor
of the increases and sometimes it has not, and you will see this a
little bit more when I give you a snapshot into the 2 year time period
as to what has changed. Before I go into that what I&#39;d like to do is
give you a conversation or a backdrop of the, one of the sources or the
variables that we&#39;ve had, and that&#39;s the variable gas tax that
we have in North Carolina. It&#39;s been in place since the mid 1980s
and what this charge is depicting is the crude oil prices over time and
that is the line in red, and then you see a line in green and that is
tied into the y-axis of the chart that basically shows that it&#39;s
crude oil prices that we have no control over, those are driven by
market prices and world economies, geopolitical influences, that our gas
tax rate kinda really follows the changes in crude oil prices. It&#39;s
not perfect and that is because the way the gas tax rate is calculated
it&#39;s always in reaction to what crude oil prices were at one point
in time. I took the liberty on this chart to not take the gas tax rate
down to 0 and the reason why I didn&#39;t do that is that the gas tax
rate in the formulas up there in the lower right hand part of the chart
is that there is a minimum floor of 17.5 cents per gallon and that
doesn&#39;t change. The variability occurs on the 7%

  <p id="10:00">
  That is the one, that is what&#39;s illustrated in that green chart in
there. This is one of those challenges that we have in trying to predict
what crude oil prices are going to be. You have read in the newspaper
how crude oil prices have changed over the last six, seven months and
I&#39;ll illustrate that in the following chart. For my purposes and our
purposes of forecasting motor fuel tax, we have to look at the crude oil
prices. The questions that are lingering now is how low or at what price
is crude oil going to stay the line, how long is it going to stay at
that rate in terms of months and what is going the be the recovery, the
slope of that over time. I think it&#39;s, most experts account the
crude oil prices at the current rate of around $55-60 is unsustainable
because of countries having their economies based on crude oil prices
and let me show you what I mean by that. The line is blue is to
represent the January 2015 time period and you see the line at the top,
and that is what it was predicted that crude oil prices would be if we
go back to 2014. Nobody really thought that crude oil prices would
change, but it would be hovering at that $100 there. Well, if you move
forward 12 months to January 2015, we know what happened over the last
12 months, but now you see what it&#39;s going to be doing over the next
few years and I&#39;ll be the first one to admit that if I was to share
with you what is the February 2015 forecast it would look slightly
different than that. There&#39;s some level of unpredictability among
the experts as to what crude oil prices will be doing, and crude oil
prices has had a double effect. It&#39;s great for the consumer because
we&#39;re all paying less when we go for gasoline, but it also has an
impact on our motor fuel tax, right, as I&#39;ve shown in the previous
slide that it varies accordingly. This is a chart that I shared in House
with the NCDOT financial planning committee that we meet on a monthly
basis to kinda review what our financial situations are. I kinda
depicted in terms of arrows what would be happening with each one of the
variables that we look at, and you see there that on the motor fuel
taxes it&#39;s a downward arrow, the volume of motor fuel taxes is
slightly going up and you may wonder well, what is happening there. Why
do you show not a flat rate or a declining fuel consumption? Well,
what&#39;s happening is that as fuel prices at the pump have gone down
there&#39;s gonna be a slight, every so slight increase in fuel
consumption. We&#39;re talking about less than 1% on a yearly basis, but
it&#39;s very different than what we were expecting 12 months ago. We
were actually expecting a decrease of a couple percentage points.
I&#39;ve also included a column on the right hand side that says overall
you can see each one of the changes of the other sources of revenue and
the variables in there. On the highway use tax, you see that there&#39;s
an uptick in the volume depicted by the second column, and that&#39;s
basically to reflect that because we were not buying cars over the last
few years, a lot of us are starting to think differently about that.
That perhaps we feel more secure about the economy, fuel prices are
lower and therefore we&#39;re taking those cars that are now approaching
8-9 years and actually replacing them for newer vehicles than that, and
so that&#39;s driving that variable up. To put it in terms of numerical
values, if you were to look at the changes that occurred over 2015, we
were predicting a 7% decrease in 2016 and a 4% decrease in 2017 and
those were mainly driven by the decrease in the motor fuel tax, right?
If we move away from the 10 year time horizon to a 10 year time horizon,
this is the same chart that I shared with you a few moments ago, but
kind of giving you a depiction of what we expect to occur over the next
10 years. Why do we go out and do a 10 year time horizon for
forecasting. Well, as most of you know, a lot of our transportation
projects don&#39;t get accomplished within a state fiscal year or 2 year
time period. There are some larger capital projects for building roads
on new location, multi-lane facilities, they take 3-4 years to actually
build once the contract is awarded, so we have to be mindful that we can
be assured that we will have the necessary revenues in place to meet
those financial commitments that we&#39;ve offered ourselves for. Over
time, we have kind of simplified the way we speak to the public

  Right to the next slide. When I was looking at doing the comparison to
other states, this is what I did. And I apologize that in the
presentation that was put on the website, there were some mistakes that
got past us, and we were hoping to have this information updated through
January of 2015, and we neglected to change the North Carolina motor
fuel tax rate. So those numbers that are in red, those numbers that are
in error on the website file, have now been corrected and those changes
are highlighted in red and I will submit the corrected version.
If you look at North Carolina, and you assume the 37.5 cent gas tax
rate, and I have put the assumption which these calculations are based
on in the lower right hand corner in terms of the fuel efficiency of the
vehicle, the miles driven, which compare back to the AAA report, and
what the vehicle price would be in trade-in and ownership for terms of
calculating annual cost, you see that if you apply the motor fuel tax
rate, 37.5 cents, the motor fuel tax rate for North Carolina is only, is
$281.25. If you&#39;re curious as to what that amount is, once you
include federal gas tax, it&#39;s close, it&#39;s the number that&#39;s
on the website file, which is $419.25. If you go in and take the annual
cost of drivers license, which is $4, the title fee, what we&#39;ve
done, the fee is $40 but since we assume a fiver year ownership basis,
we spread that $40 over a five year time period, that&#39;s how we come
up with $8.  The annual vehicle registration fee is $28, there&#39;s
some other ones that get tacked on depending on where you live in the
state. The highway use tax is 3%, and it is, we do give credit for the
trade in and you see what the cost is. All of those numbers, added up
correctly, is $471, which you may say, well Burt, you showed in previous
slides it was 640. Well, if you conclude the federal gas tax of 18.4
cents per gallon, and use the same basis, and then adjust it for that 6%
that was in the previous slide in terms of other fees and civil penalty,
the calculation comes up to $645. Which I felt kind of validated the
work that the entry researchers did of quantifying it $640, or it&#39;s
very close to it. Does that answer, sir, your question?
And this is the comparison when we look at our neighboring state on each
one of those fees. You see that the gas tax rate, and Virginia and some
of our neighboring states there&#39;s differing range between gasoline
and diesel. In North Carolina, we do not have that. And in Georgia,
there&#39;s a surcharge of 4% that&#39;s on the sales tax basis. You see
all the different fees on an annualized basis, and you see the
comparative year-end annual cost of operating a vehicle of each one of
the neighboring states. So that just kind of gives us a perspective as
to how much are we paying, more or less, than some of our neighboring
states.
Let&#39;s move over a little bit about vehicle registration in North
Carolina. We have approximately about 8.8 million vehicles that are
registered. You see a break out between autos, trucks, trailers, and
others, which are motorcycles, RV&#39;s, buses, etc. But I was asked to
kind of look a little bit in terms of what we have in terms of electric
and hybrid vehicles. At the end of 2014, we have about 2,000 registered
electric vehicles in North Carolina, and about 40,000. If I was to go
and look, take a snapshot as to how many we had back to 2009, I&#39;ve
computed the annual increase, and those are shown on the table. And
you&#39;ve seen the global insight predictions into the future, as well
as the government projections into the future, that is the expected
annual increase over time, between now and 2020. So, although there was
a huge increase percentage-wise on an annual basis in the first few
years, once those technologies were developed, they&#39;re going to
taper off according to national projections. unfortunately we do not
have any state projections, so I&#39;ll have to rely on national
projections for how those are going to change in the future.
Let me now move a little bit into the national arena, and then move back
into the state arena. This is a chart that comes from the congressional
budget office that talks about how much money has been spent both at the
federal and state level on transportation, and that you see it has
changed

  <p id="25:00">
  Reached over time, however when you look at that same dollar amount and
you adjust it for GDP, the gross domestic product, the [??] of the
country it actually changes. This is a way of kind of equalizing those
revenues in terms of inflation or how much importance are we giving to
the amount of money that we&#39;re spending compared to the rest of the
spending that we have. So it&#39;s decreased, what it&#39;s leading up
to is that the growing need for transportation investment over time is,
has declined. When we take a look at other states, this is a chart that
I have used to kinda look at, what you see in there is all the different
multitude of types of transportation revenues other states across the
country are using. The high, the bigger the plot the more number of
states there are that are using that, and you can see a multitude of
them, the small little plot in there is indicative that there are very
few states that are actually using that. When you compare that against
North Carolina you can see that those are, the transportation fees that
we have in North Carolina are highlighted in red, so there&#39;s a lot
of fees out there that are not being used in our state that are being
used by other states to fund transportation revenue. This goes without
saying, states are seeking transportation funding finance. They&#39;re
looking at traditional sources, less traditional sources, and I make a
distinction between transportation revenue and what I call finance
solution which is basically where you go out and borrow. The revenue is
one that goes back over time and is recurring. On the, when you borrow
money it may be a one time infusion depending on how that vehicle&#39;s
structured. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a quick question just sort of as a
point. The general fund that you mention on here, how many states use
general funds to also aid in transportation revenues that you know of?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don&#39;t have a specific number off the top of my
head, but I can certainly get you that information because we do keep a
database on that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m just curious. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] On the chart you
show the comparison of other states to our state. When you have South
Carolina has [??] and Georgia for, then the fact that you, then you show
revenues, are they from highway, different rate of [??], show your
numbers so that that&#39;s not really the real picture of the comparison
that&#39;s between the states. There&#39;s a lot of stuff that&#39;s not
in that chart. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You are correct in the form of general
funds. In some cases those are revenues that are collected through sales
tax that are subject to the appropriation to be used for transportation
and they were not included in there, but we can certainly include all
sources. What we were trying to do is just compare the traditional
driver and vehicle fees associated with operating a vehicle. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any other questions. Representative [Blust?]. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To follow somewhat on Representative Bumgardner&#39;s question. I have a
neighboring county in [??] county and I&#39;m aware that in [??] states
the counties deal with this in many states, including South Carolina,
and they charge somewhere in probably property taxes and other taxes
within the county, they charge people and use those funds for what
we&#39;re doing. Is there any way to get a handle on by state, by county
or by neighboring county where people drive across the line to get their
gas because of this, because if they have to drive too far it&#39;s no
money, but anyway that they&#39;re getting gas 20 cents cheaper 100
yards down the road. So the point being that in that chart proves that
the sources within the state that may come actually to the county for
them to use for building roads. Is there any way to get a handle on that
so at least we can talk about comparison of apples to apples? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, sir, and you&#39;re totally correct. Different states
handle transportation funding in different ways. You certainly have
mentioned one, that property taxes are used in other states, but then
again the fiscal responsibility of the states varies as well, but we can
get you that information, and we did do a study a couple years back that
kinda also looked at

  What is the impact of a gas tax differential between our neighboring
states and how many people would drive across the line? We’ll be glad to
provide that and look at updating it as well because we are mindful
that, because of the price differential, we may be losing.
Unfortunately, the analysis that we did back some time ago was
predicated based on fuel price, the time and the distance that somebody
would drive in order to get the cheaper gas price. The data is probably
available if we were able to get the data from the retailers. If we
could go in to a gas station or credit card company and figure out
“Where is the billing zip code?”, then we could have a better number,
but we don’t have access to that data.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions from the committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We left off here making the distinction between the traditional
transportation revenue sources and the less traditional ones that states
are looking at and the difference between revenue and financing of
projects. This map is quickly to kind of give you an indication that
between 2013 and 2014 last ??(letive?) sessions, where were bills
actually introduced to ??(graze?) transportation revenue funding
sources, and there was a multitude of that. This next map is actually
where they were successful in passing each one of them. Rather than give
you the details of each one of them I have put together a full-page
summary that’s in your folder, on the website that details what happened
in what year in which state, and also gives you a perspective of the
amount of revenue in some cases that was collected on that. However,
that has not stopped folks from looking at 2015. These states that are
highlighted in red are basically states that are pursuing and actually
have bills that have been introduced to raise transportation revenues.
The majority of those states are in the form of gas taxes. I took the
liberty of adding North Carolina in there since we have a bill that is
under consideration right now that would look at changing the gas tax
formula that we have, and this is where you get a little but into
“should you include something or not?”, so I am just making a full
disclosure as to what those are in there. As I mentioned before, there’s
been a lot of studies both at the national level and the state level
that have gone out to quantify the ways of raising transportation
revenues; the federal ones you see at the top—the first two—are
basically results from the multi-year reauthorization bills. I did not
include a copy in your folder of those reports but we’ll be glad to
follow up and provide them for you if you wish. The reports that are
listed down at the bottom are the ones that have been done here in the
state within the last ten years. We have had several of them: the
twenty-first century commission; the McKenzie study that was done for
the department; the twenty forty plan. And at the national level I would
like to highlight this one: the ??(Ashta?) folks did a revenue options
for Congress. I don’t intend for you to look at the fine detail of that
font; a copy of that report has also been put in the folder for you to
take a look at. But what I do what to share with you is that, if you
look at the box in red, there’s five different lines in there, and those
are to represent the different revenue sources that are available for
federal funding. All those ones that are listed below are new ideas for
how to get federal transportation revenues. And like I said, a copy of
the report is in your folder that you can peruse and can actually read
that table there, but it just here for illustrative purposes. In the
twenty-first century commission, they basically had a goal to raise
about a billion dollars per year over a ten year time horizon, and this
is a listing of different transportation revenue options that they came
up with. Some of them you are probably very familiar with; I am not
going to try and go down that list for the sake of time unless you have
a specific question. The McKenzie report—this is the final outcome of
the report that they did, and what they went in and did is that they
looked at all types of revenue options. Some of them may not be very,
perhaps, correlated to transportation, but they did total recall or
total study of everything in there: you can see that they include a
vehicle property tax; a real estate property tax; they looked at
tolling. The bar chart in there was indicating the amount of revenue
that could be collected back in 2008 given a low, medium and high
scenario type of option. This is just for illustrative purposes.

  “[…]that the area absorbs, studying what type of transportation revenues
could be used has been ongoing for some time. Most recently, the 20/40
plan that was produced by the department as part of a Federal
requirement a couple years back also listed some additional ideas or
updated the amount of revenue that could be collected if all of these
different types of revenue sources would be implemented. The dollar
amounts that are shown in there are basically between 2015 and 2040, so
it’d be over a twenty-five year time horizon in there. And I can
certainly get you the details that underline all of the different
numbers that are shown up there. Which leads me to the last slide of the
presentation, that there had been two studies that had been done in the
last eighteen months. One was one that had been commissioned by the
Department of Transportation for the folks out at ACU. They produced a
report that looked at, “Do we have a transportation crisis in North
Carolina? Should we think about changing how we fund transportation?”
But what is maybe of interest to the community is they have several, I
think fifty or sixty pages, that they scoured the entire country and
looked at how are other states, how are other forms of governments—city
and county—how are they doing or what are they doing to raise
transportation revenue? Which is a wonderful source to go in there and
look at it. Some of them may not be applicable at the state level. They
have things like property taxes, they have things like impact fees, they
have a multitude of ideas, but it’s a great resource that you have
available and I have put a copy of that in your folder as well. And the
last point that I want to make is one that the report that I mentioned
earlier, that the North Carolina Chamber Commission agreed to do, and
they talk about the benefits of infrastructure investment. They looked
at the spending impacts, they did the annual driving expenses, which I
reviewed with you a little while ago. What I found of interest in there
is the last bullet—the criteria for ranking revenue options. In the past
we have looked at does a revenue option make sense in terms of what is
the yield that it could bring to the state, what is the annual cost to
the average user, the ease of collection. We’ve also included other
factors such as is it a revenue source that’s going to grow. And the
best that we could do once we identified that criteria was qualify
whether that was a good, bad, average, high, low—depending on when we
did an option for it. What the researchers at NC State did was that they
gave it a numerical value and ranked them numerically. And they chose
five or six different sources or topics to look at: sustainability,
growth into the future, social equality, a few others in there. And they
weighted them and then they kind of folded them into what I call a radar
chart. And so you see a scattergram that represents how each one of
those revenue options, how do they weigh within each one of those
criterias that we use to evaluate. And I think that was a fairly good
way of representing whether Idea A might be better than Idea B or better
than Idea D. So Mr. Chairman, those are all the thoughts that I have for
the Committee this morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. [??]. Any questions from the Committee
for Mr. [??] about his presentation?  Yes sir, attention.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just got a chart about
electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles. Do you have the natural gas
vehicle numbers?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I would have to go back, sir, and double check to see
if we actually have that breakout within our DMV database. I know that
was one thing that I had a struggle with when looking into the
projections into the future, because there are some national numbers
that have that. But if you allow me, I will go back and check on that
for you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Any other questions? Senator Rabon.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On the slide prior to this,
you did come forward with some suggestions and thank you, I think that
historically the department has done a little milk toast. They’ve come
over here with a hand full of “gimme” and a mouth full of “much obliged”
but never put anything out as the way to improve things.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I appreciate that, but on this slide you ask a
question. And the first question is, do we have a crisis? I’d like an
answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Who would like to answer that?

  Anyone in the audience like to respond to them?

If no one here wants to, yes we do
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up Bill?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes we do have a crisis, that we&#39;re looking at a 30 billion dollar
gap and up to 90 billion dollars to do what we need to do, that is a
crisis. Now it&#39;s time for people in this room to step up, it&#39;s
time for folk in the public to step up and let it be known to do what we
need to do.  Quit worrying about getting re-elected and fix the
transportation problems of this state, and if your not willing to do it,
lets put some folks in this committee that will.  That&#39;s the way I
see it passing.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Anything else Senator Rabin?
SPEAKER CHANGES
That&#39;s a wrap, but we do have a crisis.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Representative Bumgardner
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you Mr. Chairmen.  I did want to have an answer to the questions
on the screen and I appreciate Senator Rabin answering that.  If the DOT
could give us a short answer, just for our purposes right here, I&#39;d
be happy to hear it.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Lewis, do you want to respond to that?
SPEAKER CHANGES
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to answer that, I do however want
to call it a snow day.
SPEAKER CHANGES
We&#39;re gonna maybe tag team, if that&#39;s ok, the response here.
SPEAKER CHANGES
That&#39;s fine with me, you might a tag team on this one.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Let me address the questions that I posed on there about the recent
study on the entry.  Do we have a crisis? If you go back and look at the
reports that we have had over time, they basically say that needs that
we have today, whether they are meeting current capital needs, mobility,
getting people to places, the amount of money that we need for
maintaining the infrastructure that we currently have, the amount of
money that we need to invest in other modes of transportation beyond
highways. Is there a crisis there?  Yes, it has been quantified over
time.  I think where we failed in that part is that some of the numbers
that you hear about get lost.  The whole concept of billions gets lost
in that area, and that&#39;s my personal opinion on that.  The part
about the para-dime shift is we have, over time we have used a user
based fee. You use a system you pay for it.  Society has changed over
time, and now there may be, that para-dime shift might need to be
revisited, the way we collect revenues may need to be revisited and look
at other ways or other non-traditional sources of revenue.  What are the
best options?  They&#39;ve laid out a multitude of that.  What may have
worked in one state may not work in our state. You have different forms
of government and how they pay for transportation, it&#39;s different
from one state to another.  What are our next steps?  Exactly what we
are doing here, is basically making sure that everybody understands what
it is that needs to be done and what are the orders of magnitude that
are needed.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I can recognize Chairmen Torbett for the next question, but if you ask a
question, be sure to turn your microphones on at the table, we noticed
that some people weren&#39;t.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you Mr. Chairmen. In the feeling of mutual aid and respect to
Senator Rabin, I&#39;d like to concur with his previous statement and
just say that, do we have a crisis, well let me tell you what I hear.
Can we help the movement of goods and services from point A to point B
to increase the economic efficiency of our friends and business partners
of state? Yes we can.  Does it need to be addressed?  Yes it does.  Next
vote for small and large business.  Do we need to impact the day to day
travel of every North Carolinian out there that currently rides around
clogged roads and artery clog once you get off major highways and byways
of a state that hasn&#39;t kept up with their transportation needs
efficiently over the last decade?  My answer is, yes we do.  Do we need
to make sure that the roads we are currently driving on are free of pot
holes, and cracks, and splits, and bad painted lines you can&#39;t see
in the middle of the night that can lead to confusion when drivers are
on the road, to just better improve the quality and the output of what
we do in transportation for every North Carolinian out there?  My answer
is yes we can and yes we do.  We need to do something and I concur with
Senator Rabin&#39;s comments.

  Speaker1: Emphasize the very simple phrase transportation  is business.
As a developer and a commercial broker, I live ??finding transportation
that is critical not only to an individual business, but also to open up
a mass amount of additional, job creating industries in our state. I
think we sometimes like to take a little flash picture and say?? this is
so much further than ?? This goes to a long term economic strategy that
involves transportation ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any other questions or comments? ?? Like to
respond to any comments? Go ahead Mr. Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Bobby Lewis Chief of Staff MCTOD. I appreciate the
opportunity to awnser the question &quot; are we in a crisis?&quot;. I
dont know if this will be an exact awnser. Most of you who have talked
to me will probably say I never give you an exact awnser. The bottom
line we have a departmental policy that we have to look at when we
maintain and build roads. Certainly general assembly gas a policy of how
we allocate the resources, so we can wrap up policy. From my eyes what
we see when I look at highway know as many of you all know operations
and maintenance of highway trust fund plus aid,is like a capital
program. If you look at the two major things were faced with is: one,
how do we handle the capacity challenges this great state is facing.
We&#39;re the fourth ?? As everybody know. So that&#39;s population
growth. Capacity challenges mean how do we move traffic? What we&#39;re
trying to manage is peak load. Four to six hours a day, people are
sitting in traffing and people don&#39;t like that, especially in our
central part of North Carolina, which represents about twenty counties.
But, then there&#39;s also how do we get the connectivity piece, which
is still capital from here to yonder if you will. But, then we also, as
you&#39;ve heard many time before, we have a eighty thousand mile system
just about, and how do we maintain that? I drive seventy miles each way
everyday. Right now, I don&#39;t worry about the reliability of the
network. What I do know is motor fuel is taxed. You know the definition
of crisis is different with everybody, but we still want to be able able
to get up and know that we can get to work free of potholes, as
representative ?? said. And, free of congestion so that we can have a
reliable time. But what we ffaceif motor fuel tax goes down as we
predict is roughly six hundred in just motor fuels tax over the next two
years. Again I didn&#39;t say it is a crisis. Its what we&#39;re willing
to live with in North Carolina. Are er content with the way it is today
or do we want to continue and still contain that.  That&#39;s all my
comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well if there are no further questions. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Want to take of from what Chief of Staff Lewis says
and ??. He mentioned traditionally if someone uses a service you pay for
it. If someone drives to work their going to be driving fifteen thousand
average miles on the highway. We know their car can use sixteen gallons
or eight gallons to go a certain distance. They can get twenty miles a
gallon or one mile a gallon. They get twenty miles to get the $280
figure. I&#39;m not going to ?? A mile driven. There are going to be fee
associated with licences and all things. Maybe that is the parsdime
here. We go back to if you use a service you pay for it. Whether it
unolves ?? We&#39;ve talked about we&#39;ll just have to see about that.

record everything, we want everybody to record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair and Co-Chairs and members of the committee I’m Mike Holder,
I’m the Chief Engineer for NCDOT. My presentation today is a bit more
and Mr. ?? and the fact that I’m bit talking about potentially about
millions of dollars as opposed to billions but it actually will in
someway going nicely with Co-Chairman hours comments about what you use
to service you paid for because that is some of the things that we are
gonna discuss over the next few minutes. Section 34.17 in the last
year’s budget bill require the Board of Transportation the study fees
privatization and sponsorship opportunities to reduce public funds use
all the services provided by the department. We will require the report
to the JLTS by December 1st and report; we did submit that report and
today’s presentation will summarize the content of that report. The
first item that I want to talk about is fees, the report that was
submitted in December had a lot of information relative to fees, the
first category that I wanna discuss is what I’m calling “Development
Fees”, these are reviews, inspections, permits, and approvals that DOT
grants to commercial entities who wish to connect to our state road
system or when subdivision roads are proposed to be added to our highway
system these include, can include the Traffic Impact Analysis which is
one of developer approaches the department has an idea to develop
property, if it’s a large subdivision or subdivision of a large regional
shopping mall the department requires the developer to provide us a
traffic impact analysis that goes through a exhaustive review of what
the traffic impacts are gonna be from that development, we have a
traffic generation is gonna be generated from that development, and what
kind of mitigation they need to do to the highway system to mitigate the
traffic generated. We also review commercial driveway permits which is
when a subdivision breaks a new street connection and new business,
makes a driveway connection to a highway system we review encroachments,
encroachments or an agreement with utilities, developers, cable
companies, and others, then for occupation in a lot of ways with their
facilities. We review subdivision plans for technical details, and we do
onsite inspections for subdivisions also. The information relative to
the development fees ___??[03:53] table F1 of the report and I included
it in the slide that just for information, I know this is a little
difficult to see but it is the report, in the report for your reference.
I’m gonna summarize in the next two slides some of the results that are
included in that particular table. Commercial developments like I
discussed a while ago conduct traffic impact analysis for DOT review.
The traffic impact analysis predicts the impact the development will
have on traffic and identifies road improvements the developer must
provide to mitigate the traffic increase. Currently, DOT reviews these
at no charge, we are proposing for discussion a new fee schedule based
on projected average vehicle trips per day generated by the site. The
fees could range from $250 to $4,000 depending on the traffic generation
of the particular development. The commercial driveway permits will
propose a fee schedule that is paid to or is calibrated…

  <p id="55:00">
  To the trips per day generated by the business or generated by the
subdivision, or the, the development. They&#39;re tying it to the
highway system. Fees could potentially range from $150 to $2000 and are
intended to cover DOT&#39;s engineering review and administrative cost.
The existing fee that we charge for driveway permits, which is what is
in this category, is $50. This covers the driveway pipe inspection and
not administrative and engineering review cost. That fee of $50 has not
changed in the 31 years that I&#39;ve worked here at DOT and I think it,
I think it was the same for probably 20 years before that. Encroachments
like we talked about are when utilities tell communications companies,
gas companies, electrical companies, others, actually occupy a right of
way for their facilities through an agreement. We&#39;re proposing
discussion of a new fee schedule based on type of encroachment and in
some cases the length along a right of way. These fees could range from
$100 to $1000 depending on the, the type of the encroachment. For
subdivision reviews, when a developer requests the department to add
subdivision streets onto the state highway system, the department
reviews the subdivision plans that the developer has prepared, and then
when the roads are ready to be added to our system, we go out and
conduct on site inspections of those roads. Currently there is no fee
for this use to the developers. We&#39;re proposing discussion of a fee
schedule based on linear feet of roadway, which could range from $150 to
$5000 depending on length of subdivision street requested to be added to
our system. On other fees, we currently do not charge a fee for
residential driveways and pipe installation. These are for single family
homes or the department actually, the property owner will buy the pipe
and the department forces will go out and actually install the pipe.
We&#39;re recommending no change there. We, we provide that service for
free, and we propose continuing to do that. We think it&#39;s a good
service to the taxpayer to continue that. For surplus right of way
disposal is when a developer or individual comes in and asks to buy
surplus right of way or asks for a control of access revision on our
state system roads. For instance, a developer might want a break in
control of access across from a ramp that is currently control of
access. Currently, we negotiate with the developer, do an agreement, and
we have an appraisal fee that is $3500. We&#39;re want to converse with
you guys about a new administrative fee for that particular service of
$1600 because currently we do not recover the cost of our research and
right of way disposal of $1600. One of the things that we also do is
offer technical courses to private sector individuals and companies.
We&#39;re suggesting that we should increase fees to approximate the
cost per student that it takes the department to put on those courses.
We currently charge fees to private entities, but the fees are currently
too low. We think we could recover about $90,000 annually if we charge
the whole cost of that course. For selective vegetation removal, we want
to increase the fee from $600 from $200 to cover the cost of review of
the permanent application for selective vegetation removal. Selective
vegetation removal is when an entity or an individual comes in and
requests permission to go out on a DOT right of way and actually remove
trees or brush to improve sight business to their business or to their
land. We do regulate outdoor advertising. We propose a cost recovery
method. We want to increase the new permanent fee to $240, which doubles
it from the current 120, and we want to increase the annual renewal fee
for outdoor advertising company permits to $120 from currently $60. Our
oversize, overweight section of the mobility and safety unit charges for
loads that exceed legal limits. This is critical since oversize,
overweight loads, as we all know, take a disproportionate toll on our
roadways. The program is currently revenue generating, but fees are low
in comparison to other states. We propose discussing increasing oversize
fees by $5 per dimension from our current fee of $12 to

  So what our philosophy is is we want to raise enough revenue that
offsets the cost of providing those services to the development
community or to the entities that are coming to us for those services in
an effort to use that $12 million, it&#39;s approximately what we would
raise from these proposals, to do highway maintenance activities as
opposed to providing that service right now for free. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Senator Ford? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We&#39;ve got a couple of questions from Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A couple of things quickly.
First, following up and my question is very similar, at least hitched
onto Senator Ford&#39;s, but it involves the signal. If we&#39;re
discussing charging or recouping our costs and [??] those with
developers towards the ongoing cost of keeping these signals functional,
my question will be will the developer continue to pay that and my
second question is how do they find ways to [??] the signals that we put
up in the municipalities and I think at some point we&#39;re going to
have to wean municipalities and counties from the care of the state and
let them take care of themselves and we have a plan and are we doing
anything currently to recoup or at least break even with our money and
put that cost in the municipality. [SPEAKER CHANGES] First of all,
relative to the developer signal, we do not require the developer to
maintain the signal after it&#39;s installed. We accept it onto our
system. If it&#39;s a signal that is currently within the subdivision or
within the development that is currently not on our system, the
developer keeps that maintenance until we actually take that roadway
onto our system. So we don&#39;t assume maintenance for anything unless
it&#39;s added to our state highway network. As far as municipalities,
Senator Rabin, we have a lot of agreements across the state with the
major municipalities and some medium sized towns and cities where they
do maintenance on a tremendous number of our signals and we do that
through agreement and we have certain maintenance criteria in the
agreement that we sign with them that requires them to go out and do
inspection on the signal once a year, to do refinements to it, to change
timing of it and to do upgrades on it, and they do that currently at no
cost to the department, so we do have that paradigm in place. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I have a question for Mr. Holder. Do you know the average time
it takes to get a crash report right now? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bumgardner, it&#39;s, I don&#39;t have that information
off the top of my head. It probably depends on the expensiveness of the
requests and how many records the traffic engineering staff has to go
back and research, how many years is involved in the request. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you start charging for those records, you think that would cut down
on the number you&#39;re doing because if it&#39;s free and anybody can
request one, you&#39;re probably getting a lot of requests for them, but
if you start charging that&#39;s going to drop. Maybe if you get more
efficient at it, well, I don&#39;t know, maybe we&#39;re efficient at it
already, but one thing you could, would possibly could say is hey,
we&#39;re not gonna do these free cause it costs time and manpower to do
it so we&#39;re going to charge for it but we&#39;re going to give it to
you in a certain length of time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Great question. I
think with any of these fees or opportunities that I&#39;ve discussed
this morning there&#39;s an expectation that if we&#39;re charging for
the fee or we&#39;re charging for the driveway permit or we&#39;re
charging for the encroachment agreement that there would be a tight time
parameter put on the delivery of that service. So we would look at
tightening those metrics up and making sure that they&#39;re met, but I
would say that the laws of supply and demand or economics would kick in
relative to the accident reports and that the fee structure probably
would ameliorate some of the demand for those particular reports if they
had a cost attached to them.

  It would not be in the department&#39;s best interest to privatize these
programs as they are currently structured. Privatizing and converting to
a revenue generating program they show a lot of promise and we recommend
doing this The fee structure to be set to allow these programs to
generate revenue above the cost to run them, and the private sector if
it managed a program would actually market the program to seek out
potential customers for these signs. This would maximize the revenues
generated by the program and DOT would like to discuss with the
legislature changes that will allow these programs to be revenue
generating and there also is the management of them to private entities.
The next slide shows other costs and cost recovery opportunities.
Subdivision pipe inspections, when we add a state system road that has a
bridge on it or a large pipe which is greater than 48 inches we have to
go out and inspect that. We&#39;re proposing that the developer actually
hire a professional engineer to do that inspection so the department
doesn&#39;t have to do that anymore. That&#39;s a office cost avoidance
opportunity. Many times signals have to be modified or have to be
installed as a result of a development. We currently recover the actual
cost of our review by agreement. We want to maintain that the same as
the existing process and that nets the department, well, it&#39;s
actually a revenue neutral proposal because it&#39;s about $5,000 per
signal. The last thing is telecommunications leasing. Telecommunications
revenue can be generated from a cell site and fiber optic lease
licensing. The current demand for broadband due to smartphone technology
has forced carriers to make plans to significantly upgrade their
infrastructure. This infrastructure can be placed on NCDOT property and
it can be aggressively marketed for that purpose. The Cell Tower
Deployment Act, Section Law 2013, 185, House Bill 65 was enacted to
facilitate the deployment of mobile broadband and other enhanced
wireless communication services streamlining the process used by state
agencies and local governments to approve the placement of wireless
facilities in our jurisdictions. DOT would like a legislative
modification that enables marketing, commercialization of the right of
way, to capture a significantly greater value from the
telecommunications market. This legislation could authorize the
department to collect revenue for this use and retain 100% of that
revenue within the department&#39;s budget. We do have examples from
South Carolina and Georgia DOT where they have successful agreements
with Verizon Wireless to place red box sized mini cells on existing
signs, signal poles or other DOT real property. We have been in
conversation with Verizon over the last several months and they have
preliminarily identified hundreds of locations that they would target if
this was rolled out that would provide approximately $1,200 per box to
the department. The next two slides is a summary of fee recommendations
with the details of the service, the existing fee, the requested fee or
proposed fee, the financial benefit of actually doing the fee change and
the estimated net annual revenue increase that would be as a result of
that. Table two gives a summary of service fees that the department now
provides and table F3 provides a summation of privatization and
sponsorship opportunities. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I interrupt just a
minute? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a couple of
questions from the committee. Representative Tine. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to talk a little bit about the
encouraged fees, especially with regards to broadband infrastructure.
You know, we still have a large part of the state in the east and in the
west that we&#39;re still trying to figure out how to bring in broadband
infrastructure and really it is an infrastructure just like
transportation in that it provides access. It provides access to
healthcare, to education, to broader markets, so to me we need to be
figuring out ways to make it easier to put in broadband in those areas
cause what they can&#39;t do is make a business case to go into some of
these areas. The mountains have a lot of site issues in going through
the bedrock, in the east we&#39;ve got low population areas that
they&#39;re trying to figure out how to get in there

  So I&#39;d be very concerned that we try to drive revenue by creating
fees on one infrastructure to pay for another infrastructure. So is
that, I just, you know, especially to the committee and to you all,
that&#39;s one area that I&#39;d be very reticent for us to go in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I&#39;m trying to get an understanding of the department&#39;s
philosophy on how you&#39;re picking and choosing what services that you
are providing for no fee and then those that you&#39;re gonna provide I
think at a cost recovery and then those that you are trying to provide
as a revenue generator and then it was kind of confusing to me when you
talked about a recurrent fee structure. Can you just give me a
summarization of whether or not the current fee structure, is the
department providing the services at a loss, a break even or overall is
it a revenue generator and as compared to what the department&#39;s
proposed fee structure change would be. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
that&#39;s a great question. Currently for the development fees, those
are the fee loss because our staff time to review the traffic impact
analysis, to review the commercial driveway permits, to review the
subdivision plans, to review, do the inspection of subdivision roads
that are added to the system, we do all of that and no cost recovery, so
we provide those services to the development community free. As far as
the oversize, overweight permits that are issued by our traffic safety
and mobility section, we do generate revenue out of those permits right
now, but like I stated, our revenue is low compared to other states so
that would be, it currently is a revenue generation. Relative to
encroachments, we currently do not charge any fees or any kind of fee
structure for review of the encroachments, for the inspection of the
encroachments as they&#39;re installed or for installation of the
encroachments themselves, so the right of way carries the encroaching
facility with no charge. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What I&#39;d like to see
from the department is a philosophy as to what you&#39;d like to
accomplish with this fee structure change, and Mr. Chairman I&#39;d like
to go back to whether the department&#39;s gonna do it as a break even
or whether it&#39;s gonna be a revenue generator. I&#39;d like to see
some consistency. I&#39;m seeing some inconsistency and I don&#39;t know
how the department is picking and choosing what it wants to charge for
one service provided and then not charge for another and that would help
me understand going forward what the department&#39;s overall goals are
as it relates to this proposal. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you, sir.
We, our philosophy is one of cost neutrality as far as the services and
the impact fees that we&#39;ve, that our district offices supply. For
those of oversize/overweight, we&#39;re looking at a philosophy of
revenue enhancement because the superloads that are increasing in this
state are damaging our roadway facilities and we wish to raise more
money from those particular moves to be able to do repairs to those
particular routes. As far as the telecommunications, we were approached
by Verizon in an effort to identify right of way that they can occupy
and the Verizon conversation also probably goes somewhat to
Representative Tine&#39;s concern about lack of cell service in the far
east and the west because these breadbox cell towers as they call them
can be deployed and actually enhance the cell signal in a limited range,
I think they&#39;re about 500-600 feet, 1,000 feet, so they can enhance
their cell service and supplement many towers that they have across the
state without having to build all the tower structure. So it&#39;s a, to
answer your question, it&#39;s a definitive mix. We are looking to
charge for services that we normally have not because now the situation
is we charge for those services and we have to bill those services out
of our existing highway fund allocation

  $17 and for overweight probably the fee is $3 for every 1,000 pounds
over 350,000 pounds and just want you to know that 350,000 pounds is
what we consider a super load. We recommend increasing the fee by $1
making the new fee $4 for every 1,000 pounds over 350,000 pounds. We
also would like the permission to apply these revenues collected to
specific improvements on routes used by these super loads or these
permitted loads. We also charge currently an individual fee of $100, or
excuse me, we also want to increase the individual permit fee to $100
from $20 when those signals are involved for house movers cause we have
several house movers that come in through the course of the year,
acquire permits through our district offices, acquire those permits and
in some cases there&#39;s no need for DOT forces to go out and assist
that house move with signal, raising signals or taking down signs or
repairing signs. In the cases when the house move does require those
services we&#39;re requesting that we be allowed to charge the actual
cost of our labor and equipment to do those services when that occurs.
Crash analysis reports, we generate about 1,500 of those per year. We
get a lot of requests in our Traffic, Engineering and Mobility Section
from law firms, from the public, from citizen&#39;s groups, from
individual citizens for crash data. We currently prepare those for free
and many times they take a lot of staff time to prepare, so we are
proposing to ask for $200 per report to prepare those. Moving on from
fees to sponsorships and privatization, we currently have a successful
pilot sponsor a highway program for litter pickup. Under this program,
DOT enters into an agreement with a service provider. The sponsor pays
for the sign and for litter removal along the segment up to 13 times per
year. DOT&#39;s responsibility is to approve the signs and specify sign
locations. This pilot program started in May 2011 for seven divisions
and has been successful in helping us remove litter on several of our
interstate sections. DOT is in the process of expanding this program to
all 14 divisions. Based on the success of the pilot, consideration also
includes expanding this program to include all interstate and primary
roadways. We propose a similar sponsorship program for interchange,
landscaping and mowing. An interchange maintenance service provider
would market the program, enter into an agreement with sponsors and
manufacture and install signs at the interchanges. Sponsorship revenues
would be used to mow and maintain the landscape plantings at the
interchange. In addition to mowing and landscape maintenance, the local
business, they have an interest in enhancing the status of an
interchange by funding the installation of additional landscape
plannings to improve the aesthetics. Relative to rest area sponsorship,
state and federal restrictions have meant attempts at commercialization
efforts to rest areas have not been effective in the past, but we do
have, have generated some ideas to generate some revenue from this
particular source. We propose advertising rest area sponsorship
opportunities. In this case, a sponsor would donate funds that would be
used for highway purposes to support that operation of the rest area
facility. In exchange signs of acknowledgement for the sponsor are
erected on the highway and in the rest area subject to signage
standards. Our logo ties program is currently very successful. We think
you could make it more successful by possibly privatizing it. Just as a
reminder, logo signs are the ones on the left, the blue ones that you
see that are for the controlled access highways, they have the
categories of gas, lodging, food, camping and attractions. Ties are
tourist oriented destination signs, are the ones like the ones on the
right. They&#39;re placed in rural areas at intersections and are for
tourist attractions such as amusement parks or cultural centers. Both of
these programs are currently revenue neutral. Right now a business pays
$300 per sign per year to be on a logo sign and $200 per year to be on a

  Like any product. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Here&#39;s a question. We&#39;ve,
I&#39;m sorry, we&#39;ve got two things going on and I know that the
full Transportation Committee&#39;s expected to get here. So now
we&#39;ve got member, we&#39;re gonna cancel that meeting just for your
information that meeting&#39;s been canceled so you know that. It&#39;s
however you wanna finish your presentation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
I appreciate your patience during this presentation. It&#39;s an
important subject and one we look forward to working with the committee
on furthering these particular concepts. Great questions, Senator Ford,
great question and we look forward to working with each one of you on
discussions relative to the results of the study and the information
that&#39;s presented in it. Just a real quick comment summation wise,
adding up the last table, F2 and F3, relative to the summary
recommendations, you get about $12-13 million which is in some respects
not a whole lot of money when you look at a, you know, $1 billion
maintenance budget or a $4 billion overall budget for DOT, but these are
important cost recovery or cost supplements to the Department as they,
you know, they represent staff time, they represent services that we
provide currently for free and that our intent is to recover those costs
and not have to charge them against the maintenance funds that we get
from the Highway Fund. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Chairman Torbett, you have a
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, just a closing comment on my behalf is
that I understand the dollar stance that Mike just brought up and in the
grand scheme of things it could be perceived as not a whole lot of
money, but in this day in time $5 is a whole lot of money, so just
wanted to pass that along. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks. Well that concludes
my presentation if there&#39;s no other questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
other questions from the committee? Well, I&#39;d like to thank all of
you for being here today, braving the cold weather and the snow to be
here. Thanks to staff for getting here early this morning and preparing
for this and for those that spoke. Meeting is adjourned. [background
