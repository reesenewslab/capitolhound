CHANGES] Senator Stein is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President. Members of the Senate, this is part of the amendment that I
offered yesterday, and I want to thank Senator Berger, Senator Apodaca,
I worked with their staffs this morning and I split the amendment so
that for the pieces they liked we can go forward with it and if there's
any piece they don't like they can stand up and say so, but I believe
that this is a piece that is satisfactory to them. They can of course
speak for themselves. It deals with the compliance boundary issue that
we discussed yesterday, and I made a change that they pointed out that
would be better that allows for multiple contiguous properties to count
for the overall property, but it makes it clear that the compliance
boundary isn't the property line, but is whatever it was under
regulation which was 500 feet from the property line or 250 from the
source. I urge your support. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any
discussion or debate? And discussion, debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President,
if I could have just about 3 minutes to look this over. Please. If we
could stand at recess for just 3 minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate will
stand at recess for 3 minutes. All right, Senate, let's come to order.
Members, return to their seats. Sergeant at arms, close the doors,
please. Senate, come to order. Senator Apodaca is recognized. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Stein's amendment is a very
good amendment and I appreciate him bringing it forward, so I ask that
we support it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or debate?

Brown. Allran, Gunn. Gunn, aye. From no to aye. Ice. 43 having voted in

you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To offer an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, you can send forward your amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Stein is recognized to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I hesitate, I almost want to ask
Senator Apodaca a question, because I thought he said he liked an
amendment that I ran, and I thought that was worthy of note, but here's
another amendment for your consideration which I surely hope you all
agree to. This has to do with the first part of the amendment from
yesterday, and it has to do with the low risk impoundments. What do we
do when we're monitoring the low risk impoundment that has been capped
in place and there are exceedances. It's violating, there are pollutants
in the ground water and affecting our drinking water, and this amendment
does two things to deal with that situation and protect our drinking
water. First, it says that whenever those exceedances occur, at that
point, and only at that point, not on the front end, but on the back
end, the utility will remove the coal ash, line the pit, and then put
the coal ash back. That's essentially what's required if it's a medium
risk or a high risk. And we're saying OK, there can be issues where
there's low risk, let's cap it in place, but once it ceases being a low
risk and starts to pollute our drinking water, that's when we'll require
it to be lined, and there was testimony by representatives from Duke
about at the ERC that any plan must be at least as effective at
protecting ground water as removal will be, and this plan ensures that.
It doesn't require removal on the front end,</p>

<p id="30:00">
Only when there are exceedances. That is also relevant because a judge
has ruled that current law says ground water contamination must be
eliminated. That's what this does. When there's ground water
contamination, we will eliminate it. And, the second thing that the
amendment does is that it says when, on these low risks, it changes the
date by when the capping in place has to occur to 2022. EPA is coming
out with its rules this year, and it will require all capping in place
to be done within five years, and there can be a two year extension,
seven years. So this just ensures that we don't do any worse by our
people than what the federal government is going to require. If the
federal government comes back next year and says that it's actually six
years or seven years, then we can change it, but I want to make sure
that we are doing the best we possibly can to protect our people and
their drinking water both by lining it when necessary, and only when
necessary, and doing that work as quickly as possible. I would
appreciate your support on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaking on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor, speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate Senator Stein's amendment, although I can't say I like this
one as much as I did the first one. We're starting a ?? commission and
the function of the ?? commission is in conjunction with Dana to make
these decisions and to go forward on how we clean those up. So, I'm
going to have to decline to support this amendment, but I would like to
offer a substitute that will correct it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, you can send forward your amendment. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, members. What this amendment does, it actually
was brought to us by Dana and the Sierra Club, and they wanted some
assurance on standards for closure of these. So, the amendment spells
out in greater detail the requirements for closure of impoundments.
Previously, Bill had just referenced compliance with rules for closure
of landfills, but this specifies it completely. And it also, high and
intermediate impoundments must have ?? collection and monitoring and
closure gap systems as well as composite liners. Low-risk ponds must
have specific requirements so that they are capped in accordance with
the rules governing closure of MSW landfills. They must also have the ??
collection ground water monitoring and closure cap systems. I mean this
takes it a step further and it is a better amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein has the floor, speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. This is a perfectly good amendment, just in
the same situation we were yesterday. It has absolutely nothing to do
with what the underlying amendment, my amendment, offered. It would be
entirely possible and in fact, entirely positive if we pass this
amendment and my amendment but of course the purpose of this amendment
is to, for some reason, protect you all from voting on something that
you should want to vote for and do the right thing by the people of
North Carolina. I will be voting against the amendment, not because I
disagree with it, but because you all, it would serve the effect of
denying a vote on the underlying amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
for the Senate is adoption of Amendment 12. All in favor, vote aye,
opposed vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. Clerk will
record the vote. 37 having voted in the affirmative and nine in the
negative, Amendment 12 is adopted. The bill as amended is back before
the body. Is there any further or debate? Senator Clark, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak briefly to the bill and then to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So do you want to speak to the bill first?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, we had a quite a bit of debate yesterday recording this bill, and
many of our members had sent forth quite a few amendments, and their
concern was over making sure that we protect the water quality for our
citizens and that we ensure that our citizens are not subjected, in
other words not held liable for the costs that would be associated with
making the changes to the ?? ponds. Now, during our debate, there was a
lot of discussion regarding Section 3B.</p>

<p id="35:00">
In that particular section there are about four sites that were listed
as high-priority sites, and those were gonna be the ones that would be
dealt with first. And a lot of questions were posed regarding the
selection of those sites. And as it turned out, it seems like there was
really no rationale, no rhyme or reason as to why those four sites were
selected. And as a matter of fact, a couple of comments were made during
those debates. Sen. Brock spoke, as a matter of fact he spoke regarding
an ammendment sent forth by Sen. McLaurin, and it stated that the
ranking of the four sites does not matter. And then later, when it was
submitted by Sen. Jackson here, and Sen. Tillman stood up and said the
list means absolutely nothing. &quot;The list means absolutely
nothing.&quot; Now folks, I think that we have a lot of concern about
these statements, because we want to make sure that the water quality
and the safety of the water for our citizens is protected. And the
things we put in this bill should matter, and should mean something.
Remember one of the other things we wanted to do is make sure that the
cost of this cleanup was not passed onto the citizens. So if we look at
the bill, you'll notice there is some mention of something to do that,
as a matter of fact on page 3, it states that the commission shall not
allow the electric public utility to recover from the retail electric
customers of the state cost resulting from an unlawful discharge of the
surface waters to the state from a coal combustion residual surface
empowerment. So now if I were to look up there in the gallery, of course
we have a lot of our citizens up there, and we've already told them of
the part about the sites does not matter, and that this means absolutely
nothing, they may wonder whether or not that portion about the costs not
being passed on to them matters, and whether or not it means anything.
So I think we need to go back and make a few adjustments here and deal
with this list of the four sites. And that reason said, I'd like to go
ahead and send forth a amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Clark, you can send forth your ammendment, clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Clark moves to ammend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Clark is recognized to explain the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay folks what this ammendment will do is essentially it will remove
the sites that have been listed as the high priority sites and what it
will say is that we're going to look at the list put out by the EPA, and
any site that has been designated by the EPA as a high risk site,  those
will be the ones that will be designated as high priority sites for the
state of North Carolina and will be dealt with prior to- no later than 1
August of 2019. I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any discussion or debate? Sen. Apodaca, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Apodaca has the floor to speak on the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate it Sen. Clark, presenting that ammendment. I honestly feel
much more comfortable with the administration, the coal ash commision
we're setting up, its charge are far broader and wider than what little
the EPA gets done at this time, so I feel like this protect our
citizens, it's best to turn it over to the coal ash commission, let them
make those decisions, and go forward with the criteria in, so I ask you
not to support this ammendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any other discussion or debate?
Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the adoption of
ammendment 13, all in favor vote &quot;aye&quot;, opposed vote
&quot;no&quot;. 5 seconds will be allowed for the voting, clerk will

13 having voted in the affirmative and 33 in the negative, ammendment 13
fails. The bill as ammended is back before the body. Is there any
further discussion or debate?
Sen. Wade, for what purpose do you rise?

Send forth an ammendment.

Sen. Wade, you can send forth your ammendment, clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Wade moves to ammend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Wade is recognized to explain the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. This ammendment does 3 things: First, it
changes the requirements and qualifications on one position on the cold
ash management commission. The one that was allocated for structural
fill would be changed to someone with expertise in determining cost and
establishing rates for energy consumption. Second, it establishes six
year terms for all appointees to the commission. And third, it increases
the staff for the commission from four to five people adding a
technician. And this is merely a technical correction I think, Sen.
Apodaca mentioned that yesterday that it somehow got changed from 5 to 4
along the way but it should be 5 people.</p>

bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca’s recognized to explain the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President and members. This
is a very lengthy amendment. It is a clarifying amendment, it is a
technical amendment. It is something Senator Hartsell would bring out of
one of his committees. I’ll go into as much detail as you would like. I
think Josh and Dan and the group were able to look at it. We’re just
trying to clear up some things. First page includes several technical
and clarifying changes recommended by staff. First we made clarification
to the definition of “impoundment” at the request of the Sierra Club,
for which I’m hoping to be legislator of the year, let me add. Second,
we made a clarification on the cost of recovery moratorium at the
request of the Utilities Commission. We made clarification to the
definition of “mine” under the bill and how it relates to structural
fill. We made modifications to the provision in the bill that requires
DENR to do expedited review of any permits needed. We extended that
period to make sure a thorough review was done. We made modifications at
the request of DENR, most technical, but they did request we put
increased buffers for structural fill in the legislation – buffers like
you will find for landfills, which we thought was a good idea. We
clarified the language concerning leachate collection for structural
fills and post-closure maintenance to bring in some standard language
from the rules pertaining to the department’s discretion on duration of
these activities. We made some changes to the part of the bill that
deals with identifying, assessing, correcting discharges from coal ash
ponds. Specifically we clarified the owner of coal ash pond identifies
the discharges from the coal ash pond but that DENR reach the surface
waters of the state. That is a misspell; I’m sorry. Clarify that
consistent with the federal Clean Water Act, discharges from coal ash
ponds that reach surface waters of the state must be corrected. Clarify
that consistent with the federal Clean Water Act that options for
correcting unpermitted discharges are to either eliminate the discharge
or to bring the discharge under the regulation of a water quality
permit. And last we added a detailed process for decommissioning of
dams, of coal ash ponds that are no longer functioning as dams. Once
coal ash ponds are closed according to their closure plans, many will no
longer…</p>

Stein has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like
to thank Senator Berger and Senator Apodaca for bringing forth this very
serious and substantive bill to deal with the coal ash problem. I want
to thank Duke Power for their readiness and willingness to share
information with us as we’ve all deliberated this important policy
issue. I think that this is a step in the right direction for North
Carolina. It’s certainly a major improvement over current law. That
said, we made a couple policy choices here that I disagree with. I think
that it’s unfair to put this on the backs of the rate payers and I think
that there were additional steps that we could take to better ensure
that our drinking water is protected and that when people turn on that
faucet, that they know that the water they drink is not going to hurt
them or their children, but because it is a substantial step forward, I
certainly will vote for it on third reading just like I did on second
reading and want to reiterate my appreciation to the bill sponsors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none… Senator Berger, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger has the floor to
speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members
of the Senate, I want to thank the folks that have worked on this bill,
whether they are members, whether they are staff, members of the public
who have provided us with input, other stakeholders including, as
Senator Stein has indicated, I think Duke Energy has been most
cooperative in trying to assist us in getting information and in trying
to come up with the best bill that we can, and I think that’s one of the
important things for us to understand. This bill represents a
substantial improvement of state policy with reference to management of
coal ash, and it’s an issue that’s been out there for a long time. I
think it is one example of how good policy can result from unexpected
circumstances, and that you can take situations that appear to be
substantial problems and are substantial problems and as a result of
that, provide and address that issue in a way that helps a great deal. I
think what we’re looking at as far as this bill is concerned is what
very well could be a model for other states in terms of they handle coal
ash issues because North Carolina’s not the only state that has this
issue, and many other states do, and I think a lot of folks are looking
at how we have addressed this, and I think a lot of people have looked
at the balance that we have struck in this bill and will see as they
look more carefully a balance that may actually fit their circumstances
as well. Again, I urge all members to support this bill. I think the
fact that yesterday’s vote was a vote where we didn’t see those
divisions ultimately on the final bill is a testament to the balance
that’s been struck and the hard work that’s been put into this
legislation. I urge your support for the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Senator. If there’s no further discussion or debate, the question
before the Senate is the passage of the Committee Substitute to Senate
Bill 729 on its third reading. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will

To send forward a senatorial statement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You can send
forward your statement, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President. I’d like to thank my guests for their patience today. I have
guests in the gallery that I’d like to honor, and you had an inkling of
what goes on here at the General Assembly, the end story. But what I’d
like to do is take just a moment and frankly brag on several of my
constituents. This is a story that demonstrates that we never know when
or how we will be inspired to do great things. Robin Rose, who’s sitting
up there in the gallery, was casually watching television in 2004, an
HBO special on the Miracle League of Atlanta. He got off the sofa,
called his friend Tony Withers, who is also in the gallery, and the rest
is what we call history, at least for the folks in Wake County. Robin
and Tony founded the Miracle League of the Triangle, to give children
with special needs the opportunity to play baseball. With financial
support of the community, the Miracle League of the Triangle has built
two baseball fields, one in Cary and one in Senator Hunt’s district in
North Raleigh. Partnering with the YMCA, the Miracle League currently
serves more than 300 players and provides volunteer opportunities for
4,000 people each season. And the unbelievable thing is there are wait
lists for the volunteers. People are lining up to help, and
unfortunately there are still wait lists for the players, so if anyone
would like to get involved, I’m sure they would be happy to have that
assistance. Robin, Tony, thank you for giving children with special
needs the opportunity to play baseball. It’s the chance of a lifetime.
Thank you gentlemen. [APPLAUSE] [SPEAKER CHANGES] With that, Senators,

As the youngest member of the senate I represent part of the millennial
generation. So, an article came across my desk that I wanna to share
with you. And also to say thank you for a lot of the hard work that many
of you have been doing in here and sometimes we need some encouragement
when we live and work in this chamber but the triangle business journal
report of this week that home ownership for millennial is to rise faster
in North Carolina than other states and I’m just gonna read the short
article to you. It starts by saying the first time buyers are struggling
but in North Carolina a cheaper cost of living and a slue of job
opportunities means home ownership rates for millennial will likely rise
faster than in other states. Diana Crew an Economist at the Progressive
Policy Institute for those of you who may not be familiar is a thing
that promotes the ideas of new democrats and was founded as a branch
with the Democratic Leadership Council under President Clint said,
“Broadly speaking some states are doing a better job than others who are
distracting young workers and North Carolina happens to be one of them
that’s because they have got greater ___[01:52] programs, the research
triangle, good regulatory policy.”  She says, “North Carolina’s
relatively low cost of living gives it an edge over other states with
more expensive cities. There is no major city like in New York.” She
says, “The cost of living has been low. You have got a good blend of
cost and jobs, schools with great programs. So, it provides a good
unique mix for someone looking to setup. It makes a lot more financial
since the ___[02:21] there than in California where the rent to mortgage
ratio is way out of sink.” Peru, expects home ownership rates to rise
faster for North Carolina millennial not just in terms of single family
homes but town homes and condos as young people are “Assuming the suburb
model that their parents embraced a little more.” Even though title
credit and student debt are hindering many young people from buying
homes millennnials actually compose a larger share of would the buyers
in the housing market and any other age, my wife…For those if you don’t
know millennnials are those who are born between early 1980s and the
early 2000s. My wife bought our first last year we live in the fourth
hottest real estate in market and the triangle, we put our offer in two
weeks and we are in a bidding work and thankfully we got it and a lot of
that is because of the policies that we have been passing down here in
the General Assembly and they are helping people in my generation like
us in the North Carolina. So, I thought I would take this moment to both
encourage you as the session moves on and to say thank you as part of
that generation.

Thank you Senator, other notices or announcements?

Senator ___[03:45] what purpose you has?

there on time so we can start and start going through the bills. And as
far as my moment of personal privilege Mr. President there are five days
left for people to apply for eugenics compensation. I just received a
message from the folks at the industrial commission it’s so far 609
claims have been filed by the survivors of eugenics in our state. I will
recall Mr. President that North Carolina adopted the state law and
policy back in July, 1933 and it was the law about land up until 1977
when this ___[04:51] style program was finally stopped, we didn’t take

...this General Assembly. Last year nothing had been done except an
apology from Governor Easley in 2002. That was it for these people.
They've almost all died out. So far we have 609 claims. I would urge
you, please, on your social media. Please make sure to put it out that
there's only five days left. There may be someone in your district who
could still apply for this.
It is a shame that North Carolina entered into these kinds of policies.
Seven thousand, five hundred and twenty-eight individuals are recorded
to have had their reproductive rights permanently altered by the state
of North Carolina and their counties.
The one county that has the dubious distinction of having the most
people sterilized was Mecklenburg County at 485, thanks to the work of
Wallace Kuralt who was the welfare director there from 1945 until 1972.
That was Charles Kuralt's father. This is a shame on our state.
I'm proud to be part of a General Assembly that finally did something
and we have five days left for those people harmed to apply for the
money that we've put aside to try to say more than Governor Easley did.
Not just an apology, but to put some money behind that. It's not enough.
The suffering was immense, but it comes to an end, Mr. President. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Is there any further notices or
announcements? Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick has the floor for a point of
personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First to address this issue that Senator Goolsby
spoken to, the eugenics victims. I worked very hard on that legislation
originally and many others in this chamber did, so it deeply concerns me
that there are people out there who probably haven't come forward and I
think in many instances it's out of embarrassment in some instances.
It was of that 7,600 people originally  that were victims. It was
estimated that about 1,600 were still alive today and that they would
potentially come forward. I think it's wonderful that North Carolina has
decided to compensate those victims. I don't think there's any amount of
money that can compensate them for the loss of their reproductive rights
without their consent and without their authorization. So I want to
comment on that first.
Secondly, I want to comment on an event I attended yesterday up in
Washington. Of course, yesterday I had an excused absence. Probably one
of only three excused absences I've ever had from this Chamber in my
seven years of being here.
But it was for the purpose of attending a 50th anniversary commemoration
of the civil rights act of 1964. And I think it's important that we
celebrate those type of events. Think back and reflect upon what it was
like here in America 50 years ago. Particularly if you happen to be
someone who will look like me or somebody who was happened to be
different, because the discrimination was rampant. The only way that one
had access to lunch counters, to lodging accommodations, to education
and the like, was hopefully if your particular community, if that
particular city, it might be Durham, it might be Asheville, it might be
Winston-Salem, decided that they want to pass local ordinances that
opened up those restaurants to whoever wanted to come there. Or open up
the hotels to whoever will happen to stay.
And you couldn't just drive, throughout the south in particular, and
know that you would have a place to spend the night. Because it was a
different world and different reality.
So I think that when we have these types of national commemorations and
I think it's wonderful when we can have the leadership of the House and
the leadership of the Senate and you can see the likes of Senator
McConnell standing there with Harry Reid. Senator Reid with those of the
like of Nancy Pelosi, as well. And the speaker Boehner, all standing
together to speak in support of this very, very significant and historic
celebration. And to see them there holding hands, perhaps a little bit
of a tense moment in the minds of some of them. But doing it in the
spirit of saying we shall overcome.
I think that's important. I think it's significant. And they thought
back and spoke frequently about the bipartisan effort that went into the
passage of the Civil Rights Act. And I think it's a wonderful
illustration in bipartisanship because today so often we are divided. So
often today we are fractured. So often today we are unable to
communicate and resolve our differences.
Many instances we are able to bridge those gaps when it comes to small
pieces of legislation or to some issue. I'm glad to see the day we're
able to do it on the coal ash bill. I think that's significant.</p>

<p id="65:00">
But far too often we are fractured. At that point in our history, back
in '64, our nation was fractured. But we saw bipartisanship come
together, and one of those statements that was made by Senator Edward
Dirksen, who was a republican from Illinois back in that period. It was
simply this. That no army is more powerful than a good idea whose time
has come. And that good idea was the impending passage of the Civil
Rights Act and tearing down those barriers of discrimination for all so
that we all could feel that we were entitled to those same opportunities
wherever we traveled, regardless of whether it was in the North or
South, regardless of the community and its boundaries. Yesterday they
actually provided an award posthumously to Coretta Scott King and Martin
Luther King for their efforts during that era and I think that is
profound and significant, particularly in light of how controversial
those efforts were made by many in that time frame. They alone were not
simply the ones who articulated a need for that Civil Rights Act. There
were many, many others from many civil rights organizations. Ray Wilkins
of the NAACP, James Farmer of CORE, Whitney Young of the Urban League,
and many, many others that joined in that effort.  My father was a part
of that effort and of course I was able to see so much of what occurred.
And of course there is always that anniversary of the loss of civil
rights workers in Mississippi. Goodman, Schwerner, Chaney.  Of course I
happen to know their families intimately, particularly Goodman whose
sister was a schoolmate of mine. Chaney's brother was someone I knew
well, we were in school together. So these commemorations mean something
to me. I don't take lightly the missing of a day from these chambers,
but when a 50th anniversary comes along, I'm not sure I'll see the next
50 or the next 25 so I thought it was important to be in Washington
yesterday. But one thing that I would ask that we do in adjourning today
is that we do so in recognition and honoring  all those that work in a
bipartisan way to pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It is a very important
piece of legislation and likewise in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King and
Correta Scott King who received awards in our nation's capitol
yesterday. Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES. Thank you Senator. Is there any further business to
come before the Senate? Now the the chair recognizes Senator Burger for
a motion.
SPEAKER CHANGES.  Thank you Mr. President. I now move that the senate do
adjourn, and in response to the suggestion of Senator McKissick in honor
of those individuals who work, and continue to work tirelessly for civil
rights in America and in North Carolina.  That we now adjourn subject to
messages from The House and the governor, the introduction referral and
re-referral of bills and resolutions, the receipt and re-referral of
committee reports, the ratification of bills and appointment of
conferees, and to reconvene on Thursday, June 26th 2014 at 11 a.m.
NEW SPEAKER: The motion is the senate now adjourned subject to the
stipulations stated by Senator Berger to reconvene Thursday June 26 at
11 a.m. seconded by Senator McKissick.  All in favor say Aye. Opposed
No. The Ayes have it. The senate stands adjourned.</p>
