We'll call the Environment Committee to order.  If everyone in the back
would please have a seat.  I would like to introduce our Sargent at Arms
today, we have  Bill Bass, Charles Goodwin, Jesse Hays, B.H. Powell,
David Collins, and Carl Morrello.  Thank you guys for doing a good job
for us.  We have some pages with us today.  We have Marquez Macon from
Halifax County.  Representative Ray, please stand up.  We have Mahasia,
how do I say that?  Say your last name. Okay, Wake County, Becky Carney.
Got your page, Becky.  I couldn't say his name.  Catherine Riley from
Johnston County, Tom Tillis.  Sam Ess from Nash County, Jeff Collins.
Savon Sampson from Robison County, Charles Graham.  Austin Wood from
Wake County,
David Lewis.  Thank you all for being with us and hope you have a great
time.  What we're going to do today, we're going to go over the PCS,
then we're going to take some amendments.  We're going to vote this
thing out fairly quick.  They'll be no public comment today and
Representative Hager moves that we have the PCS in front of us.  All in
favor say &quot;Aye.&quot;  All opposed say &quot;No.&quot;  The ayes
have it. It's properly before us.  Representative Samuelson will explain
the difference between the PCS and the old bill.  And I'd like to have
all the amendments in by 10 after 10:00.  Up to the chairs today.  Thank
you.  Representative Samuelson, you're recognized.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, I saw somebody else
laugh when you said the old bill because that's part of my point.  The
only thing that's really old in all of this is the coal ash
impoundments.  They've been there for, in many cases, eighty plus years,
and four months ago we had a spill.  And what I took from that was that
we are learning that the solution we had that was working for all
general purposes for eighty years wasn't going to be a permanent
solution and that we needed to look at a way to modify systems to deal
with coal ash on a permanent basis.  And so, what we're trying to do now
is something that has not been done anywhere else in the country,
because everybody's got these older impoundments that they're just now
realizing are going to be have to be dealt with differently over a long
term period.  And so we are leading the way on trying to figure out how
to do something that hasn't been done before.  We are the first to be
willing to tackle this challenge and to find a solution.  And what I
also want to say is we have been working with with the governor, with
the Senate and I'm going to give my colleague, Chuck McGrady here, a lot
of kudos.  We began having hearings on coal ash all the way back during
the ERC before session started and he has been working on it and working
with many people throughout that time.  And so while this particular PCS
might be new, the issue and the concerns around it, and the ideas we've
been discussing have been out there in the public for a number of
months, as we've begun to discover what it is that is the nature of the
problem and what are some of the options.  My guess is, and a lot of us
believe, that as we continue to move forward on this, we're going to
find options and find solutions that are not out there right now,
particularly when we talk about beneficial use.  And so what we're
trying to do now, is to put in place a system that will allow us to
evaluate the risk, to come up logical, efficient and effective solutions
that are going to move us into the next eighty years of dealing with
these types of products.  So what I wanted to do yesterday, we went over
the version that you got from the Senate and we did that because we felt
like it was important, as a foundation, to hear because we're building.
People talk about, I think the governor used the idea of  a blueprint,
or something of that sort.  Well, if you use that building analogy, they
laid one part of it.  The Senate put another piece on it, and we're
continuing the construction and filling it in.  So what I'd like to do
is go quickly over the changes between this and the plan that came over
from the Senate.  Go over them briefly, and then, staff, if I miss any
important details,  or if people have questions about specific details,
we will go over that.  So the first change, if you look on your summary,
is we extended the date for the moratorium on rate cases for costs
related for impoundments from January 15, 2015 to March 1, 2017.</p>

<p id="05:00">
The reason for… the Senate had put the moratorium in there to give some
breathing space on figuring out what do we need to do about rates. We
decided that we needed to extend that to give more time for all the
assessment, for all the cost factors that go into figuring out what this
is going to be. I will say that the March 1 2017 date, I do have an
amendment to move that back just to that same date that the closure
plans come out, which is December 31st 2016, so it’ll go back two
months, so it’s on that same date that the closure plans are put out.
That way when we’re going to evaluate these sorts of things, we will
have the information to figure out what kinds of issues are going to be
considered. Second, we modified the Coal Ash Commission’s membership.
You can look at that. It’s basically a preference item for where we
wanted members to go and expertise, and I think there may be an
amendment being looked at for that, but the gist of it is we want to get
people who are experienced, who know something about this issue and can
provide the guidance that we need because as I said before, nobody’s
done this before. The third one, we move the Commission under from the
Department of Emergency Management to Environment and Natural Resources.
The reason we did that was because as we looked at who all the people
were that were going to be working on all these things, they were pretty
much all in DENR, and it just seemed to make sense that it would still
be an independent commission like the Energy and Mining Commission, it
would still have that independent eye, it will still have that
additional expertise, but it would have a little bit closer working
relationship or functional working relationship with DENR since DENR’s
where most of the employees were going that we were going to have to
cooperate with, and we just thought that would… If for no other reason,
they might be in the same building. It just makes things a little
easier. We changed the matter of the Chair of the Commission to being
appointed by the Governor. The reason for this was because as we looked
at how quickly things have to move, and this Chair has serious
responsibilities that if we took a lot of time for the Commission to get
appointed and for them all to get to know each other and then for them
to all decide who they wanted to be the Chair, since it’s not just a
perfunctory presiding function, it’s actually a function that’s going to
have some hiring decisions and that sort of thing, we thought that
needed to go ahead and be appointed and decided quickly, and decided the
easiest way to do that was to have the Governor do it. The next one
modifies local preemption provision. The basic on this is these are
going to be statewide plans. They’re going to cross multiple
jurisdictions; there needs to be consistency. We’ve done that in other
areas and that’s why we put it in here. The next one’s a technical
correction. We can’t have something applicable July 1 because that was
yesterday, so we’re moving it out to August 1. The next one deletes the
leachate collection requirement. There was an amendment that was done –
I believe it was on the Senate floor – that came from DENR,
well-intentioned, but it had an error in there. It requires a leachate
collection system but it doesn’t require a liner, and those types of
impoundments don’t have liners so you can’t have a leachate collection
system, and everybody agreed it was a technical error and they just
didn’t catch it, so that’s taking that out. The next one adds language
for DENR to establish an alternate timeframe for submission of a
groundwater assessment plan. There again, first time we’ve done this.
We’re trying to make sure we are covering our bases to get it done in a
professional way, and so that was put that on there. The next one’s a
new one from the first PCS. It requires an impoundment owner to provide
an alternate supply of potable drinking water. In the version that came
over from the Senate, they said if your water is contaminated, they had
30 days to get you an alternate source of water, to which I said “Well
you’re not going to be able to drink very much,” so we decided that they
had to have 24 hours to get drinking water, but 30 days to establish a
more permanent solution for showers, ?? drinking water and shower water,
and that way we felt like you wouldn’t have someone going for 30 days
without drinking water and that that was a reasonable adjustment in that
part. The next one adds a variance provision for closure deadlines. This
includes a public process. So the idea is here we have set deadlines
because we feel like deadlines are important and they drive the process
to make sure that things get done. On the other hand, nobody’s done this
before and there are all kinds of moving pieces, and on a positive note,
there may be some new technology that comes out that nobody knew about
when they were in the process of doing this, and so we wanted to put the
variance language in there so that there was a way to accommodate the
unforeseen and a very new system, but also to guarantee that that has a
very public process, so that it’s something that goes through a general
public process and everybody knows about it. The next one is a new one
from yesterday; decreases the trigger points for enhanced requirements
for large</p>

structural fill projects. The original numbers of 10,000 tons per acre
or 100,000 tons per project were based on the only other state we could
find that regulates this. Seriously, when we were trying to find do
other states have these kind of requirements and what are their limits,
we only found one and they were using 10,000 and 100,000. Some people
had said they were concerned that that was too much and so we took it
down to 8,000 and 80,000. There again, nobody knows what exactly the
right answer is because it’s not being done and only one other state has
done it. They’re doing fine with the 10,000 and the 100,000, but we
thought we would go ahead and lower it to the 8,000 and 80,000 for the
smaller projects. Next, what modifies the setback requirement for
structural fill projects. This was also a last minute amendment on the
DENR, on the Senate side, there are some tweaks to the numbers. We
tweaked it from 25 feet of bedrock to 30 feet, mainly to keep it in
contention so we can find out what the right answer’s supposed to be.
We’re still working on that and trying to get the experts on it. The
next one clarifies the dam decommissioning provision. As we begin to
dewater these sites, some of them will have issues with the dams and may
not be in the same position they are before, and so we needed a
clarification on that whole provision of how you go about doing it.
Staff can give me the specific details. I’ll admit that’s not my
strongest point on that one. The next one modifies the compliance
boundary provision. This one is contested, but what we’ve put in place
here is what our intention was last year with compliance boundaries. The
understanding was that, when you have a compliance boundary, that it was
set by rule at either--depending on when you permitted and how you
permitted--either 250 feet or 500 feet or the property line. What we
were trying to say was we were still going to honor that 500 and 250
even if they had multiple properties. It was misinterpreted as going all
the way to the property line. It was still only supposed to be the 500
and the 250 feet, so we clarified that. The second thing that we always
intended was, if your exceedance is still inside the compliance boundary
then you are technically okay. It’s only when it goes outside that there
needs to be cleanup and that was interpreted differently for the sites
that were considered non-permitted, which I’ll admit, when we did that
before, we’d never heard of a non-permitted site. I thought everything
had to be permitted, so this is to clarify that if your exceedance, or
if your contamination, is inside the compliance boundaries you don’t
have to do anything yet but the minute it hits the line or goes after it
you’ve got to begin to clean it up. Now one of the differences on the
ones that were deemed as non-permitted was Judge Ridgway’s decisions
and, attorneys correct me if I’m wrong, the Judge Ridgway decision said
you have to remove the source of the contamination, which sounds like a
good idea until you start to realize these compliance boundaries apply
to every municipal waste treatment facility. If you have to remove the
source of the contamination you’ve got to shut down the waste treatment
facility. I don’t know how many of us want our local governments,
because of a compliance boundary issue, to suddenly have to shut down
their waste treatment facility. The intent of this language is to say we
think you need to clean it up and we think you need to keep it inside
your compliance boundary, but you’re not going to have to shut down your
waste treatment facility or, if you’re an industrial user, you’re not
going to have to shut down your plant because you exceeded the
compliance boundary. It still requires cleanup but doesn’t require the
removal of the source of it for those non-permitted ones because it
would be infeasible for many of our communities in North Carolina and,
frankly, if it’s inside the compliance boundaries, it should be okay. I
know there’ll be some debate on that one. The next one adds a
requirement for DENR to study all deadlines established by the act and
report its findings and recommendations to the ERC on or before December
1st, 2014. You’ve got to realize, again, nobody’s done these deadlines
before. There may be very well a need for variances. We want some sort
of information to help us understand what are reasonable deadlines so
that, when someone comes and asks for variance or if we’re trying to
establish if what we did worked, that we’ve got this study to help us
figure out have we set the deadlines where they need to be set. We
removed the appropriation provision simply because it’s in all of the
budgets and we therefore figured it was covered.</p>

Speaker : The last one that was clarifying technical changes if staff ??
clarifying technical changes that was don't necessarily or primarily
important and then there was ?? amendment understand one amendment that
we were working on ?? we want the staff to work on the committee members
?? to pt this on the floor but you have to do that with ?? beneficial
use ?? have some study language to encourage ?? of beneficial use and to
encourage beneficial us slow ?? sites i believe that cover on point
staffs miss person or miss ??,
Speaker Changes: Thank you ,Representative ?? to the bill ,
Speaker Changes: Representative Samuelson covered all the changes from
the PCS to the version whenever yesterday so she's best Covered
everything,
Speaker Changes: Thank you a lot ??,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.Chairman two quick easy questions to the
provision moving omission of the department ?? is this make the governor
Representative happy or ??,
Speaker Changes: Actually I don't know that was our consideration
because it is the right thing to do we have to disagree with the
governor staff position on this ?? other commissions that need those
scenes issues and ?? so it was mainly ?? them,
Speaker Changes: Follow up,hopefully ?? involved with this type of thing
 ? nothing in this will conclude ?? considered in this confrontation,
Speaker Changes: Correct the amendment that we are running on the floor
will study that and encourage more if the beneficial use,
Speaker Changes: Representative Harris,
Speaker Changes: Thank Mr.Chair said that a couple of questions probably
before the PCS sponsor Representative Samuelson ?? these are unlined
unmonitored i try to figure out why why that's better than ten thousand
because to does be a problem to those exemptions i wonder what state
that is they deemed to be because everything is fine about that ??
unmonitored ?? that eight versus ten or eighty versus hundred that
simply a recognition that ?? let's try something that ? they did
research and couldn't find any of the regulative,
Speaker Changes: ?? programs and Pennsylvania i thin was one triggered
?? and i don't think we have any other states ??,
Speaker Changes: And we could have ?? if he like to come in on the other
party of question on other sides ??,
Speaker Changes: That's not a problem
Speaker Changes: Follow up,
Speaker Changes: Please sir on page there is reference to corrections
And page 47 sub section k, i just wonder what is the impact to that is
?? about the problematic language of removing the source of
contamination is that what sections is supposed to get at,
Speaker Changes: And staff let me take the first shots and hope so they
month ave it my understand what this language is ? affirmative versus
not affirmative ?? and we restore the ground water color that we ?? and
submit the results and plan and propose schedule for corrected actions
what it don't say is you have to remove the ??,</p>

Speaker: Please I'm wondering if here the first committee provide
provide some advice language on the low risk in pavements ?? in place,
Speaker Changes: Where did Representative ?? goes,
Speaker Changes: We have looked at the part the management she was
asking  think it was going to be in the amendment ? encouraged in
official use and low risks and pavements ?? is what you ask ,there the
concern  has currently written low risk and en pavements ?? the
situation will ?? we were going to leak that options so how would do
that and protections in there so i will also get into that language when
we have it,
Speaker Changes: Thank you,Mr.Chairman ?? good questions ,who has
changed from the senate versions to the PCS A?? particularly ?? you
about a little bit about that and follow so i can understand it was
preference issue we want to put becasue of the beneficial use ?? of
people who understood about wasting management and reuse and official
reuse so we have a lot of ?? on that who represented concern of larger
rate payers ?? rate payers did that representation with that open it up
from more beneficial use representation and waste managements,
Speaker Changes: Follow up,
Speaker Changes: just to comment ??
Speaker Changes: ?? i like to see those line to make sure where the ares
is at the table through our collapse ,
Speaker Changes: We have been approached by them we understand our
concern and thought about some alternative solutions a lot of about to
say this but the public we need  suggestion on who to make positions ??
remember that there is no one on the senate side just a resident of the
state so we want this to be a high quality board when it needs to be
done,
Speaker Changes: Thank you,
Speaker Changes: Representative ??,
Speaker Changes: Thank you ,Mr.Chairman it's just a follow up on what ??
a little bit more scientific expertise on here or will be some technical
questions to be answered ?? when the question came up,they can actually
have some idea on what is going on what to do ?? on the board,
Speaker Changes: Any other questions from the committee if not the

question. We'd like to see that increase more and more, possibly more
uses of concrete with coal combustion products in it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, is it on? okay
got it. My question, is because representative Hager has brought up
about the use of the recycling of it. And I think it's good, but from my
understanding the Duke coal is so toxic, that we can't use it and we're
buying it out of state from other states. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Mr.
Chairman, that is not correct. The reason that we're using most
combustion products from out of state is because most of the large ??
units of Duke have scrubbers on them. A lot of that ash is used for
gypsum, it's used for gypsum used for wallboard. and almost all the
plants at Duke currently has running used for gypsum, used ??? and then
I'll nerd out a little bit and apologize, the use of ?? for concrete has
to be less than 1% carbon. And a lot of the old plants sitting there now
have a higher percentage It's gonna take a re-burn effort to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Harrison. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Chair, another question based on the ignorance for you, Rep. Hager,
I appreciate the amendment. I've heard concerns from some concrete
manufacturers that they're not certain that the toxins remain inert.
There'
s no distinction between the fly ash and the bottom ash. This or in the
requirement that the department of construction,I guess, it's at the end
of the bill, I meant to ask about this yesterday. Do we have some -- I
guess ?? signed off on it, I was just wondered if we had some assurance
that we're not just re-releasing this stuff out into the adjacent
groundwater or in there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate that, as you
know Rep. Harrison, fly ash is a substitution for lime has been used for
a number years. I have not read any studies yet that says that it
leeches out of the concrete itself. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other
questions from the committee? Rep. Hager moves for adoption the
amendment all in favor say aye [SPEAKER CHANGES] aye [SPEAKER CHANGES]
opposed no. And the aye's have it, the amentment will be adopted.
Repre-- that's all right. [SPEAKER CHANGES]They can make them, but it's
what I explained earlier about changing the date from March 1, 2017 to
Dec 31, 2016 and the reason for that is that it complies and agrees with
the date that they have to file their closure plans and we just thought
that it made sense that we have all those dates line up together.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Harris [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair,
Sorry for all the questions, I appreciate this extension in the
moratorium, I think that's a good revision in this bill, I actually
think it makes sense to give a couple months after the submission of the
closure plan to have some time to digest the legislature. Because this
is a more ?? case so it just seems to make sense to let legislature
digest what the closure plans have been submitted and whether we do need
to extend the moratorium.[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll respond to that. This
extension of the moratorium is putting Duke in an awkward position
because they're going to have to wait for a long time to even consider
recouping any of the costs that they have. You will have a session
before this date, if you have any concerns there will be reports coming
out, regularly, but we felt like for the purpose of balancing the needs
of the utility commission, to have the information they need to
accurately determine what needs to go forward and balance it with the
fact that this is new, nobody's done it before. that ?? ended up with
the date that the closure plans was fair to everybody. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Other questions, only amendment.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Catlin
[SPEAKER CHANGES] just a comment, I want to speak in support of that
date change. It gives us an extra year, and at the end of that time the
high priority sites we will have closure plans we will have lots of
technical and cost information that will be very useful thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions from the committee? If not, Rep.
Samuelson will move in adoption of the amendment. All in favor say aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES] aye [SPEAKER CHANGES] opposed no. And the aye's have
it, the amendment is adopted. Okay, we're going to take up Rep.

Baseline mortality and morbidity study, that pretty much parallels the
period of time that we would be monitoring, the decommissioning of coal
ash and the bill as it currently is before us has a lot of monitoring
that will tell us a lot about what’s happening with potential pollutants
and how they get into the environment. But it doesn’t tell us very much
about what the baseline is right now in the areas where the impoundments
exist. And so this would allow us to develop that kind of information so
we would see what the potential long term health effects might or might
not be. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson, would you like to
comment? [COUGH] Excuse me. Representative Hager, you’re recognized to
comment on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
have a question for Representative Alexander, if that’s okay. Mr.
Alexander, the fee, regulatory fee in GS62-302, can you explain what
that is? And I apologize I haven’t looked it up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s the, I think it’s 0.3% that funds the various staff positions and
what-not that are required to implement the bill and that just tacks
that on as the source to cover the cost of actually doing the study.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, for a comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re
recognized, Representative ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Part of this worries me
a little bit. It’s very ambiguous, let’s call it that. Disease type, all
of it, I think this is an ambiguous study. We need to drive down more
detail to exactly what we’re looking for. The fee itself worries me
because we just ran a bill that I sponsored to change the fee structure
for utilities commission. And they’re going to be wondering, making sure
that their funds are correct for the next few years. This 0.3% that
Representative Alexander’s talking about is to help fund those
positions, help fund the extra cost of some of these things that we’re
putting on them, with declining revenues that we ran in the bill coming
up and other folks having to step up, I’m not sure at the proper time
this is a right place to get these dollars and get these funds. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative McGrady. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Having no doubt that
this is well intentioned, I think it from a policy perspective is a
wrong decision. I’m well aware that DENR already views the resources
that we’re going to allow them to have in the appropriations process as
being inadequate. And if we then start pulling from the funds that are
being generated through this fee and diverting them in another way, I
just think that’s a mistake, and so I’d urge my colleagues to vote no on
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A question for Representative Alexander. How much
money are you talking about? How much is generated, that you’re trying
to use? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t specifically have a number but in
looking at what health statistics is doing currently, we aren’t talking
about a great deal of resources here. My back of the envelope estimation
would be somewhere in the neighborhood of about $100,000. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Millis. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I guess my question is directed toward Representative Alexander, and I’m
trying to wrap my mind around the purpose for this amendment and I just
wanted to make sure I have the full understanding is that regardless of
the finances of it, is that what we’re debating here today is the actual
cleanup of coal ash. We’re not debating today whether we need to
increase coal fire production. Therefore any type of movement, to move
this coal away from our water ways and streams and rivers, is actually
going to provide a positive effect. So again, I just want to make sure
that we have the right perspective of what a baseline health study is
aimed to do. If you can help me with that, that would be tremendous for
me to actually decide how I’m going to vote on this. But I think we kind
of have the perspective backwards here. We are here to actually clean up
coal ash. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I agree that that’s what we want to do. But
one of the things that I think it’s important that we understand is that
we need to have a very good grasp of the potential health effects of
what’s in place now and if our</p>

Clean up is going to have a positive impact on health, we need to be
able to prove it. One of the worst case scenarios is the old Love Canal.
If you will recall, Love Canal was one of these situations that ended up
being so bad that the whole place had to be shut down, a fence put
around it and [COUGH] there ensued a very long debate about health
effects. By running this study parallel to what we are proposing to do
in cleanup, I think we can alleviate any future debate about health
effects. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
was going to say I actually agree with much of what Representative
Millis said, that we’re already cleaning it up. And where I would
disagree with your comparison to Love Canal is this is an issue that
transcends many geographic and demographic regions of our state, each of
which could have other reasons for changes in their mortality or
morbidity rates, that have nothing to do with what’s happening at the
coal ash plants. When you’re talking about Love Canal, that was a more
confined area. This is all over the state. And so I think if you’re only
checking baseline mortality and morbidity with no concern for all the
other things demographically and geographically could influence it,
you’re not getting a real picture. And so I would urge, aside from the
money constraint which I also have concerns with, I would urge a no on
this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would urge a yes vote on this
amendment. I’m very familiar with the issues around hexavalent chromium
health impact, and we heard yesterday that hexavalent chromium has been
found in some of the spots, and so I think the issue that I’m hearing is
are we cleaning up without any consideration to the impact on human
life, or are we adding that component to it? And so I would think it’s
our responsibility from the point of view of public health to make sure
that we also consider it our responsibility to human health. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. While I applaud Representative Alexander’s desire to make sure
people remain healthy, for this study to be relevant to what we do, it
would have to last a long time, then we evaluate what actions to take.
And I think the purpose of this bill today is for the time a relevant
health study would be completed, we will have already gotten the coal
ash either enclosed or moved away from the populations that tend to be
impacted. A second thing I wanted to address, the reference has been
made to Love Canal. And while that has become the poster child for the
reuse of contaminated property, anyone familiar with it realizes that
that was a sealed and capped landfill of hazardous chemicals, which was
donated to a school board for the purpose of using for playgrounds or
could build a school on it, which would be above the surface and it
would have been fine. What happened the school board sold it for
redevelopment. People came in and put in a zoning to build houses that
included excavating basements. The chemical company spoke against the
rezoning, pointing out that that would cut through the cap, and allow
the chemicals that had been sealed to seep out. That is in public
records from the 1950s. That advice was ignored. And yes, 30 years later
people suffered from the fact that someone in government decided that
you actually could put a basement in the middle of a toxic waste dump.
This is not an analogous situation at all. This is actually preventing a
Love Canal, not creating one. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions on the
Alexander amendment? Representative Cunningham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chair. I was interested because I do like Representative
Alexander’s, it gives us a baseline and like we are the first state to
make such a progressive move on containing the coal ash. But
additionally I believe that some of the public health departments
already have some of that statistics and data, and it would be easily
collected and additionally someone would just have to look at the
particular sites around that area because the data is already there at
the public health departments on mortality and morbidity.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other debate? If not, Representative Alexander moves adoption of the
amendment. All in favor say aye, opposed no. Amendment fails.
Unannounced. Is there any other amendment? Any debate on the bill as
amended? Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was excited about the fact that we were finally
going to be tackling coal ash and then Judge Ridgway’s decision came out
in March that said that Duke needed to remove the source contamination
at all of its 14 sites. It seems like, actually, the provisions in this
bill don’t provide even the protection of Judge Ridgway’s decision. I’m
concerned that the bill allows the continued disposal, for five and
one-half years, of wet coal ash, even though we know it’s a problem now.
I’m concerned about the mandate capping in place for the low-risk ponds.
I appreciate the fact that Representative Samuelson said that will get
fixed on the floor but, for now, the bill says that, mandates capping in
place low-risk ponds, and it seems that all the other ten sites could be
identified as low-risk so we might continue to perpetuate this problem
of leaching contaminants into adjacent drinking water. I’m concerned
that the commission gets to veto proposed closure based on costs. I
don’t think there’s any cost that can, when you’re talking about public
health, I don’t think any cost is too high. I’m concerned about the fact
that the language on page 47, that I asked about, might be a way to get
around the Ridgway decision that requires the removal of the source
contamination. I'm Also concerned about the fact that this bill does not
protect the rate payer so I’m afraid I’m voting no today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further debate on the bill as amended. Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Just to clarify a couple of things: the low-risk sites have
to comply with a lot of different, existing DENR requirements and I’d be
surprised if very many sites were classified as low-risk, so that’s one
issue. The other thing, on the variance, and that’s basically schedule
related because there may be permit delays, there may be opportunity for
new technologies and right now to rush in and have no flexibility for
schedule variance I think is not the smart thing to do, so I support the
bill as it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, likewise, support the bill. I am quite aware of the issue that
Representative Harrison raised, with respect to the low-risk sites, and
that is a concern of mine. We just, frankly, weren’t capable of putting
forth the amendment as quickly on this one. I do think we have a fix and
I think that fix is important and I’m hoping when we get to the floor
Representative Harrison that issue will come off the table. With respect
to the veto based on cost, I think that’s a misreading of the bill. The
bill simply allows cost to be one of the factors and, to get to the
point that you’re saying that the veto based on cost, you’re basically
saying that the decision maker here is going to simply rely on this one
factor and not all the other factors that are set out there. You’re
assuming they’re going to do the wrong thing but, even if they do the
wrong thing, the public process here and the appeals process, everyone
here knows that if they make a decision based on cost that thing is
going to be appealed. I don’t think we’re going to need to go, I don’t
think there’s a veto based on cost here. There’s been reference to the
Ridgway decision. The original Senate bill had nothing to do with
compliance boundaries. I argued that we needed to. It’s the only portion
of the bill that is larger than the coal ash issue because there are
compliance boundaries that relate to solid waste landfills and a whole
range of other things. I will circulate, I don’t want to get staff in
trouble, but there’s clearly a view that the Ridgway decision goes too
far and, if left in place, the cost of that, particularly to
municipalities, anybody that runs a solid waste landfill, could be out
of sight. Yes, we are trying to address that issue. If we’ve done it
inartfully I am quite open to trying</p>

<p id="45:00">
to clarify that going forward, but I think it's critical that we take
care of it. Frankly, I wonder whether we need Coal Ash legislation if we
don't address the issue. I will remind people I voted against the
regulatory reform bill last year, in part, because of the compliance
boundary issue. I'm quite sensitive to the issue, but I think we need to
do it right. Finally, with respect to protecting the ?? , we're not
deciding the cost issue here. It's just too big an issue for us to
decide. The Senate put in place a moratorium, a moratorium that ends
before the general assembly comes back is probably a mistake and so
we've moved that moratorium back. So that, in fact, the general assembly
that wants to have this discussion in the future is capable of doing it.
I don't think we can have that discussion within the context of all the
other moving parts and that's why I would say there's nothing in this
bill that hurts the ?? It actually puts that decision off to next year
or the year after, at a point in time where we're going to have a lot
more information about this because of all the studies and all the work
that will have gotten done. I would urge you to allow this bill to move
forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other other questions or debate? Representative Hager is recognized
for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold off on that just a minute, Hager, I missed Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I just wanted to request division on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A motion you may make.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you , Mr. Chairman. You know, we've had this situation, we've had
Coal Ash in North Carolina for almost a hundred years. There's been
issues in the past. Previous administrations have refused to do anything
about this and turned a blind eye to this and thought it would go away,
but this administration, this legislature, this House, this Senate has
decided to take action, to be teh first state in the nation to do this.
Is it easy? No. Is it perfect? No. Will we have bills come forward in
the future that will enhance this and go to the second, third, fourth,
and fifth, stage? Yes, we will continue to see this. I think this is a
great start to charting new territory for this state, and really for the
nation. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I would ask for a favorable to PCS
of Senate Bill 729, as amended, and an unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You've heard the motion. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I'd ask for a division.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Division having been called, all in favor of the Hager motion, please
raise your hand.
All opposed, please raise your hand.
The motion passes 15 to 5. Any other business before the committee? If
not, we stand adjourned. And with a referral to finance.</p>
