  <p id="010:00">
  —several things. And since a lot of the conversation was on the
conforming changes to the Internal Revenue Code, I wanted to spend just
a minute talking about that. Then I wanna spend a little bit of time
talking about the transportation part of this Bill. The conforming
changes to the IRC that&#39;s in this Bill are the changes that passed
out of the Revenue Law Study Commission after extensive review. I&#39;ll
also point out to you that these changes are the exact same changes that
have been in effect since 2013. I have the utmost respect— We&#39;re all
sent up here by the 80,000 people that we represent to make the
decisions that they want us to make. Many of you who voted No yesterday,
voted No two years ago on the IRC conformity part. I respect that. I
just want you to know that, for all intents and purposes, it&#39;s not a
new law. So what you voted No on was, in fact, a two hundred and fifty
dollar [$250] tax credit for schooteachers that we are conforming to,
which helps schoolteachers buy— just helps offset some of the supplies
that we all know they have to buy. So, just to be clear, the IRC part of
this Bill—  some folks say that it&#39;s the Senate version— the truth
is, it&#39;s the Revenue Laws version that passed down, and it&#39;s
largely the same law that&#39;s been in place since 2013, except
it&#39;s been improved with the Teacher Tax Credit. So, for those of you
who had valid concerns—and I heard your concerns yesterday, and I
respect your concerns—and if you wanna file a bill to have those
concerns considered, I&#39;d certainly welcome the opportunity. I
don&#39;t chair Finance, but I believe the Chairs of Finance would
welcome the opportunity to have that discussed. But for the purpose of
today, for passing this Conference Report, we need to understand that
this is the Revenue Laws Report, largely, with a $250 tax credit in it,
other than that it&#39;s the same law we&#39;ve had since 2013.
The next part of the Bill has to do with building, repairing, repaving
safe roads and safe bridges. We&#39;ve had a lot of debate on this
Floor, and it wasn&#39;t a great deal of dissension or objection to that
part yesterday, but I thought we ought to talk about that too. We have
to understand that the current way that the gas tax is calculated is
decades old. When the Bill was passed, I was in high school. It&#39;s
based on a internationally traded volatile commodity that make the
predictability that we need to be able to plan roads and bridges just
about impossible to maintain. So what this Bill does, is it recognizes
that that formula that may have been the best we could come up with
twenty years ago—or twenty five years ago.  I&#39;ve been out of high
school a long time—may not be the best that we can do today. What it
does, is it says: The current gas tax is thirty seven-point-five cents
[37.5¢] per gallon, that benefit each and every constituent that we
serve because that&#39;s what paves the roads in their district, in our
districts, in our hometowns, in our communities— This is what funds the
Powell Bill money that was discussed yesterday which gives your
municipalities the ability to build some of the roads, do some of the
repairs that they deem important. This is what we need to make sure that
the projections that we&#39;ve made for the next few years are largely
able to come true. So, just to go through the Bill real quick: The
current gas tax is 37.5¢. This Bill, once it&#39;s signed will make the
gas tax thirty six-cent [36¢]. 36¢ is less than 37.5. But it is more,
let me concede that, than what the price or the tax may have been if the
formula that we&#39;ve relied on, that I&#39;ve already talked to you
about as being flawed was, in fact, left in place. What&#39;s at risk?
What&#39;s at risk? Four hundred million dollars [$400,000,000] to our
communities for safe roads and bridges if we don&#39;t change this
formula. So what this does, it goes from 37.5¢ down to 36¢ with the
understanding that there are Members in this Chamber, from both sides of
the aisle—or all three sides of the aisle, &#39;cause I think
Representative Tine is involved too—
[laughing]
There are Members in this Chamber, and there are Members across the way
who are committed to finding a longterm solution to funding our roads
and bridges. But we&#39;re not there yet. But the— What&#39;s the
incentive? The incentive is if we don&#39;t get it done—

  <p id="015:00">
  If we don’t get it done, then on January 1st of next year, it’s going to
fall from 36 in a gallon to 35 That’s 50 million. That’s going to hurt
each and every one of us in our districts. The roads our people drive on
the roads, our people depend on. And you know what? If we still don’t
get it fixed, in July of 2016, it’s going to fall again to 34 cents.
That’s another 50 million.  Math’s easy when you can do 59 million, but
it’s more important to me to talk about the eight million dollars it
means to Harnett county, and I’m not going to waste the tree, But I can
pass out to you, and I’ve done before, what it means to each and every
one of your counties that we preserve and establish a stable fund to
provide for the road maintenance and the safety projects that we need
done. If, after July of next year, we still haven’t worked this out,, it
will adopt the formula that is based on our population growth, because
that’s a big factor that’s  driving the demands on our roads. We’re
blessed in this state to have a growing population. And we need to be
able to provide for that, it creates a weighted formula which factors in
the population, and it also uses the CPI index for energy. Members, this
bill’s important. We saw what the vote was yesterday. We need to provide
the stability that this bill provides to make sure that we can meet our
obligations to keep safe roads and safe bridges and that our communities
can have the funding they need for the infrastructure projects that they
have. This bill, this conference report is important. Is it perfect? No.
Are there other things in here or not in here that many members that did
vote yes would’ve like to see? Yep, that’s true too. But this big is
what we have before us. This bill’s what we need to pass today, and this
bill’s what I urge you on behalf of the citizens of Harnett County,
which stands to lose eight million dollars, for roads that they
desperately need, to vote green on this bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Rep. Jackson rise?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; To speak on the motion.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; The gentleman has the floor to debate the
motion.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, I’m
just going to talk about the IRS decoupling. I had planned to stand up
and ask Rep. Blust a few questions. But I’ll just go through my points
and allow him to stand up and correct me if I’m wrong. I want you to
consider two options. Someone who’s been successful in real estate, they
pick the right neighborhood to buy a home in. If me and my wife—
Mr. Speaker?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; For what purpose does the lady from Suri Rep.
Stevens rise?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; A point of order, please?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; The lady may state her point of order.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; As the rules Chair just stated, what we’re
talking about today is the conference report, which would be those
things that are in controversy and he just stated all these things from
the IRS code everyone wants to go back and argue about, and not a
controversy. They we never in controversy, so is this appropriate for a
conference report vote?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; The Chair believes the gentleman’s probably
debating points that were in the bill that we passed that are not in the
conference import and pointing his concerns that in the conference
report. So if that’s where the gentleman is going, the gentleman would
be in order to debate along those lines.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Mr. Speaker, I think the bill that originally
passed the House did not have this provision in it, which has been added
back into the conference report, and that is the report I’m attempting
to debate.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; The gentleman is not out of order. The gentleman
has the floor to debate the matter.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; So me and my wife, we buy a house. We live in it
two of the next five years. It appreciates greatly in value. We sell it.
I make $500,000, I gain $500,000 after paying off the mortgage company.
I stick that in my pocket. Do you know how much of that income is
taxable under current federal and state guidelines? None. Me and my wife
are able to exclude a half a million dollars. Assuming me and my wife
buy a house for $150,000 and things go bad, and I lose my job, or we
divorce, and I can’t make my house payment, and so the bank steps in and
starts the foreclosure process and--

  <p id="020:00">
  I can&#39;t make the payments. I&#39;m willing to work with you. Tell me
what to do. They say, &quot;well try to sell the house. Find a short
sale and if we can we&#39;ll approve it.&quot; So I do that and I try to
make everything the right way and do it the right way and I sell the
house and they agree to sell the house for $50,000 instead of $150,000
that I paid for it. What this bill, this conference report now says is
that $100,000 in debt that was forgiven, that will be taxable under
state income tax laws. It will not be federally taxable but it will
taxable at the state. So you have two situations, somebody who&#39;s
made $500,000, they pay no tax, somebody who has made nothing but just
had a paper debt erased, they&#39;ll owe a state income tax, $100,000. I
guess that&#39;s probably what, $7,000 at 7%. Another problem with this
is that foreclosure, if you go through the bankruptcy process, that is a
dis-chargeable debt. You would be able to go to bankruptcy court and
discharge that and get a fresh start. You can&#39;t do that on an income
tax debt. Those are not dis-chargeable in bankruptcy. So what this is
going to do, this provision of this conference report, is going to
require people to fight the foreclosure and make the bank and the
attorneys go through the entire process and make them do the foreclosure
and then file bankruptcy. Also they can avoid paying taxes on this
$100,000, which again, they never got in their pocket.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative
[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wonder if the gentleman from Wake would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman from Mecklenburg?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson, you have made a strong case for this provision.
Did you vote for it when it was on the floor before?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I voted against the original House version of this bill, this provision
was taken out I believe in committee before it came to the House floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d liek to ask the gentleman a second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to a second question from the
gentleman from Mecklenburg.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman not realize that had we had a strong bipartisan
support for this bill in conference committee we could have defended
that position that the House had taken rather than losing it in the
conference process?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I was not involved in the conference process. I believe
this bill left this chamber with much more bipartisan support than it
got yesterday because the conference report did add back in this
provision. I think you had many democrats vote for it originally but
since you took that provision out some of the democrats have seen fit to
change their mind and vote against the bill. Mr. Speaker, if I could
continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So if someone wants to stand up and tell me on the floor why someone who
makes a half million dollars on their house shouldn&#39;t pay any income
tax but someone who loses $100,000 on their house should, I&#39;m all
ears. I&#39;d love to hear that. I&#39;d love to have that debate but
with that provision in this bill I just don&#39;t see supporting it. I
think Representative Alexander said it great yesterday when he talked
about stomping a man when he was down or kicking a man when he&#39;s
down. But why you would give someone who&#39;s then lucky with their
real estate purchase a tax preference and then punish someone who&#39;s
not been so lucky or who&#39;s had misfortune int heir life, I just
can&#39; understand. This bill is really simple. We could vote it down
today, send it back to conference, the Senate could take out this one
provision, we could have it back on the floor tomorrow and we could have
a gas tax decrease by Friday instead of Wednesday. It&#39;s 1.5 cents
difference I think it&#39;s going to make by passing this bill, making
it [??]. Most economists that I know that I read don&#39;t even think
we&#39;ll notice the price difference of the penny and a half decrease.
I don&#39;t think making it effective Friday as opposed to Wednesday
will make a big deal. I do think this is a very unfair provision. I
tried to think last night, in my six years of serving in this chamber
have I ever seen such an unfair provision and maybe I have, maybe I
voted for one, I don&#39; know but I just can&#39;t see it. I can&#39;t
see why we&#39;re going to give a beneficial tax preference to someone
who makes a half million dollars and kick someone who lost their house.

Senate Bill 20 for special moment. Those members who want to speak to
the bill, Reps. Luebke and Turner, we’ll reactivate you. We’re going to
do something a little out of the ordinary, but I think you’ll like it.
For what purposes does the lady from Cabarrus, Rep. Johnson rise?
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Moment of personal privilege.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; The lady is recognized to speak to a moment of

&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; I’m here today to announce that the 215, 216
joint motorsports caucus has been formed. The mission of this joint
motorsports caucus is to promote and advocate for the motor sports
industry, with the goal of strengthening, growing, and maintaining the

myself, and the other is Senator Tillman out of this unit. And we also
have currently 55 members of the motorsport caucus. If you’re a member
of the motorsport caucus, would you please stand? We wanted to do this
so our guests today could see the support that we have for motorsports.
The other, Mr. Speaker, is that I have—I would ask that the
representative statement that has been delivered would be read in its
entirety, and that we have a few members who would like to have moment
of personal privilege after that, and at the appropriate time, Mr.
Speaker, if you would, you introduce our distinguished guest.
&lt;SPEAKER CHANGES&gt; Will do, but before we do that, I would direct
the Clerk to read the Representatives statement.

  —twenty seven races in one year, ten of them consecutively. The most
accomplished driver in NASCAR history, 127 polls, 700 top ten finishes,
1184 starts— and I could go on. Let&#39;s talk a little bit about
Richard Petty, the car owner, today. He currently fields three cars,
Sprint Cup No. 43. driven by Aric Almirola; Sprint Cup No. 9, driven by
Sam Hornish, Jr.; and Xfinity No. 43, driven by Dakoda Armstrong. I
don&#39;t think anybody mentioned today Richard Petty, the actor. He was
featured in 2011, in a show, &#39;Modern Hot Rods&#39;, he appeared in
the movie &#39;Swingvote&#39;, and the Disney Pixar movie,
&#39;Cars&#39;, as the voice of &#39;the King&#39; who drove the Petty
Blue Tint No. 43. His wife, Linda, also was the voice of &#39;the
King&#39;s wife&#39; who was portrayed by a 1976 Chrysler Town and
Country wagon. In 1990, he appeared in the Tom Cruise movie, &#39;Days
of Thunder&#39;; in 1982, with Burt Reynolds, the movie &#39;Stroker
Ace&#39;; in 1972, the movie, &#39;The Richard Petty Story&#39;; and in
1989, the movie, &#39;Speed Zone&#39;. Richard Petty was a county
commissioner from 1979 to 1995. I was promoted in Randolph County to
Chief Deputy in 1990. Part of my duties as Chief Deputy was to present
the budget to the commissioners. So I had to appear before Mr. Petty and
the other commissioners several times begging for money. I&#39;m sure
you&#39;re not used to that— are you, Richard? [laughing]
But anyway— I have to honestly say that Richard was always a great
advocate for the sheriff&#39;s office and law enforcement in Randolph
County, and always as generous to us in the sheriff&#39;s office as he
could be, based on the money that they had to work with. You&#39;ve
already heard about the Hall of Fames that Richard Petty&#39;s in,
there&#39;s several of those. Last year, Randolph County Commissioners
designated the exterior of the original site of the Petty Enterprises,
which was built in 1949, including the A-Frame Reaper Shed, the original
shop and engine rooms, built from 1951 to &#39;64, and the exterior of
the Toomes-Petty homeplace, 1925, where Richard and his brother Maurice
were born. I&#39;ll just go on to say just a little bit, you&#39;ve
already heard about the Victory Junction Gang Camp. Richard Petty is a
champion, not only being a champion driver, he&#39;s a champion for
special needs children and I know that they can handle 128 for each camp
and over all fifty states and six foreign countries have actually been
represented in the children that have come to that camp. And finally,
Richard Petty the man, married to Linda Owens, and together they had
four children, Kyle, Sharon, Lisa, and Rebecca, which I think
they&#39;re all with him today. And he&#39;s a grandfather and
great-grandfather. Richard, again: Thank You! Honored to be able to
speak today, and it&#39;s an honor for you to be here, it&#39;s an honor
for me to live in Randolph County. Thank you.

I&#39;m hidden under here so you can&#39;t see me. I didn&#39;t write
anything down, &#39;cause I don&#39;t, but I wanted to talk about the
Richard Petty that meant so much to my family as a redneck in South
Carolina. Good ol&#39; country boys that we were, and so many
families—city - urban - rural—in both Carolinas. &#39;Cause my daddy and
I&#39;s first relationship was built in 1984. Daytona 500, or I think it
might&#39;ve been the Pepsi Race, a summer race, July 4th. It was the
summer race at Daytona, when he won his 200th victory, you could see
President Reagan&#39;s plane coming in. And that&#39;s a memory that I
have of my father. That I built that relationship with my father over
RIchard Petty. And the thing I think about when I think of the Petty
family is there&#39;s no more North Carolina story. We talk about
American stories. This is a man whose father arguably was the greatest—

like my uncle, we&#39;re competitive and we like racing, we race in a
different way now, we run in politics— But racing&#39;s fun. We like the
competition. But he fell in love with that movie, &#39;Cars&#39;. And I
had the best time explaining to him one day who that character, that
animated character, &#39;the King&#39;, was named after. And so he&#39;s
now a Richard Petty fan. And right as I got— when I came to the House, I
had a chance one afternoon— I spent an afternoon with Richard Petty, and
the man is exactly what everyone has talked about. He is a winner in
every aspect of his life. He doesn&#39;t forget where he came from. He
is kind to all people, and he&#39;s an inspiration to us all. North
Carolina needs more winners like Richard Petty. Sir, we cannot thank you

[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
The gentleman is recognized to speak to a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Adams]
Back in the late seventies and early eighties, I had the privilege of
being a racing photographer. And I got to go to Indianapolis, and I got
to photograph Formula One races, and going to the Formula One garages,
and I got to see all the high rollers. But also photograph NASCAR races.
And I wanna tell you something: There&#39;s a big difference between
NASCAR and those other forms of racing. One thing is, these people enjoy
each other&#39;s company. And they enjoyed what they were doing. And it
was like a huge family. And they are one of us. That was the neat thing
about being around these guys: they laughed, they joked. When they had a
problem they all pitched in and helped each other out. It wasn&#39;t
like they were there for themselves. They were all there together. And
Richard has been a big part of that. And I gotta say: He, along with
several others, really set the tone. And I think we oughtta take not of
that. We&#39;re all together, folks. And they have set the example. And
I just wish him well, and thank him for what he&#39;s been to our state.
Thank you.

Members, on the motion of Representative Johnson of Caberras County,

all Members of the House, the Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of

Petty, Brian Moffett, Rebecca Moffett, Kyle Petty, Sharon Farlough, and
Morgan Costano. If you all would please stand so we could welcome you
today. Thank you for being with us.
[applause]
And the Chair will just observe also, that it&#39;s been— It was really
nice to see Mr. Petty today around the building and notice how he
interacted with a lot of the children who were here at the building and
talked to them freely, gave out— gave autographs and spent a lot of time
with them, and I think that&#39;s a testament to the character of this
great man, and thank you to this great family. We appreciate your
service and, again, thank you for being with us today. You honor us with
your presence.
Also, in the same vein, we do wanna recognize our former House member
who is up there in the Gallery with the Petty family and that&#39;s our
own Karen Ray, who&#39;s a former member of the House. Karen, glad to
have you hear with us today also.

from Durham, Representative Luebke, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members of the House. As was noted, we did
not speak very much last night about the gas tax. And I am struck,
listening to the whole debate, that there is no reference to the gas tax
increase that will occur as a consequence of this bill. There will be,
and the consumers of North Carolina need to know this, that on July 1,
the gas tax will be, in rounded terms, the gas tax on July 1 will be six
cents higher because of this bill. The consumers of this state, again,
will be paying six cents more on the gallon than they would without this
bill. And it&#39;s just important to recognize that that&#39;s what the
bill does, and I&#39;m struck by the fact that no one wants to
acknowledge that, those who advocate for the bill. This matters because
people need the money in their pockets. And not to acknowledge it, not
to say to people in your district, you are going to be paying six cents
more a gallon for gas, seems to be not the right thing to do. I think
everybody should know that, it&#39;s very clear from the bill, it goes
down on April 1, in the bill, to 36 cents, but what everyone also should
know is that on July 1, without this bill, the gas tax would drop to
29.6 cents, which I&#39;m rounding to 30 cents. So six cents more than
it otherwise would be. I think it&#39;s important to recognize that, and
I urge everyone to tell your constituents about it, whether you vote yes
or no on the conference report. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Luebke would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Durham yield to the gentleman from Nash?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, I guess what you&#39;re saying now is you&#39;ve
become a champion of tax reform and of lowering taxes? Is that correct?
Is that what I&#39;m hearing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, I&#39;m telling it like it is. You can interpret
it as you wish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then I&#39;m assuming that you voted for our sales tax relief that we
had a couple years ago, where we lowered the sales tax by 20% in North
Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, it&#39;s really the point that you make is the
point. That when people do something for what they think is a good
cause, they ought to call it what it is, and advocate for it for the
substance, but acknowledge that it&#39;s a tax increase. That&#39;s all
I&#39;m saying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One final?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to a third question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is true then that although it will be a tax--it will be paying more
of a tax than would have been paid otherwise should we not do this for
the six months of July 1 to January 1, we don&#39;t know what effect
it&#39;ll have after January 1. It may be an increase, it may be a
decrease, it may be a sideways, but the only thing we know for sure is
that the tax will continue to go down as long as we don&#39;t do
something about it. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir, the tax will not continue to go down. The tax will be, would be,
without this bill, without this conference report, the tax would be,
rounded, 30 cents a gallon. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m speaking as I am.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative
Brawley, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday, I attended an education conference,
and Representative Glazier was there and speaking, and he made a
comment. He said education should be a nonpartisan issue, and I said
preach it, brother! Preach it! Which is a somewhat evangelical response,
and he was in very good spirits, took that, though we are of different
covenants. And it was an important point to make, because we had another
issue which we approached in a nonpartisan manner, and that became
Strategic Transportation Investments law. For those of you that were
here in 2013, we sent that bill out of here with 95 votes. And when the
Senate would start to load it up, I was over, working on the bill, and I
would say I had 95 votes, don&#39;t mess with this bill. Send me a clean
bill back, you got a clean bill with strong support. And while they
messed with it a little bit, they sent back a bill that we could accept
and concur, rather than have to go to conference. That is what power
this body has when we come together. We&#39;re not doing it quite as
well on this one. And we sent a bill over with some IRC updates that we
liked. Now let&#39;s talk for a moment about Internal Revenue Code. What
happens is, we start with your 1040 form, and in 2013, we concurred and
we trued up. There were changes for 2014 that were passed late. We have
not addressed those. The IRC bill specifically says to which we concur
and to which don&#39;t, but if we do nothing, we don&#39;t concur to
anything. Now I wasn&#39;t really going to tell the Senate this, because
I was hoping they wouldn&#39;t realize it, but during the conference
process, they came and said you realize if we do nothing on our IRC
update we get everything we want, except the teachers&#39; deduction for
classroom supplies. That was their position. So we could hold at least
the teachers&#39; deduction for classroom supplies in the conference
report. And so we chose to do that. Now remember, both the drafting and
filing deadlines for Finance and Appropriation bills have not yet
passed, and because the IRC update would be an affirmative act to say we
will couple on mortgage forgiveness or the other factors, we can still
do that. Now, some of these have been presented in ways that, well, the
mortgage thing, we beat that to death. But there were two others that we
discussed. One of them was the tuition deduction. Now this is going to
get arcane. There are two ways you can take credit, if you will, for
college expenses. One is a federal tax credit, the other is a federal
tax deduction. Almost everyone takes the federal tax credit because it
directly reduces their federal income tax and gives them the most money.
Because of the way we handle the federal return, if you take the federal
tax credit, you get no tuition deduction of any kind in North Carolina.
If you take the federal tax deduction, you got the deduction in North
Carolina, but it meant that we treated North Carolina taxpayers situated
the same differently, depending on an election they made outside their
state return. That is why we decoupled. People take the federal credit,
get the most money, don&#39;t worry about us because we don&#39;t give
you a credit. The other thing we talked about was a change in the way
charitable deductions are handled for people seventy-and-a-half who make
contributions from an IRA. What it allows them to do is just transfer
the money directly from their IRA with no tax consequences. Absent this
bill, you take tax credit or you take taxable income from your IRA on
which you pay taxes, and then you deduct the entire

  —or amount of your contribution from your Federal Income Tax. It works
out close but it&#39;s not as clean. What people prefer to do is be able
to take direct distributions from the IRA, because they can then
transfer property without having to sell it. There are some arcane
reasons, it&#39;s not a major issue. Having said that, the Finance
Committee is still open for business and we can hear bills on all of
these, individual bills for each one. So then we move to the Gas Tax.
The Gas Tax today is thirty-seven-and-a-half-cents [37.5¢], it could
well be less than that on July 1. And a lot of people say: Gosh,
let&#39;s just do it! We can take credit for a big tax cut! We can go
out and we can cut! Now, the city of Charlotte, which is the largest
suburb of my hometown, Matthews—
[laughing]
—has a Powell Bill loss, if this cut comes, of four million dollars
[$4,000,000]. And the DOT Budget for repair in Mecklenburg County—a
significant amount of which would be in the city of Charlotte—will be
thirty seven million dollars [$37,000,000]. That&#39;s a lot of money.
And that is going to be a huge bump in the property tax rate for the
city of Charlotte, which will be their source of the money to replace
the Powell Bill money and the maintenance money that we will not be
spending on those roads. And I would submit to you, since nobody driving
through North Carolina pays property tax while they will pay gas tax.
And people who drive seldom will have as bad a hit on their property tax
as people who, like me, drive a lot, it is more reasonable for us to
reduce the amount of the decrease in the Gas Tax as a stopgap measure
until we do what we did in 2013— and I have faith we will. We will come
together and fix this problem so for the next twenty years we can fight
about things where our ideological difference are more important, and we
don&#39;t worry about people having wrecks on bad roads. So I&#39;m
asking your support for this bill, understanding that all the things
about which we&#39;d like to debate will still be available for us, and
I look forward for the debate in Committee. Quite candidly, we passed
all of those changes to the IRC Update Bill with considerable votes. The
problem was not in this Chamber, it was in the Senate. So let&#39;s have
that fight, in a separate Bill, let&#39;s go ahead and address this
today so that our cities and our small towns will not look at us and
say: You were willing to throw us under the bus and vote against our
transportation money and vote to require us to raise our property taxes
to handle things that should be managed at the state level. Mr. Speaker,
I hope that many folks will join me in voting Green.

[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Lucas]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I sat very attentively as we bantered back and
forth about the merits of the Conference Report. I would submit to you
that it reminds me of the American Thomas Payne: &#39;These are the
times that try men&#39;s souls.&#39; I don&#39;t know of anybody in this
group, in this Body, who does not want to fix the items that are
contained in this Conference Report. Specifically, roads and bridges and
other good things in this Conference Report. In fact, we&#39;ve already
voted on these. Overwhelmingly, we&#39;ve passed it and sent it over to
the Senate. When the Conference Report has come back to us, there are
some items that tend to be contentious; indeed, perhaps even egregious,
as it relates to the specific Section pointed out by Representative
Jackson. I think that bothers all of us. I think we all are searching

to solve these problems they can stick whatever says the Jonathan Demme
version of an rise to

and the magazines and when we talk about a vision is we transmitted the

to the senate must remember a son of a onus of them as we were only
seven is landed in soma said that sun and pasted on the week preceding
the Ventura old grandson
of slaves in U.S. and different ideas and we have noted that this point
out of business goals and argued Tuesday,(SPEAKER CHANGES) we take you
back in the nominal and 80 Glennallen
you can adjust some of those legitimate issues you talk about the
tournament of the limo conference as another to say that possibly later
on its own later date we
can address those issues involved, would you want me to make this a
better deal made in the middle age and it still is subject to the
senate&#39;s decision because of
the legislation we have to send them again and ask him again and many of
you know the history of this officer for now-based tax increase on these
of killing his watch,
less and less and less to me and the Semitic comments we always get to
this point, so will we can come back in the business end of the daily
and to make this state
and is still time to address what we know we&#39;ll be fine of one of
them in jail now they will have this discussion this is never a problem
we decide to have tax breaks
for those who&#39;d be the least this question on the console  getting
ready to take the most from those who have the least and this only have
a question me say we&#39;ll come
back and prevent them as a way to women and even tax increase and every

hearing about the money that&#39;s going to be lost. These are excuses
we make when we fail to address what we know is the right thing to do.
And we come up with a number of them, every time. But there&#39;s always

there&#39;s always something left undone. I&#39;d ask that you not

those with the least a chance, at least, to eke out a living in North
Carolina, and have a fair shot to make it to the North Carolina dream.
North Carolina&#39;s open for business. I hope it&#39;s not just open

it back, that we come up with a fix now, that we not raise this gas tax,
and that we give all North Carolinians a fair shake this time around.

[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Haywood, Representative Queen,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Queen]
To speak on the Conference Report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Queen]
Thank you. It appears that this is a bit of a bait-and-switch. We&#39;re
gonna lower taxes on gas for three months, by a penny and a half [1½¢].
Then we&#39;re gonna raise it, for the next six months, by
six-point-four cents [6.4¢]. Then we&#39;re gonna see what the formula
looks like then, which will most likely be raising more than that on our
citizens. That&#39;s what we&#39;re doing on this gas portion of this
Conference Report. Now, why do we need to do this? This is my
contention. I just want to say clearly to you: We&#39;re raising taxes
on our working families that don&#39;t have an option to drive back and
forth to work. Nine cents [9¢] of this thirty seven-five [37-5]
equivalent is for general fund purposes. If we would put that back into
the Highway Trust Fund [laughing][Get my trust funds right] —The Highway
Trust Fund, we would have three cents [3¢] more than we have in there
now! to cover the very needs we want. To cover the Powell Bill Match,
and then some.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jeter]
—Mr. Speaker—
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Queen]
We would be positive on that—
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
To see if my good friend from Haywood would yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
Does the gentleman from Haywood yield to the gentleman from Mecklenburg?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Queen]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jeter]
Nine cents [9¢] times fifty million is four hundred and fifty million,
correct? [pause] It gets to a point, just go with me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Queen]
Yeah, okay. Something like that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jeter]
Ah— follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
Does the gentleman from Haywood yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Queen]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jeter]
So your argument is that four hundred and fifty million dollars
[$450,000,000] of Highway Trust Fund is transferred into the General
Fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Queen]
It&#39;s five cents [5¢] and about two hundred— yeah, that&#39;s right.
Similar to that, yes. It&#39;s taxes— it&#39;s the gas tax. The 37-5 gas
tax. Approximately nine cents [9¢] of it is being used for general
purposes. The highway patrol and five cents [5¢] straightaway. And
that&#39;s about nine cents [9¢].
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jeter]
—Ah, ah— Mr. Speaker—
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative
Jeter, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jeter]
I&#39;m trying to educate myself on math and was wondering if the
gentleman would help me some more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
Will the gentleman— It appears that the gentleman from Mecklenburg is
wishing to ask the gentleman from Haywood another question. Does the
gentleman from Haywood yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Queen]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jeter]
As I understand the premise, nine cents [9¢] is four hundred and fifty
million dollars [$450,000,000]. The Highway Patrol is, roughly, a
hundred and ninety six million [$196,000,000] which, I can make a
tangible argument, which I&#39;m gonna make, is a legitimate purpose of
our road system. Would you agree that the Highway Patrol maintaining the
safety of our road system is a legitimate purpose of that system?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Queen]
I would contend that it is a public safety thing and could be done in
the general fund. So— that&#39;s my point. And if we send this nine
cents [9¢] to the general fund, raising the taxes on the drivers of
North Carolina, what are we doing with the money when we get it to the
general fund? We&#39;re raising taxes on the drivers, and we&#39;re
cutting taxes for the wealthiest out of the general funds. So we&#39;re
paying for tax cuts out of the general fund with tax hikes in the gas
tax. And that&#39;s my objection to this Bill. This— Conference Report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
For what purpose does the gen—

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman from Wake, Representative Pendleton rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the subject.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the conference
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wasn&#39;t going to say anything until
Representative Hall stood up, but I thought everybody should know there
are a number of people that voted the same way he voted earlier, and we
were talked into changing our minds. We were promised that there would
be immediate effort to get this problem fixed. This is just one big ole
band-aid, it doesn&#39;t fix anything. And, so I&#39;m assuming they
didn&#39;t give a date to do it, but when we come back for the short
session, if it&#39;s not fixed I&#39;m going to be one disappointed
person, because it needs to be fixed. And part of that can be lowering
the gas tax, and in the interim, it hurts to know the average
citizen&#39;s going to have to pay more than they would have paid if
we&#39;d have just left things the way they were, so I&#39;m counting on
them to come back between now and the short session and fix this problem
and not leave it as a big ole band-aid. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Dollar rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the conference
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members I&#39;m surprised at some of the math that
I&#39;m hearing from the other side of the aisle. I mean on the one
hand, the gentleman back here seems to say that he wants to transfer
obligations into the general fund. So does that mean he wants to cut out
education money? That he wants to cut out health and human services
money? I mean that&#39;s roughly $250 million. Or is he advocating
raising more taxes or raising more revenue in the general fund? The fact
of the matter is, this bill provides for a steady reduction in the gas
tax in stages. A cut now, an additional cut to 35 cents, an additional
cut to that, to 34 cents, as we are working on additional measures down
the road, as have been mentioned here on this floor, to fix the
long-term problem of, of the needs of our roads and highways and
infrastructure. This is a responsible bill, and I&#39;ve heard nothing
from the other side that&#39;s truly responsible. I&#39;ve heard some
rhetoric, I&#39;ve heard some unrealistic movements of money that people
know is not realistic.  This is a responsible bill to a issue that is
currently facing us and it&#39;s time to vote responsibly for the
conference report and those who have additional ideas with respect to
raising funds and revenues, for our roads and highways, we look forward
to examining those bills when they come forward.

with my city council or county commissioners or school board on, but I
don&#39;t believe that the answer is to set up recall petitions. And
I&#39;m particularly attuned to that on school boards. Because school
boards deal with the two things that create the biggest emotions for us
in our lives: our children and our money. And in many respects,
sometimes have to do it in awfully difficult circumstances.
Redistricting comes to mind. If a school board would be recalled every
time a community disagreed with a redistricting decision, who would ever
want to run for school boards? Because almost nobody agrees with
redistricting decisions. They are tough, awfully difficult decisions to
make, and particularly confounded by a lack of capacity, sometimes from
their commissioners, or from us, or from the federal government on
resources to make other decisions. I am worried a lot that by passing a
bill on school board recall, we open the gates to say to any community,
when you disagree with your school board, that&#39;s okay, go to your
legislator, they&#39;ll pass a recall petition. And then the community,
and I recognize it would be a community, a number of folks who have to
come together, but it&#39;s a distinct minority of folks that have to
come together. And whether it is redistricting or it is budget
decisions, there has to be some capacity for stability. And there has to
be some capacity, I think, for there to be a process where the elections
matter, and not subject to recall when a distinct minority in a
community become upset. And I see that and I&#39;ve sort of felt that in
my community during redistricting times, I know it&#39;s happened in
Wake, I know it&#39;s happened other places, and I just don&#39;t think
that recall is the answer. So with due respect, it has nothing to do
with what&#39;s happening in Stanly County, but it has everything to do
with what I think is the wrong answer to a problem that may exist, and I
think one that we will come to regret considerably, as will local
officials and as will people who want to get the best people in local
office, and they are not going to serve if they&#39;re subject to recall
petitions every time the community disagrees with them. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Wake, Representative Gill, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the speaker a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This Speaker, or the bill sponsor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m sorry, the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Does the gentleman from Stanly yield to the lady from Wake?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to ask a question about the funding of the recall. I think your
bill states that their costs will be reimbursed by the school
administration, administrative unit. I&#39;d just like to know why would
you ask the school administrative unit to pay for something that they
did not request.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is typical, when you have an election that falls outside of a normal
general election, that whatever governing body is holding the election,
that they pay that cost, the expense is paid by them. It&#39;s the same
case for municipalities that hold elections as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cabarrus, Representative
Pittman, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. While I live in Cabarrus County, I actually
pastor a church in Stanly County, in Representative Burr&#39;s district.
And I know a couple years back, people had been up at arms over the
closing of a school that&#39;s just like right across the highway from
the church that I pastor. Where the schools close down, the building is
in excellent shape at the time, it may be deteriorating now, but was in
excellent shape and the kids were sent over to a school that was in such
bad shape that they were already discussing tearing it down, or closing
it down, I mean, excuse me. And the people were really up at arms in the
area about this sort of thing happening, and from what the folks in my
church and the community are telling me, you talk to the school board,
you might as well be talking to the wall. And so this is an extreme
situation that, yeah, you wait to next election, or that sort of thing,
but how many more are they going to close down, how many more bad
decisions like this are they going to make that are adversely affecting
the people in that community? And so I support this bill. Thank you.

  the gentleman from Stanly, Representative Burr, has the floor to debate
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think the title pretty much says it all and
this is identical to the bill Representative West ran earlier. It&#39;s
simply making the School Board of Stanly County a partisan school board
and I would ask for your vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. For what purpose does the gentleman
from Durham, Representative Luebke, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Burr would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Stanly yield to the gentleman from Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr, you said it simply changes things from non-partisan
to partisan and my question is what&#39;s the benefit of doing that?
What about all the unaffiliated citizens out there who might want to run
and don&#39;t see themselves as either democrat or republican?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They can go through the same process that other individuals, including
Representative Jones and others, have gone through to run for state
house our county commissioner or any other. This bill, quite frankly,
simply changing the election method in Stanly County back to the way it
was before the general assembly made it non-partisan back int he
60&#39;s. So we&#39;re going back to the way that it was for a longer
period of time than it had been since the democratic controlled General
Assembly, before they changed in in the 60&#39;s.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Stanly yield to an additional question from the
gentleman from Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are you aware that the fastest growing group by far in our state is
unaffiliated voters?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess I&#39;ll speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Durham has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, I just can&#39;t see the point of this. Why are we turning
something like the school board into partisan democrat vs. republican?
There are many, many citizens who are unaffiliated who would like to
run. There are many, many, citizens who would say this is not about
democrat vs. republican, this is about our children, this is about our
public schools. To me, it&#39;s just moving very much in the wrong
direction to make school boards partisan. They really ought to be open
to all citizens and not to have to go through the many steps which
Representative Jones, to his credit, did to get himself elected. But
really, if we had to maintain what we have, the non-partisan system, any
citizen, regardless of party affiliation or no affiliation can easily go
down to file for office. Please vote against this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberlnad, Representative
Glazier, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak briefly on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just on comment, I am reminded of my good
friend, Representative Brawley&#39;s quote a few minutes ago on Senate
Bill 20 of a good friend of his, education ought not be a partisan
process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not, for what purpose does the
gentleman from Craven, Representative Speciale, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just because the offices are partisan offices doesn&#39;t make education
a partisan issue. I don&#39;t understand it. Every democrat that runs,
even in a non-partisan election, goes to the democrat party headquarters
and garners support. Every republican that runs goes to the republican
meetings and party and everything to get republican support. So
let&#39;s not pretend that these really are non-partisan offices.
Let&#39;s just put them back the way their supposed to be. They run as
partisans. They say I believe in this or I don&#39;t believe in that and
so it lets people know where they stand. You do realize, I hope,
everybody here, the gentleman that just spoke about the unaffiliateds, I
hope you realize that every unaffiliated that goes to vote is going to
vote either for a republican or a democrat when he goes to vote. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative
Johnson, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Stanly yield to the gentleman from Guilford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to make sure I heard this right. You said you wanted to go
back to the 60&#39;s, you said something about the 60&#39;s, I might
have been asleep but you said something regarding this is how it was
done in the 60&#39;s. I could have swore I heard you say that.

believe there were

  was legislation in 69 and then in 71 where they made changes to, where
the state made statewide changes to how school boards were elected, the
election methods, and we are simply going back to having a partisan
election, which is what we had before that. I believe in the 60&#39;s it
was changed to push more of them to move towards a non-partisan and then
hold the election in the primary to give one party an advantage over the
other in the elections. So this, in my opinion, is simply righting
something that was done to give a party an advantage over another and
this way we&#39;re both on a level playing field again and, as
Representative Speciale mentioned, everybody knows where you stand when
you&#39;re running for a partisan office and it makes it a little bit
easier for them to have an idea of who they want to vote for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you know how things were back in the 60&#39;s?

Does the gentleman wish to ask a second question.

For what purpose does the lady from Mecklenburg, Representative Carney,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I wasn&#39;t going to say anything because I usually don&#39;t
speak on these local bills but I had to rise and say, when one of the
speakers referred to people always run for a non-partisan race, a school
board race, and then go to the democrat party and lobby them or if
you&#39;re a republican go to the republican party and lobby them. Well,
when I ran for school board, my first race, and I&#39;m grateful that I
lost by the way, it&#39;s a tough, tough position to serve in for those
of you who have, I commend you. But when I was campaigning, at large in
Mecklenburg County, I went everywhere. I went to the republican
party&#39;s events, I was invited. I went to the democrat party&#39;s
events, I was invited. I was a newcomer in Charlotte and nobody really
ever knew whether I was a democrat or a republican. In fact, when I lost
that race, the democrat party started coming, found out I was a
registered democrat and went, &quot;Wait, wait, run for County
Commission,&#39; and I did and I won. So at one of our County Commission
meetings, and there&#39;s a point here, most people, when you&#39;re in
a non-partisan race, unless they go digging to find out who you are,
what you&#39;re registered as, at one of our County Commission meetings,
and our public hearing, just people come and make comments for three
minutes, there was a woman that came and she was with, she was a
republican and she stood up there and chastised me for something that I
had voted on the week before and said, &quot;You fooled all of us, you
came to the republican party and made us think you were a republican. So
people, they don&#39;t really pay attention in non-partisan. They pay
more attention in a partisan race.

those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will
lock the machine and record the vote, 76 having voted in the affirmative
and 41 in the negative. The previous question is adopted. This being a
final question it will be put to the body. The majority and the minority
leaders are allowed three minutes, if they would like, to debate this
local bill. Seeing no lights, the question before the house is the
passage of House Bill 112 on its second reading. So many in favor of the
bill will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote, 75 having

For what purpose does the gentleman from Scotland, Representative
Pierce, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Pierce]
To ask the member a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
Does the gentleman from Rockingham yield to the gentleman from Scotland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative from Rockingham]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Pierce]
Thank you, Representative. Just want to ask a question: What is the
breakdown now of the people on the Board, as it relates to Republicans
and Democrats? Could you share that with me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative from Rockingham]
Thank you for asking that question. We did cover in the Elections
Committee. There are eleven members on the School Board, three of those
members are minorities, two of the minorities are elected at large. To
go into a little bit more detail, since you asked: By going from eleven
members to seven, we also would go from six districts to four. One of
the current six districts is a district where— We do not have any
majority minority districts, because in Rockingham County it&#39;s not
possible to do that. However, one of those districts is more favorable
towards electing a minority. Under the new system, one of the four
districts would also be more favorable towards a minority. But I would
again say that there are three minorities on the Board, two of those are
elected at large, those are people that run countywide.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Pierce]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
Does the gentleman from Rockingham yield to a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative from Rockingham]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Pierce]
Did— The ones presently serving, did they have any buy-in with this
decision? They were School Board members, has this been discussed with
the School Board members on the proposed legislation that you have
before us this afternoon?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative from Rockingham]
Some of the School Board members have actively told me that they
supported it. Some have come forward recently and said that they opposed
it. We have some School Board members that are pretty new, that were
just elected. I have not individually polled all eleven members of the
School Board. Now, some people may have a problem with that, but as I
said in Committee: We&#39;re not sent down here to represent simply the
members of the School Board. Now, I have talked for a long time with the
School Superintendent, with the Chairman of the Board, and I have had
conversations with some School Board members. I have not had a
conversation with every one, but I perfectly understand, and as I said
earlier: Some of the School Board members are not in favor of this, but
some are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Pierce]
One final follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
Does the gentleman from Rockingham yield to a third question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative from Rockingham]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Pierce]
The citizens of your district— Are they pleased with this decision that
you&#39;re proposing today on the Floor? The citizens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative from Rockingham]
The citizens?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Pierce]
The voters. Yes, sir. Excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative from Rockingham]
The feedback that I have gotten from my district has been overwhelmingly
positive. And I would say that, again, as far as the size is concerned,
we are putting it forward as a referendum. Frankly, I think it will be a
popular thing. But I&#39;m willing to let the citizens decide. So— yes.
I have had very little pushback from people that are against it, and
that is not saying they are not there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
For what purpose does the lady from Guilford, Representative Harrison,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Harrison]
To debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
The lady has the floor to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Harrison]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Members of the House. I don&#39;t mean to beat a
dead horse but I really think it&#39;s important to think about this
trend of the legislature making local school boards partisan. I
don&#39;t think it&#39;s a positive trend, I think that education should
not be a partisan issue. I just want to make that point. I appreciate
the fact that Representative Jones is adding a referendum; I think
it&#39;s really important to let the local voters decide. I wish that
that referendum included the partisanship of the Board, but I appreciate
him doing that. We heard from a couple of the School Board members who
were concerned about what this might mean for the School Board and they
felt that the current makeup was fairly harmonious and that reducing it
the way that it is proposed would result in some racial tension. Also,
there is an issue that there are three unaf— currently sitting Board
members, three are unaffiliated, and I understand that Representative
Jones was able to cross that hurdle and get elected as an unafilliate.
But we all know how difficult it is to get your— the necessary names to
get on the ballot then run as an unafilliate. Then, as Representative
Luebke pointed out, that&#39;s the fastest growing coalition of voters
is the unafilliate. So I think that makes sense, I just think it makes
no sense to be forcing this on the citizens of Rockingham. We heard some
pushback from the sitting School Board members and a retired teacher
from there and I think I would just urge you to vote No. Thank you.

leader or the minority leader wish to use the three minutes to debate
this local bill? The gentleman from Durham, Representative Hall is
recognized to speak for up to three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I won’t use three minutes I just do wanna call
attention to the fact that we are resetting the way our citizens are
able to interact in the elections process and we should just be worry
about what we are doing that will create more difficulty to do that and
be represented, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Rutherford, Representative Hager is recognized to

Thank you Mr. Speaker, I would like to delegate my time for
Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Rockingham may use three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and I will not use the entire three minutes
either, I would remind the body that there are 115 school boards in this
state, there are only four that have as many as 11 members on the board,
Rockingham County is by far, by far and not one of the larger school
districts in the state. The only other thing I would say is that I keep
hearing all this about how the General Assembly should not be involved
in local affairs and such things. So I would just like to say that over
the past 20 years the North Carolina General Assembly when the other
party was in control set the size of the school board and there was no
referendum. So I believe it’s a good bill, I think is what the citizens
of our county would like and I would commend the local bill for your
support.

county has a board of equalization and review when you reevaluate
property and the citizens have the right to appeal to that to try to get
the rates down. With Wake County getting so big in population, County
Government would like to have, to be able to have two patterns so they

Representative Davis and Howard, House Bill 39, a bill to be entitled an
act to increase the penalties for the illegal operation of amusement
devices. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from New Hanover, Representative Davis, is recognized to
debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the House, on the
evening of Thursday, October the 24th, 2013 an accident occurred on the
vortex amusement device at the NC State Fair. The Vortex is an adult
amusement ride featuring two passenger carriers, each of which contains
four groups of four seats for 32 seats total. During the unloading
process, the ride restarted unexpectedly and threw several patrons from
the ride. While trying to address the unexpected restart, a ride
attendant was also injured, in total four patrons and one employee were
injured in the accident. Beginning on the night of October 24 and
continuing for several months, a thorough investigation was conducted.
The investigation found that safety mechanisms on the Vortex device had
been intentionally circumvented, which ultimately resulted in the
unexpected restart of the ride on October 24. Due to the injury of one
employee, the North Carolina Department of Labors, Occupational, Safety,
and Health Division issued citations and civil penalties against the
amusement device company and the owner. Due to several violations of the
Amusement Device Safety Act which resulted in the injury to four ride
patrons, the North Carolina Department of Labors Elevator and Amusement
Device Bureau issued citations and civil penalties against the amusement
device company, owner, and ride operator. However, despite the findings
of the department investigation, no one involved int he accident could
be charged criminally under the Amusement Device Safety Act since no
fatalities occurred, although the accident did result in very serious
injuries to at least one patron. That is because, under the current law,

  <p id="135:00">
  a person who willfully violates any provision of the Amusement Device
Safety Act can only be charged criminally if the violation results in a
fatality. Additionally, under the current law, the person can only be
charged with a misdemeanor and the current law also allows a fine of up
to $10,000 for a first offense and $20,000 for a subsequent offense.
What the bill before you would do if it is passed would be to increase
the penalty for each day each device is operated or used in violation of
this article as follows, for operation without a certificate or not in
accordance with the article of rules and regulations, to an amount up to
$2,500 for each rule, regulation, or article section violated. It is now
just $250. For operation after refusal to issue or after revocation of
certificate or for violating a liability insurance or reporting
requirements to an amount up to $5,000. It&#39;s presently $500. For
violation of the location notice provisions to an amount up to $2,500,
presently it is only $500. For violation of reporting requirements or a
violation of statutory operator requirements to an amount not to exceed
$5,000, presently only $500. For operation of an unsafe device or
operation of a device while impaired, up to $10,000. It is now only
$1,000. This bill would also authorize a Commission of Labor to
determine whether the amount of the fine is appropriate given the annual
gross volume of the business, the seriousness of the violation, the
presence or absence of good faith, and whether there have been any
previous violations. This bill would also increase the punishment for a
willful violation of any provision of the article from a class 2
misdemeanor and the possibility of a fine of up to $10,000 and a
subsequent condition punishable as a class 1 misdemeanor and possibility
of a fine up to $20,000. This bill would also add a new subsection
providing that willful violation of any provisions of this article that
results in serious injury or death constitutes a class E felony
punishable by a fine of up to $50,000. This bill would also add a new
subsection that would provide that any state prosecutor may impose or
may proceed against a violator on a charge of willful or culpable
homicide. There was a very good discussion of this proposed bill in
Judiciary 3 where it received a favorable report. There is an identical
bill in the Senate now and the Senate is waiting to see what we do in
the House on this bill before they do anything with theirs. Obviously,
if this bill does pass it would be sent over and the Senate would not
proceed with their identical bill. At this time, Mr. Speaker, if I may,
I&#39;d like to make a technical amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will
read.

Representative Davis moves to amend the bill on page 2, lines 22-23, by
rewriting the lines to read:
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.

Yes, all this does is reword those lines to correctly state that the
serious injury or death of any person, then the person shall be guilty
of a Class E felony, which may include a fine of not more than $50,000,
and I would ask that the body please pass the amendment.

Thank you sir. I&#39;ve been going through the bill and I just wanted to
ask a quick question. You had mentioned that, and I want to understand
this. You had mentioned that if an injury occurs or even a death occurs,
would the manufacturer or the distributor of the ride or whatever it is,
would they be included in that or is it just the people involved in the
actual using of the ride and maintaining of the ride?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, thank you for that question. Under this legislation, the person
doing the operating or the company running it would be the ones that you
proceed against. It will be in those doesn&#39;t mean that someone might
not do a civil action, where they could try to get compensation from the
manufacturer.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Gentleman from Nash, Representative Collins, is recognized to debate
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Let me say first of all, for those of you who
were in either Public Utilities or Finance Committee last week, Senate
Bill 305 is the exact same bill word-for-word as House Bill 265, which
passed favorably out of both of those committees last week. Those of you
that have been here for a few years know that I don&#39;t stand up
infrequently but I usually stand up and speak very succinctly and
don&#39;t take much of your time, I rarely speak more than two or three
minutes, this may go four or five and I apologize for that in advance.
This is something that goes a long way back with me. In 2010, when I was
a political neophyte running for office for the very first time, as I
was going around knocking on doors in Nash County, another fella who was
running for office for the first time, a fella named Buck Newton, was
riding around with me in the truck a lot of times and as we would drive
from neighborhood to neighborhood, between going up to doors, we would
talk about what we could do if we were elected for the people of our
area. What could we do that would absolutely help them more than
anything else? And this was a topic that came up over and over, and over
again. He&#39;s from Wilson, I&#39;m from Rocky Mount, two of the 32 in
the campus municipalities. If we could anything to help the rate payers
in our area with their exorbitant electric rates, that would help more
than anything else. Realize that where I live this affects everyone,
from the poorest residential rate payers to the biggest industrial users
of electricity. We did get elected and we weren&#39;t given much hope of
success. We were told over and over again this is a 30-year-old problem,
you&#39;re not going to solve it, it&#39;s been studied to death,
everybody&#39;s looked at it, there is no solution, you&#39;re just
wasting your time. But we were two pretty hard-headed freshmen who
didn&#39;t take what was probably good advice and we begged and cajoled
and whined and everything else until the Speaker of the House and the
President Pro Tem of the Senate agreed to appoint a joint study
committee and make Senator Newton and I the co-chairs of that and in
2011, as some of you who were on that know, we began to study this
issue. Let me just read you the study committee that was appointed met
from October 2011 until May of 2012 and we gave our report. Let me just
read you a couple of the findings of that report. Finding number one
was, &quot;at this time the rates of the municipal electric systems
operated by members of the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Electric
Power Agency are significantly higher than the rates for service offered
by the investor on utilities, 38% of the whole sale rate for electricity
paid by members of NCEMPA is used to pay this debt.&quot; I hope you
picked up that number. I know in Rocky Mount 30 cents of every dollar I
pay for electricity goes to nothing but debt reduction. That means I buy
70 cents of electricity for every dollar I pay. That&#39;s a 42% premium
on electricity. The total debt of NCEMPA at that time, January 1st,
2011, was $2.25 Billion. Another finding was the high electric rates of
the NCEMPA member cities have affected economic development in these
cities. That&#39;s an understatement. A related statement, the high
electric rates of the NCEMPA member cities exacerbate the effects of the
loss of industrial business. One of the people who testified in front of
our committee actually has an agricultural production facility that is
split across two electric grids, half of his plant is in the
ElectriCities area, half of it is in the Duke Progress Direct zone and
he testified that just the half of his plant that&#39;s in the
ElectriCities grid, the extra cost he was paying

  for that half of the plant was $350,000 more than he would be paying if
the whole plant were on due progress directly. So you can imagine trying
to recruit an industry that knows they&#39;re going to get a $700,000
excess in their bill just from being on that grid. Dr. Thomas Stith of
the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise found that the rate payers in
NCEMPA have paid $240 million more in electric rates each year as
compared to other rate payers in the state. Two-hundred and forty
million dollars a year. Folks, that&#39;s a lot. It&#39;s been a noose
around the neck of eastern North Carolina for a long, long time.
Fortunately, a number of things happened after--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose--I can&#39;t see where--does Representative Floyd rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to know if the bill sponsor will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will you yield, Representative Collins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, when you first got up you indicated something to
me that was very impressive, that you don&#39;t normally speak no more
than about two minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Five minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Floyd. Please continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand you, Representative Floyd, but this is the one pet project
I&#39;ve been working on since I&#39;ve been here. I apologize. This is
the one time I&#39;m going to have my say. And I&#39;ll apologize in
advance to you for that. Because normally I&#39;m like you, I like to, I
like not to waste people&#39;s time. A number of things happened after
the study committee in 2011 that actually helped Senator Newton and I
and others who were trying to get this problem solved. Leadership, new
leadership at NCEMPA, began to seriously pay down the debt. It&#39;s
down now to $1.7 billion. It&#39;s been decreased by over $500 million
since we held that study committee just four years--well, just
three-and-a-half years ago. Now that might not sound like much to you,
but the debt had only gone down about 1.2 billion in the 27-plus years
before that time. Also, the Duke merger put Duke Progress in a much
stronger cash position to be able to look for acquisitions that might
help their business model. Today, these parties are asking us to enter
into an agreement that would benefit NCEMPA customers by reducing
NCEMPA&#39;s debt by more than 70%. It would help the non-NCEMPA Duke
Progress customers by lowering Duke Progress&#39;s fuel costs by an
estimated $70 a year. So this will help people on both sides of that
deal. All of North Carolina wins because a major impediment to economic
development in 32 municipalities is greatly decreased by this bill. This
bill is a market-driven solution to a long-term problem. The two sides
have negotiated a sale in which both sides gain benefits. This solution
requires no appropriation of state monies, nor does it affect the
state&#39;s bond capacity or credit rating. I know of no opposition to
this bill. I&#39;m not going to bore you by going through it section by
section. If you&#39;d like to ask questions about it, I&#39;ll be happy
to answer them. I would ask that you join me in rejoicing with the rest
of the people in these 32 municipalities today, by voting yes on Senate
Bill 305, and I thank you for your indulgence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pierce of Scotland is recognized to debate the bill, and
while he&#39;s rising, the clerk informs me that this is a roll-call
bill, we will have third reading tomorrow as well. Representative
Pierce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I first of all want to
thank you, a little premature thank you for your yes vote on this very
important piece of legislation today. I represent three of these areas
that will be affected: the Red Springs, the town of Lumberton, and
Laurinburg, North Carolina. And I speak for those who are unable to be
here today to tell you thank you for this legislation. It would
definitely make a difference in the communities that I serve. It&#39;s a
win-win situation for all of us going forward. Just looking at some of
the press release I had from some of my local papers, and how excited
our city councilmen they are about this legislation. It&#39;s just a
great thing. As a pastor of a church, I have many opportunities to help
people with their light bills in the church. Sometimes the winter
months, the hot summer months, and those bills are very high, I can tell
you that, and this is a great opportunity to lower those bills. There
are some people that have to decide between food and other--medicine,
sometimes--to pay the light bill. So I just think it&#39;s a great day.
I&#39;ve been here five terms, reckon on my sixth--six terms. This is
some legislation that&#39;s been a long time coming and really, the
chamber, we ought to be proud of ourselves today, going forward. This is
a great piece of legislation. Thank you for allowing me to share on
behalf of my constituents who cannot be here today. Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin of Wilson is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I won&#39;t take a lot of time because I
think my colleagues, Representative Collins and Pierce have done a great
job outlining the benefits of this bill. When I first ran for the House,
this was a huge issue for my district, which I share with Senator Buck
Newton.

  And it’s great to see with the persistence of continuing to work at it
and work together to see that we can come up with  solution that
benefits the whole state, its great for business recruitment it’s great
for families it’s  a bipartisan bill, both chambers support it, this is
like an hallelujah moment.  My paper keeps calling me every day every ??
Because they know it’s going to have such an impact.  I think of all the

supporting this, and I also want to thank the folks in the industry, who
work so hard.  The due progress and the ?? of working with us, because
it’s not something we did alone as government, this required all the
stakeholders coming to the table so thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] is

state and to make recommendations as to how the laws may be revised to
better ensure the safety of bicyclists and motorists on the roadways.
?? of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] the gentleman from
Transylvania, representative Whitmeyer is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you mister speaker, I will try to keep gravity
in mind.  This bills intent, is for the department of transportation as
it is spelled out in the bill to lead a directed study of a working
group of key stake holders which is also defined in the bill but also
has latitude for flexibility to study a topic that is 37 years overdue
without a significant update of bicycle safety laws and bring back
recommendations to this body for possible improvements on some
situations that have declined during the short session.  Again, the bill
is designed with latitude for the stakeholders, latitude on topic, it
does touch on a subject that often times gets a lot of blowback.  It’s
had tremendous support, and with that, in the end we want to make sure
our roadways are safe commoners can get to and from market efficiently,
and that motorists and cyclists truly know that it’s a two way street
for sharing the road. Thank you mister speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  for
what purpose does the gentleman from Gilford represent affairs ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill [SPEAKER CHANGES] the gentleman has
the floor to debate the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you mister
speaker, this is a good bill, I recommend it highly, in committee I did
raise the concern that a constituent of mine had given me, she was
involved in riding down a rural road with her husband and a driver came
by and hit her husband and left the scene, he ended up dying. It’s a
very, very sad situation it happens time and again, over our state and
so I raised this concern and I think this study is a good place for
perhaps a revision of out hit and run statutes where a bicycle or a
pedestrian is involved.  A person hitting a car might just think they
did a little damage but if a truck runs into a pedestrian or a bicycle,
you know you’ve hurt somebody.   So I’m convinced that this language in
here will take care of that, looking at that in the study and I urge you
to support the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] for what purpose does the
gentleman from Rowan representative Warren rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] to
ask the bill sponsor a question [SPEAKER CHANGES] does the gentleman
from Transylvania yield to the gentleman from Rowan? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
yield [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you. When an
accident occurs between a motorist and a bicyclist, there is normally a
report that is written out, but it is my understanding that if there is
an accident with a bicycle and an attack by an animal whether it is a
domestic dog or something, there isn’t necessarily a report written out
for that.  I’ve had a constituent campaigning for a bill to require that
but,

  <p id="165:00">
  I&#39;m told by law enforcement to require them to respond to that kind
of a call, to fill out a report, may take them away from a more serious
crime. So I&#39;m just wondering, what your bill, says it would study
other issues related to the bicyclists. Would that be an issue you think
that would be covered as well, or do I need to file a bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker? I&#39;ll answer the question as best I can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Transylvania has the floor to answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A couple things. One, the bill has certain latitudes involved or written
into it, if it navigates the General Assembly and makes it into law. It
is leveraging the Department of Transportation&#39;s Pedestrian and
Bicycle Transportation Division, which has expertise, and it also seeks
to leverage a lot of other key stakeholders&#39; in a lot of areas
expertise. With lines 11 through 16, having some defined topics to look
at and key on line 16, &quot;other issues as determined relevant,&quot;
certainly they can go to places such as Representative Faircloth
mentioned and maybe your topic mentions, too. My caveat is simply they
will be doing this, and I&#39;ve worked with the subject matter experts
there for well back into last year. They will certainly need to be
somewhat cognizant of how many topics they take on. Because none of
these topics are easy. And they&#39;ve been put in the too-hard-to-do
in-basket for way too long, 37 years since a significant update. But
certainly, the worthy topics that come forth, they&#39;ll have to
ultimately prioritize which ones to tackle--on line 16 where they have
the additional latitude. So that&#39;s not a direct answer, but
that&#39;s the best I can do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Haywood, Representative Queen,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill&#39;s sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Transylvania yield to the gentleman from
Haywood?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In my district, bicycling is becoming a very important economic
development driver. We have a lot of folks coming to the mountains to
bike. And we have a lot of safety issues on our mountain roads, as you
do over in Transylvania. So, but biking is a real draw for the
mountains, and it&#39;s becoming more so. Does this bill get involved in
any economic development aspects of making the roads safer for
bicyclists?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wayne, Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A point of order. Are we going to study the bill here, or are we
actually going to approve it so we can study it at a later date?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apparently we&#39;re in the middle of the study, it sounds like. Does
the gentleman from Transylvania yield to the question from the gentleman
from Haywood?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields, and I believe it&#39;s the gentleman from Transylvania has
the--I apologize, I was conferring with a couple committee chairs. The
gentleman from Transylvania has the floor to respond to the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will emphasize it is a study bill, and what this bill does is find an
eloquent way to address a lot of topics that oftentimes, if taken in
isolation, create a lot of blow-back. So, in the end, yes, cycling is
very important to much of our state, from Murphy to Manteo, 543 miles
from tip to tip. So in the end the working group of 12, under the
facilitation and direction initially of DOT&#39;s subject matter
experts, that then expands into the overall working group, certainly
items like that I&#39;m sure will come before their discussion. But to
what degree they can solve all those problems, we need them to bring
back items for our consideration, so that we can do something more than
just study it and talk about it. So again, best I can do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Sorry for the long question, but it&#39;s a very important
topic and I hope we will advance cycling in North Carolina.

The House will come back to order. Members, there was another Bill on
the calendar when we were adding that we had objection to, it was House
Bill 255, which was the Reg. Reform Code Enforcement Bill. Is there
still objection to adding the Bill? If there is, we&#39;ll just have to
have a vote on it. Does the— I know Representative ??, you have an
Amendment to the Bill, but I believe Representative Hall made the
objection?
[long pause]
Apparently, the Rules Chair and the Minority Leader spoke and
there&#39;s an agreement that the Bill&#39;ll just be done tomorrow.
I&#39;m assuming no-one&#39;s gonna object to a third reading on it
tomorrow, just dispose of it tomorrow in one day?
[long pause; rhubarb in background; speaker laughing]
It will be on tomorrow&#39;s calendar, and we&#39;ll see how long
it&#39;s on the calendar. Members, if the Body would give the Chair your
attention please? For planning purposes this week, I believe either
Representative Cleveland or Representative Speciale are gonna announce a
change to a scheduled meeting on Thursday. I&#39;ve confirmed— there
were two committees scheduled to meet late morning, and I&#39;ve spoken
with the Chairs of the Environment Committee who&#39;ve indicated their
Bill is not time sensitive and that there&#39;s no rush to take that
Bill up this week, and then the Homeland Security Committee I think is
gonna take their Bill up tomorrow at 12:30, but I don&#39;t want to
steal Representative Cleveland&#39;s thunder on that. That&#39;s the
only other committee that was scheduled to meet on Thursday. Other than
the Appropriations Committees that are meeting at 8:30, are there any
chairs of any committees who are intending to call a meeting for
Thursday that have not yet sent that to either the Clerk&#39;s office or
my office?
[pause]
Okay, I see no lights other than Representative Cleveland, and I know
what his is about. I believe Representative Davis, Local Government, you
are gonna meet tomorrow instead, and maybe one additional meeting, is
that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Cleveland]
Yes, sir. We&#39;re getting together to do a meeting tomorrow, and then
also, probably, fifteen minutes after Session on Thursday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
M&#39;kay. All right. What— Just for planning purposes, Members,
tomorrow&#39;s Session will be at two o&#39;clock [2:00]. Thursday&#39;s
Session will be at ten a.m. [10:00]. The purpose in having Session
Thursday morning at that time is that, Number One: There&#39;s really no
reason in committees meeting to take up bills because we won&#39;t be
here the next week, that&#39;ll be the week of the spring break. So part
of the reason we&#39;ve been adding so many bills on today— I suspect
tomorrow may be a heavy calendar, and Thursday may be a heavy calendar—
