Good afternoon, ?? being present, the house committee on transportation
is now in session. Our sargents in arms today are Carlton Adams, Joe
Cook, Bob Rosse, and Martha Parish, thank you for your service. We have
four pages today, Hannah Simpson, from Gates County, Ryan Titus from
Wake, Patrick Archer from Wayne, and Joseph Bost From ??. Committee
staff ?? Perry, Brenda Carter from researcher here, Lin Taylor, Carl
Farmer, our clerks, representitive ?? is in another committee today. Two
of our bills will be displaced, that is house bill six twenty-one,
electronic vehicle titling, and house bill Seven Eighty-Five cross ?? on
transportation improvements. The two remaining bills will be covered
today, house bill 513 representative Stone is recognized to explain the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ??, thank you committee today. House bill
513 is a simple bill ?? the deal of place law. This bill simply treats
the independent dealers the same as the franchise dealers, any
questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is the explanation of the PCS which on motion of
representative Stone is for, is there any question for the bill sponsor?
Representative Pitman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For motion proper time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's a proper time sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move a full report on house bill 513.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pitman moves ?? report on PCS to 513
unfavorable to the original bill, this will be reported to the floor,
representative Starns.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, why does this change ?? thought this was the law
of man.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? for the staff, to go over the current changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starns, the current law applies to only
franchise dealers, this would allow the employees and officers of
independent dealers to be covered by this provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And one follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And do you have any idea of how many are out there?
These independent dealers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, I don't.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My guess is that it's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For the discussion for the debate, motion is the
approval of the PCS of the house bill 513, all in favor say
&quot;I&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES] &quot;I&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed? Bill carries and will be reported to the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. ?? and thank you committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House bill 673 Bi-optic lenses for drivers license
tests. Representative ?? recognized, is there a PCS on this Tim?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, a motion of represented of PCS is in front of
us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I'll
make this brief, I like the way transportation committee moves along.
This bill is to allow those individuals who have bi-optic lenses to use
those during their testing for their drivers license. For those who may
not know what a bi-optic lens is, if you have ever seen a surgeon and
they have this little thing that looks kind of like a magnifying glass
on the end, it sort of sticks out of the glass, that's the best way I
know how to describe the bi-optic lens. What it does is it allows those
individuals with that vision impairment to be able to, it corrects it so
that they can see. They also have to be able to see safely, and you see
can see how the bill spells it out, and I will tell you their number of
representatives, Mr. Chairman of folks how had asked this bill be filed
if the chairman allows them to speak at some point. But we all had a
meeting in my office with folks form the DMV, and this language came
about as a result of that, and simply it's designed to allow those
individuals who have the bi-optic lens to be able to drive and to be
able to use those for their testing, but at the same time if a person
can not safely operate a motor vehicle than the motion does not have to
issue a drivers license.</p>

In a nutshell, that's what it does, mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Shepard. Oh I'm sorry, did you say you had an
amendment to send forward?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, the PCS incorporated, I didn't know if you wanted to hear from me or
any of the folks who had came by.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How many folks have we got that would like to speak? Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe just one or two of the group, if one or two of you wanted to
speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. Representative Gill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Want to make a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Gill, you got it. Will you come up to the microphone? The
sergeants in arms will show you how to turn it on. Please identify
yourself and your organization that you represent, if any, and please
limit your comments to three minutes. And please speak your name
clearly, because you will be included in the minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Paul Smokowski, and I'm a professor at UNC Chapel Hill. I
also represent the coalition of drivers who use BiOptic lenses in order
to drive. My colleagues and I, we have over a hundred years of driving
experience with perfect safety records. However, we can't get licenses
in North Carolina because we can't use our BiOptic glasses in order to
take the vision testing. So this is not a tenable situation for
consumers. The current law says that BiOptic lenses can be legally used
in North Carolina to legally drive. However, they can't be used in order
to pass the vision testing. No one has been able to explain that law,
and all of our neighboring states, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, have the type of regulation that this
bill allows, which is simply to let BiOptic lenses to be used in the
vision testing. And we've developed this bill in association with the
medical advisory panel from the DMV. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Was there another speaker? I think there's, there's DOT
here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Rita Smallcombe. I'm speaking on behalf of DMV. We actually need an
additional amendment to the bill because after we have done research we
still do not have the capability to allow testing with the BiOptic
lenses. We would like that language stricken from the draft of the bill,
and instead the compromise that we have offered is to allow effective
drivers to bring statements from their healthcare providers stating what
their vision is and that they are safe to operate a motor vehicle. For
us to be able to test with the BiOptic lenses, we would have to replace
our vision testing equipment in all of our license offices. This is a
compromise that we feel where we can accommodate the citizens without
having to go to the expense of replacing our equipment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that's what our PCS did. Is that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The language has not been removed. If you look at different parts of it,
it says after using bioptic lenses to, for the eye test, that needs to
be taken out everywhere that it's referenced.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee will be at ease. Tim? Just so you know, they've worked out, we
should have a, an amendment that will fix this bill in five minutes, so
rather than displace it and bring it back again, we'll go ahead and get
rid of it today. Let's, still have you out of here and plenty of time to
get lunch by one o'clock. The committee stands in recess for eight
minutes. Will the members take their seats? House committee on
transportation is back in order. We have prepared an amendment and
Representative Moore will explain it, and I will put it to the
committee's discretion. We can take the time to make copies, and if
after his explanation you want a copy we'll get you one, or if his
explanation is erudite sufficiently that we can vote without you getting
additional paper I'll get you out of here quicker. Representative
Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can we reserve that recommendation until after we hear the explanation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we'll do that. Representative Moore is recognized to explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just commented, I was the only thing standing between mister Torbett
and his nicotine here so I'm gonna make it quick. He's not a kind of guy
you want to try to block out too much. What the amendment does, members,
if you'll flip to the second page of the bill, and on line two where it
says you're gonna strike through the</p>

<p id="10:00">
filing words after using biopic telescopic lens, lenses for the eye
test, and your going to strike the same words on line 9. Same thing
there and then also in those same sections it has issued a normal
drivers license. i was going to say regular class c. its going to say
that in line 1 its going to say that it line 9. those amendments were
requested by the head of the medical division aot i talked to the member
of the advocates that that's clear the reason to strike that language
about the after using about biopic telescope lens the actually with all
the other certifications wont be able to sit for them and have to sit
with them and do the eye test. If you go in your DMV office you will
notice that theirs like a thing and you stick your head down there and
look at it. Well they cant do that because what i understand is that
they have to create pressure, well to do it that lens sticks out to far
so its just a practical matter so. With that being said Mr. chairman i
would like to move the adoption. Are any members desires-es of having a
hard copy of the amendment. saying no the motion of the. Comment Mr.
chair. Yes. just a comment. yes Mr. Wilkinson. The explanation was great
the hand gesture was much better than that. No extra charge. those in
favor of the amendment say i oppose no. okay the bill as before has been
amendment further discussion further debate. Representative bill is
recognized. Mr. chairman i move for a favorable report to the pcs as
amended, and unfavorable to the original bill. Representative bill moves
that the amendment be rolled into a new pcs unfavorable to the new pcs
favorable to the new bill all in favor say i appose no the I's have it
is there further business for the committee the court is adjourned</p>
