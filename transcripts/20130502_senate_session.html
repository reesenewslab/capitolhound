The President Pro Tempore: The Senate will come to order. The sergeant
at arms will close the doors; the Members will go to their seats.
Members and guests of the gallery will please silence all electronic
devices.
Leading the Senate in prayer is the Reverend Peter Milner, our Senate
Chaplain.
All Members and guests of the gallery will please stand.
The Chaplain: Gracious and loving God, we do come before You and we
thank You for a great state. We live in a great state. And on this
National Day of Prayer, we are moved to see not only that reality here,
but we remember that You are our mighty fortress, that as a nation and
as individuals, we have called upon Your name, and You have placed a
roof over our heads.
We've been attacked, time and time again, but even inside of our hearts,
we all know that it is like a wonderful thing to have a place for us to
be safe, where we can be still and have confidence and other gentle
reminders of protection and imposed upon us here gathered not only Your
Blood but Your Divine  Providence.
Cover us under Your Word. Allay our cares, our thirst, and our desires.
But You're as old as the trees from centuries down. Wind along the roads
of North Carolina to the fountain of Your Grace.
May the prayers of our grandmothers and grandfathers down to the tenth
generation be lifted up to You, Lord Jesus. May they be lifted on high,
and may the thoughts of our minds and meditations of our hearts be
cleansed with hyssup. We commit ourselves again on this day, as did
George Washington commit himself and our country to pray in 1775, to
fast, to cease from recreation. Lord we do this to honor You, Lord we
thank You for our religious freedom, and Lord we thank You for bringing
us together here today in this Senate.
In the Name of Jesus we pray. Amen.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator Berger's recognized for a motion.

Senator Brunstetter for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Two motions related to today's calendar, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter has the floor to make his motions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, Senate Bill 337, NC public charter school board is on

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senators let's come to order as we're moving into the calendar. We'll
start with public bill second reading roll call. Senate Bill 58, the
clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 58 increase funding for dredging.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. I don't think I need to talk a whole lot more
on this bill, I think it's been discussed and talked about and debated
for a while but I think I do need to talk about why the bill is on, was
introduced and what we're having to deal with. For many years the
federal government took care of dredging on the coast of North Carolina
and really, I guess, most of the east coast, but in the past few years
those dollars have pretty much gone away. So, there's really no money
left now for dredging the shallow draft inlets on the coast of North
Carolina. And in the summer I think most of you probably go to the coast
sometime or other, and I can assure you on the 4th of July you can
probably walk across the inner coastal waterway on boats if you want to
because that's how ?? will be in the water on the 4th of July. Probably
when all these votes come to the coast and a lot of the maybe not
living, people that don't live on the coast, one of the most dangerous
places in the world to be is in an inlet that's too shallow to be going
in and out of and you end up on the bottom. There's probably more
drowning in Ellis than any other place on the coast because of that
issue. So it is definitely an issue for the coast. Plus on the coast of
North Carolina there's quite a few fishing tournaments, some of the best
fishing tournaments in the country happen in North Carolina and they all
depend on those boats being able to get in and out of those inlets. As
we work through this bill, my first version usually did the fee
increases on boats, and I listened to the concerns. So I went back and
reworked this bill and been working on it I think to a point that now
we're talking about registration fees that really haven't been touched
in a long time and the existing fees on boats now are $15 per year to
register a boat. And that's been in place for quite a while. I think
Senator Bingham had a bill yesterday that raised the fees on getting a
permit for a gun yesterday. So we look at raising these fees quite
often. The  ?? bill does is if you have a 25 foot boat or less it raises
the registration fees on boats from $15 to $25. I'd say a pretty modest
increase, especially the fee hasn't been increased for a long time. If
you have a 26 footer or above, we're going to raise that fee from $15 to
$50 dollars, and most, pretty much any boat that's a 26 foot or above is
going to be on the coast because that's your bigger boats. I don't think
you'll see many of those in any lakes across the state. It also raises
the title fee $10 as well to capture some money, and the rest of the
money is coming from the highway fund and there was an article in the
paper yesterday that I think
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p id="010:00">
[0:00:00.0]
…Quote this right and a lot of people feel their both steps at the pump
in the state of North Carolina, when they feel they cover up they have
the both behind it and they will feel both as well as their cars at the
same time and this is doing is recapturing a small percentage of those
dollars that are in the highway fund one sixth of 1% and that generates
a little over two million dollars. So, what we have generated overall is
a little over six million dollars but I think the most important piece
of this when…And I think the most difficult piece will be the people
live on the coast is a bit poorly these dollars down is gotta be a
dollar-for-dollar mash over communities on the coast. So, a coastal
community that lives next to an inlet they are gonna have to match those
dollars dollar-for-dollar to pull them down to be used for dragging on
the coast. So, the coast communities have a whole lot of this and the
game to pull these dollars down. There is an article I was reading
earlier today it talk about the fairies__[01:02] in North Carolina, one
of the fairies is gotten so shallow in that very that two fairies can’t
pass each other any longer besides shallows gotten in some of those
areas and there is a serious, serious issue on the coast, what it means
the state dollars I think economically for the coast and the state as a
whole if these are inlet shallow you pull the buoys they go away, it
means millions of dollars to the state of North Carolina and tourism
dollars that come to the state. Again, I think I have voted on this will
all session I think it’s a pretty good compromise where we are at, one
of the questions I think Senator Nesbitt asked me about drenching in
lakes in the state, state dollars are used now to do that so we use
state dollars to drench lakes when that’s needed. So, I think we have
touched every area I know this bill it is not a coastal issue it is a
state issue, people from all over the state come to the coast pulling
boats. So, I’m asking for your support on this bill and import bill to
the coast and into the state. And I try to answer any questions if there
are any.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
for the…Senator Tucker would you like to speak to the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No Sir, I would like to ask in reference to the bill ask Senator Walters
a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters do you yell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters now as we have heard in committee with a raise in fees
and now the reduction in fees for boats, will you be register in your
boats in North Carolina now rather than South Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker I think Senator Brown explained the bill very well and I
will support the bill at this time, thank you.
[Laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
for the Senate is the passage of Committee Substitute #2 to Senate Bill
58 on its second reading, all in favor will vote aye, all oppose will
vote no, five seconds will be allowed for the voting and the clerk will
record the vote. Gunn aye, 35 having voted in the affirmative and 13 in
the negative, the committee substitute #2 to Senate Bill 58 passes its
second reading and it will remain on the calendar. Senator further down
in your calendar Senate Bill 476 is local bill, we are gonna move that
up for the next reading. So, the clerk will read Senate Bill 476.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 476: NC Captive Insurance Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate, this bill Captive
Insurance Companies or insurance companies that are formed to insure the
risk apparent and affiliates and control by unaffiliated companies

management tools to meet or assistant meeting the needs of owners or

as members of the thankful. let me bring this bill for Senegal for a
non- protected consumers continued access to traditional instalment
credit are North Carolina consumer finance act, would you give a brief
description of what design the design cash maximum loan amount of
fifteen thousand dollars a pop in his right calf from thirty six to
thirty, and making slight adjustments within the three divine minion

continues to maintain worked on strong consumer protections, especially
for military members and it significantly reduces the APR class on
smaller dollar lines. members of Montréal residents deserve expand
access to reasonable, safe and regulated instalment credit to finance
acts of and in the provision and there had been in here to mistake seven
decades, and they deserve to have these all available devices regulated
and examined companies, Commissioner of Banks is a proven top regulator
when growing us have not been adjusted for thirty years it was believed
that after thirty years of inflation. some reasonable adjustments are
necessary. all customers need to understand their need to make the
payments on time and contract licensing should have the ability to
collect a nominal nominal fifteen dollars late fee, just like banks,
credit card companies and other lenders, customers do not take late
charges. all are only overpaid men if made within that. the maximum
amounts available should be increased somewhat more, consumers should
have access to credit military protections, nothing is real important in
response to the concerns of various military bases instrument is several
landmark protections that will provide a new level of protection for our
young soldiers and their families. as a result of these provisions,
Nevada commanders Council and a consensus vote is taken another position
on this particular vehicle. but they did tell us that those provisions
must remain and we have all met here to their request, Commissioner of
Banks is taken another position on Senate Bill four eighty nine,
Commissioner Banks did request an industry has included language
providing additional protections for non- file coverage if it is
obtained. I would find out that the neurotrauma commissioner banks and
the Justice Department commented in the consumer finance study and
February two thousand eleven. if you are the remarks no compelling
evidence was submitted by consumer advocates are describing a review of
the North Carolina commission of banks and just about also support the

intermediation
work on a commission of nice data collection does not distinguish
in-depth informational renewable that came up in committee. they do not
report according to size Tom or amount advanced industry would be
supportive of more comprehensive data collection, licensees. this is, we
believe this bill is reasonable and needed and well just thought of this
time, given the fact that it has been thirty years without any
adjustment. this bill provides several avenues to reduce renewable. one
elimination elimination all of chapter fifty three, one seventy three on
the small lung chapter includes a performance which makes it easier for
customer and company instead of renewing the loan. it raises the minimum
time from six to twelve months to create smaller payments that would
lessen the chances for customers to become overwhelmed. Susan, the

Actually, I’d like to send forth a series of four amendments, if that’s
okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ll send them forth one at a time here. And we’ll vote on them one at
a time as well, Senator. Is the next amendment on the dashboard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, it should appear on the dashboard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The purpose of this particular amendment here is to exempt the spouse
from being contacted in the event that the member who has signed for the
loan happens to end up in the theater of war.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To find my notes. I appreciate you, Senator Clark, bringing this
amendment. I believe that this is an additional protection for the
consumers and particular for our young military family and I would
encourage you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill’s sponsor encourages you to support the amendment.
Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Senator would yield for a questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark, if this amendment passes with the approval of this body,
do you intend to support the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It depends on the status of the other amendments that I will also send
forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you yield, Senator Clark?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark, if your other amendments, which I think I know what they
are, but if they don’t pass, but this one does, will you support the
bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the amendment regarding pulling this or not allowing this to go to a
military member does not pass, I will not support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate Senator Clark’s honesty on the series of amendments that he
intends to set forth. I think this is a sound amendment and I’d like to
see it included in the bill, but I really would like to see Senator
Clark’s support of the entire bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the passage of amendment one. All in favor vote aye, all
opposed vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk
will record the vote.
Tucker, aye. Berger.
47 having voted in the affirmative and 0 in the negative, amendment one
is adopted.
Senator Clark, you sent forth another amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that amendment is on the dashboard.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark is recognized to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This particular amendment is actually required by federal statute, but
we thought it would be appropriate to actually include it in the state
statute as well. Just make sure there’s no...if a person is charged a
late fee it’s not pyramiding on an individual because the particular
company might say, ok, you were late in making your payment, therefore
you didn’t pay your entire thing on time, therefore you’re going to get
charged another late fee and it just continues to go on and on and on.
This particular provision would preclude that from happening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There any discussion or debate? Senator Gunn, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Once again, I would like to thank the distinguished Senator for bringing
this amendment forward. I think once again, that in an effort to try to
work with everybody in this chamber, I am going to support this
amendment and I would encourage you to do so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill’s sponsor encourages your support. Is there any further
discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is
the passage of amendment two. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote
no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will record

The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark is recognized to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Effectively what this amendment does is it removes the provision in the
bill that says that we’re going to be allowed to provide this particular
loan to military members. As written, the bill says we can provide it...</p>

Senator ___ yelled for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yelled for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark you are Four Star Admiral is retired.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And he represents a Navy, Marine Corps Relief Society.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In what capacity?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He has it up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He hedge to that as a retired…What state is he in?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t know what state he is in, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do say it’s not North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman has the floor to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have offered two good amendments and I think you have thrown in one
that you don’t like so you can go against the bill Senator that’s good
work if you wanna do it that way thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn what purpose you has?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m gonna ask the members here to not support this amendment. I do think
there is a big difference in the letter that Senator Clark gave you and
a letter that I have signed here by Thomas A. Gory Brigadier General US
Marine Corps Chairman, North Carolina Commanders Council, North Carolina
Commanders Council. They have taken no position they are tickled to
death and I wanna go through on that but they have tickled to death that
we have lived and worked ___[01:26] with these folks to put additional
provisions for these hard serving members and their families, I would
ask you to not support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those sponsors ask not to support the amendment, is there any further
discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is
the passage of Amendment 3, all in favor will vote aye, all oppose will
vote no, five seconds will be allowed for the voting the clerk will
record the vote. 14 having voted in the affirmative and 34 in the
negative, amendment 3 fail. Senator Clark you have a fourth amendment,
Senator Clark you send forward your amendment the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark is recognized to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As indicated previously I was I guess provide on these particular loans
with the members of the military.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[Inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry, as I indicated previously I was against providing these
particular loans with the members of military but I’m equally concerned
about providing this product to members that are not are at the
military. Okay, I just believe them to just rise too high so what I’m
recommending in this particular bill as that we invert them to just the
way structured which bring up this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think there is gonna be an image displayed on your dashboard members
for you to review.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you look on your dashboard you will see a PowerPoint there saved as
PDF. Okay, under the current board structure basically has 500 I mean
$5,000 increment. What bill is saying is that for the first $5,000 we
are gonna charge 24% interest. And the second $5,000 I mean the second
$5,000 24% going further remainder 18% but what I’m saying is
essentially invert that structure, on the first 5,000 we charge 18%, the
second 5,000 we charge 24% and then on the final 5,000 we charge 30%.
Now, what the industry is saying they can’t afford that but I don’t
believe that’s necessarily true, I do believe that they can charge lower
interest rates and still make money, next slide please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senator still explains the amendment…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, the next slide we just see here this is a comparison between what
our bill here is doing and what is just taken place in floor, okay. So,
if you look on the right hand side you see the floor bill they just
passes on May 1st, okay. Now, actually what they will do is providing
loans…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me…! Like the ___[04:34] so I would have to hold.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, they are actually providing loans up to $25,000 but that will just
kept to $15,000 for comparison purposes. So, you can see with floor what
they are doing is the first 5,000 they are charging but actually 30% on
the first 3,000 they are charging 24% on the next thousand well as on
the other hand on the first 5,000 we are charging 30%...

Representative: …you have this service to go to, to try to help these
people, and, in most cases, who have happened to get a job now, have no
transportation, or have credit card debt that is, in my opinion, is even
worse than these because you never end up paying it off. What you find
is that people can get these loans and in most cases, Senator Newton hit
it right, in most cases these loans are $5000 or less. These are not big
loans. So if you look at the total amount of interest paid on these
loans, in the scheme of things, that interest is really a small amount,
but what it does is, in my opinion, most importantly, it gives that
individual an opportunity to build some credit. I know in committee we
talked about this and I could not get statistics, because they were not
out there, but I can tell you personally, for my business, if I can get
someone one of these loans and they will pay it for a year, year in a
half, and pay those payments on time, I normally can take that customer
and put them in a conventional loan next time, and really help them get
in a better financial situation. Now if you have got individuals that
are not going to pay these loans either, then I cannot fix that problem,
and I don’t think anyone in this building can fix that problem. I think
these are good step loans for most people to rebuild their credit and
put them into a better situation – to, in the future, be in a better
position to buy a car, home, whatever it may be, but the chance to
improve their credit situation to improve their style of life. Surely
these interest rates were high – no one is going to ague with that, but,
you have got someone who is willing to take a chance on these
individuals to fix that problem. I would say in most cases most people
will pay this debt and improve their credit situation in the future. I
think this is a good deal. I think this amendment hurts what these
businesses are trying to do. I cannot support this amendment. I think we
are beating these people up, Most of them have gone out of business in
the last few years, so it is not like this is a lucrative business where
everybody is making a ton of money. They are taking a ton of risk, and I
think you need to defeat this amendment. I think you have a good bill
that helps put people in a better situation for the future.
Speaker: Any further discussion or debate? Senator Bryant, I’m sorry,
Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: [laughter] I will be Senator Bryant, I like her. I rise
to speak to the amendment and I want to ask the amendment’s sponsor a
question first.
Speaker: Senator Clark do you yield?
Representative: I will yield.
Representative: Senator Clark, back to your chart, and maybe I am
reading it wrong, but could you re-explain that because it does appear
that up to $5000 that is at 30%, but is that currently what is in place?
Are you offering the reverse of that? Could you explain that please?
Representative: Could you bring up the chart please?
Representative: I am looking at my dashboard.
Speaker: It is on your dashboard Senator.
Representative: Okay, you have S [xx] 89 m, that is as the current bill
is written. That is not my recommendation. My recommendation is on the
right hand side, in blue, the first $5000, and 18% interest rate would
apply. As opposed to the bill, as currently written, a 30% interest rate
would apply. All of that is essentially inverted the structure. On the
left hand side, the bill is currently written. It goes 30, 24, 18. I am
saying let’s reverse that, going 18, then on the next 5000, 24, then on
the next 30,000, I mean the next 5000, 30%. I presented this to the
industry officials who said they could not do it because they could not
afford it. That is why I showed you the [xx], in which case it served
what Florida is doing. They are charging a lower structure than what we
have. So I am certain that we can do better than as currently stated in
this 489.
Representative: Thank you. Follow up, Mr. Chair?
Speaker: Senator, do you yield for a follow up?
Representative: Well actually, I will just speak on the amendment.
Speaker: Senator Robinson has the floor to speak on the amendment.
Representative: I want to support the amendment because, while I would
generally support this bill because it is an alternative to high credit</p>

cost rates and I think we do need to have an alternative.  I too am
concerned about high interest rates for people who are the working class
poor who really don’t have, Senator Brown, anywhere to borrow money from
have bad credit.  But the issue I have is still it’s a high rate and
secondly there is no counseling.  Financial counseling is so very
important where Senator Brown would offer that to his customers and then
later offer conventional loan.  In general there are not people out
there who says a condition of  this loan, after you pay this off or
while you’re paying this off, you need to come in for consumer credit
counseling so we can help you with financial literacy.  To understand
how this impacts your long term ability, to have good credit to buy a
house to buy a car, etc.  And so I think that this is a good
alternative.  I support the amendment.  I am concerned still about the
overall lack of consumer credit counseling.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr.
President.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Brown for the purpose of your
rise.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Just to speak a second time real quick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Brown has the floor to speak to the amendment
a second time.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I think you see on a $5,000 loan
you’re talking about $489 in interest.  That’s what we’re talking about.
 I’m gonna ask this question.  Is there anybody in this room that will
loan someone $5,000 that has a 450 beacon, with terrible credit, with a
$489 return?  I’m gonna ask that question.  I don’t think anybody in
this, anybody would do that.  I think that is a small return for the
risk that’s out there.  You need to think about what these people are
doing and they’ve got to make a profit out of that as well.  That is a
pretty reasonable, I think, loan to make.  I think that’s the question
you’ve got to ask.  I wouldn’t make that loan personally.  I wouldn’t
loan my dollars out there.  Think about it in that respect.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Any further discussion or debate?  Senator Gunn for the
purpose of your rise.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  You’re having too much fun
I’ve got to speak to the amendment police.  Let me just reemphasize 30
years, how many people in this room own a business, been associated,
have been 30 years without an increase.  30 years without an increase.
Unless you’re in the real estate business which is non-profit. Years of
inflation folks, years of inflation, normal business increases every
single year these are reasonable rates that have been proposed.  The
North County Commissioner banks has stated in their report that 40 to 50
percent of these companies are operating at a loss.  I’d ask you to
defeat this amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Nesbitt for what
purpose do you rise?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. President, to
speak on the amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate, I
rise for two purposes.  One of them, a while ago there was, I think
Senator Clark was accused of offering bad amendments so he could vote
against the bill.  I just want to say from my perspective and knowing
him and having listen to him, he firmly believes that this is
detrimental to the military and he’s defending the people that he knows.
 Just like I’d defend the folks in the mountains and y’all would defend
the folks, the farmers and whoever else.  And I really sincerely feel
that, but I don’t think it’s proper to prescribe motives to people
offering amendments.  And as we have gone through this the question
becomes how much is enough?  You do have inflation, but we also had a
depression.  And we also, you can get a home loan for 2½% now.  I think
that’s what I saw on tv,  2 ½ or 3 or 3 ½ %.  The FEDs loaning the big
banks money for nothing, zero, unless that’s changes lately.  And the
cost of capital was gone way down.  And there’s no question this
industry had a tough go.  A lot of them are in the second mortgage
business and when the housing market collapsed so did their collateral
and so did their loans, but that happened to everybody.  Everything
collapsed.  And I feel for them</p>

<p id="055:00">
Representative: I think they are a good industry and I want them to stay
here, but I think that it is legitimate to raise the point of how much
is enough, and what the rate ought to be, and whether they would make it
in today’s world without increasing these rates on the people, secondly,
I want to add to the debate that there was some discussion on credit
counseling when the credit unions came to visit us this year, I had a
long conversation with them, and I asked them what kind of loans they
were making this year: they are making every kind. I asked how they were
doing it because everybody’s credit is ruined, just like Senator Brown
said. A lot of people that did not have a hard time had their credit
scores ruined because they cut credit lines and they did things like
that, that bump your credit score up when you make your payments and
everything else. They actually do a thing when somebody comes to them
and has a bad credit score, they put them in a loan and require them….I
am not sure about that… They offer them a course on how to rebuild your
credit. They actually teach it at the credit union, and the people come
like one day a week. The minute you get your credit score up, they move
you to another loan with a better interest rate. That’s what we need to
be doing for people with bad credit, not just sticking them in a loan
with a high interest, leaving them, and letting them do the best they
can. The first thing that will happen to them is they will not be able
to make this payment, and like you said, nothing can fix it. So, we may
want to think about that. We may want to think about requiring people,
at a minimum, who make high interest rate loans, to offer – I am not
sure credit counseling does it, some way for them to work themselves out
of it. These people, if the risk is less, they ought to be able to offer
a better rate. I assume that they do because these are maximum rates. I
assume they do. So we may want to look at that as we move through this
bill to see if we can come up with some way to accommodate this need as
well as the difficulty that people find themselves in.
Speaker: Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before
the senate is the passage of amendment 4 to senate bill 489. All in
favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for the voting. 9 having voted in the affirmative, 39 in the
negative. Amendment 4 fails and senate bill 489 is back before us on a
second reading. Is there further discussion or debate? Senator McKisick,
for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To speak on the bill.
Speaker: You have the floor.
Representative: First I would like to ask the bill’s sponsor a question.
Senator Gunn, do you yield?
Speaker: Senator Gunn, do you yield?
Representative: I yield.
Speaker: He yields.
Representative: Senator Gunn, the statistics I have seen, relating to
these types of loans, indicate that 2/3 of the people obtaining these
loans simply had been turned over – they keep flipping them and they
never get out of this cycle of debt. Is there any language in your bill
that would limit that problem so we know that people can somehow
eliminate that cycle of debt people seem to be trapped in, because I
know that 2/3 of these people are going to end up in this cycle
indefinitely, and one day, may end up in bankruptcy?
Representative: Senator McKisick, I think you heard those same
statistics in meeting and remember that the response is that the NC
commissioner of banks does not have data that breaks down the reasoning
of why it is 60%, but let me tell you this, these are fully amortized
loans – fully amortized. People are paying these down from the day they
get them. If they want to refinance, and I do not know about you folks,
but knowing my business, we refinance all the time. As a matter of fact,
there are lines of credit that I work with but the point is this, they
do not allow you to take out, the company cannot, take out another loan
without</p>

Internet right now.  We don't even want to know what's going on.  And
we're seeing an alarming amount of folks starting to use sources, as we
restrict credit here, they're going to go other places.  So I would like
to, however, ask you to support the amendment as presented.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on amendment five?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissak, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the amendment's sponsor a clarifying question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn, do you yield?  Senator Clark, your microphone is on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn, just for purposes of clarification, it's my understanding
right now your bill allows the 18% between 10,000 to 15,000.  Are you
proposing that that 18% also go from 5,000 to 10,000?  I just wanted to
be clear.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe if I've got my amendment right.  Originally we were 30 to
five, 24 to 10, and 18 to 15, on a blended rate.  What this amendment
will do is say if you are taking a loan out between 10,000 and $15,000,
we're going to fix that rate at 18%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion on amendment five?  Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose
do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Senator Gunn yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It'd make my Thursday afternoon.  It's basically the same question.  I
still can't understand what you're doing.  The chart I'm looking at
shows 18 percent at a loan above 10,000 dollars.  What's different?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe I'm answering this correctly.  The way that the bill has been
presented, it is a blended rate.  It is a blended rate.  In other words,
you're going to pay 30 up to five, then when we go to between five and
10, it goes to 24, but those rates are blended, and if you go from 10 to
15, it would go down to 18, but all that is blended.  With this, for the
higher loans we're going to charge anything over 10 it will be a flat
rate of 18% instead of a blended rate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on amendment five?  Hearing non, question
before the senate is the passage of amendment five, the senate bill 489.
 All in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no.  Five seconds
will be allowed for the voting.  The clerk will record the vote.  47
voted aye.  48 having voting in the affirmative, and none in the
negative, amendment five to senate bill 489 passes, and the bill is back
before you on second reading.  Further discussion or debate?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clodfelter, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, members.  We've been at this for a while, and I apologize
senator Brunstetter, I can see you, for taking more of your time.  But I
need to do that.  The debate we've had so far shows how complicated this
can be and how difficult this is to sort of sort through all the moving
parts and try to find a place that's good for our folks.  I think the
bill does that, especially in light of the amendment that was added, and
I need to sort of tell you why I think that.  Many of you few who have
been here for while know that I have been one of the most outspoken
critics and opponents of the so-called payday lending industry, which
has recently raised its head again in something called the advance, or
the deposite advance kind of product, is currently receiving a lot of
scrutiny from the control of the currency and the number of our larger
banks are offering that, it's really payday lending in disguise.  In
part because of my position on that, I have felt it incumbent and be
responsible about providing an alternative.  It's not going to be
sufficient to simply eliminate the bad industry without giving people an
alternative and a better way to secure credit.  They're going to need
it, they're going to want it, they're going to have it.  It's going to
be provided in some way.  And so, after an awful lot of study, an awful
lot of frankly agonizing about it, I came to the position that maybe the
best thing we can do here is to try to revive this industry, to extend
this industry, to make the loan products offered by this industry
available for another 30 years, as they've been available for decades in
the past.  I think there's a real question about whether that would</p>

<p id="075:00">
if we do nothing, if we simply sit and allow this regulatory structure
put in place thirty years ago to simply continue unadjusted and
unexamined and unreviewed, I do not believe this industry will be
available to our citizens as a credit alternative in a very short period
of time. Let me add to the debate some facts, some statistics. In 2007,
the number of licensees offering loan products under these  current
chapters of the general statutes was had 586 licensed offices in the
state. By 2011 the number of those offices had fallen by over a hundred
to 488. When we check the number now in 2013 it's down further. It's now
down to 458. These offices are closing all across North Carolina.
When you look at the 2011 report of the Commissioner of Banks on the
consumer finance industry, one thing struck me very powerfully. Most of
these offices that this industry, the product of this industry provides,
are in offices located in small towns, andrural communities, where there
is virtually no other alternative source of credit. The banks have
abandoned those communities. The large banks have abandoned those
communities. And that's where those communities and the citizens there
depend upon this industry as a source of old-fashioned, face-to-face
credit. Where you can go into a store front in your community, and deal
accross the desk with a live human being. Somebody who might understand
if you need a payment deferral. somebody who might understand if you
need a little bit of a slack on your loans. Somebody who can help you
constructure a loan which best fits your repayment abilities rather than
simply taking cash advance on an out of state credit card and then
having a call center overseas somewhere deal with you when you've got a
problem repaying your credit card monthly payments.
I think that old-fashioned way of lending is really valuable. I think
it's really valuable to consumers, and I think there is a real chance we
will lose it if we do nothing. Senator McKissick, with all respect, the
companies that are licensed in North Carolina, yes, Landmark and
Springleaf are among them, but when you look down the list of licensees
in North Carolina, they start off with Mutual Credit Company in Spruce
Pine with one office. Career Home Services in Elkin, with one office.
That's not a Florida office, by the way. The companies that are
regulated by this industry in North Carolina are small and medium-sized
lenders by and large. And they're having difficulty keeping the doors
opened and providing the loan services in the community. As Senator Gunn
said, the Commissioner of Banks analysis, which does an annual analysis,
52 percent of these licensees are showing net operating losses, that's a
net operating loss, that's before you even take into account the cost of
capital on your return on the investment made. You can't keep your doors
open year after year, and that's why the number of offices is declining
so dramatically.
I think this is a good loan product for the reasons that I've said. If
I'm in trouble and I need to talk to a loan officer, I can go to my bank
in Charlotte. If I need some concession or some additional funding, or I
need to restructure my loan, I can go to my bank officer in Charlotte.
But in many communities this is the only option to have that kind of
dialogue with a real lender.
What's the alternative if we do nothing? You know what it is, we've
talked a little bit about it here before. Typically, it's cash advance
on a credit card. A credit card usually from an out-of-state lender who
doesn't have to abide by any limits on interest rates in North Carolina,
and is not regulated by the Commissioner of Banks, and then doesn't
really care whether or not you amortize your loan, talk about a renewal
problem. A cash advance on a credit card that carries from month to
month to month to month to month to month indefinitely, and may never
have the principle amortized -- that's high cost credit with renewal
problems. Then when you need to do something about that can you get
anybody on the phone to talk to? No.
What are those alternative offerings? I took a look at a couple of them.
Just picked a couple of credit cards of interest. One of them, I heard
Senator McKissick refer to the position of the AARP on this legislation.
AARP offers a credit card. You can get a cash advance on that credit
card if you want to. Don't have to amortize it and ?? perpetually
renewed. They'll take your interest every month and never amortize it.
And then, if you add up the fees, the charges, the charge for the cash
advance, the monthly APR on that cash advance, and you'd better hope
you're neverlate, and by the way the late fee on that pay are</p>

<p id="080:00">
...credit card is higher than in this bill. You better hope you're never
late, because the penalty interest rate--we'll talk about it in a
minute-- but the APR on that cash advance is about 27.5%. From the first
dollar up, all the way to the top. No blended rates. And if you're ever
late, one day on one payment, APR is gonna charge you 30%, indefinitely.
30%. That's a number I think we've been talking about a little bit this
morning. If you have your credit card from the NAACP-- a Visa card from
the NAACP, and you wanna get a cash advance on that? You can do that,
and then after you've paid the fees, and the monthly interest rate, your
annual percentage rate is 31%, assuming you don't default, or miss a
payment, or go late, and have to pay a penalty interest charge on top of
that. That's the alternative source of credit we're leaving our people
if we say to this industry: &quot;We don't care what happens to you,
it's OK if you go out of business-- no concern of ours.&quot;
As an opponent of high-cost payday loans, I don't think it's a
responsible approach to say that. The bill has been very carefully
worked over; Senator Gunn has told you a number of the things--
provisions that have been put in the bill to try to address legitimate
concerns that I think consumer advocates have. One of the things I want
to talk about, and then I'll be done, is about renewals. Currently,
under the current laws for the small loans, and by the way, I heard
someone in the debate say that the small loans are not where the
predominate lending activity is, it's in the bigger loans-- that's not
correct. 70% of the loans are $3,000 or less. And they're made by these
small lenders, with one and two offices, in small towns in North
Carolina-- they're not made by Landmark and Springly [?]. The bulk of
those loans are made at $3,000 or less. Right now, there's no minimum
loan turn on those, they'll make you that loan for a month. And if they
make you a loan for a month, you're gonna have a lot of renewals-- can
yo pay off a $2,000 loan from your next paycheck at the end of the
month? Most citizens in North Carolina can't do that, and so that's
where the renewal problem comes. The bill addresses that; the minimum
term now has to be at least 12 months. You could structure a monthly
payment that actually fits your income. You might actually be able to
make that repayment and not have to renew. The maximum loan terms are
extended as well to give more flexibility to the lender and the borrower
who needs the funds to work out a repayment program that they can afford
on a monthly basis.
The best way to avoid renewal problems is to make an affordable monthly
payment. On an [??] loan; Senator Gunn talked about that, and I agree
with him 100%. The bill also provides mechanisms for payment referral to
be allowed, you don't have to renew your loan. You don't have to go in a
pay a bunch of up-front fees to renew a loan. If you need an extension
on a payment, the bill allows the lender to give you an extension, or a
payment referral. I think that's a positive development, and a positive
change in the law. Before that, the lenders have to be able to stay in
business. That's what the bill's about: to stay in business, offering
credit to consumers who want it, who need it, and can manage it
responsibly. Don't leave them with no alternative. I ask that you
support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate. Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We've heard two or three varying sides, and I appreciate the amendments,
I think that they have improved the bill, including the last one,
Senator Brown, I appreciate that. However, we've also heard from others,
AARP, other military branches, and I've been watching this for a long
time. As a matter of fact, I've been watching the last two terms as
sixteen years worth of my work has been taken apart piece by piece, but
I think this one hurts more than the others. The fundamental question
for me is-- and you have to realize where I'm coming from-- why the
wealthy wish to oppress those who have nothing? To squeeze the last
little bit out of those who are just barely struggling. So why this
bill? Industry will tell you that they have not had an increase since
1983, well, they don't need an increase. Why? Because the industry make
money not only on the high interest rates, but really, the loans being
recurring, whatever you want to call them, and selling insurance
products. Remember the insurance product is the largest part of the
amount of profit they make. Here's a typical--</p>

<p id="085:00">
?? right here. Amount borrowed ended up as 2000. Finance charge $979,
one half almost. Insurance $411. And each time this loan is renewed, if
you want to call it that, those fees are charged again. 66 percent of
the loans in 2011 were renewed. 90 percent, 92 percent of the loans with
insurance products were funded from loan proceeds. So you can see that
we're not just talking about interest. And yes, it hasn't been raised
since 1993, but they don't need to because they make their money these
other ways. Then, a late fee of $15 on an $82 payment. For example, ??
paid $82 per month for 36 months and ended up getting $1.27 the last
time they renewed the loan, because all the rest went to insurance,
finance, and late fees.
So, if the person is squeezed to the point of default, the lender has
already made money on insurance products, late fees and finance charges.
While this poor person ends up in an endless debt cycle, until they end
up in court.
Industry says they don't make enough on the business. Look at their
income over expense. In 2011, $277,500, which is the income, and the
expense is 263,000. Tidy little profit there. They'll tell you the
company's lost money during that period, but not if you look at the
figures. The industry, and Senator Clodfelter, says they didn't make
enough loans, but how about 461,560 in 2011. The industry says they help
people by lending money who have bad credit. If they really mean that
they would lend money at the same rate as their Credit Unions program
with a built in default cushion for the lender.
Now, you may think this is about that small, humble businessman who sat
in your office in his thrift shop suit and said he can't make a living
without the changes in this bill. But this bill is really about the
city. And their parent, City Financial. This is about Springleaf, nay
AIG, aka Fortress American General. A private hedge fund. This is about
Landmark, BB&amp;T, based in Georgia. Owned by BB&amp;T and six out of
state companies.
The military has rightfully been opposed to this bill and defeated it
last time around, but this year the industry hired a retired military
general who persuaded them to stay neutral after exempting military
personnel from the bill. Well, if it is bad for the armed services, why
is it okay of the rest of the people? And two service branches are still
opposed because it preys on military families.
This is about the unsophisticated borrower, as Senator Clodfelter said,
you and I aren't going to take out these loans. This is about rich and
poor. City Corp paid a CEO 11.5 million in 2012. This is not about that
simple man just trying to make his living in your hometown. Nor is the
CEO of City Corp going to take out this, because he's collecting all
those late fees, and insurance products, and interest on hundreds of
thousands of loans and living well. What differentiates the well-off,
the comfortable from those who are struggling and seeks the loan is
wealth accumulation. A home bought with a mortgage is wealth
accumulation, investment and stocks or bonds, real estate, but when
you're at the bottom financially, you never accumulate wealth. How can
you accumulate wealth when you have to pay back $520 in fees when you
have to borrow $325? I had a personal experience like that. Senator
Brown, you asked if anyone would take this kind of risk. A grandmother,
whom I've worked with for years, was taking care of her daughter in a
wheelchair and her granddaughter with a neurological illness and she was
forced to take out one of these loans. After a year, she owed $1600 on
her $1000 loan, and a deputy sheriff came to me because they were taking
her to court. I couldn't take it anymore, and I went in and I paid off
that loan, and I said, don't go after her for one more penny. These
folks not only can't live comfortably, they have nothing to leave their
children. I think this is a moral issue. We have differences on moral
issues for some it is death penalty, for some it's the beginning of
life, but I think we can all agree that what we hear every Sunday is as
you do unto the least of these. I hope that we will deeply consider what
we are</p>

doing to thousands of people in our state, I intend to vote against the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark, what purpose you rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When I first entered the Air Force I was over there in  Germany on a
tour. And I can remember I had only been at the site for about four
months, Belburg(??) Air Force Station Germany, and the Commander was
relieved of duty. Since there were only two officers at the site, I had
to assume command of that site. Okay and I can remember during that time
all of a sudden things changed. I can remember heading from the mountain
top down into Frankfurt Germany to my apartment--[SPEAKER CHANGES]
President, point of order. How many times do we get to speak on the bill
from the floor? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is my first time speaking to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, the rules say that each member is allowed to speak
twice on the main question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought I've heard two at least. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]
I've spoken to all the amendments, this is my first--[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark you have the floor, speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. So as I'm heading home often times the beeper goes off 'Lieutenant
Clark will you call the site, Lieutenant Clark will you call the site.'
And more often than not, it was some sort of domestic dispute that had
taken place in the home. And often times the result of that dispute was
financial problems. Later on in my career as an Air Force Captain
stationed at Scott Air Force Base, I served as a financial program
manager, assisting the troops who found themselves strapped with
financial debt. Often times these loans were the culprit. So I did not
put forth all of those amendments for the sake of voting against the
bill. I put forth those amendments out of a true concern for the
military members. But I also do recognize that I can't have my way in
everything. And I applaud Senator Gunn for the concessions that he has
made, accepting several of the amendments. And I believe that-- blended
rate, pretty much will give you better than what you can get off a
credit card, I mean non-blended rate excuse me, the non-blended rate
that he offered. Also, although I would like to have the military
components stricken out of the bill, I do believe that they will get a
better deal based on the amendment that Senator Gunn put forth. I only
ask one more thing. I believe Senator Gunn you indicated that the bill
is written, not allow anyone to turn and request the loan until the
current loan had been paid off. I can't find that in the bill, I'm not
saying its not there, but I can't find it. If it was the intent to have
that provision in there so that an individual can not refinance that
loan until the residual(?) had been paid off, if it gets put in I will
appreciate that, and then I would recommend that we support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, what purpose you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To offer an amendment, a very simple amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Clerk has your amendment, the Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, hold on just a moment. The amendment is on the dashboard.
Senator Davis you have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President if you look on page two line, twenty three, the
language of my amendment just clarifies the fact that the maximum amount
of $15,000 dollars refers to the loan and not to the installment amount.
I think that's pretty important. In addition to that line 24, while
we're at it using proper English, we might as well fix 'less than 12
months' to 'fewer than 12 months'. I ask that you support the amendment
out of respect to your sixth grade English teacher. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn, for what purpose you rise.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Kinda hard to argue with that. To speak-- reckon to the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I'm hearing Senator Davis correctly, you are assuming this language
is going to make sure that it is not a $15,000 installment. Is that
correct? Or is that a monthly installment? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield. That is correct I think a $15,000 installment is a pretty good
size installment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn you have the floor.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion to amend a committee report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
State your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, Senate Bill 59: Armed security guards in K through 12 is
in the committee on rules.  We ask that it be removed from the committee
on rules and be re-referred to the committee Judiciary 2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection?  So ordered. Committee report?  Send forward your
committee report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, this be an oral committee report.  The Oximeter Committee
did meet and there’s a lot of competition for the award this time, but
the committee has decided to award the Oximeter to the President Pro
Temp, Phil Berger, for his policy for not allowing the rules chair to
call the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Accepted with great appreciation.  Senator Newton has an excused absence
for the remainder of the session.  With reference to… Next item, Senate
Bill 493.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 493: Prohibit after ?? headlights.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Senate Bill 493, basically, is a very simple
bill.  It prohibits the use of headlights that are not DOT stamped or
DOT approved.  This has come from a safety issue.  We have some members
of the motor public that change their headlights to different counter
powers or different colors that blind people on the highway. But all
this does is change it to DOT approved.  Thank you.  I would appreciate
your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate? Senator Clark, your microphone appears to
be on.  Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before
the Senate is the passage…</p>

Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moment of personal privilege, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. President and members of the Senate, on Monday, in the
7:00 session, the resolution for Senator Edward Jones will be calendared
for that session and at 6:30 that evening his family will be here and we
will have a repass for them that you’re all invited to, in the gallery
outside the Senate chamber. If you could just stop by to greet them that
would be wonderful because, after the resolution, they will probably
move on and we might not have a chance to share memories and our
recollections with them. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there further business to come before the Senate? If not, the Chair
recognizes Senator Brunstetter for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I move that the Senate do now adjourn, subject to the
receipt of committee reports, the referral and re-referral of bills and
resolutions, and the receipt of messages from the House and the
governor, to reconvene on Monday, May 6, 2013 at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn, subject to the
stipulations stated by Senator Brunstetter, to reconvene Monday, May 6th
at 7 p.m., seconded by Senator Hise. All in favor say aye. All opposed?
The ayes have it and the Senate stands adjourned.</p>
