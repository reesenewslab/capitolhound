[applause]
Notice and announcements. Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] An announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Republicans will caucus immediately after session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Gunn, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, point of personal privilege and to send
forth a senatorial statement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forward your statement, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Distinguished colleagues, this is a great day and
indeed a great privilege for me to be able to honor Elon University on
its 125th anniversary that takes place this year. Elon, on a personal
note, used to be a little college town called Elon College that I lived
literally just about a driver and a five iron away from. They used to
play football at my high school, Williams High School, soccer was
non-existent.
And just thinking just a short term year, they have gone to one of the
most unbelievable university and recognized throughout the nation. It
started in 1889 as Elon College and in 2001, they did change the name to
Elon University to reflect the growth of the academic programs,
personnel, enrollment and national statute. They now enroll almost 5,600
undergraduates, 700 graduate students, 22% of the individuals are from
North Carolina, but the remainder are from 46 states and 49 other
countries. They are one of only seven private universities in the nation
that have accredited schools in business, communication, education, law
and health sciences.
Recently that have been ranked number one in the south for regional
universities by the News and World Report. Number one masters level
university in study abroad, and one of the nation's top 25 best value
private universities.
I'm really proud of this. They are renowned for their preeminent
community engaged teaching and learning. Three hundred and ninety-four
full time faculty members that are distinguished teacher/scholar
mentors. They have sent more undergraduate students abroad than any
other masters level school in the nation. They are the top producer of
Fulbright student scholars, Peace Corps volunteers and Teach for America
educators.
This used to be a little two building campus on just a few acres. Now
there is over 620 acres and it has been recognized, as designated as a
botanical garden and regularly receives recognition as one of the
nation's most beautiful environments. It really is a pleasure today to
be able to stand in front of you and celebrate such a wonderful success.
They mean so, so much to our community. They give to their community.
They continue to grow academically. There a big economic engine.
And we really are privileged today, and I'm going to defer back to our
President here in a minute, but today we have a very special guest that
has come. You may have seen him walking around today in the halls. He is
one of the former presidents and a dear, dear friend. He is the heart
and the pulse of Elon University. I told somebody the other day, I said,
&quot;I know he doesn't part the Red Sea, but I've seen him
maroon,&quot; which is Elon's color when he walks into an auditorium.
The man is truly loved and endeared by all of the community and all the
students.
With that, Mr. President, I'd like to turn it back to you, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Gunn. Members, upon the motion of
Senator Rick Gunn of Alamance County, the Chair is happy to extend
courtesies of the gallery to Dr. James Earl Danieley. Dr. Danieley is
the sixth president of Elon College. He was the president from 1957
until 1978. He was named President Emiritus of Elon in 1992. He's one of
only two presidents to ever receive that honor from Elon. He is
recipient of the Order of the...</p>

Long leaf Pin in 1996. He’s contributed in countless ways to the school,
was responsible for the expansion of Elon’s athletic programs,
particularly the women’s athletic programs, and also admitted the first
African-American student to Elon College. He currently still serves as
an adjunct chemistry professor at the university. I had the opportunity
to spend a good deal of time this morning with Dr. Danley, and I can
tell you that while I was never one to relish taking science courses, I
think I would have enjoyed taking his chemistry class. And he still does
teach that. The other thing is, Dr. Danley is turning 90 years old this
year, and he is in the gallery. Welcome, Dr. Danley, to the North
Carolina Senate. Would you please stand? And Senator Gunn, Senator
Apodaca tells me he’s seen you hit a driver and a five iron, and he
doesn’t think you can get there from there. Further notices and
announcements. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of
personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I feel I would be remiss today if I didn’t point out that fact
that 50 years ago today, the Civil Rights Act in 1964 was signed by
President Johnson. I think a few of you heard me mention a commemoration
which I attended last week in Washington, which provided strong
bipartisan support in terms of what was done 50 years ago today. I think
it’s very insightful to think about how 50 years ago our country was
torn apart racially, in terms of a divide that was in many parts of our
country, particularly in the South. There was a lot of strife, a lot of
bigotry, but it was probably the perhaps the first time that the media
in our country really was instrumental in helping to shame, inform
public opinion in many respects. Because we didn’t have a hundred
channels to watch back then on cable, there was just ABC, NBC, CBS. At
the end of that broadcast, when Walter Kronkite presented that news he’s
saying, that’s the way it was. You know, many days when he said that’s
the way it was, he’s referring back to the demonstrations occurring
throughout the south with civil rights protestors. They capture the
images, these very vivid images of those nonviolent protestors, standing
up for civil rights, and individual rights were being confronted by fire
hoses, electric cattle prods, and the like. It was something that
shocked America’s conscious and something that cause us all to realize
that regardless of where we came from, regardless of what our background
was, that we all aspired to have the rights that were spoken of in our
constitution. Equal rights for each and every individual regardless of
race, regardless of color, regardless of national origin. And the
courage that was shown by President Johnson and the bipartisan
leadership I point out of that era, Republicans and Democrats alike,
that came together, and they didn’t take a poll on public opinion to
tell them where to come out. They forged consensus, they provided
courage, they provided insight, and they helped heal America racially.
We’ve come a long way since then, many of those divides have been
overcome. We still have a long, long way to go. But we all can feel very
proud of the fact that America stood strong. That America was principal.
That America showed courage and conviction, but most importantly that
there was bipartisan leadership that embraced equal rights for all of us
in this country. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further notices or
announcements? Senator Apodaca, before I recognize you for the motion,
if that’s the reason you’re standing, I would ask the chamber to
consider by unanimous consent granting Senator Tillman, Senator Wade,
and Senator Soucek, excused absences from the vote earlier today, I
think they were serving on a conference committee and were unable to be
here. Is there any objection to that? Without objections, so ordered.
Senator Apodaca what purpose you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
President. First I have an announcement. First I have a moment of
personal privilege if I might. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it’s fitting since the most distinguished
alumnus from Elon College</p>

late getting to session today. I don’t think he was anywhere but tardy,
so I think that was appropriate to let everyone know. Our schedule going
forward, Mr. President, tomorrow morning we’ll have what’s known in the
Senate as a skeletal, otherwise known as skeleton session, at 9:30 am,
and then on Monday we’ll have another skeletal session at 4 pm, and then
we’re going to reconvene on Tuesday July 8th at 3 pm. So that’s kind of
what we’re looking at the next few days, and things are looking like
we’d better be ready to work because it looks like we’re finally getting
to a point we may be able to shut down. Mr. President, I move that the
Senate do now – [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, hold on just a
second. I think Senator Pate may want to be recognized for something.
Senator Pate, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] An
announcement of conferees. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Sorry about that, Senator.
Mr. President and members of the Senate, Senate Bill 614, Military Lands
Protection Act, Senator Berger has appointed Senator Brown as Chair and
Senators Meredith, Pate and Rabin of Harnett and Clark as members of the
conference committee for Senate Bill 614, Military Lands Protection Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And speaking of the distinguished alumnus from Elon
college, Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I would have Senator Apodaca, who I
don’t know what’s “skeletal” – I’ve never heard the word “skeletal”. I
think he did go to college somewhere, but even at Elon we knew it wasn’t
“skeletal”. That’s not a word. I was with my distinguished President;
Senator Gunn brought him down here when I was there, and he was
President at the time, so you can imagine Dr. ??, up here Senator
Berger, and he and I had some mighty good chats and a lot of them since
then, and he is still mentally alert as I’ve ever seen him. Talked to
him at lunch today. He’s an Alamance County native, his brother was
Chairman of the party over there, and he is a solid ?? R. I love the
man, he’s a legend, and I’d like to be like him but I would like to have
hair. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, just for the record,
I did ask him how fast your fastball was. It’s not near what you say.
Senator Apodaca is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I can
only imagine the conversations the President had with Tillman in school.
Mr. President, I move that the Senate do now adjourn subject to messages
from the House and the Governor, the introduction, referral and
re-referral of bills and resolutions, the receipt and the re-referral of
committee reports, ratification of bills and appointment of conferees to
reconvene on Thursday July 3rd 2014 at 9:30 am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
motion is that the Senate do now adjourn, subject to the stipulations
stated by Senator Apodaca, to reconvene on Thursday July 3rd 2014 at
9:30 am, seconded by Senator Tillman. All in favor, say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. The ayes have it and the
Senate stands adjourned.</p>
