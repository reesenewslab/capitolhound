  Thank you Mr President, Colleagues, Welcome back to town. We have a lot
of work  ahead of us. It&#39;s going to be interesting to hear the state
of the state from the governor next week. And In keeping with the
tradition , one of the most popular caucuses in the general assembly,
the sportsmen caucus will be gathering for activity next week. You
should have all received in your Email inboxes invitations to join the
caucus. So, Please look for that. Also on our desks have been placed
further information about that. So we have some activities next week. we
will have a reception at the Natural  museum in science and history,
which  should be a lot of fun and hear about issues  to our outdoor
sporting heritage. We will have a breakfast  that morning as well and
all are welcome to attend at 7:30 downstairs as usual and hear more of
the same. And on Wednesday before the governor comes and lets us know
what&#39;s going on, there will be a lot of activities here in the
general assembly. I believe it&#39;s the 1100 quad as we have done in
the past. So, a lot of interesting exhibits at the wild life commission
will be setting up for us and  activities. There  should be a challenge
between the senate and the house on target shooting with pellet guns out
on Halifax mall. Senator Schuchek, we are counting on you to bring home
the trophy again. we have got to up hold our standards in the body.
Anybody who wishes to participate, Please be on the look out for that.
That&#39;s usually  a lot of fun and a lot of good information. So, Look
forward to joining you. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] May we have  other notices or announcements. Senator
Bloom, what purpose did you rise?
[Speaker Changes] appoint a personal privilege
[Speaker Changes] Senator Bloom, you have the floor for  appoint a
personal privilege
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr President and to my colleagues here in
the senate. As we convene today, beginning  yet another long legilative
session, we take stock of the fact that millions of hard working middle
class families across the nation are finally getting back to work,
feeling a little more secure. Having just a little bit easier of  a
time, putting food on the table and raising their children. So, after
the  global recession that rocked our economy to its very core, our
stock market is soaring and employers, large and small hiring again. And
across the nation, we are in the midst of a great recovery. I too look
forward to the  governor&#39;s address next week because we want to have
to address some real issues facing North Carolina because here too in
North Carolina we hear of  comebacks. And for a  fortunate few , the
past few  years have brought great prosperity. But more and more it is
becoming clear in our state too middle class families are not feeling
the recovery  in their day today lives. For these families, the cost of
living has gone up with new and increased taxes. Wages remain too low
and small businesses and employers have been unable to grow and hire.
Our children schools have seen drastic cuts where students have been
crammed  to under stocked class rooms as the best teachers leave the
state. And for these middle class families, who form a vast majority of
our state, there has been no economic comeback. So, while the
legislature has made it a priority to see to it that our wealthiest
individuals and nation&#39;s largest corporations  on a solid footing,
it&#39;s time now in this session to focus our attention on the middle
class bring in relief and new opportunities to North carolina&#39;s
hardworking families.  So, as we begin our another long legislative
session, Let&#39;s focus on job creation for the middle class. I heard
the governor talk about that. Let&#39;s focus on investment and small
business growth and ensure that we providing relief to all North
Carolinians. It&#39;s time to put more money in the pockets of working
families by providing tax relief to the middle class , not just to the
wealthiest individual and large out of state corporations. Education
plays a key role in attracting any business to the state. And in order
to remain competitive, we must raise teacher pay to the national
average. As the ninth largest state in our nation, we cannot continue to
be ranked  last in the nation for teachers. At the least, we must fall
in the middle of the pack if we want any hope of employers bringing new
jobs to the state. Just ask the team of people who were involved in the
effort to recruit ?? North Carolina.

  ?? this was a point of personal privilege…so not of the state of the
union. So if you’ll please wrap up. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Sir. I appreciate that. So school systems
are very important, from K12 all the way through the university system.
It’s enticing the job creators and we must support collaboration between
industry and the university system in order to create degrees that can
put people straight to work as new jobs become available. North
Carolina’s economy has always grown from the middle out. And North
Carolina was once a state where home-grown businesses could grow and
thrive. A state that outpaced the rest of the South in new industry,
growth and job creation. A state with the best university system in the
country. A state where middle-class children learned the skills to
outpace and out-compete everyone else in the nation. That’s the kind of
North Carolina that I want to work with the majority in this session in
making sure that we create, in making sure that we sustain. That’s the
kind of  North Carolina that will make North Carolina great for all of
its people and great for all of us. Thank all of you.
