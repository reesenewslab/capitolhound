Speaker: Good morning. The house finance committee will please come to
order. The chair would like to start by welcoming our house pages: Jacob
Helms, Chad Hagen, Steven Holly. Thank you so much for being with us
today. Extending our thanks to our sergeant in arms: Fred Hines, Reggie
Seals, John Brandon, Mike Clampett. And of course to our dedicated
calendar. House bill 743, Representative Howard is recognized. There is
a committee sponsored substitute. Representative McClemburgh moves to
propose the committee substitute be brought before the commission. Is
there objection? Hearing none, Representative Howard you have the floor.
Good morning ma’am.
Representative: Good morning Mr. Chairman, members of the finance
committee. This is truly a technical clean up bill. If you remember, we
passed house bill 4, which were the changes to the UN fund solvency and
program changes, and that bill was [xx] the governor on February 19th.
We knew it was going to be tweaks that were necessary before the bill
was implemented, and that is exactly what this is. There are no major
policy changes in here. There are technical changes, making cross
references, making statutory cross references, fixing technical errors.
There are about ten points. I will be glad to go through them if you
would like to hear what the changes are.
Speaker: Representative Sensor please state your purpose.
Representative: To make a motion.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized.
Representative: I move for a favorable report for PCS, house bill 743,
unfavorable for the original bill.
Speaker: Representative Sensor has moved for a favorable report for the
proposed committee substitute for house bill 743. Is there further
discussion or debate? Seeing none, those who favor will signify the
motion carries. Thank you. House bill 94, Representative Samuelson will
present this bill. There is not a committee substitute, therefore, the
house bill is before the committee and Representative Samuelson is
recognized to present the bill. Good morning ma’am.
Representative: Good morning. Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee. This amended environmental laws bill is the standard amends
bill that comes out of the ERC every year. Normally, it does not come to
section finance. The only reason it comes to finance this year, staff,
if I miss something let me know, is because in section 2 about civil
appeals… from deener, it is clearly just cleaning bills from the past.
If you have any questions I will do my best to answer them, and staff,
if I missed which piece it is for the finance, let me know.
Speaker: Representative Brawley, please state your purpose.
Representative: Did you say section 10?
Representative: Section 2 – it’s early. Section 2 has to do with appeals
for civil penalties by local government that is administering a state
plan and how they go about doing it.
Speaker: Representative Brawley, Viredale moves that house bill 94 be
given a favorable report. Is there further discussion or debate? Seeing
none, the question before the committee is the motion from
Representative Brawley to give house bill 94 a favorable report. Those
who favor the motion will signify by saying aye [aye]. Those who oppose
will say no [silence]. In the opinion of the chair, the aye’s have it
and…house bill 912, Representative Jones, did you wish to present the
bill sir? Representative Jones will present house bill 19.</p>
