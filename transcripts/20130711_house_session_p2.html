The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman, we all know that this is a controversial bill and
I would be lying if I didn't tell you some times this makes me a little
nervous. This is the second time today I get to handle a senate bill and
fortunately though this one. Most of it is a bill that we've all ready
pass, but before we go into the details, I just wanted to reiterate.
That this is all bout protecting the health and safety of women. We are
not here trying to shut down, the words has been shut down every
abortion clinic in North Carolina, except one. What we are attempting to
do is protect the health and safety of women, by raising the standards
of many of  those clinics. Standards that have not been raise since
1994. there are a number of facts that will still, there true now that
will still be true when we are done. One is roe v wade will still be
legal. But the other fact is that problem do exist in our abortion
clinics and we need to address some of those. And so that's what we will
do.
As I go into the detail of the bill. I'm going to skim through the fist
part and focus most of my explanation on the parts that are new to this
board, to this body. But there was one thing, sorry. I'll be less
formal, I didn't wan to address the proses that got us to where we are
right now. Over the course of this secession, we have pass a couple of
other bills that are now incorporated in here, and now we sent them over
to the senate. They took those pieces put them together added a piece of
there own and sent it back over to us. The normal reaction, we would do,
is ether concur or not concur. If we had chosen to concur the only
debates on there changes would have been here on the house floor, no
opportunity for amendments and only one debate. If we had chose not to
concur, the normal action would be, we would not concur we would appoint
a small conference comity those people would meet in private they would
bring it back and the only public debate would be on this floor one
time. By doing it the way we've done it here what we have allowed is for
there to be a public hearing that we had on tuesday. I loose my days
some times here. On tuesday to let the public to voice there interest
there concerns about this bill, to let  members do the same thing and
most importantly to let the secretary boss of the DHHS address the
concerns, that she and the governor had with some of the way the
language had been done.
We then took it before a comity and had the comity thoroughly debate the
bill. Had opportunities for amendments. Now we are bring it back here
under a very public proses. So I want some of the people who have
complain about the process, and how this has happen. To understand that
we have had more debate and more opportunity for change and discussion
and correction, under this process, that we would if we would follow the
process of concur or not concur.
So with that said I like to go over the detail of the bill and then we
will open it up for questions. On the first session witch start on page
one line 18 the Health Care Conscience Protection Act, this  portion all
the way over till you get to part tree on page two was included
originally in our conscience protection act, which was sponsored, as a
reminder by representative  Schaffer Martin, Conrad and Brown. Then if
you get over to the next section, which was the part that says. ?? by
law prohibits sex selective abortion. I was the primary sponsored on
that.  Once againg we had a lot of debate on that one, when we came
through the first time, it was me, Pat McElraft, representative Turner
and representative Schaffer. And all that goes around till we get to the
portion that is new on the amendurum, Women's Right to Know Bill. And I
will not forget to mention the motorcycles</p>

<p id="005:00">
Portion when I’m done. Amend women’s right to know act. What I’d like to
do is go through those, and talk about the way it came over from the
Senate and then how we fixed it based on what the feedback was that we
got back from DHHS. The first section was amending the women’s right to
know bill, having to do with the physical presence of the doctor during
both the abortion, during the abortion whether it was a clinical
abortion or whether it was through a pharmaceutical abortion. When we
got it over from the Senate, it included a requirement that the doctor
be physically present not only when they were performing the clinical
procedure, but also for all three doses of the abortion pill. It can
sometimes be two doses, often it’s three doses. The DHHS secretary had
concerns about that, on the basis of the health and safety of the woman.
Her complaint which we eventually began to agree with, was that when the
woman takes that first dosage of her pill, and then she’s supposed to
take the second one, there’s a timeframe within which that she should
take that second pill, if for some reason, car breaks down, family
crisis or whatever, she could not get back to the clinic in order to
take that second dose in time, that could jeopardize the health and
safety of the woman. So we agreed on that point and decided that we
would make it so that the doctor is only physically required to be
present for the first dosage of the pill. We felt like that was a
reasonable concession for the health and safety of the woman. The other
reason people asked us why does the doctor even have to be physically
present for the first dose of the pill, was because part of the abortion
procedure is making sure that the woman is at the point in the pregnancy
where she is supposed to safely be able to take that pill. There had
been concerns, and there had been anecdotal stories in the past, that
there were women who had gone there, gotten their pills, taken them, and
given them to someone else. So we wanted to make sure that her safety
was protected by having her take the first dose there and then she could
have the others to take home and take. The second section that’s new has
to do with information on the state website. If you remember from the
women’s right to know bill, we do have a state website now that gives
all the information for women about abortion. The one thing we had not
done is list the resources that a woman may contact for assistance if
she finds out after the ultrasound that her unborn child may have
disability or serious abnormality. And so we wanted to make sure that
they knew where those resources were should they need that common
information, which is one of those unfortunate things sometimes, as a
mother of a child with special needs. Then we got to section four. This
is the one that got the most controversy. The way it came over from the
Senate was that the DHHS was to write rules to review the standards for
our clinics that have not been reviewed since 1994, and it was to raise
them up to the level of an ambulatory surgical care center. The concern
had to do with the fact that an ambulatory surgical care center does
things other than just abortions. It does, I don’t even know if they do
abortions. But they do other things, and so therefore their standards
were broader and different than what you might need for an abortion
clinic. So what we did was we rewrote those so that they only apply if
they’re relevant to the issue of having an abortion. It has on here that
they must do so in order to not, standards applicable for clinics
certified by the department to be suitable facilities for the
performance of abortions. So the complaint that it would bring in all
kinds of standards that would shut down the clinics has been taken care
of in this adjustment. The other thing we added in there was the
language that says they must make these changes while not unduly
restricting access. The concern had been that if we made these standards
too hard, we would be restricting access to women for the clinic, and so
therefore we made sure that it says while not unduly restricting access.
So we have made those standards, the DHHS secretary agrees with them,
and as a little background I think one of my other members will speak
later, they’ve got the documentation. While changes were made twice in
the 70s, once in the 80s and once in the early 90s, those standards have
not been updated since then and it’s time to look at them and make sure
that the health and the safety of the women are up to current standards
when they’re doing these types of procedures. Another new section that
actually came out and I’ll thank Representative Insko, I don’t see her
here, but she helped to bring this up when we were in the public
hearing. The secretary mentioned concerns about inspections. That
they’re supposed to do these inspections, but they can’t get them done
as often as they should do them. And the secretary’s response was an
issue with staffing, trying to know how often should they do
inspections, how should the inspections be done. So we added a new
section that directs the department to do a study and come back to us in
the short session</p>

<p id="010:00">

And tell us what they think should be the protocol for our inspections,
and how to get those inspections  done, and how much would they need
from us in an appropriation, to make sure those facilities are inspected
on a regular basis. In a way, this also ties into the one about
increasing standards. Doctor Folgem, in one of the meetings, brought up
a correct statement, which the secretaries confirmed, which was, many of
these clinics are up to really good standards. But they haven't been
inspected in so long that we can't make sure that they are in
compliance. So it's the combination of getting the standards where they
need to be, and getting the inspections done in such a way that they can
be handled safely. That's all the new part on the abortion clinics. The
rest of it has to do with motorcycle safety. It's not motorcycle
helmets, and many people asked if it was motorcycle helmets. It's not
motorcycle helmets. It's basically for another safety issue. If
someone's on a motorcycle, and you run them off the road, there out to
be some sort of penalties. What they did is look at, how do we make sure
that motorcycles who are sharing the road with cars, that if there is a
violation, that they are appropriately dealt with legally. That's the
gist of the bill. That's not the gist, necessary, of all the issues we
will hear here today. Abortion is a very sensitive subject. I'm aware
that it's a very sensitive subject. We have lots of different opinions
on it. But I will say that, personally, it matters a lot to me that we
respect the women who are faced with these decisions. But we do so in
such a way as we did with the Woman's Right to Know bill, of making sure
that they have all the information they need in order to make that
abortion decision in a safe and informed manner. But on the other hand,
we also need to make sure that the facilities that they go into are
properly inspected, are properly up to standards, and that they are not
putting their health in danger once they make that decision to move
forward. I urge your support of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, at this time, the
clerk advises the Chair that there are no amendments in possession of
the clerk. Any member wishing to send forth an amendment will have a
deadline of 1-15, I'm sorry, 2-15, to send forth an amendment, in order
for it to be in order. Any amendments submitted after 2-15 will be ruled
out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] There's not an awful lot, thank you Mister Chairman,
that I can add to the wonderful comments that Representative Samuelson
made, because I stand before you conflicted, as quite a number of us do,
over this particular issue. A few weeks ago, I stood up and told you
that I could not be judged on my votes by simply who I am, as a woman,
as a Christian, as a Southerner, as a Republican. And I'm split between
the people that I am and this vote. As a Christian, as a mother and a
woman, I'm very much opposed to abortion. I believe in birth beginning
at the moment of conception, and I believe all life is holy and should
be honored. But I also understand that as a legislator, I am bound by my
oath to enforce and support the laws of the land. Which, as
Representative Samuelson pointed out, is Roe v. Wade. And I, as a State
Representative, am in no position to bring about change at the level
that that law is enforced. But what I am able to do as a State
Legislator is to make sure and certain that every woman who faces that
horrible decision and makes that choice to have an abortion because of
her personal circumstances, is guaranteed by the state of North
Carolina, that she's walking into the safest and most up-to-date
facility to handle her at that moment of need. Whatever it may be, as
simple or as complicated as it may turn out. It absolutely appalls me
that for nineteen years, we have not looked at and reviewed and updated
the standards and requirements of facilities that take this type of
step, surgically, medically in a woman's life. Nineteen years ago, I'm
pretty sure a lot of us walked into a doctor's office, and they reached
over into a bottle of alcohol and pulled out a thermometer, and stuck it
in your mouth. They don't do that today. They've got a digital
thermometer that has a disposable cover, and when they finish with it,
they throw it away.</p>

Don't you think that there have been some changes that we need to look
at, we need to consider, to make sure that the optimum safety for the
women in the state of North Carolina is taken care of by the people in
this body? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Conrad, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As Representative Samuelson pointed out, I was
one of the primary sponsors on the original bill, that is section one
and two of this new bill. Just to briefly remind you of what those were,
it regarded health care workers who might have religious, moral, or
ethical objections to participating in abortion procedure. And also that
taxpayer funds would not be paying for abortions through the new
exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act. But I really want to
address most of my comments today to the new section that was added by
the Senate and clarified by the House, of a very open and deliberative
procedure, and both the Health and Human Services Committee and also on
Judiciary B, of which I am a member. I am really quite glad that this
section was added actually, because I am very concerned about
regulations and health care. We debate regulations on this House floor
on a lot of issues--energy, building--for all types of businesses, and
we have differing opinions on the degree or complexity or necessity of
those regulations. But I would think on this issue, and I'm talking
about broader health care, not just abortion procedures, that we would
all be on the same page. That we could not have a deficiency in
regulations and standards for the safety, regardless of what medical
procedure you're going to have. I guess in my life I've had a unique
combination of experiences that really emphasize the importance of this
to me. I've had the opportunity to be on the board of trustees of one of
the largest health care companies here in North Carolina for a dozen
years, and we spent a lot of time talking about quality of care and
regulations and what new procedures we need to put in place to protect
the patients from something as simple as making sure all the employees
wash their hands to more complicated procedures. I had the experience of
one of my first positions of actually being a health care worker. I was
a chemist and microbiologist in a laboratory, and I can tell you, you're
very well trained in the importance of procedures. I often say that
probably was the most stressful job I had, when you know that the
accuracy of a test that you're doing could affect someone's life or
their treatment. Or a doctor would give me a call and say what
antibiotic is the one that's going to help my patient the most, and I
had to give him an answer. I can tell you I have known the importance of
health care regulations. Also, from a small child, I've had a lot of
orthopedic surgery, from the time I was four years old until a couple of
years ago. And as a patient you get a third dimension of perceptive of
how important health care regulations are. And as many regulations as
there are, there are often still significant events or things that go
wrong in health care. But we need to do, whether we're talking about
something as important as abortion, we need to make sure that the safety
of those who are undergoing this procedure have no deficiencies. And we
can't let the fact that we're dealing with something of such an
emotional nature hinder us in pursuing inspecting on a more frequent
basis these abortion clinics, but also imposing new and higher
standards. And I ask for your support for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Schaffer, please state your purpose.

The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, we've already heard it
mentioned a few times already, this issue of the abortion right that is
protected under Roe versus Wade. Since 1973, when the court acknowledged
that women had this right to an abortion, it has come up with some other
very important qualifiers to that right. What we know is that a woman's
right to an abortion does not exist in a vacuum. This very important
qualifier is that the state has an important interest in promoting the
health and safety of women who would seek an abortion. And as such,
reasonable regulations and limitations may be placed on the method of
abortion and the</p>

This is surrounding it so that we can promote the health and safety of
women. Recent events in our state just as recently as this past Friday
afternoon have indicated that we as a whole as a state we are doing a
poor job and abdicating for that right and promoting that health and
safety of women choosing an abortion on Friday, this past Friday
afternoon DHSS shutdown The Baker Clinic for Women in Durham because
“Conditions at the Backer Clinic for Women present an immediate danger
to the health, safety and welfare of clients and that emergency action
is required to protect the clients.” Now, I have the complaint I wanna
read a few lines from that so as the investigate findings of real
potential immediate threat to the health and safety of patients based on
the survey findings the facility fail to ensure the quality control was
performed in blood blanking, based on the survey findings the facility
failed to perform quality control testing on 108 patients that received
RHD testing fail to ensure that ___[01:01] NTD blood group in ___[01:03]
manufacturers performance specifications are verified prior to patient
testing fail to ensure a positive and negative red blood cell control
material was tested at least once daily when RHD testing was performed
fail to follow and I could go on. What we have here is…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ___[01:20] Mr. Speaker…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ___[01:26] please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to ask lady a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will be happy to yell to my statements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady may continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What we have here is that is a theme of problems in the laboratory,
problems with blood testing and etcetera. Many have said that since the
Baker Clinic was shutdown that means that our regulations are working if
this was an isolated incident however I might be persuaded to that
effect but that’s simply not the case. I have the copies of some of the
complaints that have come against abortion clinics over last the last
decade and a spreadsheet that list these recurring complaints and we
find that they are coming against the same abortion clinics for the same
reasons time and again I will give one brief example, we have in Raleigh
preferred women’s health center. In 2008, no proper procedures for
collecting blood specimens they did not meet HHS proficiency standards
that lack for recorded proficiencies evaluations from some testing
personnel then we have similar short time later further deficiencies
listed for a laboratory incidence we have the same clinic time and again
having problems with their RH blood testing, their HGC testing, we have
a lot of breakdown in the laboratory. When you go through the full list
and it really…[Chuckle] It’s a long list and we have this recurring
theme there is delay in disregard for standards repeated lab
deficiencies, failure to properly drugs and missing proper RH testing
and HCG testing as I mentioned. We do have a problem here it is
recurring and we need to do something to fix that, the current
regulations and the inspections is few and far between as they are or
simply not solving the problem for us. Now, I have a copy of the
regulations governing our abortion clinics and they fail in detail in
breadth in comparison to what we require for our ambulatory surgical
centers. Interestingly enough not that I’m saying that we need to do at
this way but they also fail in details and in breadth to what we have
require of animal shelters and things promoting animal welfare I mean I
will submit to you we need to be protecting and promoting the health and
safety of women with at least the same amount of detail and the care
that we would regulate what's going in our animal shelters. But off
course we are talking about abortion so perhaps the discussion of animal
shelters and even ambulatory surgical centers is bit misplaced and that
being the case I would like to draw your attention to this packet that I
have, this comes from the national abortion federation is the 2013
Clinical Policy Guidelines. The mission of the National Abortion
Federation is to ensure that women have legal, safe, healthy access to
the abortion procedure. So, everything that they are doing in this
packet is to ensure the safety of women in approaching this medical
procedure, this 55 page set of guidelines certainly overshadows the 11
pages of guidelines that we have for our current abortion clinics, one
particular guideline that I would like to mention simply because it has
been mentioned again in the complaints against the abortion clinics in
the state has to do with RH testing, one of the standards that it says,
RH Status must be documented in all women undergoing abortion and then
it goes on to explain the reasons why the data supporting that there is
not data that supports that a lack of that testing is okay.

This is a repeated offense that's going on in our clinics and we must
address this. Our regulations governing these abortion clinics have not
been updated since 1994, as we've heard. We have major problems that are
going on in this state. They need to be addressed. This bill simply
authorizes HHS to review and update our rules and our regulations
governing these abortion clinics so that we can fully promote that state
interest that we have in protecting the health and safety of women. This
gives HHS tools and their toolbox in terms of promoting health and
safety of women. I urge your support of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Earle, does the lady wish to state her question at this
time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, just also for the purposes of time accounting, it
is the opinion of the chair that any questions pose the time to-- pose
the question and respond to the question will be counted against the
fully allotted time for the member posing the question to debate the
bill. The lady may state her question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. In the committee of the day, the secretary
indicated that if she had adequate funding, she could do more
inspecting, and you mentioned, and it seemed to be a negative indication
that there was a facility that was closed, in turn there was also one
closed in Charlotte. Do you not think that is a good thing and an
indication that the system is working? It was closed, so do you not
think that was what should have happened?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, this is the point that I made, is that, when we have repeat
offenders time and again that they are consistently being written up for
the same offenses, for the same blood testing problems, with the same
failure to do their duty under these regulations. Yeah, we do have a
problem; the regulations aren't working because clinics are not
upholding their duty under these regulations. They're being cited for
the same problems time and again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield? The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Was there an indication that there was a continuation, or prior
violations with either one of these?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, there has been, there have been several problems with the Charlotte
clinic. The Durham clinic has been open only for a few months, but I
gave the few examples. I've got other clinics that I'm referring to, we
have quite a bit of documentation that demonstrates that these clinics
are engaging in repeat problems. They're failing to discharge their duty
under these regulations and they're being cited time and again for the
same problem. They're being shut down, and they're reopening when they
get up to par, and then they're being shut down again when they violate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was not the indication that we got from the committee, but again,
is that not the way the system is supposed to work? If there is a
violation, should they not be closed? And that is exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely, they should be--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes and no, please, ma'am, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I'm going to answer it the way I would like to answer it--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The members will yield, the chair will direct the discussion, there will
be no discourse after the question is stated, unless it's directed
through the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely, it is the way it should work, these clinics--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Earle, the chair, again, will direct the lady. After the
lady answers the question, the member will be provided time to answer
the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I was just acknowledging-- I appreciated her answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And the chair would like for the edification of the other members, up to
and including thanking the chair or the member before the member is
completed with answering the question will be out of order. The lady may
proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is the way that the system should work, but
the problem is that the system is not holding these clinics accountable,
shutting them down time and again, time and again, time and again, shows
that ultimately, these clinics are not operating the way that they need
to be operating. If we can allow HHS to have further, more frequent
inspections, that we can have standards that are more in line with what
even the National Abortion Federation requests, our standards would not
even come up to those standards. So ultimately, we do need to get these
things up to par.

Members, also, with respect to the rule, the chair would ask any member
interested with respect to the chair's ruling on any discourse or
questions asked, members as they're speaking, to refer to page 52 of

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to ask the bill's sponsor a question
and I'd like to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Samuelson, this bill you say
is all about safety. And it does, as I look at it, target women's health
clinics that provide abortions. My question is have you investigated
other medical clinics or doctor offices that provide much higher risk
procedures than abortion to determine if there have been violations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Those have been done by others. It was not part of my
research on this bill that came over from the Senate. I've been assured
that they have. I also have confidence that our DHHS secretary will let
us know if there's a need to change any of the standards in other
branches or if they're having problems with inspections on those, as
well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So you're saying that you don't know or, I mean, you
don't have any data that, at this point?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know that these things have been done, but it's not
the data that I was collecting at this point. That's not what I was
charged with. I do know that ambulatory care centers do automatically
have higher standards than what we've currently got for our abortion
centers. Our abortion centers need to be brought into the 21st century.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. One last question, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You talk about the process and the procedure and you
sort of said that it was open. I'm curious about why the public was not
given notice about the bill change, especially when it went to the J
committee and it comes out under another number and name?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, we gave four days notice, as I recall, on the
public hearing that had to do with the health committee. On that
particular one, yes it was quick. It's the end of session. Things move
more rapidly at this time of year. However, as I pointed out, it was
still an open process in a committee as opposed to a conference report,
which is not an open process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. One final question on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield? The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield for all questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. And so you indicated, I was in the J committee
when I heard that the meeting was going on. But you said you worked this
out with secretary and the Governor the evening before?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, we worked it out up to the last minute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Speak on the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Members of the House, it does appear to me
that there were meetings in private. And that there was not full
disclosure around this bill. But I just want to stand in opposition to
Senate Bill 353, a/k/a 695. As a woman, I am personally insulted by the
maneuvers around getting this bill to the floor today. We appreciate the
time that has been allotted to allow us to at least have some comment
about it at this point, because actually I sat in when the bill was in
the Senate and that bill came to that floor hurriedly. No input from
legislators even, as well, until they got to the floor.
But you know, we've made a mockery of women's health and safety by
taking a motorcycle bill, gutting it in order to pass the most sweeping
legislation that will effect women's lives. And I can't think of as long
as I've been here what other bill that would focus on any other issue,
especially health, that we would not allow, that we would not seek out
input from stakeholders, from other professionals in those fields. None.
Absolutely none. There was no input allowed or requested from any
women's health center provider who offer health care services that
include safe, legal abortions. No weigh in from physicians who provide
abortion care about the restrictions and the regulations that will be
required for them.
And as contentious and sensitive as this bill is, we deliberately put up
all kinds of barriers to keep the public out. There was no real
transparency. There's been insufficient public notice about where and
when the bill would be heard. As a matter of fact, the bill came under
another name. The bicycle safety act or the motorcycle safety act. The
bill targets...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It targets...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, the lady will yield. Representative
Stevens?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of order. I know...</p>

The gentleman may state his point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker if my memory serves me correctly. The prime bill sponsor
took extensive time explaining the process by which the bill came to the
floor and put that in the record and I would hope that we could also
deal with the relevancy of that and addressing the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall you’ll note that the chair did not provide
additional directions to Representative Adams. Some of representative
Adams time has already been allocated for questions and if she wishes to
speak on the contents of the bill it may be something that she wishes to
keep in mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. The bill targets and it singles our women’s
reproductive clinics that perform safe and legal abortions but it
doesn’t target other agencies as well. It is an unnecessary bill, it’s
not needed, regulations are in place and they’re working. So if it’s not
broke why are we trying to fix it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stephens please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to see if representative Adams would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No I will not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady will not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Laws in our state regulating clinics that provide safe legal abortions
are working and have been working, and when we found instances where
they weren’t working they were shut down. That’s exactly what should’ve
happened. This bill is a decoy it’s an attempt to regulate something
that’s already regulated. When rules already work, and when we find that
they’re broke, we fix them. Now, without commenting on the intent of the
bills sponsors, if these regulations are imposed and they are regulated.
The end results will be that clinics that provide abortion care will be
put out of business.  The result will be the elimination of women’s
access to safe and legal abortions. And that is a constitutional right
that we have as women. Now of the 17 clinics in North Carolina. Only 1
would meet the standards outlined in this bill. And we still don’t what
all of those standards will be. But when these clinics are shut down,
safe legal abortions are no longer available to women who need them and
other critically important health services that these clinics provide
like preventative services and pap smears and cancer screenings. Those
thins will not be available as well. SO if we really cared about women’s
health, her safety, why are we rushing tis bill? What’s the rush? Now I
realize this is a motorcycle bill, and they move pretty fast but why
wouldn’t want to get to stakeholders and citizens, when we’re crafting
this bill, why wouldn’t we want to get them involved? Why wouldn’t we
want to get the input from abortion providers? Why wouldn’t we want to
know what this bill costs? We don’t even have a fiscal note, and why
have we been so afraid of public scrutiny? And why would we push so
hurriedly for the establishment of rules when the DSS secretary has
already said that they don’t have enough staff to do what’s required of
them right now? Well let me tell you what I think. I think and I
believe, I truly believe that this bill is about limiting choices for
women. To make the choices that she needs to make about her body. We
don’t need to be making those choices for her. This is not a compromise
bill. It’s not about safety. It’s about choosing, or not allowing women
to choose. It’s about limiting her right to make that choice. This bill,
the way it was handled. Makes it clear to me that it’s about politics.
It’s not about women’s health. It’s not about safety. Ironically, AKA
695 now 353, Family Faith and Freedom, it doesn’t do anything to support
or respect women or me as a part of a family. It does nothing to restore
my faith in this general assemblies ability to respect women to make
personal decisions that only she and her doctor, and her family ought to
make. Vote NO on this incredibly horrible bill.</p>

Representative Farmer-Butterfield, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, I
strongly encourage all of you to vote against Senate Bill 353. This bill
is just another ploy to control women's abortion rights by imposing
excessive and unnecessary requirements. It is a trap. These antics did
not work through Senate House Bill 695 so instead the Senate places
almost identical language within Senate Bill 353. Senate Bill 353 was
intended to keep motorcyclist safe, not to regulate abortions. The
requirement of ambulatory surgical centers has been eliminated; however,
instead the authority has been granted to the Department of Health and
Human Services to apply the requirements for the licensure of ambulatory
surgical centers and standards applicable. This can still close clinics
in North Carolina depending on what the department decides to do. It
might be cost prohibited. These other additions to the bill are still an
attempt to control women's abortion rights rather than protect their
health and safety. They limit. They restrict. They control.
Senate Bill 351 would eliminate insurance coverage for abortion in
certain insurance plans and limits the funding under other health plans,
including county and city employees' plans. This is an attempt to limit
access and the ability to pay for legal abortions. Women who want this
medically legal procedure, whether surgical or chemical, should be
assured that the decision is a private one controlled by them, their
family, friends and physicians as Representative Adams said.
Are these regulations really necessary to protect women's health? Or are
they a decoy for another agenda? This is an anti-women's bill in
disguise. A wolf in sheep's clothing and another attempt to try to slip
in anti-abortion legislation with little public notice. Women seek to be
in charge of this process, but some of our fellow legislators are trying
to take control of this process. North Carolina already has intense
regulations on abortions and clinics that perform them for safety
purposes. This bill is not about safety. It is about limiting choice.
There's no medical or scientific basis for actually promoting women's
health and safety with these proposed restrictions. It is just an
honorless and biased bill.
More than half of the States now have laws instituting honorless and
irrelevant licensing requirements known as targeted regulation of
abortion provider laws. The trap. There needs to be more research done.
Additional inspectors hired. Actual safety precautions instead of
proposing anti-abortion legislation. That's where the money needs to be
going as pointed out by Secretary Voss of the Department of Health and
Human Services.
These facilities need to be regulated by health service regulation
section of the department. Yes, they need to be visited more than every
three to five years to monitor and enforce. This is a trap. This is
absolutely nothing to do with protecting us, women. And everything to do
with shutting down clinics across these United States.
This is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Don't fall for this trap and North
Carolina is better than this. I plead you vote no on Senate Bill 353.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanted to see if Representative Farmer-Butterfield
would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Farmer-Butterfield, does it
concern you that the rules have not been updated in 30 years? And don't
include some of the National Abortion Foundation's recommendations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't have a problem with the rules being updated. I
think the key thing is that they don't need to avoid people having legal
abortions in this State. And they don't need to be cost prohibitive. In
fact, I wondered why no one in the Department of Health and Human
Services in the 11 years that I've been here has even talked about the
need to update these.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  So members, let me get this straight.  Out
of a purported concern for women's health, and in light of the
Constitutional rule of Roe Vs. Wade, and in an ostensible, at least,
genuflect to the outcry over the Senate process and substance of the
Senate bill, the majority in what it portrays as an admirable exercise
of legislative restraint, abstains today from passive a bill that
eliminating abortion access outright.  It does so, because after all,
that would mean a direct Constitutional confrontation it was sure to
lose.  So this bill emerges from yet another secret rewrite by moonlight
to the early morning sun yesterday, under the intriguing an wholly
non-transparent title of the Motorcycle Safety Act, with some minimalist
change in the wording, but as Representative Samuelson conceded
yesterday in committee, quote the same the same intent, unquote, as the
widely criticized Senate bill.  The result of course is precisely the
same as the Senate bill, and no different than if the bill expressly
eliminated access.    No one really believes the majority's bait and
switch today.  No one is persuaded the bill is really about women's
health, except those already persuaded, and not a dimes worth of
difference in principle exists between the Senate bill, or this one, or
one that would have directly eliminated reproductive choice.  They all
would take a slightly different route but they end up at the same
intended destination, effective elimination of meaningful choice in this
state, and any claims to the contrary are insulting to the intelligence.
 So let's start, since we're re-writing the law of abortion, with what
the law of abortion is.  In Planned Parenthood versus Casey, the court
established the undue burden test for determining whether a statute
restricting abortions could pass constitutional muster.  Under Casey
Laws, invalid if it places an undue burden on a woman's right to have a
pre-viability abortion, and an undue burden exists if the state
regulation has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path
of a woman's choice to that abortion.  A state's discretion to regulate
on the basis of maternal health does not permit it to adopt regulations
that depart form accepted medical practice.   In some quarters, those
are known as constitutional principles, but not apparently in the North
Carolin General Assembly.  The majority today, in an attempt to show
public relations compliance with the right to privacy suggest a general
health rational to uphold the bill's 3 key provisions.  One, a
physicians presence, whatever that is, and supervision, however you
define it, is needed throughout the quote, entire abortion procedure,
end quote.  And don't strain yourself looking for that definition,
because it doesn't exist in the bill, or the law.  And the floor
managers yesterday in committee could not answer what the real
definition is.  Second, a physician's presence is mandated for the
administration of any medication swallowed, designed to abort the fetus,
but not for further doses as Representative Samuelson correctly
acknowledged.  And third, the Secretary of Health and Human services is
given total discretion to decide on what procedures and rules are needed
for clinic and patient safety, including, and let's be clear, because
the bill says it, any option that's pertinent to ambulatory surgical
facility regulations.  When asked if these rules met the Casey
standards, the majority repeatedly and robotically said they create no
undue burden, they are necessary for a mother's health, and they ensure
safety.  Well, wrong, wrong, and wrong again.  Repeatedly saying those
phrases without content hardly gives them more merit.  To answer the
real constitutional issue raise by this bill, we need go no farther than
asking if there are compelling facts as the</p>

<p id="050:00">
Law requires sufficient to justify these highly invasive governmental
intrusions into a woman's fundamental right of privacy and her access to
it. Well where to begin? Maybe where I just ended. Because not a single
fact was truly presented in any serious form in either the senate or the
house. And what's the first giveaway to that? Well the first giveaway is
the absence of any legislative findings on the record, or in the bill.
There's not so much as a preamble to this bill or this new section to
support why the bill or these provisions are medically necessary,
medically reasonable or legally valid.
Across this nation there are a number of bills this session that have
been filed and some passed in other states, seeking to change the law of
abortion in those states. And what I would defy any of you is to go to
any  of those bills that were enacted and find a one that doesn't
contain a copious legislative record or findings. The arrogance of the
House determination to simply impose its ideological will here today
without even attempting to create the findings to show why the
provisions are necessary and reasonable medically and legally valid is
breathtaking.
of course good reason exists as to why there are no legislative findings
in the bill and that's because there's no legislative record of evidence
to support them. As to the first provision, the record here is stunning
for its nonexistence. No testimony, no studies, no evidence of any kind
was presented in the Senate, but of course why should any of us expect
that to occur because the goal there was to move fast with no notice and
no record, and they succeeded.
Here we at least had as representative Samuelson has correctly stated a
public hearing, but most of the concerns raised by many at that hearing,
including requests by the secretary for long term review and study of
dozens of issues occur, but no testimony other than a few brief three
minute comments form members of the audience. There was no medical
evidence requested, no studies introduced and the committee that
listened to the comments was not even the committee that ended up being
assigned in voting the bill. A first I would expect in the annals of
state governance.
Nor the committee comments for that matter transcribed for those of us
who weren't there, although I was for part of it, to read, and at least
say we had the comments in front of us. Next, the first provision of the
three that I mention in this bill which hasn't been talked about in the
previous discussions creates the physician requirement. It sets out
whole new terms undefined in prior law and in this bill like the term
entire abortion procedure. What does that mean? is the physician to be
physically present with the patient an hour pre-op and an hour post-op
as was suggested in the committee yesterday? and if so, what a surprise
to the North Carolina Medical Society to learn that nearly all its
surgeries for generation have been done wrong, since that's almost never
occurs.
And what does the term presence mean? Actual physical presence as some
of the bills sponsors said? Construct a presence in the building as
others suggested? Or maybe metaphysical in some way like telephonicly.
And what does it mean if they can be in the facility? Within so many
yards of the room, within so many feet, seconds away, could they go
outside for a smoke? Well no one knows. The bill's that invade a
constitutional right at least ought to define the terms of the invasion.
As to the second provision, clearly the winner of the most feeble
provision of the bill award, what possible reason exists to watch the
pill being ingested? And if it's needed for the first, why not the
second or third? And if it is to see if the woman is ready and it is the
right time for her to take the pill well that's truly important and I
agree with representative Samuelson there, but the physician doesn't
have to be in the room when the nurse comes with the pill and she
swallows it. That is absurd.
And what a surprise I suspect it is to the anesthesiologist in this [??]
stay, who earlier this session fought over the term supervision in bills
before us. Supervision for them means in the building, they can be in
several OR's at the same time as long as the CRNA is there and available
if needed. Well let me suggest to you men and women who are
anesthesiologists no longer guys, if it's medically necessary that
supervision be physically present in the same room for the operation for
abortion, it sure should be for anesthesiologists where someone could
become brain dead and die because of a lack of oxygen. The consequences
of what we do today...</p>

<p id="055:00">
the words that we have in this bill matter to all patients and all
doctors and all facilities and it cannot be neatly ??? into abortions.
But of course when we race to put on the calendar ideological bills
without taking the time to talk with medical societies and boards and
practitioners and facilities, do we expect a different result?  Finally,
as to the third provision in the bill that authorizes the study of what
rules are needed but orders the effective date of compliance with those
rules months before the study is to finish, someone else on our side
will talk about that. But more important to me the bill provides no
guidance whatsoever to practitioners or facilities of what is expected,
when compliance will be expected, the costs of that compliance, how they
can prepare to comply and indeed how they can comply.  Just notice that
any and everything is possible including all the mandates of an
ambulatory surgical center, whatever they are,  because we don't have it
in the record what they are, and the Secretary saying the other day that
there are serious issues that deserve long-term study, apparently at
least a night's worth. Casey teaches us that health regulations which
are unnecessary and not reasonably related to maternal health or depart
from accepted medical practice cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny
and must be invalidated.  I assure you these will. In reality this bill
is nothing but a legislative fusilade aimed at smothering the right to
privacy and a woman's right to choose under any circumstances. The bill
tramples on access and marches backward in time, all but eliminating any
cost and time effective way to practice medicine in this arena and for
facilities to plan and comply with what amounts to a standardless
unbridled discretionary law changeable at the political whim of a
department, a Governor, or a Legislature. It is a betrayal of settled
expectations of the women of North Carolina to reproductive choice. And
you know, it takes real cheek for the majority to assure us their only
concern is women's health.  And those who do abortions, says Senator
Daniel, safely have nothing to fear from this law. When what has
preceded before and succeeded since the filing of all these measures has
been a virtual assault in public and private speeches on the concept of
abortion by bill sponsors and co-sponsors and lectures on how abortion
should be eliminated. For many in the majority the story of abortion is
always black and white.  Have an abortion, you've done a bad thing. But
the truth of course is the majority of women in this State and nation
and world know is far more complex. No one today should doubt the only
restraint on the majority's reach on this and other issues like it is
what it thinks it can get away with and the answer to that question lies
with the courts and the electorate, both of whom we shall hear from soon
enough. Some today have excoriated the process used to get this bill to
the floor and to an extent I agree.  But in a sense the majority has
done us a favor.  It has given us the most transparent view of what
really underlies the bill.  A pretension to power confined by neither
the Constitution nor the current sentiment of a majority of North
Carolinians. The bill is astounding to me.  An unprecedented except it
continues and takes to a new extreme the recent tendency in the House
and the Senate to turn Constitutional protections for minority rights
into a repealer of this state's traditions of tolerance and it is to me
fundamentally wrong to use some newly found Constitutional protections
as springboards for major changes like the Second Amendment with whom
this Legislative body is conducting an amorous affair while treating
others like senile relatives to be closeted in the attic until they quit
annoying us like the right to privacy and bodily integrity and
reproductive choice. In the end North Carolina should be scared of what
this bill portends when a Legislature feels unrestrained by its oath,
unrestrained by any sense of responsibility to cast a middle ground on a
divisive issue in a centrist state, and unrestrained by any
understanding of women and families who lead lives outside our narrow
cultural lens as legislators. 1984 may have come a bit later than
predicted but it is here at last and with all pretense to moderation
shorn of its fictitious cover.  Justice Kagan recently stated: to a
hammer everything looks like a nail. And to an extreme legislative
majority bent on eliminating the right to choice, everything looks like
a health regulation ready to be abused and used to</p>

sounded nice but it's incorrect. I hardly know where to start. But I'll
limit it to one question. Are you aware that the 4th Circuit has upheld
a very similar law to this in South Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I've read the Greenville opinion from the year 2000,
Representative Blust. And the Greenville opinion, which at the time
obviously cert was denied 13 years ago. Had about 10 different
provisions in it. It was a 2 to 1 decision, as you recall, with Judge
Hamilton writing a brilliant dissenting opinion. And an awful lot of the
provisions that we're talking about here, particularly the physician
presence provision and the physician presence provision for medication
weren't in that bill. The facility provision to some degree was but
written entirely differently, and there, there were actually a whole
series of standards. And in that case, Representative Blust, there were
copious legislative findings. Cited by the majority opinion but Justice
Niemeyer and cited by Judge Hamilton in his dissent. And in that case as
well, there were a whole series of exhibits and evidence introduced
before the South Carolina legislature. None of which are here. We are,
as Representative Samuelson said, in a different time. So we can't rely
on another State's finding 13 years ago, can we? And if we can't, where
are ours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Buncombe,
Representative Fisher rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of
the House. So we are told to believe that this is an improvement on what
the Senate did last week while we in the House were given the week off.
Well, this is just another version of the same political game playing.
Maybe we could call it sneak attack on women's reproductive healthcare
version 2.0. Because it does not matter what we call it, it is what it
is. The deceitful hijacking of women's access to a constitutionally
protected medical procedure. The republican majority must think that
their constituents can't read or else they might have given some thought
to dropping language that they criticize their Senate counterparts for
having put into a sharia law bill into a motorcycle safety bill. Really?
Well it does not matter where this language appears, it still does all
of the same damage that the Senate version did. It renders this week's
carefully orchestrated Health and Human Services Committee meeting on
the Senate bill nothing but a charade. No lessons learned from last
week. A bill with all the same ingredients. Still done in a rush. Still
no stakeholder or Health and Human Services Department input until the
last minutes. Still tells physicians how to do their jobs. Still
interferes with local governments decision making and all of this
happens still with no public notice.
If the goal had been to protect the health and safety of women in this
State, often what we do is we go and look at other examples in other
States to see what they've done. I mean I know we've all been looking at
Texas lately, but have we looked at Maryland? Maryland just tightened
the oversight of their abortion clinics but it just came into force this
year. Their regulations just came into effect...</p>

<p id="065:00">
This year, North Carolina has had regulations in effect since '94, way
before now. If the goal is to protect the health and safety of women,
why would we not look at other states who are just now getting around to
it, who actually had people on both sides of the aisle in agreement?
This is the thing I came here to do. To work toward agreement on both
sides of the aisle. This Maryland bill had even the Maryland officials
of Planned Parenthood, a group leery of regulations because, in its
view, they are too often driven by politics, call these rules reasonable
and helpful. We have to begin taking politics out of these legislative
exercises and we need to begin to talk to the departments first. Or at
least look at other states and what they're doing. Where does this bill
leave women in North Carolina? Well, it looks like that the only
facility that will qualify to provide services under this bill, just as
in the Senate version, is in my district in Asheville. This is going to
make it difficult, if not impossible, for women in the rest of the
state, in particular rural areas, to access reproductive healthcare. Why
is this happening, and under the guise of the safety and health of
women? It is clear that this is about pushing a political agenda, not
about protecting women. It is obvious with the numbers of voters that
have signed petitions and that have appeared week after week on Halifax
Mall that we must give women more respect than to ignore the democratic
process. Let me just say that according to the Center for Disease
Control, the medical record for abortions in the United States indicate
that the procedure is quite safe, overall. Ten women died. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, point of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose
does the lady from Surry, Representative Stevens, rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Are we back on the bill, or are we going to discuss abortion? I
think we're here talking about clinics and the regulation of clinics as
opposed to whether abortion is safe, period. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair
will accept the lady's point of order. I would not rule the lady from
Buncombe out of order, but I would encourage the lady from Buncombe to
keep her remarks as relevant as possible to the bill without venturing
off as much as possible [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Speaker, and I will
say that this does address the matter of safety of women. This bill
purports to be about the health and safety of women. And the CDC says
that ten women died of abortion-related causes out of 1.2 million
procedures in 2010 and that the number of deaths in 2009 was twelve. And
for many years, the death rate has hovered around  one per 100,000
procedures, according to Dr. David Grimes a professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at the North Carolina School of Medicine. And today he is
quoted as saying that having an abortion is safer than an injection of
penicillin. So if this is about the health and safety of women, as I
said earlier, we have seen numbers of voters that have signed petitions,
that have appeared week after week on the Halifax Mall and it is clear
that we must give women more respect than to ignore the democratic
process. Ladies and gentlemen, we must listen to their voices. We must
listen to their voices and vote no. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For
what purpose does the gentleman from Vance, Representative Baskerville,
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor</p>

to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I just want to take a few
moments this afternoon to talk about this so-called Family Faith and
Freedom Act.  It started out as the Family Faith and Freedom Act, an act
that was so important and vitally necessary that it was hastily buried
in a motorcycle bill under the cover of darkness only to be resurrected
in its current form under a different title, Health and Safety Law
Changes. The procedure happened this way because that was the way that
this majority party figured that they can get the legislation passed.
It was done this way because all of the women in North Carolina know
that this bill does nothing to protect their constitutionally guaranteed
freedoms including that right to privacy and that it does nothing to
improve women's health or safety.  This bill in my opinion is yet
another power grab by this Republican Party.  The most recent example of
our state being tutored by this Republican majority on what big
government really looks like.  Case in point: part 2 of the bill takes
away authority from local officials to insure city and county employees
as they see fit. Sections 2b and c dictates all the way from Raleigh
down to the 100 counties in our state as to what those county
commissioners and city councilmen can and cannot offer as a part of
their health insurance package to their employees.  Now I contend to you
that local control works and if a county wants to offer more
reproductive health coverage than what's offered to teachers and state
employees then they ought to have the freedom to do that.  No.  But this
big government Republican majority thinks they know better than all of
the city councilmen and women, all of the county commissioners, what's
best for their employees in their counties.  I ask you, how does that
section improve women's safety?  How does that section protect
individual freedoms?  If you think I'm exaggerating here about this big
government power grab let me tell you about what Dr. Aldona Wos, the
Governor's Secretary of Health and Human Services, said in a Committee
meeting.  Dr. Wos essentially told us that her agency couldn't even
accommodate all the new authority.  They couldn't even handle all the
new power that this Legislature wants to give to them. I interpreted her
remarks to mean that this bill is a bridge too far. But instead of
compromising and paring down the bill this new version gives even more
power, even more government authority, to the current Secretary of HHS
as well as all future secretaries of HHS to impose whatever new rules or
regulations they want to.  The Department is authorized to apply any
requirement for ambulatory surgical centers to certify abortion
facilities. This legislation is forcing the Department to do the dirty
work for this sweeping right wing agenda. But if you look at Section 4
of this bill, this bill literally allows this Legislature to invade the
privacy of the doctor's office and literally dictates to the doctor,
once again all the way from Raleigh, how long that doctor must be in the
room for these procedures. That is the very embodiment of big brother
looking over your shoulder.  That is a decision that should be made
between a woman and her doctor at that time, in the privacy of the
doctor's office, and this Legislature ought to respect that right and
that privacy. Now to the men and women in North Carolina, when you hear
my Republican colleagues profess to you that they believe in privacy and
that they believe in personal liberties and individual freedoms I want
you to think back to today.  Think back to this unprecedented big
government intrusion into the private lives of women, their families</p>

And their doctors. The actions today are not only detrimental to women's
health, it's also detrimental to our economy. Business are not inclined
to come to a state where they'll be subjected to hastily crafted,
sweeping legislation at the drop of a dime with no public notice. But
you don't have to make my word for that. You can follow the most recent
survey by CNBC that ranks the competitiveness of all fifty sates in
America. This year we will rank the twelfth most competitive state of
business.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker point of order.
[Speaker Changes] The lady from Surry has the floor to state her point
of order.
[Speaker Changes] We're now coming from clinics and regulating clinics
to our standing as business friendly. I think we've moved very far
afield here now.
[Speaker Changes] To the Representative Baskerville the Chair would ask:
I realize this is an emotional issue and that there's a little bit of
political discussion that's somewhat permitted on this. The Chair is
trying to get wide latitude but would ask the member to try to contain
his remarks more relevant to the issues at hand.
[Speaker Changes] I appreciate your indulgence Mr. Speaker. When I get a
point of order that means I'm really cooking; that means I'm on to
something. [Laughter from audience.] Now last year we were ranked
fourth, this year we're ranked twelfth. You know why? Because we fell to
thirtieth out of fifty states of quality of life. Quality of life
impacts our business competitiveness here in this state. Believe
business leaders read these bills. They read the headlines that explain
how this body has taken a regressive turn for the worst. They see the
thousands of protesters who gather here weekly to decry the legislative
measures that impact their quality of life. Kudos to our Republican
controlled legislature for fulfilling the campaign promises of creating
a business friendly environment. I think that some of my colleagues
might...
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman would be reminded to contain his remarks
to the bill if he wishes to continue to have the floor of debate.
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir. I think that some of my colleagues––and I'm
wrapping it up. I think that some of my colleagues will speak more to
this issue, but I just wanted to say one last thing, and it literally
comes from my friend and colleague on the other side, Representative
Jeter, speaking passionately about the airport, he said, &quot;The
decision I make is my own; my decision is personal. The airport is in my
backyard.&quot; That is what millions of North Carolina women are trying
to tell us. Their decision that they want to make is their own decision.
That's a personal decision to them. Now, they don't have an airport in
their backyard, but this is their body we're talking about. And I have
faith in our women, that they will exercise their Constitutional
freedoms to make the right choice for their families. I ask that you
vote no.
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does the gentleman from Union,
Representative Arp rise?
[Speaker Changes] To ask my esteemed colleague, Representative
Baskerville, a question.
[Speaker Changes] Does the gentleman from Vance yield to the gentleman
from Union?
[Speaker Changes] I will for the gentleman from Union.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you very much. You begin your comments regarding
the freedom offered of abortion services to –– through municipalities
and so forth, and then ended up the comments regarding the personal
choice. Is it your position that you want to force taxpayers to pay for
those abortions through taxpayer dollars.
[Speaker Changes] May I answer?
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman yielded the question and may answer.
[Speaker Changes] No sir, that's not my personal position. My position
is that if a local city counsel or a local county commission, who are
directly elected by those constituents, decide that they want to offer
additional abortion services on their health insurance plans, they ought
to be allowed to do that. And I veto by Raleigh that they can.
[Speaker Changes] Follow up?
[Speaker Changes] Does the gentleman yield?
[Speaker Changes] Yes.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Changes] The local funds that would used to pay for those
services would be tax dollars. Is that correct?
[Speaker Changes] Well, the... I know that the Affordable Care Act
already bans any...</p>

Funding for abortions and insurance plans
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker
[Speaker Changes] Representative Hamilton please state your purpose
[Speaker Changes] Inquiry of the chair please
[Speaker Changes] The lady may state her inquiry. The gentleman is in
the middle of answering a question to another member. Is it relevant to
this discourse here or can the lady wait?
[Speaker Changes] It is. I'm curious as to who's time is being used
during this discourse.
[Speaker Changes] As stated by the chair at the beginning of the
meeting, the time that the gentleman spends responding to a question is
allocated against the time of the person asking the question. The
gentleman may proceed. Just as that time was allocated to representative
Hamilton. The gentleman may proceed.
[Speaker Changes] I'm done, thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Stevens please state your purpose
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I want to
get to some of the questions that you've been asking over there, as if
this were just pulled magically out of the air that here was no need for
this bill. Let me first tell you we got the information from the
Department of Health and Human Services. There have been 205 citations
issued against these clinics in the last 10 years. A preferred woman's
health in Raleigh had 33 citations since 2001. A preferred woman's
health in Charlotte has had 41 citations. This is a clinic that was just
closed in the last month, but the investigation had been going on for 3
years. A woman's choice in North Carolina, in Greensboro, had 5
complaints since 2001. All of these are since 2001 to the extent that
they have been open. A woman's choice of Raleigh has had 13 citations.
These are not just the inspections itself, but these are the problems
that were found. Chris clinic for women in Jacksonville had 9
complaints. Easton OBGYN in Chapel Hill had had 15 citations. Family
reproductive of Charlotte had had 4. Hallmark woman's clinic had had 14.
Piedmont Carolina's medical had had 8. Planned Parenthood of Central
North Carolina and Chapel Hill had had 11. Planned Parenthood of
Wilmington had had 9. Planned Parenthood of Winston Salem had 19.
Woman's health alliance of Chapel Hill had had 10. And the Baker clinic,
that had only been open for 6 months, had already received 6 citations
in those 6 months. Yes the system is set up properly, but the problem is
repeat offenders are hard to get to. Now, the rest of you talked about
these rules. And what was in these rules? And I challenge to see how
many of you in fact have read these rules. They are less than 10 pages
of rules that currently govern clinics that were set up in 1974. I
believe that is the correct statement. They were set up in 1974 and have
not been revised in almost, what is that,  40 years we are coming up on.
Things have changed during that time. The standards and needs have
changed during that time. Now were these frivolous little complaints?
No. We've looked at the documented complaints. As Representative
Schaffer says she has a timetable showing these complaints. These
complaints were things such as, breaking open a vile of intravenous
medicine to divide it among four patients. Both of which were
violations, breaking open the tube, and giving it to multiple different
patients. They found dirty unsterilized equipment that was going to be
used on women in some of these clinics. They found dried blood on the
lamps that were used to investigate these women. So don't tell me this
is not about health and safety, that's exactly what it's about. We need
very specific rules. The National Abortion Foundation, which we looked
at their manual that was sent to us, has standards. They go on for 50
pages with standards that are a bare minimum of what you should do. Then
they have recommendations, that are sort of steering. And then they have
other things that are optional. North Carolina's not bothered to look at
that because the National Abortion Foundation did't come into a factor
and set up its standards and rules until 1996. All we've done with this
bill is give the authority to Health and Human services to do what needs
to be done. In the last 6 months, they've had to close 2 clinics. And I
will bet it took an act of Congress, because there is very little in
those rules that they can rely on. So you know these things had to be
egregious. I'll be happy to share them with any of you, and share the
information.</p>

<p id="085:00">
[Speaker Changes] I could tell you there’s a box of documents
downstairs. I could tell you there’s a file folder on Ruth Samuelson’s
desk that has all the complaints about the one clinic that did get
closed down. I could tell you that this is not been treated lightly, and
it is very much concerned over women’s health and safety. There is not a
war on women. There is a group of people here trying to make sure that
those people who go in at that most vulnerable time are provided safe
and effective healthcare, under the best standards and conditions
possible. And I’m sorry if you don’t believe that, but thats the truth.
We know that Roe vs. Wade is the law, we know that abortion is out
there. But it should be safe, and clean, and sterile, as well as legal,
and that’s what we’re here for.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Richardson, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The Lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] I’ve been sitting and listening and I’m not gonna be
as eloquent as many of the other speakers. But I question the motive and
the authenticity of this bill, because for the very citation that
Representative Stevens just spoke of.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] A point of order, did the lady say, “I question the
motives of”?
[Speaker Changes] Of the bill, I mean, not of the people, of the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The chair will remind, for the third time today, that
the chair will continue to ask the member to suspend. That the discourse
is managed by the chair. Every member will wait until the chair
acknowledges the members right to continue speaking, before they speak.
Discussions will be ruled out of order and the remaining time for that
member for that opportunity to debate will be ended at that time. They
will be recognized for a second time, should they have it, after I rule
them out of order. The lady has the floor.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, I apologize. I would like to
correct that statement. I question the motive of the bill, if we are
saying that the bill has been written for the safety of women health,
when there is no fiscal note on this bill and we have given the
secretary of DHHS the authority to make rules and to come back to this
committee with the necessary resources that will be needed to implement
this. Which seems to say to me that we have no intentions of putting
money into correcting the issues that were cited, because there is no
fiscal note. We have asked that this bill go into effect October 1,
2013, but we don’t have to have temporary rules until January of 2014,
and then we wait until April of 2014 to report back what those findings
are. So I question why we don’t have a fiscal note, knowing that the
Secretary has stated to us that her office and her staff are not capable
of being able to implement these regulations or to follow up with any
more frequent monitoring of such facilities because she does not have
enough resources. So I do question the motive of the bill in the sense
that it said that it’s for safety reasons. I question why we would
propose a bill without studying it to find out what the fiscal
responsibilities would be for the state, for the provider, and what
financial impact it would have upon women who access those clinics that
may possibly be closed, whether they are safe or not. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chair, Mr. Speaker. I have listened to
this debate of this bill, and it is really almost laughable, at the
arguments that I hear. I continue to be amazed at our ability to
demagogue in this general assembly, on important issues concerning this
state. We all know what this bill is about. This bill has nothing to do
with the safety of women no matter how much we want to continue to say
it. This is a radical bill, that gives the ability for radical
politicians to oppose radical beliefs on the rights of women. That’s all
this is about. If you wanted to increase the safety of women and have
quality access to healthcare, you….</p>

[Speaker changes.]...abdicated your responsibility by denying the
Medicaid expansion or the Affordable Healthcare Act...
[Speaker changes.] Representative Brandon, the gentleman...be mindful of
the scope of his comments.
[Speaker changes.] It is...ok...I apologize Mister Chair but we do have
to talk about...when we talkin' about the safety and the healthcare of
women, we have to talk about all of the things that we've done in this
General Assembly that goes along with that and we can't just come up
today and all of a sudden, we care about it when we have proof for many,
many bills that we might not have cared about it but I just want to...I
really want to talk about what this does is if you are a pro-life
person...and a lot of people on the other side who claim that and I'm
not gonna be long in my comments because I just really wanna make this
point for you guys that, if you are pro-life, pro-life exists after
birth. And that's just a fact.  We can't continue to deny people
healthcare. We can't deny people unemployment coverage. We can't deny
people earned income tax credits and then...
[Speaker changes.] Representative Brandon, that will be the last time
the Chair allows you to run that far afield. Gentleman may continue.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker, I continue to maintain that this is
an overall point of I'm trying to make in terms of the point of the bill
that everyone continues to try to make that this about the healthcare of
women and about the protection of women and I'm trying to correlate how
other bills in this General Assembly has not actually correlated with
this one but I understand your point and my point is this...folks, if
we're gonna really do some work, if we're really gonna be able to deal
with the issues, if we really wanna deal with healthcare for women, if
we really wanna make things safe, then we really need to look at a
comprehensive way in the way that we deal with our lawmaking and we need
to deal with a comprehensive way and make sure that all women have
access to healthcare, not just at an abortion clinic but in all
clinics...and we need to make sure that when they wanna make a
decision...this important decision that they have adequate services and
adequate ways to be able to do that and that includes making sure that
once the baby is born that they are able to be able to take care of
that...and my position continues to and maintains to be, even if it's
out of order, that we have not done that and we need to continue to do
that. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Presnell, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] I've been standin' here listenin' and I been tryin'
to put myself in the shoes of a young woman going into an abortion
clinic. I personally would never and will never attend anyplace like
that but I'm tryin' to put myself in the state of mind of what these
women are gonna go in there and see. They're not gonna see the blood on
the table or the surgical instruments that have not been sterilized. I
would hope in their mind they are asking the Lord, is this the right
thing to be doing. I don't think they're looking at the infectious
diseases that could be transmitted through the surgical instruments that
have not been sterilized at all.  On a tour in December 11th of 2012,
which is only about two weeks before Christmas...at 10AM with a surgical
procedure scheduled to begin around 11:30, there was dried blood on
observed on an exam light, on a chair and the doorjam in procedure
number two...room number two.  There was thick dust on the exam table in
number three.  The tour of the procedure room in number one revealed
dead insects in the window.  This young lady is not gonna have that on
her mind.  We, as legislators, have gotta do something that will take
care of these women when they're in there having a procedure like this
done.  It is ludicrous to think that that woman is gonna have in her
mind, looking at stuff and saying...it's not clean for me to be here and
maybe I need to leave.  That's not what she should have on her mind. I'm
just tired of listening to this whole thing and I just had to tell you
how I feel. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker, can I ask a question please?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Holley, please state your purpose. If
the lady's purpose is to ask a question, may she direct the...to whom
does she wish to direct the question?
[Speaker changes.] To Representative Presnell.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Presnell, does the lady yield?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, I will.
[Speaker changes.] The lady yields.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Presnell, I understand what you're
saying. And, there are exceptions to every rule and there will be
facilities that are like that but would you prefer her to go to some
back alley with a nasty coat hanger?
[Speaker changes.] I prefer that she plan ahead.</p>

birth control. But know there's other places that are clean that she
could possibly go to if that's what she has in mind. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I

when we say one incident is the norm, because it's not. You can also go
into a dental clinic and see the same things. You can go into a number
of facilities. I'm just pointing out that the alternatives sometimes can
be worse, and this is not. You can't use the instances of one facility
to blanket everything. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may
state his point. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Listen to the debate, and it's been
several of the speakers. I'm listening intently. Would it be in order to
do what we do for resolutions and have the bill read in its entirety?
Particularly section 4, because I'm not sure the members are debating
the bill as it's written. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair would hope that
those who take this matter seriously would have taken time to read the
bill and the implications of the implementation of the bill, but the
Chair would not take your question to have the bill read in its
entirety. Representative Cunningham, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady
is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much.
I have received numerous emails from medical professionals in my county,
Mecklenburg County. I'm gonna read just one to you. As a charlatan?? and
a physician, I am saddened by the bill, especially the latest version
that placed limitations on simple, safe procedures for women. This bill
would institute unneeded barriers to care, both financially and by
limiting availability. We recognize the need to keep abortion safe,
legal, and rare, but this provision would place women at risk. Medical
abortions are extremely safe and simple, and requiring a physician's
presence would be the equivalent of requiring a doctor to supervise a
diabetic injecting insulin. Furthermore, meeting the the requirements of
ambulatory surgery centers is insufficient, high cost, and not medically
necessary.  I urge you not to support the bill. Dr. Eifert, medical
physician. Now I will make my comments. As a health care provider and a
member of the American Nursing Association, I believe the health care
client has the right to privacy and the right to make decisions on
personal health based on full information and without coercion. It is
the obligation of the health care provider to share with the client all
relevant information about health choices that are legal and to support
that client regardless of the decision the client makes. Abortion is a
reproductive alternative that is legal and that the health care provider
can objectively discuss when counseling clients. If the state limits the
provision of such information to the client, an unethical and clinically
inappropriate restraint will be imposed on the provider, and the
provider/client relationship will be jeopardized. Just as the client has
rights, the nurse also has rights, including the right to refuse to
participate in a particular case on ethical grounds. However, if the
nurse becomes involved in such a case and the client's life is in
jeopardy, the nurse in obliged to provide for the client's safety to
avoid abandonment and to withdraw only when assured that alternative
sources of nursing care are available to the client. The fact that
thousands of North Carolina women are seeking abortion is a symptom. It
is not a disease. The treatment lies in addressing the problems</p>

...belying a deteriorating social fabric. Healthcare providers have the
right and the responsibility to seek viable solutions to these problems
that signal social failure. Such as any effective family planning,
deficient prenatal care, drug and alcohol abuse treatment, domestic
violence, unsuccessful parenting, sexually transmitted disease, and
inadequate child care.
Today we are restricting access to women in North Carolina whom are
determined, determined, to make their own reproductive choices. I want
to believe you want to help the women of North Carolina to live
productive lives. The women of North Carolina are intelligent, strong
and capable of making these vital decisions for themselves. We should
allow them to make their own life changing decisions for themselves.
You want to help women? Then institute equal pay. Reinstate their
unemployment benefits so they can support their children.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cunningham, if the member will remember
the admonishment from a prior speaker, the Chair would appreciate if the
lady focuses on the scope of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I will continue. Thank you. A system with
family planning tools, increased funding to women, infant, children
programs to provide care for their children.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cunningham, this will be the last time
the Chair tries to provide the member with the proper direction on scope
before the lady is ruled out of order in her first time to debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will try to stay with the
content, but my point of view is that this is not a one sided issue
where only one thing affects one thing. This is a full view. One thing
always affects another.
For social...we'll move on. The social failures that I have mentioned
above, if addressed can empower the women of North Carolina and their
families. When women are whole, their families are whole. Let the women
of North Carolina determine their own destiny. I ask you to vote for the
women of North Carolina by voting no for this bill. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I find it quite ironic to stand here in this General
Assembly and talk to you about regulating healthcare. This General
Assembly has been all about regulatory reform, reducing the regulatory
burden. Whether it's been about fracking or aquifers, or job safety, or
conservation issues. We've been about regulatory reform and that has
been about reducing regulation. Streamlining aspects of our economy. But
when it comes to women's healthcare, we find that government can really
use regulation to be an obstructionist. To add hurdles, to add cost, to
add inconvenience and delay, to access to, again, an important service
for women in this State. And women's healthcare in general.
Because the attempt of this bill is really, the outcome of this bill, is
to make it harder for healthcare professionals to provide women access
to their constitutionally protected medical procedures. It's not about
safety. It is quite clear that what we are doing here is using
government's power to make it more difficult to have access to quality
care. Access to quality care is what creates safety. What creates better
outcomes. Now I do think there is room to improve all medical
procedures. My wife is a physician. I've been on my hospital's
foundation board. Designed hospital facilities. Designed medical
facilities. I'm an architect as you know. To use the division of a...</p>

Services, to make it harder to create access, is just contrary to common
sense and decency in this state. We have had these women’s clinics in
North Carolina for 40 years. And our state has regulated them carefully,
thoughtfully. They have provided services adequately and safely. But
like any hospital, like any clinic, like any health care facility, there
is room for improvement. Room for improvement in safety. Three or four
years ago when I was in the Senate, we had an initiative to save 100,000
lives from the Hospital Association. There were 100,000 lives in America
in a year that were lost through preventable causes in hospitals. There
is absolutely room to improve safety in every kind of medical facility.
But this approach, with no findings, no research, no authentic looking
at the facts, reviewing the facts, including experts to help you
identify what would be an initiative that would have positive results? I
think there’s plenty of room for our Department of Health and Human
Services to look at all our health care facilities and come up with such
strategies and procedures. So I’m not opposed to that thought. But it’s
transparent to me that this is just government obstruction for women’s
rights, and I will be voting against this bill and I hope you will. And
I hope we can actually be sincere about how much we could improve health
care if we took it seriously to discover the possibilities for
improvement through good research, through real fact-finding and real
research in this regard. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Earle, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. Speaker and members, I’ll be very
brief, but I’ve two reasons that I really need to speak. One is that I
ride a motorcycle and I want to let my motorcycle buddies know that when
I vote against this it’s not because I’m not concerned about their
safety on the highway. So I felt it necessary to make that point. The
other thing is much of what I’ve wanted to say has already been said so
I’m not going to go over it, but this legislation, this bill is supposed
to be different. But it has basically the same language that closes
these facilities. And of course, we’re hearing some of the safety
rhetoric that we heard in committee when we were dealing with the Senate
bill. I just want to be very clear on some things that I have gathered
from the legislation. To me, this is just another backdoor way of
attacking Roe vs. Wade. You know, abortion is legal in North Carolina
and is legal in this country. But if you continue to chip away at the
infrastructure, you basically the limit the choices that women have. And
I also want to say to that, this is not about safety issues or health
issues for women because when you start closing these facilities and
it’s my understanding that all of them would be closed with the
exception of maybe one or maybe two, but for all practical purposes
you’re closing all of these facilities. Well that’s going to drive women
to go to these back room places that existed before we had these
facilities come into existence. And if we’re going to talk about the
health of these</p>

<p id="110:00">
Women. Then I would think that that would be a major consideration
because you're going to be sending them to unsanitary places and
probably providers that have not been trained. And that ought to be
major consideration because the need or the desire for abortion is not
going to go away just because you close the facility. And I just want to
mention too that in my opinion here, we
have done more legislation that impact women than we have that creates
jobs or has a major impact on the economy. So we are basically focusing,
not just in North Carolina but across this country, a huge amount of
legislation that's dealing with restricting the rights of women.
Now I don't know if that's what I keep hearing that folk didn't campaign
on those kinds of issues. They campaigned on jobs and the economy and
all. But basically that's what we are doing. And the message that I got
from the Secretary is that if she had more resources, she could
effectively do a better job at looking at all of the abortion centers,
the ambulatory surgical centers across the state and that was one of her
major concerns. And I also kind of questioned the fact that there were
two facilities that were closed. And then we hear about the other
citations.
Obviously, the Secretary did not feel that it was necessary to close the
facilities or else she would have closed those also. And if we look and
make some comparisons when we look at restaurants when they have
received citations or whatever they are called, basically we give them
opportunity to correct it and stay open and they could have a negative
impact on our health as well. But we allow them to make the corrections
that are necessary and to stay open and to move on. And as I said,
evidently these citations that they receive, the DHHS obviously didn't
think that they were severe enough to close them. They have the
oversight.
But basically, I just think that we need to rethink this. This is not
very much different from the legislation that came over from the Senate.
And if we didn't think that that was good, the leadership didn't think
that was good, then we ought not think that this is good. And we should
also consider any office that does a surgical procedure, then we should
make sure that they come under these same guidelines. If we are going to
put these kind of stipulations and set rules for abortion centers, then
we should look at putting all of these different offices, dental
offices. Some time ago I had a foot surgery done in an office. So we
need to look at every office that does a surgical procedure and putting
them under some kind of guidelines and regulations and the same ones
that we do for abortion. And I would ask you not to support this at this
particular time. Thank you.

Thank you, Mister Chairman. I rise today to speak on another provision
in this bill that has been less prominent in our discussions today and
somewhat overlooked. It's our rights as citizens of this country and in
this great state to privacy where our healthcare is concerned unless the
individual chooses to disclose that information. This bill requires the
court to make the decision regarding a woman's private healthcare and
medical treatment. If she has already refused to consent to allowing a
party who is bringing a lawsuit against her to disclose her identity.
I'll quote the bill. The court shall rule whether the anonymity of any
woman upon whom an abortion has been performed or attempted shall be
preserved. Further, the court shall make the ruling determining that the
woman's anonymity should be preserved. End quote. So, the patient</p>

judge will make the decision for her. It seems to me like this wasn't
the face of our HIPPA Laws, if not in fact certainly in the spirit of
their intent of the law which allows all citizens of our country to
their privacy in their medical treatment. So not only are my colleagues
limiting access to healthcare for women, they are also  eliminating
patience rights to privacy regarding their medical care. I urge you
strongly to vote against this bill.

Representative of ?? please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill a second time
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The ladies recognize to debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ?? speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I wasn't planning to speak a
second time, but as the scientist in me, a couple of comments caught my
eye, and based on personal experiences as a second reason, I felt I
needed to speak about the quality of care and training that we seem to
be lacking in some of these facilities. First of all it was
Representative Schaffer who went through the list of some of the issues
with her documentation. It was followed up by Representative Stevens
enumerating some of the issues that were found in clinics. The one in
particular that caught my ear was the RH factor and this handling of
blood diagnosis and evaluation. Personally I have history with that
particular issue. My mother was an RH negative factor, blood. I as a
first born, was an RH positive. At the time I was born, my mothers body
began to develop antibodies to any future RH positive babies that she
might have, which turned out to be my younger sister. My younger sister,
who was born in 1958 before the immunoglobulin shot was developed, was
severely jaundiced. And over a period of months She had to have an
entire blood transfusion, cc by cc. And I sat in the hospital where she
was being given those shots to remove her blood and to replace it. And
it was horrible because you can imagine the size of a blood vessel of a
baby that size. With the mishandling of the blood work that's being done
in these clinics, we are opening that door to a lot of women who are not
getting the kind of counseling and the kind of analysis of their blood
that will let them know that they may have a future problem. That's
where I feel like we need to clamp down extremely hard. I've read
through the restrictions, I've read through the rules, I don't see
anything about what the certifications are for the people who are doing
the blood work. Where is that? Show me that in statute or in our rules
that demand the type of quality care of the people who are taking the
blood, making an analysis that's going to affect the future of that
women whose going through a terrible choice of an abortion that may want
to have a child in the future. We have got to tighten up, and we have
got to hold the kind of people accountable. Just like every position
whose have ever been held accountable for every surgery I've ever had in
the two times that I've delivered my children. I strongly ask for your
support for the health and safety of the women of North Carolina, thank
you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. I got confused in part of this bill, and I did want to ask what
something refers to. On the bill page three, lines, basically 43 down,
there's a definition of an attempt to perform an abortion and I couldn't
find what that related to anywhere else in the bill. Does it? This is a
legitimate question, I'm not trying to make a point or anything.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes this is the part that is related to the clarify law prohibit sex
selection abortion which we passed earlier in the session, so it goes
with that portion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll look at that later, thank you. My next question also refers to
something in the bill...</p>

...page 4, lines 14, 15, 16, 17, it talks about the physician performing
a surgical abortion shall be physically present during the performance
of the entire abortion procedure. And I was curious as to entire
abortion procedure, whether that included, okay, they treat the cervix
first and then there's a waiting period while that medication takes
effect before an abortion's performed. And then there's a recovery
procedure. Does it refer to all of that as the abortion procedure or is
it actually referring to the actual surgical abortion? This was the
question that Representative Glazier brought up and I would say
misinterpreted the answer he received from Representative Stam.
I asked around in the meantime and was told that the abortion part is
the actual abortion itself. The procedure of the abortion itself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Good. Thank you. And then in section 4 on that
same page, it says that the, it talks about Department of Health and
Human Services. The Department is authorized to apply any requirement
for the licensure of ambulatory surgical centers to the standards
applicable to clinics certified by the department to be suitable
facilities for the performance of abortions. And, this is just because I
don't know this because of lack of experience, but would those be
entirely up to that department or were those something that would come
back to be approved by this body?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's part of the rules making process. There were some
complaints earlier that there would be no input from the clinics and
such on these rules. That's where that would come in. When they go
through the rules making process, they ask for public input and then
they make the rules. But the department would make the rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, well, when I'm looking at the current rules, they
all have like...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McMannis, this will be the last
question before the Chair goes back to the more classical process of
engaging in the discussion because you asked for four questions, you
yielded four times.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I really didn't understand these things, so I didn't
know if the, I'm still not clear if the body will, if we approve those.
Because there's like approval dates under these rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We do not. It goes through the rules making process,
the formal rules making process. There's public input, there's time for
people to object. They look at what would be viewed as, were they
suitable facilities for the performance of abortions and if people think
they were unsuitable, either because they were too broad or not broad
enough, the public would be able to file letters of complaint and that
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, very much. I just needed clarification on
some things, so I do appreciate that. Now, if I could, I would like to
debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. In 1973, the United States legalized abortions
nationwide and almost immediately after that, pregnancy related deaths
and hospitalizations due to complications of unsafe abortions
effectively ended in the U.S. They pretty much disappeared after that.
Whereas prior to that there were a lot of hospitalizations.
Abortions are currently one of the safest surgical procedures for women
in the United States. Fewer than 1/2 of 1% of women obtaining abortions
experience a complication. And the risk of death associated with
abortion is about 1/10th of that associated with child birth.
If we pass laws that decrease access to abortion, then there are going
to be more illegal, unsafe, unsanitary abortions. And I'm afraid it will
make some of those criticisms and the abortion clinics look like
nothing. Those are bad and I admit it and I thought about some of
these...

access to abortions.  we're going to see illegal ones again, and the
public health tragedy costs by unsafe abortions is especially tragic
because it's largely preventable.  We don't have to make it so.  By
increasing access to safe services and improving the quality and ability
of post-abortion care, we're protecting women, we're protecting their
safety.  And because almost every abortion is proceeded by an unintended
pregnancy, the expanding access to contraceptive care, HIPPO, and
services is another factor that would protect women.  According to the
World Health Organization, unsafe abortion is the cause of 70,000
maternal deaths worldwide each year, or 1 in 8 pregnancy related deaths
among women.  That translates to 7 women per hour dying from a maternal
death from an unsafe abortion in this world.  The cost in women's lives
and health because of unsafe abortions are a human tragedy, but then
there are other costs to society.  Actual financial costs.  Each year an
estimated 5 million women are hospitalized for the treatment of abortion
complications world wide.
Mr. Speaker?
Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
What I'm hearing in essence is going worldwide, as opposed to this bill,
and it actually goes to supporting this bill to make sure abortions are
safe, but we're going for the worldwide.
Representative McManus will yield to Representative Stevens.  The chair
is going to allow some latitude.
I do think abortion statistics are important.  And no, right now we
don't have as many illegal, unsafe abortions because we have had
widespread access in North Carolina.  But if we start limiting it, we
may be looking at the same problems that they have had worldwide.  As I
was saying, an estimated 5 million women a year are hospitalized because
of treatment of abortion complications at a cost of at least $460
million, and that's in countries with much lower per spending, per
capita spending on health care.   I worry about what we're doing to
young women because these are options I don't think anyone chooses
lightly.  When Representative Presnell said she could not ever imagine
doing that, I would agree.  And yet, through my husbands medical
practice, I've seen a lot of people who thought they would never imagine
doing that, until their child was the one that was pregnant, and it was
different.  We don't know what we would do until we're in that
situation.  We think we do, and I think I know what I would do.  We had
an unplanned pregnancy in my extended family a year ago.  And it was my
nephew's girlfriend.  They had not been dating that long.  He was in
school, and my brother called to tell me about this, that I don't know
what we're going to do, I can't tell mom and dad, I can't believe this
happened, they said they were using birth control and it failed.  He
said, I never thought I would wish somebody would have an abortion, but
I kind of wish that's what she would choose right now, because I'm
afraid my son won't finish school, won't finish college if she has this
baby.  Now, she did choose to have the baby.  Her mother kicked her out,
her mother wanted her to have the abortion, but her mother kicked her
out, she moved in with my brother's family, and they're now the parents
of a beautiful, almost 1 year old daughter, she'll be 1 in August.  She
made the right choice for her, but she had the option of making a
choice, and she had the availability no matter what choice she did make.
 And that's why I pleading with people to vote against this.  This bill,
when you try to read it</p>

And this is not a criticism of the bill sponser, it's a messy looking
bill. All the pieces in it don't seem to flow and fit well. It was
obviously put together quickly. We shouldn't be doing this kind of thing
and haste, these are decisions that are too big to do in haste. So I ask
that we wait, that we vote no this time. That we come back, I agree,
that maybe perhaps regulations need to be looked at, on these
facilities. Though actually, when there was a question about where was
it that it says what kind of person administers different things. There
is a portion of the regulations, because they actually compared all the
regulations for the ambulatory care versus the abortion clinics, and
there is a page in there that says that abortion clinics must comply
with the rules governing sanitation of hospitals, nursing and rest
homes, sanitariums, sanitoriums, and eduational and other institutions
contained in 15a NCAC 18a .1300, and if you look those up,  they're
pretty detailed. And they were actually a large portion of them were
updated more recently than the ambulatory surgical care center
information, because some of them were updated as recently as 2003 and
2004. Actually, the ambulatory surgical care were only updated in 2003,
so that's been 10 years too. So they are operating under the same guide
that says hospitals and nursing homes. So there are actually good
regulations in there, you just have to take a step further, and look at
what it refers to, to see what they are. I spent a lot of time of this,
because I think it is so important. It's such a personal decision, and I
think we should leave that up to individuals. Taking care of facilities,
yes, but not in a way that limits and restricts them. That's the wrong
choice for North Carolina. I ask that you vote against this bill please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Guilford,
representative Adams rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak a second time,
speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies recognize to debate the bill, a second
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Like a thief in the
night to steal women's reproductive rights, this bill came hurriedly
through the Senate, rerouted through the House on a motorcycle, we
think. No input from stakeholders, no public scrutiny, no transparency,
no fiscal note. But when you look at the overall outcome of this bill,
it's safe to say that it's really not about safety, it's about limiting
women's choices, her freedoms, her access, and her privacy. Restricting
local governments from providing abortion care self services in the
plans that they offer to their employees, eliminating abortion care and
health exchanges or local state health plans. And it really discrminates
unfairly, forcing women to spend more on their medical care than men.
I'm not going to talk about the men in here, cause some body will stand
up and say I'm off the target. But it is targeting, this bill does
target, I think unfairly, centers that provide abortion care. It is a
very bold, in your face, disrespectful, vicious attack on women's
health, and it would as the outcome, if all of this is put in place, it
would restrict women's access to safe and legal reproductive health
care. It does deny her choice, it does deny her right to privacy. Now, I
believe that no woman can call herself free, who does not own and
control her own body. That's not my quote, I'm sure you know who made
it. But eliminating safe and legal abortions in this state, it's already
been said but we need to remember, that it will not reduce the need for
abortions. They're going to happen. So what would the next step be?
Well, we're gonna go back to the days that none of us should want to
relive again. When abortions we're not legal, when they were not safe,
but they were fatal. And we won't go back, representative McElraft, to
the dark houses. But we'll go to the dark alley ways.</p>

[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Adams, don't we still have hospitals? He keeps talking
about alleys. It really bothers me because I really. As a Christian, I
am very concerned about this in listening all day to this debate, but we
still have hospitals. And women can go to hospitals where they are clean
and where they are taken care of. If they have to go anywhere, they do
this. If they don't plan ahead, they can go to hospitals, can't they?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Is that a question?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The lady has the floor to respond to the question.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
I suppose they could go, and I am concerned and I am a Christian too.
Let me say that for the record. But let me go back and say again that we
are going to go back to those days and there will be people who can't
afford to go. We've got a lot of women right now who have no medical, no
health insurance. And some of these surgical centers that are in place
right now provide preventive care, other kinds of service, so there
won't be anywhere for them to go. But we know if you go back to those
days, it will be the dark alleys. And the surgical instruments that
they'll use won't be the surgical instruments that they might be using
in these centers, but they're going to be coat hangers. And what a
terrible day for North Carolina women. Shame on us. That's what's going
to happen: Coat hangers. Do we want that blood on our hands? I do not.

Thank you Representative Samuelson and Mister Speaker. After the public
hearing that was held and you all said in there that you were committed
to not closing facilities. But you also said that you were committed to
protecting the health of women going to these centers. Did you all, in
your overnight working to correct the other bill from the Senate, did
you give any consideration to just
bringing forward a bill that dealt just with these clinics across the
state that have had problems in updating those codes and standards?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Can I ask her to clarify her question a moment?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
If the lady yields, yes.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
I'm not sure I understand what the alternative you are asking? Should we
consider only addressing the needs in those clinics that have been shut
down?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Mister Speaker, may I? I'm sorry. The clarification is, did you give any
consideration to just addressing that issue that's in section four that
you've given to the Secretary that authority to study and move forward?
Was there any consideration given to just addressing that issue along
with the safety of the, the helmet safety I know you need in the bill
instead of adding all the other bills that we've already voted on in
this House?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
No. That did not come up when we met with the Secretary. We only dealt
with her questions and her questions and concerns were just in the new
portion that had been sent over by the Senate. So we addressed her
concerns and made sure that she was comfortable with this. And part of
that was making sure that the direction for them to make rules were
reasonable to ensure that we would not unnecessarily be shutting down
clinics. She was also concerned about not making the standards so tough
that they were not able to be complied with.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister Speaker. To speak on the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Ladies and gentlemen, I asked that because several people have said all
this bill does is address the health and safety of the women in this
state. When the bill that is before us, and I've read it and I've
underlined it and gone back over it and asked questions and taken notes.
There are five sections to this bill, or four rather. And that is, those

situation where they have address those concerns in a bipartisan way
with the act, entities like Planned Parenthood at the table if that is
truly the goal of what we're trying to accomplish in here today for the
women of this day and why are we not dealing with that one issue. while

not a priority to set it up and available standing on its own work with

headed down a road to make this worse. I agree, and I think every woman
in here, every woman in this balcony, every woman in this state says
&quot;Yes, if you're gonna have an abortion, make it safe, make it
accessible and make it clean.&quot; But that's not what we're doing
here. We’re passing it off. We're passing it off to the Secretary. We're

impose on the people of this state. I ask you please to reconsider and
vote No, and yet again today I'm asking you take your time, go back to

these centers that everybody's been saying -- all the citations and the
closings and the re-openings -- if that needs to be addressed, let's do

profession at the table. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Fulghum, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I really struggle with keeping my mouth shut because I
worked in the medical fields for over 35 years. There are 254 facilities
in this state that are currently licensed to do abortions. Sixteen
abortion clinics do the majority. Probably far more than the majority.
And all the ambulatory surgical centers are licensed to do abortions.
All the hospitals are licensed to do abortions, so let's just can this
back-alley nonsense. Now, the Secretary said that despite the Planned
Parenthood representative's comment in her interview with Skip Stanwell?
on the record, these abortions clinics are not inspected every year.
They're lucky to get inspected every 3-5 years for medical purposes. The
current regulations from 1994 are pretty good. They call for recovery
room, procedure room, corridors to accommodate stretchers, elevators to
accommodate patients, and medical procedures that are set up to take
care of medical records and staffing requirements and so on. Making
regulations is a waste of time unless you enforce them. They're not
being enforced on a regular basis, but we're doing better than
Pennsylvania did. Gov. Ridge decided, politically, to not enforce the
annual inspections in Pennsylvania during his administration, and look
what that got him. For 17 years, they didn't do annual inspections. They
had a horror show on their hands. I'm not claiming we have something
like that in North Carolina. We don’t need to. No other state should.
but we have the opportunity here, and the Secretary has agreed to
co-operate with how many staffing problems she has to be able to enforce
this, to get the job done to bring these 16 abortion [CUTS OFF]</p>

Division Head of Health Service Regulation were they in compliance with
the current regulations, he said, “We assume so.” I really didn’t want
to get out of my chair and go over and ask him again, but I felt like I

I think this Bill gets us to a place where we ought to be. I honestly

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McManus, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the Bill again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the Bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually I just wanted to share a bit of information since there was a
question about, “Could they not go to hospitals and have abortions?” So,
I’m going to share just a bit here.
In North Carolina…Well, in the South, let me back up a moment. First,
the percentage of ob-gyns performing abortions in the United States
dropped 14 percent by 2008, from 22 to 14 percent in 2008. Ob-gyns who
were least likely to provide abortion services included doctors located
in rural communities in the South and Southwest.
Southern doctors accounted for just eight percent of ob-gyns that
reported providing abortions. 70 percent of all abortions were provided
in abortion clinics. 24 percent in other types of clinics. Only four
percent in hospitals and one percent in private physician offices.
In 2008 there were 31 abortion providers who actually were providing in
North Carolina. Other places are licensed but don’t necessarily provide.
This represents a 16 percent decline from 2006 when there were 37.
So, it’s rare that it happens in a hospital unless it’s medically
necessitated. Only 17 percent of ob-gyns even nationwide report doing
abortions, and only eight percent in North Carolina. So it’s unlikely to
happen in a hospital. That’s what I wanted to share, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McElraft, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ve sat here and listened about safe, healthy access and that’s exactly
what this Bill is about, whether you believe it or not, on the other
side. Poor women should not have any less access to clean conditions, to
sanitary conditions than those who can afford to go to that one facility
in Asheville that you talk about that would meet these requirements.
Let me just give you some of the organisms that are life threatening
that can be transferred from unsterilized medical, surgical equipment.
Staphylococcus aureus which can be Methicillin-resistant. Streptococcus
pyogenes which is the flesh-eating bacteria. Chlamydia. Neisseria
gonorrhoeae. HIV, herpes simplex two…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady may state her point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I guess my question is, “Are these not things that could
happen anywhere, not just in clinics that provide abortion or abortion
services?”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher, the Chair is not a medical professional. I think
that the lady is trying to suggest that they do at least happen in these
conditions, that if the conditions are not sterile, that I assume from
her comments that they may be more likely. The lady may proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’ll answer that question. Yes, these can be
organisms that are transported in other clinics too. But other clinics
of the ambulatory status and licensing are different than what these
certified North Carolina abortion clinics are. They have higher
standards. They’re inspected by not only our Public Health department
but they’re inspected by CAP and Joint Chiefs and some of the other…</p>

Representative Cunningham, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak finally on the bill just to clarify.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Something that Representative McElraft said
about poor women, it's not only poor women that seek out abortion in the
state of North Carolina. Women of all financial status seek out
abortion. It's just that they may not have to go to an abortion clinic.
Sometimes they can get their obstetricians or gynecologists to admit
them and they have the procedure in a well, well nice equipped facility.
And all narcicoma infections, those are infections that you get inside
of facilities. Not only can you get it in an abortion facility, you can
get it in a hospital. You can get it in a nursing home. You can get a
narcicoma internal infection anywhere in a medical facility. Clarity,
nursing homes, hospitals, all types of facilities at some point in their
history come up with a violation of something that is required by
regulatory. So this is not unusual that you would find a couple of
facilities that are not within compliance. It is not unusual. Lots of
hospitals are out of compliance right here today. Lots of nursing home
facilities are out of compliance here today. How do I know? Because I've
been in them. They've often given the opportunity to correct those
issues. Once they are corrected then they are back in compliance and
they operate as usual until the next inspection comes along. If
regulatory is done where the inspections can be done properly and on
time, effectively, and with a normalcy of when they should occur within
a period of time these issues can be corrected without going any further
stipulating that a facility increase what is in their facility which is
not going to help with the safety of the client when the help is not in
the building but is in the hands of the people that care for them. Thank
you.

be glad for the lady to do so. Exactly which one of the standards in the
[xx] service centers will make abortions safer in NC at the clinics?
Representative: I will tell you the defect in the clinic certification
is that you do not have to even be an OBGYN to do abortions at an
abortion clinic: you can be a foot doctor, a brain surgeon, a doctor of
osteopathy. The clinics only say that you have to bring an OBGYN if
there is a complication.
Representative: Comment?
Speaker: The lady is recognized to debate the bill a second time.
Representative: I really believe that this debate today indicates the
importance of this issue and the fact that women are articulate; they
are bright; they have a mind of their own; and they are good decision
makers. This body is representative of that. It is also representative
of the fact that there are a lot of competent people in the state of NC,
and there are a lot of competent legislators in this body, and we should
all be able to sit down, address this issue, and come up with a
solution. But we are not transparent and we hide things in spite of the
fact that we are in a majority situation when you have 78 members in
this body, so you know you have the votes, and for the life of me, I do
not understand why this could not have been more open and transparent
than it was. Therefore, it leads to situations like this: distrust.
Thank you.
Speaker: Further discussion, further debate? Representative Samuelson,
please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate a second time.
Speaker: The lady is recognized to debate a second time.
Representative: Members we have had a lengthy debate on a bill that,
otherwise, would have only been here on concurrence. There have been a
number of things that have been said about the bill: some of them
correct, some of them incorrect. I am not going to correct all of them.
I just want to address two because I thought stood out and needed to be
addressed. Representative Hamilton brought up some concerns about a part
of the bill we have not debated much. I just wanted to alleviate your
concerns on the privacy piece. Those are contained only in the sex
selection abortion piece and only come into play if there is a legal
lawsuit against the doctor who is accused for performing an abortion for
sex selection. It is a very narrow application in those very specific
instances, but that brings up a question that Representative Carney and
others brought up which is why this bill has all these parts in it? Well
because that is the way the senate sent it to us. So, the senate said
that we want to put all those bills we sent over to them in one piece,
and that is the way they did it. So that is why they are put together.
The question of why we did not earlier address the question of standards
and say, well gee, if the standards needed to be updated, why didn’t we
start this process six months ago, and do all that before we came up?
Well frankly that was before the incident in Philadelphia, where a
doctor up there is now going to jail for the horrendous conditions in
his abortion clinic, which caused some people to say, well gee, are
these kinds of things starting to happen in NC? As they looked around
they say, gee, we have got some problems with some of the situations in
NC. In fact, we have recently had two abortion centers closed. So, yes,
it would have been nice if that was done earlier. It could have been
done in previous administrations</p>

<p id="170:00">
And a horrid incident in another State caused us to look again in what’s
happening in our State. In fact Representative Blust was kind enough to
send an article about some abortion deaths in Maryland, which makes me
go to the point that has caused me the most ?? in all of this is the
issue of this being cost prohibitive. You don’t increase safety because
it’s cost prohibitive. You don’t raise standards because it’s cost
prohibitive. People are dying in abortion clinics. Maybe they didn’t die
in the abortion clinic in North Carolina but do we want even one person
to die in an abortion clinic in North Carolina before we raise the
standards? And in terms of whether raising the standards is legally
verifiable if passed in South Carolina in the courts? Alright, so there
is precedence in this. There is a reason to say, we are not going to
wait until women die in an abortion clinic for us to raise the
standards. We have consulted with the DHA State Secretary, who by the
way is a strong woman if you haven’t met her. She is one of the few that
can intimidate me. And she is a strong woman and she has acknowledged
that our standards need to be reviewed. She has also acknowledged that
we need to increase the amount of inspections. And our Speaker said to
me the other day and may have said it in committee, I can’t remember,
but that if we need to do some audits, let’s go to the DHA Secretary and
ask her, “How much would it cost for you to audit?” Every abortion
clinic or every abortion facility we could ask her and figure out what
she’d want between now and when we come back and if we can afford it
lets look at how much that would cost and find a way to put it in our
budget now. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. It should have
been addressed years ago. As someone said to me earlier, we need our
standards to be in the twenty first century. We’ve been in the twenty
first century for thirteen years and we haven’t increased our standards
since way before that! This is not about shutting down sinners. This is
not about making abort illegal. Women will still have the right to
choose but as a result of this Bill, they will have the right to make
that choice in a safe facility. I urge your support.

The gallery will be cleared to the right. Up to this point, I shared my
sentiment with Representative Wilkins. I’m not really sure why someone
thinks that that’s really respectful of this body, but it is what it is.
Ladies and gentlemen, we still have another bill on the calendar. It’s
Senate Bill 112. I’m going to provide everyone with about a ten minute
recess. We will return at 4:30 and, for your planning purposes, the
Chair understands that there will be an objection to third reading on
this bill; therefore, it is the intention of the Chair to have session
tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. Members who were thinking about calling committee
meetings this evening may want to consider, instead, having the
committee meetings in the morning. We will return at 4:30. If the
members will yield for just a moment. Representative Moore, please state
your purpose.
