Committee will come to order. Thank you. We'll begin this committee this
morning by introducing our pages. Tharon Scrubs, hiding behind the post
over there. Adam ??, Mackenzie Launder, hi, Reeves Houston, Tammy
Holland, Evan Harris, and Mark Makin II. We have all our pages here
today, Sergeant at Arms Charles Harper, Justin Owens, Anderson Meadows,
Donna Blake, and Steve McKay. Thank you, all. Committee for today we
have one bill in front of us, it'll be House Bill 392, moving forward we
do have a PCS for this bill. Senator Allran moves for consideration of
the PCS. All those in favor say aye, opposed. Thank you. The PCS is
before us, representatives, whatever order you'd like to go with.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the opportunity to come
before you and present this bill. I wanted to tell you what this bill is
trying to do. First of all, it has two purposes, the part I'm going to
discuss then, my colleague is going to discuss another part. Right now,
this bill is an attempt to prevent fugitives, felons, and probation,
parole violators from receiving financial assistance according to
federal law. This bill is to ensure that financial aid goes first to law
abiding people. It also makes a public policy statement that says that
all agencies should work together with law enforcement to keep us safe.
I want to tell you the background about this and how this bill came
about. Back in 2011, in Senator Tucker's county and mine, we had a
situation where a case workers job was reported jeopardized and put on
an action plan by the state, after the caseworker notified a deputy in
the agency that a person seeking public assistance had an outstanding
arrest warrant. The deputy promptly arrested the convicted felon. A few
weeks earlier a similar situation had occurred, and also resulted in the
person being arrested for an outstanding arrest warrant. The state JFS
contacted our county officials and said, if an outstanding arrest
warrant is noted, a local caseworker cannot act on that information. The
state JFS went on to say, that the county agency should not have
accessed that information and shared it with law enforcement and that
local JFS is not duty bound to report information to law enforcement.
You can imagine that the caseworkers job was in jeopardy for doing the
right thing. Out of that, this person who came in to our county to
receive aid was an out of state felon, who had came to North Carolina
and had been arrested again. His original felony conviction was for
pistol whipping a robbery victim, I believe, was arrested in North
Carolina on drug charges and had an outstanding arrest warrant for a
parole and probation violator. This person came to our county seeking
aid. What this bill does is require that JFS check the criminal
statutes, criminal database to make sure that the people who applied do
not have an outstanding arrest warrant or are on probation or parole
violators. The second thing that this does is create a database
exchange, that when law enforcement asks information, and the asker has
to be law enforcement, they can create a database exchange where law
enforcement will query and ask JFS, if you have these people who have
these outstanding arrest warrants in the system, JFS would be able to
create this database exchange to assist law enforcement in keeping the
public safe. With that, that's the first part of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Good morning, members of the committee. I actually have nothing to do
with the preparation of this bill or the amendment I'm getting ready to
tell you. Section five and section six are</p>

A part of Senator Davis's bill that you saw before Senator Davis wanted
to have a drug test for everyone before they received benefits the
problem is as we reviewed that in our judiciary committee that's
unconstitutional we needed to have some kind of reasonable suspicion in
order to ask people to submit to a drug test so we're connecting it
along with this criminal if there's a criminal record for drugs within
three years if there's a reasonable suspicion that they are doing them
now that can also be an arrest warrant that's outstanding or the other
factors that the Department of Social Services takes into account
already so it somewhat narrows Senator Davis's bill but tries to help
make it constitutional and by putting it along  with this it helps you
to understand that the reasonable suspicion can be having looked at all
this past history.  Section six is simply a severability clause that
says if one of these sections is determined to be unconditional then the
other one can still stand. So that's the primary purpose of the
amendment is to put it together in a more logical fashion[SPEAKER
CHANGES]and with that Senator Tucker and I will greatly appreciate your
support on[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Bingham[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr.
Chairman appreciate the work done on this glad to know this is
constitutional move to favor[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you we will hold that
motion Senator Curtis, Senator Curtis okay Senator  McKissick[SPEAKER
CHANGES]just a couple of questions and perhaps staff can help me with
this what did Susan work on this?[SPEAKER CHANGES]??[SPEAKER CHANGES]Oh
okay let me ask you this the way that this drafted right now it looks as
if a person has a misdemeanor a warrant for their arrest that could
happen if somebody got a seatbelt violation and didn't go to court issue
an order for their arrest or somebody even could go to court on a
traffic-type citation and failed to pay the fine and court cost on time
an arrest warrant could go out even if they're put on probation some
minor, insignificant matter you know you could be shoplifting for that
matter and they failed to pay something in that could violate a term of
condition of probation so I'm wondering I can understand why you want
this in felony cases I think in felonies it's a very clear cogent
argument but dropping this thing all the way down to misdemeanors if
somebody who could help me with how we could do this in a way where
we're all these people that might of gotten involved in things that were
relatively innocent but they happen everyday don't get caught in the
net[SPEAKER CHANGES]Certainly thank you Senator McKissick this bill
states in what terms current federal law already provides for that is
has to be a fleeing felon so it has to be a felony charge and then the
arrest warrant is for probation or parole violation a part of it and so
working with this I worked with Ms Paul and so it's limited to those
people which are currently in federal law that are prohibited from
getting those benefits and so we're are mirroring that[SPEAKER
CHANGES]follow-up maybe Ms. Paul can help me with that[SPEAKER
CHANGES]follow-up[SPEAKER CHANGES]what I see here specifically spell out
misdemeanors and so it will seem they may get caught in the net[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Senator McKissick and Chair if I may ?? on that question Senator
McKissick under federal law which is under 42USC it specifies
specifically that the ?? statute specifies certain conditions under
which the state has discretion  to take certain action but also
circumstances in which the state does not have discretion to take
certain actions and a state is barred under federal law for using
federal ?? funds to provide assistance any individual who is either a
fleeing felon so fleeing to avoid prosecution, custody, or confinement
after conviction for a felony or and the next provision under federal
law under 42USC indicates violating a condition of probation or parole
imposed under federal or state law it does not limited it to felonies
under that provision of federal law[SPEAKER CHANGES]follow-up ??[SPEAKER
CHANGES]So what you are saying federal law already mandates that you
capture these misdemeanors that I'm describing</p>

In that case, it sounds like the directive was issued at the county
level was inconsistent with federal law that existed at the time.  Would
that be a correct assumption?  Because I thought we were fixing that was
occurring at a county level that was not a matter of law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can speak to the situation in our situation.  Current practices is
simply asked the people, applicants, are you a convicted felon or
parole/probation violator?  That's a check-off box.  And that's the
extent of the review.  This astute... we hire very capable and qualified
and wonderful people in our county in DSS.  This person was very astute
and knew this individual and the situation and alerted the authorities.
The question became this transfer of information.  The way we understand
the rules of the federal construction is the person asking has to be law
enforcement, has to be the actor, the initiator of the action.  And
that's why the database transferred is what is doing...what is being
done in seven other states to meet with the federal rules.  And it's, in
my opinion, a crazy situation, but I'm sure there's some reason for it.
But it's ...anyway the database...the way the database is set up in this
law allows the federal provisions to be held and it's modeled after
about seven other states.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excellent.  Quick follow-up, Mr. Chair, if I could.  From the staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Final follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are we going, Ms. Poll, beyond federal law in what we are doing.  I
understand that we're sharing information.  I think that's a good idea.
It shouldn't be limited just law enforcement being able to ask those
questions.  We've got somebody in social service office, they ought to
be able to ask it and not be penalized.  But are we going beyond federal
law in what we are requiring.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Senator McKissick, with regard to release of information to
law enforcement agencies, this bill before you gives DSS, I keep trying
to say DHHS, gives DSS the right and the responsibility to check to make
sure that the information that the individual is providing the agency
with respect to the check off box is correct and can be verified.  With
regard to federal law, I essentially read the provisions are of federal
law that apply to these types of situations and on whom the criminal
record checks have to be made.  And the ?? statute itself, under federal
law, specifies certain conditions under which the state has to exchange
information with law enforcement agencies, but a state has the right and
the option to exchange information in additional cases as long as there
are protections against the disclosure of confidential information that
is provided in the ?? statute and that the disclosure of confidential
information is limited as the federal statute requires.  So all that the
federal law says is that a state has to... the state's ?? plan is to
outline how the state would...and the statute provides specifically
would take such reasonable steps as the state deems necessary to
restrict the use and disclosure of information of that individuals and
families receiving assistance of the program attributable to funds
provided by the federal government.  So as long as the state establishes
safeguards against the use and disclosure of information, then federal
law would permit it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  And the crimes that are committed are no
greater than what federal law requires us to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Mr. Chair.  A couple questions.  In the sharing of arrest
warrant status and probation and parole violator information, that's
just sharing of information and there's no cost to the applicant.  Is
that correct?  On the drug-screening and testing where there's a cost,
that cost is reimbursed if you don't....  And does the person have to
come up with ... Excuse me, Mr. Chair.  Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the person have to come up with the cost before they even get the
benefit?  Or is it billed to them after...?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Using the cheapest test available, it's ten dollars.  And we do say, if
the applicant...[AUDIO ENDS]</p>

Who do not need it and are violating it because they're not law abiding.
 And that's a way without increasing our funding and all these tight
budgets to do that.  And so that's.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird.
 [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, I just want to thank Senator Stevens.
This section three on page five is right on.  And that takes care of the
problem, thank you so much.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  ?? I wanted to ask one
question before we go through other co-sponsors, if I could.  Are you
aware that this has any impact on the kind of programs who are already
doing drug testing out front for individuals who are applying for jobs
that require job testing up front?  There's a lot in the work force
first program right now that if you're applying for a truck driver job,
for example, or others that they have you do the drug test before they
waste their time on others before they send you out to a job that's
going to require it to begin with.  Does this still allow them to
continue to do that within the program?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, this
should have no effect on that.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] The thing is, the
people who are going to be drug tested under this, there's already going
to be a reasonable suspicion that they're doing drugs.  There's already
going to be a record or there's going to be some things that these
people who want to screen them for a job are going to be aware of, too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bingham.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman, I was just going to inquire how you all can reduce this drug
test cost.  I'm, for my information and I appreciate the work you did on
that.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] What we did was a full panel drug test, whether
you draw blood or urine can be a much more rigorous screen.  What this
is is just the cheap squab and it won't do as in depth a test but will
give us a nice preliminary evaluation as to recent drug use.  Sort of an
ongoing type problem.  It's not as in depth or detailed as some of the
screens we were looking at before.  So, that's the reality.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]OK, Mr. Chairman it's ??  And so cheek squab or whatever you
indicated is only $10.  I think I heard that said.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]That's correct.  We were talking with social services and we
were talking about various drug tests that they can do and the rates
that they are.  But yes there's a buckle squab that will test for
several drugs.  I believe it includes alcohol as well, and it's only
$10.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]And on the background check.  Senator Bingham on
the background check in terms of that cost, what this bill does is
provide for a state-wide access to the law enforcement database by that.
 So, we worked through that on the House side.  And I got a letter here
by Glenn Osbourne, who's the director of Wilson County, as well as Nancy
Coston, who's the director of Orange County, that says they are in
agreement with this and we were able to work to get that database access
at no cost, because we're using state resources.  And it says, 'You've
addressed our concerns.  We thank you for that.  We have no further
concerns.' I'm in a meeting with DSS directors across the state and
we're in agreement on my feedback to you as well.  And then Nancy Coston
is director of Orange County says, asks that I convey this agreement as
well.  So. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Any other questions?  ?? Senator Bingham has
moved for a favorable report to the bill, unfavorable to the PCS,
unfavorable to the original bill.  All those in favor please signify by
saying aye.  Opposed.  Thank you members of the committee.  We stand
adjourned.</p>
