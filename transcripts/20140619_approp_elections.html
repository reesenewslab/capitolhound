<p id="00:00">
I'm going to recognize co-chairman Lewis to present the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Chairman, isn't that 1267? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that not what I
said? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You said 1276. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Dyslexia is a
tough disease.... Representative Lewis, gentleman has the floor to
debate 1267 or 1276, whichever it is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman and members of the committee. I do stand before you to present
1267 this morning. House Bill 1267 is a very straightforward attempt to
clarify the state statue and make absolutely clear that if an individual
is able and qualified and registered and goes through the process of
exercising their right to vote that that vote would in fact count even
if the person became deceased between the time they cast the vote and
the time that the canvas was held. Representative Gilmore may wish to
speak to this and I will certainly yield to him in just a moment. I will
tell you this became known to me back in May of this year and when the
vote of Mr. Everett Harris was challenged the reason given by those that
challenged the vote was that they themselves had had a family member who
had also cast a valid vote and then had that valid vote challenged prior
to the election cycle. We have through staff and otherwise spoken to
both the families that were involved here and they both approve this
bill. With that Mr. Chairman will you accept Representative ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Absolutely. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Lewis.
Very well said. What you stated about the bill resolves an issue. This
happened in my district several years ago to a family. The ballot was
challenged and it made no difference in the election whatsoever the
challenging of the ballot. It was just challenged because the gentlemen
passed away. Pretty much this bill takes a philosophy that once a person
marks their ballot and turns the ballot in, seals that absentee envelope
or sticks it in the machine that they've officially cast their ballot at
that point so I think it's a good clarification and a good way to let
the voters voices be heard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions from members
of the committee for the bill sponsor? Seeing no questions is there a
motion? Alright, I saw several hands on a motion. I actually saw Dr.
Fulghum's hand first though. Representative Fulghum.  Gentlemen moves
adoption of the House Bill 1267 further discussion or debate? Seeing no
hands means favor of the motion for a favorable report to House Bill
1267 please say Aye. Aye. As opposed no. The aye's have it the bill is
given a favorable report. The next bill on our calendar is Senate Bill
403 I believe there is a proposed committee substitute without
objection. The PCS is before the committee  for discussion.
Representative Lewis is recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I do stand
before you to present the proposed committee substitute of the Senate
bill 403. At the committee's pleasure I will go through the bill and
then I'll be glad to answer any inquiries that may or exist or certainly
they can be relayed to the staff. Section 1 of the bill is simply a
language clean up. Trying to specify that some one has to be affiliated
with a political party for 90 days prior to filing for office. This is
not a change in actual policy is is simply clarifying language. Section
2 specifies that the order that candidates appear on the ballot will be
performed consistently...[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis, hold on
just a minute. There should be copies of the PCS. Are there members who
do not have copies of the PCS in your folder? Ok, we'll stand down just
a moment. It's Senate Bill 403 you should have a PCS version 7 where it
says corrected copy 51313.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And staff reminded me also, this is the same PCS that was emailed to you
last night, if you read your email last night, so you have it, but there
is a fresh hard copy being handed to you right now.
Do all members have a copy?
Alright, Representative Lewis, you're recognized to continute explaining
the bill, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
In the interest of clarity, with the permission of the chair and the
[??] of the committee, I'll just start again.
Section one of the bill is not a change in policy, it's a clarification
in language specifying that someone must be affiliated with a political
party for at least 90 days prior to filing for office to recieve that
party's political nomination. Section two specifies that the ballot
order for candidates on primary and nonpartisan official ballots will be
done under the random selection mode that has been used for years by the
state board of election. Again, not a policy change, a clarification.
Section three of the bill establishes the -- pardon me, Mr. Chairman --
section three of the bill clarifies that when you are reviewing the
cumulative total number of scheduled voting hours-- which is, members,
I'm on page 2, line 15 -- that you can indeed count the hours that the
board of elections or the central polling place itself is open. It's my
understanding that that is the way it was interpreted and implemented
but we wanted to make sure that that was clear. Section four of the bill
is merely a clarifying change, this was a policy decision and debate
that was held in the last session, this will clarify the statutes.
Again, this bill only deals with the technical change required in that
matter. Section five is a statutory reference change. Section six
corrects a error in the statutory language and inserts -- a little
&quot;i&quot; there beside that you can all see. Section seven of the
bill, the substantive part of this is found down beginning on line 26.
You know we wanted to include the tribal enrollment card issued by
federally recognized tribes as one of the acceptable forms of
identification in the voter ID. We wanted to make clear some of the
tribal expiration cards do not have expiration dates on them, but they
do have issuant dates. And so this is permissive language, it expands
the kinds of IDs that can be accepted by saying that if the card was
issued fewer than eight years ago, that the card would still be valid.
Section eight of the bill-

Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, is it a follow-up on that? Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Last year seems like a long time to me right now and I'm not sure that I
was present or available for the discussion with regard to that but can
we possibly, can you share now what the thinking was?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Representative Mobley, this, the Chair is going to, this is a
technical bill. I would say that that debate is not germane to this
particular bill. That's a policy decision that's been made. This is just
a technical bill to conform that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux is recognized for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I'm in the same section. You crossed out preregistration. This
means that we cannot preregister 17-year-olds? Is that what you're
telling me in that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, it's my understanding that preregistration for
17-year-olds who will be 18 in time to participate in the next election
is still allowed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just conferred with staff. When a 17-year-old registers, who is going
to be 18 by the election, that's not a preregistration. That is just a
registration. The preregistration had to do with those 16-year-old's.
You're welcome to have staff answer that. That's-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When you register you can vote. When you preregister you preregister so
that you can be ready to vote at a particular time. It sounds like to me
like you're cutting out, what you're saying is, whoever interprets it is
going to have a problem with that, in my book, because it sounds like to
me you're not allowing them to preregister.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm going to let Ms. McGraw address that. That's clearly not the way the
bill is but I'll let staff testify to that. Ms. McGraw.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, in last year there had been a program in the
statutes and it was called the Voter Preregistration Program. That was
the term that was used and that specifically allowed 16 and
17-year-old's who would not have been eligible, as of the next election,
to register, well to preregister, and then they were put on a list and
the State Board would contact them before the election they would be
eligible to vote in to activate that into a full voter registration.
When that program was repealed we removed references to the term
preregistration that refer to that program but we missed this one in
another section in the statute. So this is a conforming change to take
out that phrase.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright. Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A question for staff, maybe, or the bill
sponsor, do we have any idea how long in section, I think it is section
8, when will those funds be exhausted? Any idea?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I need to refer to staff or perhaps to the State Board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think Eric's going to address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually we were going to say we have no idea how many, what the dollar
amount left in that fund is. The State Board might know or we're happy
to follow-up with Fiscal Research and get that for you today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright. Representative Lewis, you're recognized to continue explaining
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members, I believe that I had reached page 4,
section 12. If that's not correct I'll be happy to back up further. This
is language that clarifies that, pardon me I lost my own notes, this
just says that a voter who is moved precincts within a county within a
30 day time period will be allowed to vote and their vote, of course,
will count. This is in compliance with federal law. Moving on to section
13, this is a very interesting provision to me. When all of us file for
office, all of the members in this room and those who seek to file for
office, we're required to complete a Statement of Economic Interest and
I'm sure you can all recall completing those in writing and submitting
them to the Board of Elections. It was brought out to us that all the
Board of</p>

elections does with those is for them through the state ethics code
mission where they are housed and actually, sometimes, entered into,
they will actually be entered electronically from the hard, from the
paper version. What this does is two things, one it would allow an
individual to set up their own electronic account with the State Ethics
Board, like all of us in this room have and enter the information online
if they chose to do so. However, if they chose to continue to use the
paper copy it would direct that that would go to the State Ethics Board
instead of the State Board of the Elections. We did put a crosscheck in
there that the State Board of the Ele-, the Executive Director's State
Board of Elections would in fact notify the State Ethics Board of
everyone who had filed so that they would have a cross reference to make
sure that they received either an electronic filing or the paper filing
within the ten day time period, as is required. It just really was a
redundant amount of work to have it submitted to the County Board, which
did nothing with it but submit it to the State Board, which really did
nothing with it but walk it over to the Ethics Board. So we tried to
clean that up. It's a very wordy session but it's, that's all it does.
Section 14-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm trying to be clear on that, if I can. David, if you don't mind,
right now when we go file, for instance, for this office we file at our
County Board and we file our statement of economic interest with our
County Board. Now, what does this change in that? That's what I'm trying
to get at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, you would still have the option to do that or,
because you also file every April 15th with the State Ethics Board, you
could simply log into your account and update it directly with them and
not have to complete the forms. You could still choose to complete the
forms but you would not be required to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis, I'm going to ask for staff, if they would, to
clarify your answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That might be helpful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, the changes, right now, all legislators, all
judicial officials, and all members of the Council of State file an
annual statement of economic interest. In the odd numbered years that is
filed with the State Ethics Commission directly. In the even numbered
years or in their filing year if they serve a four or eight year term
they file that statement of economic interest with the Board of
Elections that they file their notice of candidacy will with. This is
altering that one filing that comes with the notice of candidacy to say
that it's filed with the State Ethics Commission, just like all of the
others. It does not change the way in which you file it, whether you
file electronically or on paper. It just changes the entity that
receives that filing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, when I filed, if I file in the next election I could file directly
with the State Board rather than with the county? Is that what I'm
hearing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You will file it directly with the State Ethics Commission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right, I mean, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis, would you like to continue to explain your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to make, if I may, Mr. Chairman, just to make sure, for those who
may have just heard an exchange with Representative Michaux, you still
file for office the same way. This just deals with the statement of
economic interest. Yes sir. Yes sir. Ladies and Gentlemen, section 14
has to do with the issuance of photo ID cards for the purpose of voting.
Under current state law there's a crosscheck that an individual is
registered with the U.S. Selective Service, the draft, whatever that's
called, I'm sorry if I misspoke on that. This would remove that
crosscheck for the purpose of getting this</p>

this card. Section 15 is merely a statutory citation correction. Section
16 provides that there will be cooperation on list maintenance efforts
between the State Board and the County Boards. Section 17-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question on section 16. If you look at the statute it says,
&quot;that the State Board of Elections shall adopt a uniform program
that makes a diligent effort not less than twice a year to purge those
records.&quot; And so is this redundant? Is this reinventing the wheel
to have the, you have the County Boards doing this and now you're going
to have the State Boards doing it and they're all going to be doing it
no less than twice a year. So how many times do we need to do this and a
follow-up to that is now much will it cost?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I direct that to staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Churchill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, Representative Fisher, the State Board is charged with developing a
uniform state-wide program. However, that program is implemented by the
counties themselves. So if you keep reading in the statute, for the
reasons that someone could be removed from the roles: death, conviction
of a felony, or a change of address, all of those actions are actually
taken by the County Board with instruction and information from the
State Board under that uniform program. The change would simply allow
the State Board, if they have all of the correct information under the
statute, they could go ahead and act instead of the county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Section 17 of the bill establishes that the
process for second primaries and provides that voters may be registered
between the first and second primary except for persons who's
qualifications mature between the two primaries, in which case they
would need to wait until after the second primary. What does that mean?
If you were not old enough to vote in the May Primary then you could not
register to vote prior to the July Second Primary. If you were then you
may register to vote even if you did not take part in the May Primary.
And section 18-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I got a question on this one now. Tell me what happens to the 17
year old who becomes 18 between the first primary and the second
primary?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, if he was, if the 17 year old was not eligible
to vote in May then he would not be eligible to vote in July.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But he's registered, isn't he?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go through the Chair, please. Representative Lewis, would you like to
respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The 17 year old would have been qualified to have been registered only
if he'd have been qualified to have voted in the May Primary. If he was
not old enough to vote in the May Primary then he would not have been
registered to vote in the May Primary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I think, I think staff would like to clarify your answer as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. McCraw.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, the situation you refers to is actually under
current law. If you look on page 7 of the bill, lines 43-46, current law
states that a person who's qualifications to register and vote mature
after the date of the first primary, which could include a person who
turned 18 between the first and second primary and before the date of
the second primary, may register on the date of the second primary when
thus registered shall be entitled to vote in the second primary. There
are a few other categories of individuals who's qualifications mature.
That could include someone who's had rights restored after a felony or
had attained citizenship status before the next primary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, you have a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. So that person can vote in that second primary?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. That's what the current</p>

<p id="30:00">
Law says. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's what I thought but it doesn't sound
like it in the explanation. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Lewis, would you like to proceed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Only with first an
apology for the flawed explanation. Section 18 if you will notice down
on page 8 line 30 and 31, this is a statutory exchange and that
concludes my presentation of the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative Lewis. At this point I'm going to add a comment from the
chair. If we could look at Section 1, I was in the cue for the question
when you completed your remarks, so now that I've assumed the chair, I'd
just like to make those remarks from the chair. I understand that we are
looking at eligibility to file for a candidate that must be affiliated
with the party for at least 90 days prior to filing such notice of
candidacy here, and I understand that what you're doing is it's a
clarification of existing law, but also it says that this is an act to
amend and clarify. But, just a personal comment, but I think that 90
days is not long enough. Now I don't know if anybody else here feels the
same way, if this is an opportunity to amend that, but I can briefly
explain but it's something I've thought about before. I think 180 days
probably be better and a year might be even better. But I will say this,
I think that political parties have an important role. I think one of
the roles of a political party is to allow relatively like minded people
to gather around a platform that they believe in and to be able to run
as a candidate representing that political party, and for that reason I
have a problem with the concept that someone can change simply 90 days
before, and I think it happens, and I think it often happens for
purposes of convenience. We all know that there are districts or
counties in the state where you can say well, you know, I really am
this, but if I'm going to be elected, I'm going to have to be a
republican or I'm going to have to be a democrat and so I would just
open that for any discussion that anyone would like to make, but I would
say it would be my preference that we would increase that time and so I
would. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me take you
in the order that I saw your hands. I'm going to start with
Representative Conrad and Representative Stam, I'll come back to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to state for the record that I agree
with the chair. That 90 days really popped out to me because we all have
to swear to it when we file for office, and I would like to see that
changed, I think at least to 6 months, 12 months is even better. So I
would support the Chair's recommendation on that or opinion. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I will recognize Representative Stam and I would
like to see the hands again so I can have the opportunity. I'll give you
the opportunity to respond, Representative Lewis. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As the bill sponsor, my request would be, again
it was the attempt simply to clarify the 8 or 9 lines it took to say the
same things that we're saying in a line and a half. If the members wish
to explore the substantive policy change of extending the time period, I
would submit that the long session would probably be a better time to do
that, mainly, largely because filing has already concluded for this
cycle so any change that we make would not impact until the 2016 filing
time, so I greatly respect for the chair, but at the bill sponsor I
would prefer that this provision which is currently purely technical
remain as such. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Lewis. I
will certainly take your comments under advisement. I would like to have
some discussion, at least for discussion purposes only, not necessarily
plan to send forth an amendment, but I would like to see what some of
the members think about this. At this point I've got Representatives
Stam, Harrison, Michaux, Iler and Cunningham and Speciale, and
Representative Stam, you're recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. If
we were going to amend it, which I don't think we should on this bill, I
would want to amend it to make it shorter, and let me tell you why. It
depends on where you live, but I have often been engaged in candidate
recruitment across the</p>

… state, trying to make things more competitive and trying to get people
to run against in hopeless counties and things like that, and people
will say “Oh, you need to talk to so-and-so. That person’s a really
great conservative,” on our side. You’d have somebody say “That person’s
a great liberal.” And I’ll check it out and they’re the wrong party, but
there’s nobody who will run, and you get up to the deadline and why not?
In other words, if they’re willing to embrace the… put that label on
themselves, let them run. Let 100 flowers bloom. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Who
did you quote on that? That can’t… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mao. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I was going to say, that was Mao. That might be the first time
Mao has ever been quoted in a committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman,
point of order. It may be the first time he was quoted by Representative
Stam, but I would - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Maybe. I might just rule the
gentleman out of order for such a thing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll leave the committee room for five minutes and
your… Yes, Representative Stam is recognized for a mea culpa. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Actually that’s the second time I’ve quoted Mao on the subject.
On the charter school lift the cap bill, “let a hundred flowers bloom”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair stands corrected. Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am in complete agreement with
Representative Stam. I’ve been similarly engaged in candidate
recruitment, and often what I find out is we have unaffiliated
candidates who find out when they get ready to register to file for
candidacy, they can’t file to run as affiliated with the Democratic
Party, and we know how impossible it is to run as an unaffiliated the
way our statutes are right now, so I think if folks really can’t decide
within… I think I agree with Representative Stam; we ought to shorten
the period and not lengthen it because I think it will just discourage
candidates who might be capable and willing to run for office, and we
ought to be headed in that direction. Thanks. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I find myself in a very
odd position again. I agree with Representative Stam, and Skip, I don’t
know why this is happening on this session, but I agree, this period
should be - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh my God. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I’m not
doing mea culpa on it either. The period should be shortened because
there are folks out there… and I think you have a problem, somebody’s
going to take you to court on this anyway because there’s a thing called
free expression in this country and I think that’s a constitutional
guarantee, and if I want to change tomorrow my affiliation, I would hope
that ya’ll would take me in tomorrow. I’m not going to do it but – no
way – but it ought… in my book, it shouldn’t be shortened; it should be
taken out completely. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Iler. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’m going to disagree with everybody
because I had a candidate move from California slightly over a year
before the election, and this would be about the same thing. We filed in
February, and this is based on the filing date. So if file in February,
you’ve got to register sometime in November apparently, change your
registration, and geographically, if you move into the jurisdiction, you
also have to be there a year to run against one of us and two years to
run against the Senate, so you can debate which is right, but this is
about a year before that election and it’s 90 days before filing. I
think it’s just about right, so that’s my two cents. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there…? I think staff’s… Is there a consti…? I heard you say
something about a constitutional provision. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry.
Yes, sir. We’re having a sidebar conversation back here. For House and
Senate members, there is a constitutional provision that you have to
have resided in your district for one year prior to filing to run for
House or Senate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cunningham. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Iler, you’re
recognized for a follow-up, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t have my
constitution in front of me, but when that person filed against me, I
looked it up and it says one year before the election. Is that not
correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s what she said, one year before -
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But she said before filing. It’s before the election I
believe, right? [SPEAKER CHANGES] One year before the… [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which would be in November. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’re not dealing with
that in this bill I don’t believe, so… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, can I raise a different section?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well let me do this. I’ve got Cunningham, Speciale,
and then I’ll come back to the Stam and Michaux show in just a minute.
Representative Cunningham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. My
observation of this is that I do agree with Representative Stam, is that
younger generations want to also follow in our footsteps, and sometimes
they don’t have their minds made up at filing time, and it’s already
hard for the next generation…</p>

…because of other restrictions with having to finance their homes and
come up here. So I wouldn’t like to see any more restrictions and
opportunity for the next generation to come along and be able to step in
just because they can’t determine what party affiliation because changes
are coming and we’re going to see other parties coming along so we don’t
need to close it in so that it’s just two parties that’s operating at
this time. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we do need to make a longer period of time
that you have to register a particular party. We had people this
election changing their affiliation so they could vote for the lesser,
what they considered the lesser of two candidates in some of the
primaries. That’s something that’s been going on for awhile and it went
on pretty good this time. I think you should have to be, by the time the
candidates finish filing whatever you are at that point that’s what it
should stay until after the election.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] section of the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Section two about the order of ballots, it’s random
selection for non-partisan or primary but doesn’t really tell us the
main issue there. That is, is it random selection for… well I’ll just
give you an example. By flipping a coin you could say alphabetical first
heads, alphabetical last tails. What that does for that election is give
a big advantage to one person for that election but who gets the
advantage is a matter of luck. The real way to do it is to say half the
ballots will be in one order and half the ballots will also be in the
other order then nobody has an advantage. They all have practical
problems but does this provision tell the state board of election what
they mean by random selection? Being Stam, that’s always the end of the
alphabet so I was always prejudiced in school, called on last and
things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m going to let Miss Churchill answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Never Representive Stam. The bill does not direct the
state board how to determine what is random selection. They might be
able to speak to what they’re doing today for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I plan, once we get finished with member comments,
I think Miss [??] going to let her speak. Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m going back to section one again. I understand this
to actually apply only to candidates. Is that correct? In other words,
let me say that if I choose to change my registration to another party
would that allow me to vote in that party primary? It doesn’t stop my
vote does it? What this does, it just applies to candidates, I hope.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? going to take that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux that’s correct. This section
just deals with candidate filing. There is a limitation before a primary
election. There is a time limit. I’m sorry, I’ll have to check. I can’t
remember if it’s 30 or 90 days. You can’t change your party affiliation
immediately before a primary and vote in the party’s primary if you are
registered with another party.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is just a general
question about the bill as a whole. Is there anything in the PCS that
replaces or changes the law or effective dates of the 2016 voter ID
legislation that we passed during the long session?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher there is one section. I believe
it is section seven of the bill, does amend the voter ID provisions,
however it does not change the current law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question staff in the chair. These are generally
technical changes. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So there is no substance or policy changes in this
bill. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Any other discussion on this [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] …motion is appropriate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’ve heard the motion for a favor report  to the PCS
for senate bill 403 and favorable to the original…</p>

<p id="45:00">
... in favor aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed,
no. The ayes have it. The motion is adopted. Is there any further…?
Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I thought I heard you say
earlier you were just going to let Ms. Track come and explain the one
provision on the random selection, and I’d be anxious to hear that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll go ahead and let Ms. Track speak to it. Ms.
Track, welcome to the Elections Committee. Glad to have you over.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’m happy… I hope I get this
right. In 2002, the State Board of Elections met and they determined
what the process for random selection would be, and the current State
Board has not changed that, and what they started off with is it’s sort
of… it’s a two year cycle, so I think they started off with Z, and then
it was reversed. It would go all the way back to A, the last name of the
candidate, and then in two years, it would go back to A, and we’d go
back and forth, reverse from forward alphabet to reverse of the alphabet
every two years, and that’s been the policy since 2002 and it’s
continued through this primary. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could ask a question, Mr…. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The process of random selection, that’s
just for primary candidates, correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s for primary
candidates, and it was also that same order was used for nonpartisan
candidates as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You’re recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you explain the
process for selection who goes in the ballot first for general election?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the statute deals with that. I think that
change now is based on party, and it’s the party of the Governor will be
first on the ballot. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just a little anecdote to show how ridiculous that system is.
It’s what we told them to do, but this is… I’ll just give an example. I
was the recruiter for appellate candidates for a long time, and
unofficially, but I did it. So the Democratic candidate was John
Arrowood, so to meet the alphabetical part of it, I found an extremely
qualified district court judge with 20 years of experience, who was a
woman, which gave us three or four percent advantage, and her name was
Alloway, Sherry Alloway of Guilford County, because she would beat him
on the alphabet. That is what we’re reduced to when you have the
alphabetical thing that applies statewide for that election. All it does
is make it completely unfair based upon some years the front of the
alphabet, some years the back of the alphabet, but it’s completely
unfair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman, for a moment of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized for a moment of personal privilege. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members, this is contemplated by the
Chairs to be the last time the House elections Committee will meet
during this session or this biennium. On behalf of Representative Moore,
I’d like to extend my sincerest thanks, first of all to all of you.
There have been many issues that this committee has dealt with over the
past two years, and many of them have been stressful, and some
emotional, and I personally appreciate the dignity through which you
have all conducted yourselves and the business of this committee. I
think that we have done credit to the House and to the legislative
process as a whole by the actions that we have shown. Also on behalf of
Representative Moore and me, I would like to issue a special thank you
to Nancy, Misty, Grace, Greg and Mark for all of their work in making
sure that trains run on time, and of course, we would be completely lost
without our central staff of Erica, Cara and Kelly, so again, thank you
all for your hard work. It is very much appreciated. It has been an
honor to serve as Chair of the House Elections Committee this year.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any further
comments or business to come before the committee? Representative
Michaux. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Chairman. Don’t you want to enforce the
rule – 15 minute rule? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well we have voted on our last
act, and I guess you could call this last little bit kind of a social
time, so if there’s no other notices or announcements for committee, we
stand adjourned.</p>
