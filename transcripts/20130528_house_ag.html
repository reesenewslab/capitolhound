[SPEAKER CHANGES] All veterans are not in this bill presently all
military personnel within the state are treated this way and we brought
this forward to treat those visit here and who would like to come here

something we should consider moving forward.

conforming changes to reflect the renaming of the division of force
resources to the North Carolina force service and modify the statue
governing the stand by duty for fire fighters and it gives the
commissioner of agriculture the right of entry upon the premises of any
place where the entry is necessary to enforce the provision of the
bedding walls under the current statue and provide if consent front
entry is not obtained administrative search and inspection warrant may
be obtained for the purposes of entering both these bills passed the
Senate anonymously are best supported by the agricultural commissioner
and I will answer any questions in the appropriate time.

The state of North Carolina and to the Department of, of Agriculture.
For these reasons and many others, Mr. McLeod has been awarded the Order
of the Longleaf Pine by the governor, and we'd like to ask Mr. McLeod
and the Commissioner of Agriculture, Mr. Steve Troxler, to come up,
please. Commissioner Troxler, welcome to the House Committee on
Agriculture. Feel free to take a few moments as you see fit preliminary
to you presenting the award to Mr. McLeod. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Sherman
and members, I thank you for this opportunity today. David, it looks
like there's a lot of people here that are interested in these three
bills that we had running today. And, I had hoped, Mr. Chairman, that I
would come to this committee today to hear the debate over the bill that
said David McLeod could not retire. I have threatened, threatened this
with him. In fact, I asked my former counsel, Ray Starling, to run the
bill. He said that he thought it was both unconstitutional and violated
the state personnel ??; but, why let that stand in the way of something
that needs to be done? But I can't tell you how much this man has meant
to agriculture, to the department over the years, and all the things
that he's done. I think I, I need to tell a little, short David McLeod
story to show you how he operates: Anybody that knows David knows that
he's quiet and thoughtful and cagey. In fact, most of the time, he's
thinking, and that scares me unless he's thinking for me. There came a
time when there was a man that would not pay his assessment on the, a
cotton assessment; and, David messed with him and messed with him and
messed with him to try to, to pay this boll weevil assessment, and he
just wouldn't do it. And David didn't want to harm the farmer and his
farming operation; but, he had to take a lean out on something. So, what
he did is he took a lean out on the farmer's wife's Mercedes, and she
paid immediate, he paid up immediately; so, that's kinda the way he
operates, and that's what we're gonna miss. But, David, I want to
present you the Order of the Longleaf Pine from the governor and what ??
says: The Order of the Longleaf Pine with the rank of Ambassador
Extraordinarily Privileged to enjoy fully all rights granted to members
of this exalted order, among which is the special privilege to purpose
the following North Carolina toast and select company anywhere in the
free world: &quot;Here's to the land of the longleaf pine, the summer
land where the sun doth shine, where the wheat grows strong and the
strong grow great. Here's to down home, the old north state,&quot; and
it's with great pleasure that I present you with this, and just thank
you so much for what you've meant to the department and to me. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. McLeod, we would be delighted to hear a few words from you
this afternoon. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is bound
to be out of order, and I smelled a rat when I saw some people when I
came in here didn't belong here, and I know Ray Starling must've had
something to do with this. But, anyway, I do appreciate it. The
agriculture committees have always been my favorite committees; it's
always the best group of people to work with, and I've enjoyed it. Thank
you so much for everything.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Committee,
thank you so much for allowing us to take this portion of our committee
time to present this important award. Committee's adjourned.</p>
