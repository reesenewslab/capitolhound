[CHAIRMAN] For discussion purposes, all in favor say aye.
[GROUP] Aye.
[CHAIRMAN] All opposed.  Motion carried.  Senator Cook welcome back to
the House and welcome to House Finance.
[SENATOR COOK] Thank you Mr. Chairman, it’s good to be back here amongst
so many of my old friends.  It’s good to see folks I haven’t seen for a
while.  Anyway, let me get it on.  Senate Bill 790:  it was a very
simple Bill.  It’s morphed. There’s a couple of pages to it now, and I’m
going to tell you about the part I know about which was for Hatter’s
Electric.  As you may recall, we increased their sales tax from 0 to 7%
and this is a utility and group of customers who haven’t had a sales tax
in 70 years, so I just thought that was a little too dramatic and we’re
trying to give them a break for one year.  For one year they would have
3.5% instead of the 7%.  And then after a year it would go to 7%, if
there’s no objection, all of the other municipality—excuse me—electric
co-ops are in agreement with this--no problems--and the rest of the
Bill, I guess I would ask Cindy, staff to explain.
[CHAIRMAN] Ms. Averett [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  The PCS adds three provisions
to this Bill.  The first one is one that the House passed in it’s
version of the budget and it’s a very similar situation to Senator
Cook’s [??]  There are 8 gas cities, and in those gas cities those
customers have not had to pay any of the excise tax on pipe natural gas
in the past.  When House Bill--the tax reform bill--was passed last
year, the sales tax was imposed on all customers.  This break was not
afforded, so in a similar situation, the sales tax for those customers
was going to go from 0 to 7% in one year. So in a similar fashion, it
phases the rate in.  This was included in your House Budget.  It’s in
this Bill because it is time-sensitive.  That rate becomes effective
July 1st.  So for these people to have this reduced rate, this Bill will
need to pass this body and be signed by the Governor by July 1st.  The
second thing that has been added to the Bill is something Representative
Turner is familiar with.  It is something that this body passed last
session.  The site infrastructure property tax referral program.  One of
the requirements to be in that program is that the land must have been
in the PUV system.  This removes that requirement because there are, in
fact, large blocks of land that are vacant agricultural land that aren’t
in the PUV system that would like to take advantage of this and can’t
because of that requirement.  And lastly, it makes a technical change.
You may say both versions of your budget delayed the effective date as
to when dealer administrative fees would be included in the highway use
tax base to October 1st when you passed House Bill 1050 earlier this
session, that change was in it, so the last section of the Bill simply
repeals those provisions that would have had that fee becoming effective
July 1st.
[CHAIRMAN] Questions from the committee? Representative Tine.
[REPRESENTATIVE TINE] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to thank the
Chairs of Finance for helping us out with this.  With the Hatter’s Co-Op
portion of it.  The reason that it had an exemption was because it was
the only co-op in the State that did not have a protected territory, and
when the other co-ops gave it up, this one stayed more like a public
agency, and so that’s why it existED that way.  And I’d also like to
make a motion at the appropriate time, sir.
[CHAIRMAN] You’re recognized for a motion.
[REPRESENTATIVE TINE] I’d like to make a motion for a favorable report
for the PCS unfavorable to the original.
[CHAIRMAN] Members of the Committee you’ve heard the motion on the
floor.  Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, all in favor say
aye.
[GROUP] Aye.
[CHAIRMAN] All opposed?  Motion carried.  Thank you. Senator Cook.
[SENATOR COOK]  Thank you members.  Chairman.
[CHAIRMAN] It was a pleasure. At this time we will hear House Bill 1220.
 Hope for Hailey.  Representative McElraft
[REPRESENTATIVE MCELRAFT] Thank you Mr. Chairman, and members of the
Committee.  Dr. Fulgim[??] and Representative Carney are also members.
Doctor Fulgim had a surgery and I don’t believe he’s here right now,
hopefully he’ll be here this afternoon.  I believe, Mr. Chair,  that
representative Carney has an amendment.
[CHAIRMAN] Has it been passed out?   It’s being passed out.  Members of
the Committee the Carney amendment will be passed out.
[REPRESENTATIVE MCELRAFT] All this Bill is, this amendment is doing it
it’s on page 3</p>

line 45, we're deleting the word &quot;oil&quot; and substituting the
word &quot;extract.&quot; The word extract is used throughout the bill.
This is just one of those technical changes so I ask for your approval.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Discussion or debate. Representative Collins. Members of the Committee,
you've heard the motion from Representative Collins to adopt the Carney
amendment to House Bill 1220. Further discussion or debate? Hearing
none, all in favor say aye. All opposed. Amendment is adopted. Thank
you, Representative Carney. Representative McElraft.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. The only finance piece
to this bill is a 50$ fee. It is a registration fee. When the child and
their parent and the physician decides that this is the medicine that
that physician, that neurologist, wants that child to be on then that
child will have prescription, it's not really a prescription because
it's not an FDA approved drug, but it will be an order from the doctor
that will go to DHS. That child will be registered at DHS. There will be
a fee of $50 and then that registration will go to the local sheriff.
That way we will have record of which children are on the CBD oil and we
will have, the local sheriff will know and that way we will have record
for the state. We will know then and the data then will be presented at
our medical universities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Motion for proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll hold that, thank you. Representative Jones. Representative Jones.
Representative Burt Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was going to also do the same.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I support the measure and intend to vote for it but I'm curious, since
the oil's an extract of the cannabis plant where is this supply of
plants coming from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The plants will probably be coming from the only known source that has
lab work done to test its' purity, which is the Charlotte's Web source
in Colorado. But the, each medical university will select their own
source, a proven source to those physicians there. Each medical
university does not have to participate in this. We have found out that
our three medical universities have been chosen by GW Pharmaceutical. We
have gotten, I've heard about Duke and UNC through the grapevine. We
haven't gotten proof of that yet but Wake Forest has given us the notice
that they have been chosen by GW Pharmaceutical to be part of the
clinical trial for Epidiolex which is the same thing CBD oil in an FDA
approved format. That will probably be two years down the road. So that
university wants to compare the two, though a Charlotte's Web, a CBD
oil, and the FDA version of it. So we're very excited that we have that
opportunity for our medical universities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there somebody here from the medical community that can answer a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last night, may I help you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not that sick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What did he say?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not that sick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You could be, we're not done yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll ask staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright. Who deals with this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any adverse consequence or additional liability for a physician
who recommends a treatment that's not approved by the FDA?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Riley can you answer that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not know what the adverse effects would be. We're not privy to that
information. I would imagine the physician would have liability for
anything that he prescribes. They take responsibility for that, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr.-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McElraft.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We did talk to urologists at UNC, had a long conversation with them, Dr.
Fulghum and I did. I'm sorry he's not here but they do non-FDA approved
clinicals all the time. In fact, the Epidiolex is non-FDA approved</p>

It will be in a clinical trial. They do accept that responsibility and
the parents know at the time that these are not FDA approved clinical
trials. And the parents I’m sure have to sign off for it. But I will
have that information for you on the floor today. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. A couple questions. The first
one being is there a neurologist here today who can speak to this from a
medical perspective? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, that question was already
asked. There is no one here from the medical community. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That came forward at this point. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well as Representative Starnes said
yesterday, we’ve always in finance been able to ask questions on other
parts of the bill and not just this and is there someone then [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Dr. Fulghum just came in, so maybe he can answer your
questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That, and then Mr. Chairman I have another
one after that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, if you’d like to go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Fulghum to the rescue. I told him ?? express and
it didn’t work. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fulghum,
over here. Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m wondering if you
can speak to the medical issues involved here, in your role as a health
professional? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t know where you started on this
but the cannabidiol is a component of a hemp plant. It is also a
component of a marijuana plant. It is a drug that is now being studied
around the world, particularly in North America the FDA and US
particular has declared it an orphan drug. And also an IND or an
investigational new drug. It’s now being studied in several medical
centers around the country. It’s been found to be effective so far, in
very early studies, in controlling intractable seizures. In intractable
seizures involving two main syndromes involving children. Dravet and
Lennoz-Gastaut are the two ones that are fairly rare but genetically are
linked. And other people who have intractable seizures meaning their not
responsive to three or more medications. Not responsive being they can’t
take the medications or they’re not controlling the seizures. And these
are people who are having maybe hundreds of seizures a day. The GW
pharmaceutical company in the UK is producing a pharmaceutical grade
drug called Epidiolex. Epidiolex is the drug being studied and approved
by the FDA for the study. It has not been approved for general release
yet but early indications indicate this is going to be a good drug full
of purpose as it’s meant to be used for. There are other drugs that this
company produces in the general line. They’re studying this but the FDA
has very, very strict type production controls as well as controls
involving how this study goes, what kind of reporting goes, and I think
this particular type of bill would help you to allow Epidiolex to be
used in this state, under the control of neurologists at the university
centers, enrolling their patients in studies and following in outcomes.
And I think this is the scientific way to do it. This is the best way to
figure out if this thing really works. And also it gives these people
the protection they need not to be arrested for using an illegal drug.
So I think this is a good bill. It’s got some tidying up to do I think
here and there. But frankly I encourage your adoption of it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, second
question and related to what Representative Fulghum just said. I had a
visit yesterday from health professionals from Carolina, UNC Chapel Hill
medical center, and they pointed out that this research is planned. And
I am concerned that the bill on page 3 lines 44 section 3 uses the word
encourages these universities. And my question is whether you can except
the group, the group get excepted from the amendment that we do here on
the floor that would say the following. The General Assembly directs UNC
Chapel Hill, Duke and/or Wake Forest University to conduct research.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, at the time, absolutely. At the time the
bill was written, we were not in the clinical trials. We</p>

...I have begged DW Pharmaceuticals legal staff and they have begged to
part of the clinical trials. They have just selected us I think this
week or last week so we would love to have that amendment. That would be
great. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you don't mind would you run the amendment on the floor so we have a
length calendar?

Thank you. Staff did you approve the amendment? Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Riley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can cert- we can direct UNC to do the study. I think it might be
difficult to direct Duke and Wake Forest since they are private
institutions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wwll we can always ask. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I just have a comment not a question. I think most
observers of the general assembly would agree that you don't have to be
a brain surgeon to do this job and that's an understatement. But, I just
want to say it's sure nice to have at least one around at times like
this. [LAUGHTER]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We need all the help we can get. Representative Hager, you're recognized
for motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I want to make a motion for a favorable on House
Bill 1220 as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Unfavorable to the original bill.

Unfavorable to the original bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative McElraft and company. At this time we will hear
House Bill 1182. UNC non-appropriated capital funds, Representative Bill
Brawley Mechlenburg(?).
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ryan Brown...somebody will be back.
Representative Brian Brown, Rodney Moore is also on this bill and Nathan
Ramsey. This is a non-appropriations bill for the university system.
These are projects for which we do not appropriate money. They will be
covered with revenue bonds and contributions from supporters on the
universities. But, it does require our permission for them to issue the
bonds. We have the fiscal note or the notes on the second page detailed
what the projects are at the different universities. What the fees will
be. The first one on ECU there's an asterisk it says it's a new fee.
They actually have a fee that will be expiring this year so they are
eliminating fees as they are adding fees but we're showing it as a new
fee. And the rest of them go down. We have representatives of both East
Carolina and West Carolina in the audience today to answer direct
questions. I think Representative Brown would like to make some comments
on East Carolina because really that's the biggest one. But Mr. Chairman
I want to go ahead and move for a favorable. Representative Brown if you
would recognize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely. Asked and affirmed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members thank you. Chairman thank you. Just a brief comment on East
Carolina University's it is a project for a new student center at ECU.
The last student center that was built Linden Hall was build in 1974. At
that time we had about 11,000 students and about 31 or so student
organizations. We've now blossomed to about 27,000 students and about
402 student organizations. We've also seen tremendous growth on our
Health Science campus so part of the allocation will also go to build a
student center out on our Health Science campus. Very much need projects
with our expanding campus and then we really hope that you support this.
If you have any questions in terms or how the projects will actually be
funded please don't hesitate to ask but I don't want to waste the
committees time if not necessary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me ask Representative Brown a question on East Carolina, he's
talking about there'll be a new student(??) free of $425.00 per student.
That sounds pretty high. How does that compare with other public
universities? It's actually right about the middle and we actually have
representatives here from East Carolina if you would like to have them
address it. We've actually in terms of what we're looking to do the fee
hasn't been raised in many years. There's no mass increase this year so
it is going to be a step program and the student body has actually voted
on this increase as well as the Board of Trustees and the Board of
Governors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions, Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for a motion to (??)
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have one on the floor.

… administration’s signed off on these projects? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
General administration and the Board of Governors have signed off on all
but the Western Carolina. I do have an email from the Chairman of the
Board of Governors, also including their Finance Chairman and the
incoming Chair, that they intend to approve the Western Carolina at
their next meeting, so we are flipping the order on that one, but since
we will not be here when their next meeting takes place, that would
delay them for a year. I will also say that I have personal knowledge of
the Western Carolina, as my son was an undergraduate there. Their
cafeteria’s undersized for their student body and it’s sometimes
difficult to find a place to sit to eat, so they’re really trying to
get… this is what theirs is for, dining hall. If you’d like to have the
folks from Western Carolina, they’re here, and then I have a copy of the
email if you’d like to see it, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d appreciate
that. It does make me a little nervous. I understand what you’re saying,
but we do not have official approval of this through the Board of
Governors. I understand what you’ve just explained about how it’s
forthcoming and we may not be in session. Rather than take the
committee’s time in terms of hearing from Western Carolina, I would just
ask, because I’m not having time to find it in here, what is the amount
of student fee at Western Carolina compared to the one thousand or so
that is in reference for ECU? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please step to the mic, Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Western Carolina right now is 387 dollars. Appalachian is 579. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No, excuse me, what will the fee by what this…? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That will be the fee with this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may, for
Western Carolina, the total fee’s including this project can only be 300
and change? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct, sir. They’re not requ…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley, let Mark Bondo, staff address
that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mark Bondo, Fiscal Research. If you’ll look on
page 2 of the fiscal note, Western Carolina has the maximum fee that
they expect to increase will be 136 dollars to support this project.
Currently, as Representative Brawley stated, their current debt service
fee is 387, so this would be an increase to that fee. For 2013-14, their
general fees were 2,040 dollars, and so this would be an increase of
that amount of 136 to that amount. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? Representative Brawley, you’re
recognized for your motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
move favorable to the House Bill 1182. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the
committee, you’re heard the motion on the floor. Any further discussion

that I know of other than Representative Stam, and I’d like to allay his
fears by agreeing to take the same pledge that our other Representative

built by the people of the community of Taylortown, and end of
segregation, is was merged in with the school system. The school system
has since vacated the building and the town would like to have it back,
and what we’re asking is that instead of county commissioners having to
buy it back, is that the school board can sell it back directly to the
town. All are in agreement with the county commissioners, school board,

CHANGES] Thank you again for that editorial moment. At this time, we
will hear House Bill 1070, Town of Duck Imminent Domain, Representative
Tine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the
committee, this was a bill that was asked for unanimously by the town of
Duck. It adds the town to 19 other towns in two counties that have an
expedited imminent domain process available to them to access and
facilitate beach re-nourishment. There’s one difference. There was some
opposition to allowing the town to take property to create public beach
access parking areas. We removed that provision portion of it and it
took care of any opposition. I stand ready to answer any questions.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Explain the practical effect of this. You have a hurricane and what, a
house washes away and so then the town wants to come in and take that
property? [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is more the availability of access to
do a beach re-nourishment project, so for example if they need to lay
pipe across somebody’s land or they have… Up to the edge of the
waterline is the state’s property and then the rest is the owner’s. If
they need to lay sand on that area that’s the owner’s, they can do that
also, so it’s an expedited process. And happy to turn to staff if I
haven’t answered your question properly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Hager. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Tine, can you tell me why you need it expedited? You’ve
got processes for imminent domain now. Why does it need to be expedited?
That worries me a little bit when we start taking folks’ property
expeditiously. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And it’s in order to protect that
exists along the - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, follow-up. Whose
property? The town’s or the people’s? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The people
because you have all these properties along the way and we’ve had beach
erosion over time, and we do have some funds that are available now to
be able to go ahead and do some re-nourishment projects in order to
protect property, and so they’re trying to move as quickly as possible
because it changes of course based on the weather events that we have
out on the coast. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I want to see if I’m understanding. I think maybe I can
envision the situation you’re just talking about. You have… even a
nor’easter up where you are can tear beaches up and strip the sand out,
and maybe you’ve got an area there where you have ten property owners
from all over the United States, and maybe you can’t get in touch with
two of them or something like that. Is that the kind of situation you’re
talking about? You need to lay sand across the whole path but you can’t
get in touch with some of them or something like that so you need the
ability to go ahead and do it so that the other… so that everybody’s
property can be protected and not just the eight you could get in touch
with, or am I missing the point entirely? [SPEAKER CHANGES] With the
Chair’s permission, I’d like to ask staff to clarify the ?? down to the
details, if that’s alright. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. Mr. Roney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What the bill does is it does authorize this quick
take procedure where they could just go to court very quickly…</p>

do eminent domain on the land, and then the, the ramifications for that
are for... you know, put off for another time, so the town immediately
has possession. And, the, the purposes that the town can do it are
pretty broad. It's more than just, just beach nourishment if you look at
the bill. But, the policy decision to allow the coastal communities to
do it... I mean it... you know there's a large list of coastal
communities that currently have the authority. I'm not really familiar
with how... like operationally these coastal communities have actually
used this authority, but it's adding thought to a list of coastal
communities that have the authority to ??, and then, then if you look at
the bill, there's, there's a lot of authorized purposes for this, and
then the bill excludes DOT from the authorized purpose of public access.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley, Robert.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Understanding there may be a problem where this needs
to be done at times, and the questions being asked, are any of the
communities currently affected by this, asking to get out of it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not to my knowledge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, then Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, under the normal process, without the expedited
quick-take, how long does it take?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Like to refer to staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, staff, how long does it take to do the normal
eminent domain, what's the time frame?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Representative Stam does, Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] An extra thirty days at least. But if I could
extrapolate on that...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll come back. I'll come back to Representative
Starnes, if he could answer your question more thoroughly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Usually the problem with quick-take is not the
quickness of it, but that it's a... it uses the DNV, diminution in
values, which is not fair to the property owner. But I examined this
with Representative Tine, and they are not, they are not doing the bad
part of quick-take. They still are using Chapter 48, measure of damages,
which is favorable to the property owner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, well I guess, and I, I know that other
communities have this, or little towns. But my, my thought is... I mean
?? nourishment, that's a long, detailed, involved process. You just
don't go in today, lay a pipe, and start sucking up sand and rebuilding
it. I mean, that's a slow process. And so, I don't understand why they
need to rush. I mean you make... this, these are the types of things
that a local town would make plans for. And they get... they make their
preparation, and it takes time. I just don't understand why they just
can't work it through the normal, orderly processes, as opposed to
having to go through the quick-take to expedite this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I, I was hoping to save the committee time, but I can
explain the the long history we've had over the last decade and a half
with regards to ?? nourishment. Which, originally we started with a
federal program that was permitted and processed to be able do it. And
then, it was under those rules the federal funding fell apart in regards
to it, so therefore, we already identified offshore sand, and everything
else. We, we more recently have more damages to the beaches and ?? which
made it more critical to re-nourish those areas to protect the
properties that, that are along that area and protect our infrastructure
?? twelve along that way. So it has been a long process, and now we've
just had a county decision which said they are going to utilize funds in
a different way. Because, before when it was federally funded, then you
had to have public access which means the ?? wasn't allowed to
participate. But now it is allowed to participate by ??, so now they're
in a critical situation in regards to their beach. And now they also
have money and funding available, so they want to go ahead and take care
of that while they have the opportunity to do so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And Representative Samuelson can shed some light on
this issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I don't know if I'm that perfect on the bill
itself. So often I hear in our various committee's, when it comes to
coastal issues, I'm gonna let the coastal legislatures decide. And one
that I've learned to work with over the years is Representative
McElraft; whose currently covered... almost all of her district is
currently covered under this exact same provision. So, I went out and
asked her, and she looked and said &quot;Oh yeah we really need... this
is no problem whatsoever.&quot; So, if you wanna know what the coastal
people say who are already living under this, and, and have to operate
under it; she thinks it's a good idea. So I would urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much for that enlightenment.
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The only improvement I could make to the bill would be
to try to include Wake county...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh dear.</p>

Out of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Since the ?? I would like to vote for a
favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Members of the
committee, you've heard the motion on the floor after the brief
discussion. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All opposed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion
carries. The bill is, thank you for your kind presentation. At this time
we will hear House Bill 1059, venus fly trap taking penalty, occupancy
use tax. Representative Davis, Representative Starnes moves to have the
PCS before us for discussion purposes only. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion carried. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Davis. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This
is a local bill that is comprised of two sections. The first section is
concerning the venus fly trap. As many of you all may know, the venus
fly trap is a very unique plant. As a matter of fact, it only grows
within a 100 mile radius of New Hanover County and grows nowhere else in
the world. The basis of doing this is presently under our present law if
you go and take a venus fly trap to steal it, it's basically just a slap
on the arm, slap on the hand misdemeanor penalty. We had a situation in
Wilmington where there was a large venus fly trap area where these
plants grown in natural habitat and someone came in and stole just a
vast number of these plants, so in order to try to deter people from
doing this in the future, I was asked by conservancy agencies to go
forward in legislation that would make this a felony. The reason a class
H felony was chosen is because presently under our general statutes,
larceny of a ginseng is a class H felony, larceny of pine straw is a
class H felony, so this is consistent with the punishment in those
particular situations. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, at the proper time for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I had a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Moore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we, which one, my cousin or me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was looking at Representative Rodney Moore. I'll
come back. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, Mr. Chair, I just want to make a
motion at the appropriate time, but just to let you know I am familiar
with these venus fly traps growing up in Wilmington and always enjoyed
the plant life there so I ask that you adopt this with all speed. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that kind information.
Representative Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Question
for the bill sponsor here. I notice in the environmental bill we have,
the Senate bill we have here that the venus fly trap, the penalty for
that has been suggested raised from $75 up to $175. I'm just curious, I
didn't see in there. I may have overlooked it any provision about
changing that to a class H felony. I was curious if you were going to
propose an amendment on the floor for that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I
respond? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you have to, yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, and thank you for that question. Actually yesterday in
Judiciary C I sponsored a bill called the omnibus criminal amendment
bill, which is a multitude of criminal proposed changes. One of those
would be to make the theft of a venus fly trap plant a class H felony
statewide. So actually I have these two things basically going on at the
same time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
I'm willing to vote for this local bill but I do want to caution you and
I do want to ask the legislators from these 4 counties to really think
about this. A class 3 misdemeanor is like nothing, you know, less than a
speeding ticket. Class H felony is what you get for strangling somebody
and causing physical injury. It's what you get for activities designed
to overthrow the government. It's continuing criminal enterprise. Now
whenever somebody wants to race up, you know, a lot of local people,
make it a felony, we can't prosecute without a felony. There are a lot
of class 1 misdemeanors, class A1 you get more time actually but without
putting the label of a felon on somebody and the assembly just has this
yo-yo thing, we're constantly making things felonies and then we're
expunging all their records. Am I right? Yeah. I mean, let's be real
about this. We worked on the justice reinvestment project in the 11th
session and we changed a lot of penalties with the idea of let's
structure our sentences so they're correct. Now every time somebody
wants to over-felonize something they bring up get ginseng and pine
straw, and those should be changed. They should be misdemeanors, but a
class H felony's a real crime. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For procedural purpose,
Representative Starnes, would you mind reporting from this occupancy tax
subcommittee? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank</p>

Speaker Changes: Thank you my goodness Representative Corney
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.Chairmen i look for favorable report 59,
Speaker Changes: Thank you you had the floor Representative Luke,
Speaker Changes: Mr.Chairman i have a question for Representative ?? and
for staff you ?? that the decision situation in ?? is out of complaints
and now is in complaints with his bill can you explain that please,
Speaker Changes: All right new handover county and ?? located with in it
are convoluted collection ?? before the guidelines were adopted,so
basically nothing in Wilmington and ?? guidelines,now the district view
ill stand for the incorporated areas never cleared me when we have new
?? county ?? but Representative Davis was a county commissioner he had
got the bills passes non other less but the district view has to be used
for ?? which is an accepted guideline,but there is a district view don't
need any beach nourishment  collected ?? rough;y of a million dollars is
not been used for any type of purpose,and also they do have some canals
that they do wanted to have dredge ?? is not an acceptable use of ?? tax
funds not will this be under this bill but they say they can but they
will agree to view district and applies with the guidelines they get and
going followed everything else has used into it 2/3 traveler related
issue,one thirds for tours activities,
Speaker Changes: Follow up and this may be for staff but what is this
after doing with beach nourishment what is this bill have to to do with
beach nourishment because you said that ??,
Speaker Changes: 100 percent ?? tax collected under business view goes
under ?? nourishment but they font have any because and they don't have
any nourished and collecting this tax in a just a fund ?? because they
can use for ??  nourishment,when they passes they bill they said wanted
from ??nourishment they got it but they wanted to ?? nourishment,
Speaker Changes: so you are taking way the ?? nourishment use it's gone
under the bill,
Speaker Changes: It's i may, the whole thing create is as Representative
storm says ?? and at the present system hundred percent of that was to
be used from ?? nourishment  that was it out complaints got ?? because
you know 100 percent can be used for ?? nourishment ?? when it realizes
no beaches in ?? so since 2006 we got million dollars in this fund just
siting there  it can be used so this legislation bring into complain
were about from now on when that money comes in two thirds for tourism
promotion and remaining for tourism related expenditure ?? you have two
choices the other choice would be ?? don't leave that choice ??,

Rodney Moore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Very quickly, Mr. Chairman. There was
some discussion after my previous statement about I enjoyed all kinds of
plant life in Wilmington. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That was your admission, and
we thank you for sharing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me clarify. There is a
beautiful garden in Wilmington called Early Gardens and we enjoyed many
trips to Early Gardens, and let me just say for the record, this was not
hemp related that I enjoyed plant life in Wilmington. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I did not inhale. So that's, I
just wanted to clear that up. I heard a lot of banter around the room,
but just wanted to say that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] News travels fast around
this complex here. Representative Hager. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think I've
got my question answered by Will, make the observation that
Representative Moore is sitting beside Representative Alexander.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. You know, Rodney, when you're in a hole, stop
digging. Mr. Chairman, actually I think these questions would best be
answered by staff. The idea of a felony in 4 of 100 counties sounds a
little odd to me. I understand that's the only place venus fly traps
naturally occur, but I just wasn't sure if that was a common practice,
and the second part of the question is this says the section would be
effective for offenses occurring, OK. Never mind. I understand. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We're glad to help. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, but yeah, on that, on
the 4 counties only felony, is that an unusual provision in North
Carolina law? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley, it is somewhat
unusual and when this bill was in the Judiciary Committee the staff to
that committee contacted the criminal law folks at the School of
Government to confer with them and while it's probably not the preferred
method, they did not see any constitutional problems with it and again I
think to your point to the extent that this is kind of a localized
offense and also Representative Davis explained in the subcommittee
yesterday that the areas would intend to publicize this or the
conservancy groups would intend to make it known in those areas that
this would be a felony. So with that information from the School of
Government, they felt comfortable with that provision, and just to
follow up, since Representative Davis has indicated that he is making an
attempt to make it statewide as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Blust. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley asked my
question too. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, you are
recognized for your motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that we give House
Bill ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, you've heard the
motion on the floor. Any further discussion or debate? If not, all in
favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion carried. Thank you
Representative Davis. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At
this time House Bill 1052, Representative Hager. Hm-hm-hm. Jeopardy.
Representative Hager, you are recognized to explain your bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And the committee is
waiting for you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. This bill was vetted
yesterday. Representative Luebke I think asked most of the questions but
what this bill does is take some of the, back when telecoms were
regulated. As they become deregulated moving through the system, they
kept the fee regulation in place until the regulation was complete. This
basically does away with a lot of that fee regulation and as we found
out yesterday, Representative Luebke asked a question it is meant for a
hold harmless issue where the other folks would step up to take up the
extra slack. And Mr. Chairman, Trey Raben is in the audience if we have
any tough questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Questions from the
committee. My goodness. Representative Hager, you're recognized for a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move that House
Bill 1052 receive a favorable report, to the PCS, I believe it's a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's not a PCS. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not a PCS? Just
favorable then, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Members of the
committee, you've heard the motion on the floor. Any further discussion
or debate? Hearing none, all in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.

As a little bit of cleanup, House Bill 1059 was a PCS in that motion,
and we didn’t include that in the motion so we’ll add that to the
motion. At this time we will have but last but not least, House Bill
1145, Insurance and Registration Required for Mopeds, Representative
Sheppard. The PCS is being passed out. Representative Warren moves to
have the PCS before us for discussion purposes. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed? Motion carried.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning Mr. Chair and committee. House
Bill 1145, basically the PCS will change some information that you will
receive - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Your mic. If you’ll turn the mic on please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. House Bill 1145 is an attempt to register
mopeds. In the state at this time, there is no current oversight over
mopeds in the state of North Carolina through on our highways, and so
what House Bill 1145 does is require that mopeds be registered through
DMV and have plates on those. There was also in the earlier portion of
the bill a requirement for insurance. That has been taken out with this
PCS. What we would like to do with this PCS is study the requirement for
insurance and any other requirements that we may need to do in the
future as regards to mopeds. This bill came to you because many people
contacted me complaining about the situations with mopeds. There have
been many accidents on the highways with mopeds. At the current time,
there is no oversight on mopeds; they are not even registered or plated
with DMV. There’s no way to correctly collect data that we’d like to
collect with those, so this is just a starting point with mopeds to
ensure that they are registered and they have plates, and then to do a
study in the off session that would come back and report to the
transportation committee that would let us know if we need to do
anything further as regards to mopeds. I’m here for any questions if you
have any. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee, I’ve talked with
Representative Shepard many times about this bill and I’ve found that
it’s really, really something that’s needed. I actually thought that
probably we had some things in place for mopeds, but there’s really not
any kind of registration or regulation of that moped industry. I know
many of you have probably gotten some information from the moped
association about the pushback for this, but I really do believe this is
something that should have been done a lot time ago. They travel on the
highways, and certainly we need some protections for those other folks
that travel on the highways. I strongly recommend  that… Of course, I’m
a little disappointed that the insurance part was taken out, but I’ve
had that explained to me about why we need to spend a little time
working on that, and I strongly encourage you to approve this bill and
for a motion at the proper time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Carney. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and
I want to thank the bill sponsors for taking out the insurance piece
when it was in Transportation and putting it into the study because I do
think there were some questions there, but I agree with the previous
speaker that this is something that does need a comprehensive study and
to look at what we’re going to come back with. As we heard in
Transportation, it’s not only a public safety issue but a law
enforcement issue, and we heard from both of those segments, but I just
want to point out to the committee that we regulate a lot of vehicles
that have wheels. We regulate bikes in some way, that you have to wear a
helmet. We regulate golf carts, we regulate ATVs, we regulate
motorcycles and of a lot of people use these to get to work, but it’s
because they can’t drive their cars anymore for whatever reason, and
some people are using them as a preference to get about on, but anyway,
I want to thank the bill sponsors for making this a comprehensive study,
and I do urge us to take a serious look at this next year. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chair? I would like to… In regards to what Representative
Carney said, this bill has been supported by the League of
Municipalities. Also the police chiefs of North Carolina have supported
this and the North Carolina Grange Society have supported this. I
reluctantly took the insurance part out, but I do believe it needs to be
further studied. There are a lot of questions that we need to have
answered about the insurance part, but I’m also concerned about many
times when there is an accident. A lady contacted me last…</p>

-week. She was hit by a moped in a shopping center, the police came,
did a report, and after the accident and the report was done, the moped
driver did not have insurance, did not have a driver's license, or
anything, so her insurance had to pay for the damages on her car. So I
am concerned about that aspect of it but I, based on the information
that we were getting, it's better I think to study this little feather,
and come back next year and see if we need to identify any other areas
that we need to work on as far as this bill is concerned. And it's not
my intent to keep anyone from using a moped to get to work or to class
or anything,  but I do think that if they're going to be on our public
highways- and we've got to look out for them, and also look out for
others, then we need to have some sort of requirements on mopeds, we
don't have any at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Hanes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm looking at your bill analysis, the vehicle
registration portion of it, and I'm trying to understand what a moped
owner would need in order to have the moped registered.  I see that they
need a manufacturer's certificate or something like that but is there
anything else that that person would have to provide when they go to the
DMV to register their moped?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Griffin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under the bill, in order to be registered, other than the moped meeting
the requirements to be used on the public highways, they just have to
produce the manufacturer's certificate of origin. And the owner will
also have to title it and pay a titling fee, but under the bill they
have to present a manufacturer's certificate of origin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I respond [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hanes, also if they also do not have that, the
manufacturer's certificate of origin for the moped, they can submit an
affidavit stating why the applicant does not have the manufacturer's
certificate of origin, and attest that the applicant is entitled to
registration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up please, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So do they have to present any type of ID to register the moped?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Griffin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think Bryce Ball over there might have the answer to that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bryce?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bryce Ball with fiscal research. GS20-52 with regards to the application
for registration and certificate of title require the identifcation of
the owner's name as well as other identifying information including the
mailing address and residence address. So, standard information
including included in the certificate of title.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Well I was pleased when I heard you were going to study the
insurance part, but then I'm looking at this study and it says it's
going to be the DMV, the Department of Justice, Department of Public
Safety, and the Department of Insurance are going to  study this, and
then they just give a report to the legislative transportation
oversight. Why would you not want to have a legislative committee to
study it and bring in these outside sources for information? You know
sometimes  I think that we have to filter the information we  get
because we're the ones that pass the laws. Would you be willing to
change that to a legislative study as opposed to outsourcing it to these
other departments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, I sure would. I think that's a great idea. we'll
work on that for you before it gets to the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
-we'll work on that for you, if it makes it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Don't say that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Would you be amicable to let all of it be
studied? Including the registration piece? Because if identification is
required in order to get a title, that means  somebody may have to have
a driver's license and may- Can we study all of this at one time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I appreciate the question from Representative Holley, but what I do
think that what the registration does do for us going at forward with
the study is to show how many of these we're dealing with out there. I
do think it gives us some sort of data that we can draw from when you
study.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yep.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Holley, do you have follow up?
