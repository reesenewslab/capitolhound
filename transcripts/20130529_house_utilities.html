<p id="10:00">
Whatever industries, I’m not sure. So that’s number one. Number two, I
think if we look at Mr. Gruber’s record over the years, he was not an
active Democrat, in the sense that he did not get involved in political
campaigns. According to this, according to the documents we have, you’ve
been, and that you’re right, to be the Treasurer for the Chad Barefoot
for Senate campaign. Now again, that’s absolutely your right as a
citizen but what we’re looking at today is not your role as a citizen,
your role as a director of the public staff, acting on behalf of the
public. And I just question whether people are active, partisans in the
party, are a good choice for that. So to me, we have three issues. Your
work record is not, does not have any indication that you spent any time
representing the average person, the average consumer. Number two,
you’ve been in a partisan role supporting a candidate for the Senate. As
you know, he was successful. And number three, we have the letter from
Mr. Newsome saying that there’s a potential conflict of interest. And I
just, I don’t know if anyone wants to respond to that. Mr. Harris,
Representative Moore. But to me, I wish the Governor would withdraw your
nomination, appoint you to the utilities commission, so we could vote
yes on you on the utility commission. But this is just very, very bad
for the public. Six years of having someone direct the public staff,
who’s had no record of supporting the public. So members, I urge you to
vote no on the nomination, with due respect to Mr. Ayers. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I didn’t think I was going to need this but we plan on taking a
vote by 12:30. Representative Moore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just say that I
think Mr. Ayers is more than qualified and I think he’s very well
qualified for this job, knowing what I know about what he probably does,
I would imagine he’s making a pretty significant personal sacrifice
frankly, to take this appointment. I don’t think, Representative Luebke,
that the criteria that you would want to use and certainly that has not
been employed in the previous administrations is whether a person has
never been involved in politics whatsoever. I think Mr. Ayers has a
great history. The statement of economic interest, the state ethics
commission finds there is not a conflict, and I think anything that
would try to argue that there is, is just not accurate at all. But you
know, this is the Governor’s appointment. I have full faith and
confidence in Mr. Ayers to do this job. Again, I think he’s making a
huge personal sacrifice and I would remind the gentleman from Durham
that when his party was in the majority and when I was in the minority,
we did not act in such a way to the Governor’s nominees at that time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Chairman. Mr. Ayers, welcome to Raleigh. [LAUGH] I’m reminiscent of
a story I once read, about Joseph Kennedy, who was a great speculator
and then when Roosevelt appointed him head of the SEC, because he knew
all the ways that people were playing with markets, he went out and
completely reformed them. And I’ve seen from your resume, you’ve been a
long career in utilities and you’re also an attorney and while some of
us would see that as almost a disqualification for any honest
profession, [LAUGHTER] I realize attorneys represent their clients. You
take the point of view of your client. If you’re representing a utility,
you’re going to put the best argument for the utility that you can. And
now your client is going to be the using and consuming public of North
Carolina, and you’re going to be taking your 20 years or so of
experience and representing them and perhaps using it against the
utilities if one assumes the adversarial bent that Representative, the
other Representative has put today. So that might be an argument for not
confirming you because we’re giving the public staff too competent a
person [LAUGH]. But I will say this sir, I think as an attorney as with
your background, yes you have to take unpopular positions but you have
to represent your client. Having a little bit of utility experience, I
see that you really are conversant with a broad range, having worked
with the public staff, I quite frankly am glad I didn’t have to face
you. And Mr. Chairman, I am so impressed with this gentleman that I
would like to make a motion at the appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Brawley. Hold that just for a minute. Let’s get
a few more folks and we’ll come back to you. Representative Arp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m truly amazed at Representative Luebke’s analysis
of the situation. I first of all, I think it’s appalling that you would
question the integrity of Mr. Ayers, that are total meritless and
founded</p>

And action in the future based on your perception of what you think his
character is.  Groundless, baseless. And to say that someone because
they’ve exercise their right in a political process is going to rule
some way or another because of some perceived future action is just
beyond the bell to me in this discussion.  I don’t know if you got the
same letter I do, I’m assuming we do, it says, we did not find an actual
conflict of interest, but found the potential for a conflict of
interest.  The potential conflict identified does not prohibit service
on this entity.  It even addresses the potential.  And so to politicize
this is just beyond thought to me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitmire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley has beat me to the punch and I concur with
Representative Arp’s comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]``
Thank you, Mr. Chairman I’ll be quick.  Two basic comments.  First, want
to echo what Representative Brawley said.  It seems to me, that the
Governor has made a wise choice that can well serve the public interest
and consumers in selecting someone who has spent time working the other
side of the road. That is a common occurrence for attorneys. It’s
something that they understand their responsibility is to the client
they represent at the time of the representation and I see absolutely
nothing wrong from an ethics standpoint or from a practical standpoint
and feel that Mr. Aires could well serve, maybe better serve the
interests of the consuming public because of his prior associations with
utility companies.  Secondly, regarding the letter.  The letter
regarding what the potential conflict I find to be very difficult to
figure out what they’re talking about.  On the one hand they make
reference to his prior membership, or his membership in the firm of ??.
He’s leaving that firm so he’ll no longer have any connections to them
economically. And he’s no longer representing the clients that he used
to represent.  So unless now it’s going to be considered a conflict of
interest for a lawyer to do something against the interest of a former
employer and a former client, which I think is sort of a new concept, I
don’t see any ethical problems here.  To the extent that there’s a
problem the only thing I can see is if something came up that might
involve knowledge or a matter that he had previously had some
involvement in, in which case I think the rules of the bar would require
him to recuse himself.  So I don’t’ see any problems here at all, it’s
an excellent nomination I urge the Committee to approve Mr. Aires.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Blackwell. I wanted to introduce Mr. Groover,
the current Director of Staff. Mr. Groover I saw you walk in, thank you
for being here today. Appreciate that.  Representative e Reives, I
imagine you’ve already been pre-staged to give your report.  Thank you,
you now offering a motion.  Any further questions, comments? With that,
Representative Brawley. Ya’ll draw straws over there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well what I was going to say in the interest of bipartisan cooperation
I’ll be happy to defer to Representative Reives.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Reives.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m moving that we approve the motion of House Joint Resolution 1007 and
confirming ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You want a favorable report on the PCS, unfavorable for the original?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. All those in favor, say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, the motion passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Aires.  Now in front of you is House Joint Resolution
1006, I’m sure I don’t think we have a PCS on that.  Representative
Moore you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This is, and for members to let you know, that
resolution will be added to today’s calendar for consideration as well
as the second ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Rules Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The always glad to serve the Public Utilities Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before you start Representative Moore, I  apologize, I want to recognize
we’ve got 3 member of the Utilities Commission here, they’re sitting
right here to my right. Chairman Ed Finley, Chairman Finley, Ms.
Brown-Bland, thank you for coming here, and Ms. Allen. Thank you very
much.</p>

Continue, Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. It's good to see Representative Allen here
today, so we came in as freshman a couple years ago. Good to see you
back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She looks younger than you, Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She does, she does. She chose better than I. She went
to the utilities commission, I stayed in the House. Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, it is an honor to be here today to speak on
behalf of the two nominees for the Utilities Commission. Those
individuals are James Patterson. Mr. Patterson is from Greensboro, is
also here. He's a CEO and founder of Webb Patterson Communications,
which was rebranded in 2006 as Patterson Partners Incorporated. Has a
long and distinguished history. He's very well qualified for this job
and I know will probably be coming forward in a few moments. As well as
our own Jerry Dockham, who of course seated over here to my right. And
we all know Jerry from being a colleague of ours here in the House. I'm
very proud, as a North Carolinean, that the Governor has made these two
nominations to the State Utilities Commission. And am honored to have
been asked to run these bills.
Mr. Chairman, with that being said, I don't know if you want to hear
from Representative Stein or if you want to hear directly from our
nominees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Moore, I...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know a lot of members really were looking forward to
asking a lot of questions of Representative Dockham, last I heard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I noticed they had to put Mr. Patterson, Mr.
Dockham and Mr. Patterson so we'd make sure it passed, right?
Representative, I mean for Representative Stein?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. With careful consideration, the Governor has made
these two appointments and we would hope that you, as you just did,
confirm these two appointees. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dockham, would you like to say a few
words? You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, it is with
great trepidation I come before the committee today, but Mr. Chairman, I
want to thank you for hearing this resolution and I really want to thank
Governor McCrory for his confidence in me and appointing me to this
position. And I really want to thank members of the utility for setting
utility commission to be here today. That's very kind of you to be here
in support. Members, this is kind of a bittersweet day for me. It's
sweet in that I have a new opportunity, a new challenge, which I really
look forward to and I welcome. But it's bitter that after spending 23,
almost 24 years here in the General Assembly, I'll be leaving you. But I
really am honored that the Governor chose to choose a nominee from the
House. I don't think he...he could have chose any one of you and made a
good choice. I was thinking about qualifications for this and for 23
years I've been doing exactly what you have been doing all this time.
We've been, I feel like I've been preparing for this for the past 23
years. We get all the information we can, we think about it, we make the
best decision we can and then we try to do what's best for the people of
North Carolina. And that's my pledge to you today that that's what I
will do if confirmed by this committee to the North Carolina Utilities
Commission. I appreciate your support and Mr. Chairman, I'll be glad to
make a motion, if you'd like for me to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hold on, hold on. Hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It ?? order, but...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Patterson, Mr. Patterson, will you come up and
join us, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But Mr. Chairman, you do have my biography, you have a
letter from the State Ethics Committee, you have my Statement of
Economic Interest with an addendum showing that I do not own any utility
stock and I'll be happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Apodaca, I forget to tell you, we're
going to take up 298 real quick, House Bill 298.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Patterson, would you like to tell us a little bit
about yourself?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. This is a
brand new experience for me and one that I am just honored and happy to
be able to participate in. I've spent my entire career in the private
sector so coming into government is a new experience and one where I
hope that the experience that I've had as a small business owner, the
experience that I've had working with large companies, working with many
companies in many of the industries that are very important to the
future of North Carolina. Education, healthcare, food, the whole
agribusiness sector. Many of the clothing and textile companies that
I've worked for over the years. It's important how we move forward and
keep North Carolina competitive and I'm glad to...</p>
