  Members, welcome to the committee on health. If members could take their
seats and guests retire to the rear of the committee room, we will get
started. I call the committee on health to order. Members, we do have a
few housekeeping things. We have a couple of pages with us today. I
believe I did see them, yes. We have Abby Martin sponsored by
Representative Susan Martin and Miles Hunt, sponsored by Representative
Rosa Gill. Our sergeant of arms with us today, Mr. Young Bae, Mr. Bill
Tomas, and Mr. Jim Moran. With that, we are under kind of a time
constraint here so we&#39;re gonna get right to it, and I will
relinquish this to Representative Lambeth to present his bill, House
bill 158.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister chairman. Thank you, committee members. And I will try
to make this as concise and quick as possible. There are actually two
points that I wanna make on the Jim Fulghum Teen Skin Cancer Prevention
Act. First, this bill is essentially the same bill that passed the House
with bipartisan support, 94 to 22 in our last session, so we had strong
support. It simply prohibits minors less than 18 from using indoor
tanning beds. There&#39;s growing evidence to support this change. Skin
cancer is a major public health problem, skin cancer is the most
commonly diagnosed cancer, and each year nearly 5 million people are
treated at a cost of approximately $8.1 billion. Currently, 44 states
and the District of Columbia have some law or regulation related to
indoor tanning that includes bans on indoor tanning for minors under a
certain age. Our current law requires children 13 years and older to
have a note from their parent, but that&#39;s not really not well
enforced. The second point and reason, really, for my sponsoring this
bill is my good friend, Dr. Jim Fulghum, who I think most of you
remember. He was very passionate about this. He and I had many
conversations about this bill before he even introduced it. We came in
as freshman, and his passion for this and really wanting to leave a
lasting legacy is really the reason I put my name on this bill. I felt
like it was a great way for us to remember Jim and his passion for this
particular issue. In fact, the funny story is, you may remember, he
wanted to vote it out off the floor and get it on over to Senate as
quick as he could. This does have the endorsement of many healthcare
organizations, including the American Cancer Society and the North
Carolina Dermatology Association, and we have a number of healthcare
professionals here from dermatology, American Cancer Society, and I just
ask you all to stand to show your support for this particular bill.
Answer any questions that might, yes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just at the appropriate time for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Any other questions from the members? Representative Carney,
it looks like that is the time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and thank you Representative Lambeth for bringing this back to
us. It is an important issue and I agree with the naming of it because
Jim did, this was a passion for him, and so with that, mister chairman,
I move that we give House bill 158, the Jim Fulghum Teen Skin Cancer
Prevention Act a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, you have heard the motion before you. All in favor say aye. All
opposed no. The ayes seem to have it and the ayes do have it. The bill
passes with a referral nowhere. Perfect. Seeing no further business
before the House, we are now adjourned.
