CHANGES]
Madam Chair and members of the committee, we are going to begin with the
money report. So this is the report of the continuation of the expansion
budgets. If you would please turn to J1 of the document. Overall
spending for the general government agencies is 417.8 million and that's
a slight decrease over the 14-15 certified budget. We will walk you
through the changes that is being proposed in the house budget. Items
one and two are standard throughout all of the agencies and this is the
compensation increase of a $1000 annually recurring. As well as the
benefits totaling approximately $1,236 per employee. So for the
department of cultural resources, that is a total of 778,215 on a
recurring basis. Item number two is the state retirement system
contributions. That's 155,620 on a recurring basis. And item number 3 is
historic publications. You heard a little bit about this before when we
discussed the senate's budget. So it's a reduction to staff within the
historical locations unit. It's 247,449 on a recurring basis, and an
elimination of four staff. There remains about 3 positions within that
unit and 173,484 that continue what's required in the law for them to
do. Item number 4 is a position elimination, it's an education
coordinator. This was the same that was in the senate's budget, 63,870.
1 position eliminated. Item number 5 is an item proposed in the house
budget, it's funding for strategic marketing, so this continues an item
that was funded on a non-recurring basis in the current year. It's for
the online calendar, the social media, contract for its attractions and
so forth. So it's 43,000 recurring, slightly less than what was put into
the budget on a non-recurring basis this year. The next item, number 6,
is reduction to the museum of History. The history museums, 114,961 on a
recurring basis. There is a special-- this is a 2% reduction -- and
there's a special provision that goes along with this, that directs
that-- the department of cultural resources may not close the gateway,
the mountain gateway museum. Item number 7 is a library grant. This is a
2% reduction, it was in both the governor's budget and the senate's
budget. There is a special provision going along with this to cap the
single county or municipal grants to 400,000. So there are only two
counties that will be impacted by this reduction and that's Wake and
Maklemburg countys. Item number 8 is a house proposed item. It was also
in the governor's budget at a little bit higher level. 400,000 recurring
for ?? Palace and that's in addition to the 100,000 you gave them,
non-recurring for next year.</p>

The Governor’s budget had requested about 550,000 so it’s a little bit
less than what was in the Governor’s budget but this brings their total
operating state appropriations to three million. J3 is the ___[00:14]
Commission this is a 2% reduction so it’s 9,000 on recurring basis at
least 441,000. J4 begins the Department of Insurance, and items 10 and
11 are the salary and retirement contributions and adjustments. Item
number 12 is an operations reduction within the division of
administration it’s 20,000 on a recurring basis. Item 13 is position
eliminations a slight modification of what was in the Governor’s budget
but the same is what was in the Senate’s budget so it eliminates 7.8
fulltime equivalent position some filled some vacant for the savings of
433,955. J5 item 14 is over realize reseats, this is reseats collected
from collection agencies but also it takes out some other reseats that
have still been budgeted but are no longer being collected, the
Governor’s budget had a million dollars in here but here you say this
amount is 200,000 as same what was in the Senate’s budget. So, it looks
that there is reseats that they are not really collecting within the
budget there is that are off the books and that’s out for the 200,000.
Item number 15 is a reduction to these line items communications
printing and some other 200,000 reduction within the office of the state
fire Marshall, the remains about 800,000 in those accounts. And item J6,
this is an item opposed here by the house and this is an increase to the
interims regulatory surcharge it would go from 6% to 6.5% and the
additional amount to be generated would be approximately 2.4 million on
a regular basis. There is a special provision that we will talk about
that goes with along with this as well. Now, I’m turning to J8 the State
Board of Elections, item 16 and 17 are the retirement salary
contributions, item 18 is a contract elimination of 117,415 this was in
the Governor’s budget as well as the Senate’s budget and this is where
the State Board of Elections is bringing some of their previously
contracted data services in-house. Item 19, these are investigated
positions this is a new item for these budgets, it was not in the
Governor’s or the Senate’s so this would be an additional three
positions that 201,657 to investigate fraud in elections, discrepancies
in voter registration inflammation and so forth. Turning to J9 the
General Assembly 20 and 21 are the reserves for salaries and benefits,
item 22 is the General Government Oversight Committee and this is
funding for several meetings throughout the interim, this was an item
also when the Senate’s budget and there is a special provision it goes
along with this. Item 23 is a modification of what was in the Senate’s
budget it’s a reduction to operations within the Information Systems
Division of the General Assembly, this is a non-recurring cut, the
Senate’s budget headed in 750,000 but looking more at that budget it
looks like there will be less potential carry forward for this year so
that’s been reduced to 600,000. J10 is a health insurance mandate study
this is a new item for the house so it provides funding for the General
Assembly to wish your request for information from consulting firms to
look at the potential impacts of the insurance mandate requirements on
providers, individuals, and the states economy in general and there is
500,000 on a non-recurring basis for that. Item 25 is the youth of
General Assembly so this transfers the program from the Department of
Administrations that Youth Involvement Division that provides one
position to the General Assembly for you to operate the Youth General
Assembly program so that’s a transfer of 56,833 recurring. Moving to J11
to the office of the governor, 26 and 27 are the reserves for the
salaries and benefits, item 28 is another transfer from the Department
of Administration which is the Youth Internship Program this has been
transferred to the office of the Governor one position and some
operating funds of 254,974 and all of that would be transfer to continue
to manage the internship program. Item 29 is a management flexibility
reduction of 103,442 this item was also in the Governor’s budget, the
Senate ___[04:52] but this is the same cut in the same level as it was
in the Governor’s budget. Moving on to…

<p id="010:00">
12 state budget of management, again, items 30 and 31 are the reserves
for the salaries and benefits. 32 is a position elimination of a grant's
assistant that you have heard about before that was in the senate’s
budget and also the govern’s budget, so one position being eliminated ??
of 50,584 savings. Item 33 is a contract reduction within technology and
data services of $100,000 on a recurring basis which would still leave
them about $587,000 in that account for 14/15. Item J13, this is an item
that was in the govern’s budget, it was not in the senate’s budget and
this is a grant in aid to the North Carolina humanities council, so
their  grant in aid level is $20,000 and this would eliminate that grant
in aid on an recurring basis. J14, moving on to the auditor, 35 and 36
are the salaries and benefit reserves. Item 37 is an operations
reduction to be taken agency wide $37,000 on a recurring basis from
travel, lodging telephone, services, those types of line items. And Mr.
Chairman I’m happy to, Madam Chair, I'm happy to take questions if you
want to now or we can.
(SPEAKER CHANGES) I do, put your hand??
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Yes
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Questions, comments from the committee
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Representative Harrision
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Thank you Madam Chair. Would you mind telling me on
item number 34, does that leave any appropriation to  ?? council
(SPEAKER CHANGES)No, Representative Harrison it does not. It’s J13, item
34. So currently what’s in the budget on a recurring basis is $20,000
and this totally eliminates it. It was reduced last year, the year
before, somewhat and that was the remaining amount.
(SPEAKER CHANGES) I thank you
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Questions comments? Any further ones? Ok.
Representative Pittman
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Hi. On J2 ?? The $4,000. I was there in February and
they were showing us very bad needs of repair. Are they going be able to
approach getting them done within the ?? same appropriation they had?
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Representative Pittman this would not include any
types of repairs or renovations, they are using these funds for
operating and paying for positions, and I’m not familiar with any
potential projects
(SPEAKER CHANGES) That would probably be a concern with me. ? I have to
say I’d love to see all kind of types of things eventually be
self-supported, but they got to keep standing there if we are going to
get there.  Thank you.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Further questions from the committee? Representative
Ross
(SPEAKER CHANGES) J item 2.  The start of the ?? If I understood it
correctly, ?? there will be 4 position eliminated leaving 3. Is that
correct?
(SPEAKER CHANGES) That’s correct
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Whether they were ??  balance, as long as they are
reoccurring, is that correct?
(SPEAKER CHANGES) That’s correct
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Representative Queen
(SPEAKER CHANGES) I just want to follow up on that ?? This isn’t a big
division, but they’ve done terrific work over the years for the state.
?? I’m just ??
(SPEAKER CHANGES) This was in the original??
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Is there any analysis of why this was done?
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Let us get some information for you
(SPEAKER CHANGES) My general comment would be that there’s a lot of work
to be done on the district pay for North Carolina and they are the ones
that are doing the publications, communicating and educating the public
(SPEAKER CHANGES) I will tell you that this was in the senate’s budget.
This identical provision that went in last week
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Representative Queen there are very specific
requirements that are laid out   in General statue 21.4 on what the
department of Cultural Resources aught be doing regarding publications,
one item includes the Governs papers for example</p>

<p id="015:00">
That is something that’s specifically laid out. The department has had
reductions in the past and they have taken some reductions in this area,
so for instance, that’s one thing that’s put on hold. Right now when you
go to their website, it shows that that one’s on hold. Some other
requirements. And so producing the papers of the Governor, they do a
part of that, but then the funds for the editorial assistants, printing,
bonding, distribution, that kind of thing, comes from a different fund
not within the Department of Cultural Resources, and again, that’s an
item not being completed right now. Another requirement is to edit and
publish a second or new series of the most significant records of
colonial North Carolina. So there are just a few things that are
explicit. There are lots of broad categories, publications of suitable
histories of all the counties and other appropriate materials. They
provide a historical review that you can subscribe to and those are
produced quarterly. So there are lots of things going on that they’re
doing, few specific requirements in the law. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. On page
J8, under Investigator Positions, is this a new position, the 201
thousand C57? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am. Representative Fisher, this
would be new positions added to the Board of Elections. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And then a follow-up? On the Information Systems Division, can
you tell me more about what was eliminated with that item? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Within the General Assembly? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Within Board of
Elections. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Board of Elections. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry, same page. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Same page. This one… they had been
contracting with a third party entity to provide their data information,
the election returns and so forth. They brought all of that in house, so
this is the savings from the elimination of that contract. So this is
following a practice that’s already in place. It’s just taking the cut.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And one last follow-up on that same couple of items
there. Where will the new positions come from for that investigative
position, or for the investigative positions? Are they going to be from
outside or within the department or…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] They will just
go through the regular recruitment process, whether or not they go about
in or how they go about hiring, but it will be just through the state’s
regular recruitment process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Anyone else? Representative Cunningham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
want to go back to that investigators on page J8. On those investigators
??, I heard what Representative Fisher was saying, were they going to be
hired in or without the state, and I’m not sure where are they going to
be coming from and if there’s a background qualifications for these
positions, since they’re going to be paying about 60 thousand dollars
per person per piece, and if they’re going to be travelling
investigators. Can we find that information out? [SPEAKER CHANGES] What
I can tell you is this of course is at the request of the head of the
state Board of Elections because she feels as though she needs these
positions, and then you can answer… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair, if I
may. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. You are recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] These
three positions were… actually, they requested five positions, the state
board of elections did. They have investigations languishing over there
that are several years old that they’re been trying to get finished and
they haven’t got them finished. This isn’t just for quote-on-quote
“voter fraud”; it is to give them the ability to do their campaign
finance work in addition to other things, is what these three
investigators are for. They’re going to be hired through the normal
process; they will be vetted in any same way as any other investigators
hired for the Board of Elections. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you want…? Did
you have anything to add to that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, ma’am. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any follow-up? Representative ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just
sort of concerned about the continued cut in positions for the
Department of Insurance on J4, pages 5 and 13 ?? positions. I remember
last year’s budget, we had a dozen I think eliminated. We’re in an
environment where insurance is a more and more contiguous service.
Customer service is a bigger and bigger concern. There’s a lot of
changes, not only…</p>

Affordable Care Act within the property insurance. We haven’t had a
hurricane lately, but let us have one and we’re going to be struggling.
What do we really save here? I understand that these are fee supported
positions, how does that help the general fund? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen this is actually a reduction to their overall
budget. These positions were in the Governor’s budget. The list was
provided by DOI. Last year there were the 9 positions eliminated and
there were some issues around that. And the department of insurance has
asked for some flexibility and so forth then. I don’t know if they’re
asking for that now but this list was provided. And the way that the
department of insurance is funded is that it’s funded through the
regulatory surcharge. So the regulatory surcharge comes in within the
department of revenue. It’s deposited in a special account within the
department of insurance, and then they’re up-fronted in appropriation.
DOI’s up-fronted the appropriation from the General Assembly, and then
DOI repays the general fund, plus interest. And I think that’s what
you’re talking about with the fee piece. But ideally, the whole
operations of DOI would impact what that surcharge is set at. And as the
costs go down to DOI, that rate is looked at every year. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is your question answered? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s answered to a
point. I’m just, my concern is the need is great, and we’re cutting
their staff off, right and left. And I just wonder why we’re doing that.
I have some thoughts but I just want to take government out of our
government committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Other comments, questions from
the committee. ?? We thank you very much. ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good
morning, I’m Daniel Sater with the fiscal research division. I’ll begin
on page J16 with department of revenue. Items 38 and 39 are the salary
and retirement increases. Item 40 is an actual office space increase.
This was in the Governor and the Senate budget. There were new IRS
regulations about physical building security so the department had to
upgrade their lease. Item 41 was in both Senate and Governor’s budget,
is transferring operating expenses over to receipt support. The receipts
are going on to the collection assistance fee. That’s the 20% surcharge
leveed on overdue taxes. Item 42, this is a slight modification of a
Senate item. It eliminates 9 vacant positions. 7 of these have been
vacant for over 300 days. Item 43, local government division positions.
This adds 5 positions to the local government division, to help local
government auditing non profits and governmental units in auditing their
refund requests. It’s $400,000 recurring and $600,000 non-recurring
spent. The money for this will come from receipts collected on
apartment, on the local sales and use tax receipts. This is in both the
Senate and the Governor’s budget. Item 44 is a transfer over from the
department of transportation. OSBM, transportation and revenue have all
agreed that this program should be housed within revenue. The ?? tax
project and it allows revenue to pay for expenditures related to the
project. And that’s just under $800,000 recurring and this money comes
from property tax collections collected by the division of motor
vehicles. On J17, the special fund for the project to collect tax. This
is the account for the collection assistance fee. The first item you see
is the locator services, this was a modification of the Governor and the
Senate item. This sets the cap at $250,000 for locator services. The
next item, the taxpayer assistance call center. This is a modification
of the Governor’s proposal. It was not in the Senate’s budget. It
appropriates just under $4 million recurring for 50 positions to open a
second taxpayer assistance call center in Guilford County. It’s about
half of what the department had requested. The next item, criminal
investigation division special agent. This is a modification of the
Governor and Senate item, authorizes the department of revenue to hire 2
new special agents to pursue individuals and businesses with overdue tax
debts. And again, all this money is coming out of the collection
assistance fee so none of these items will have a general fund impact.</p>

<p id="025:00">
The last item on this page, collection e-service. This transfers the
money over to a different special fund, which I'll talk about in a
moment, it's going over to the I-task replacement project. On page J-18
the first item, this was in both the Governor and the Senate. This
provides the department the 1.4 million dollars non-recurring to upgrade
the technology at the current Rocky Mountain Call Center. The next item,
ABC permit tax compliance program, some software purchases to allow
commerce and DoR to ensure that all applicants for retail ABC permits
have paid all of their taxes. The last item you see, operating expenses,
this is the transfer over that you saw on the general fund code, so
we're decreasing the general fund appropriation and it increases the
money that is spent out of their special fund. Next on page J-20,
collections case management, this authorizes the department to spend 5
million dollars nonrecurring out of the I-task replacement code which is
a combination of the TIMS benefit stream, some general fund
appropriations, and collections assistance fee money. This is what we
had, the General Assembly had been paying for, for TIMS, this is what's
going to be the next portion of the TIMS replacement so it allows the
department to spend 5 million dollars to implement a collections case
management program. Collection e-service, this is what I spoke to just a
moment ago. This is a transfer over from the collections assistance fee
fund. That will allow the department to implement an e-garnishment
system, to automate management of the garnishment process to be 7.5
million dollars, nonrecurring. The last item tax impression management
system funding. This is maintenance of the portions of TIMS that the
department did receive from the TIMS contract, to be 11 million dollars,
nonrecurring. This is, all of these three items were in the Senate
budget. On page J-21, the two items you see here are technical fixes to
the certified budget. When the budget was certified last year, the
contract was CGI the former TIMS vendor was still in place so the
General Assembly had to fix the certified budget to, yes thank you, to
reflect the changes we've made in the current budget. Just can't think
of words. On page J-22, the first two items you see, 45 and 46 are the
combination retirement increases. Item 47,this is the modification of a
send item, the Senate had eliminated three positions in the publications
division. The house budget gives this as a management flexibility
deduction. Item 48 is identical to the Senate budget, it eliminates two
vague additions in the corporations division. On page J-23, first two
items are the salary and retirement, the next item is from the Governor
and the Senate's, it's operating expense reductions, this is a 2% cut to
the Lieutenant Governor's office. On page J-24, first two items are
compensation increases. Item number 54 is a slight change from the
Senate and the Governor's, there is a technical fix, one of the
positions numbers had to be changed, but the amount is the same as in
the Senate and the House. Item 55 is the operating budget, just
appropriates 173,000 dollars to decrease the transfer that is going from
one of the Controller's special funds into their general fund.
Currently, their transferring just over ??,000 dollars from a special
fund into their general fund operating. This decreases their transfer by
173,000 dollars. Item 56, this is a new item. It extends the hardware on
the Beacon, it extends the warranty on the Beacon hardware through July
of 2015 to 130,000 dollars, nonrecurring. Item 57 was in both the Senate
and the Governor's budget. It provides money for the ongoing maintenance
the cash manager program, it's 180,000 dollars, recurring. Item 58 is a
contract increase, it provides 21,000 dollars to pay for our contract
increase for Oracle software licensing fees. Item 59, this was in both
the Governor and Senate budgets, operating budget reductions, it's
520,000 dollars. Item 60 was in the Governor's budget but not in the
Senate budget. There was a contractual inflationary lease increase for
the Bush street building where the Controller's office is. Item 61, this
was in both the Senate and the Governor's</p>

It’s another contract increases the hundred thousands dollars. On page
J26 the special funds of state controller the first item is the Federal
and Trans contribution act savings, this transfers 5.255 million dollars
non-recurring problem that fund to the general fund and the next item
operating budget just with the second half of an item you saw just a
moment ago this decreases the amount but it’s taken out of this fund by
110,000 dollars every years because the General Assembly is
appropriating that through the General Fund Appropriations.

Questions from the committee, Mr. ___[00:45] any questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ford…
[Background Conversation]
The call centers…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is on page J17, if you want.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The ___[01:12] is selected due to the ability of the local community
college that provide training and they have been providing training and
there are numerous other call centers in that area presently and the
support for the call center locally with the employees and educational
backgrounds and what not was the best choice to understand I think.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s the one I think say private funds ___[01:50] if there is not
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is one, there is currently in the Rocky Mount and then the Greens
___[01:57] will be second.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, if there are not probably.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions from the committee, Representative ___[02:05].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, just like the little information on the J26, transfer problem
with the ___[02:13] and talking about savings I think ___[Inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The savings what J26, first item, this transfer going to general ability
the ___[02:26] fund has built up a balance, it’s the money in that
account comes from what the state saves when it doesn’t pay to payroll
tax if employees select, if employees enter into flex plans to pay for
health care and travel expenses. So, if you are employee like he puts in
$1000 into this flex plan then I save on the payroll tax of that $1000
but the state saves on their half of the payroll tax as well and that
money goes into this fund and it builds up balance overtime. So, just
transferring about 5.2 million dollars out of that fund and putting
towards your health and other availability and it’s not correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions or comments from the community?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[Inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
[Background Conversation]
Good morning, good morning it’s Mark Bonder with this research and we
are gonna be starting on page J28 under the Department of
Administration. As you have seen item 62, 63 are the compensation
increases for employees, item 64 is variation on the Senate budget
instead of eliminating 10 specific positions, it gives the department
flexibility and what positions it eliminate the dollar amount remains
the same. Item 64, the modification of the Governor’s budget that also
included in the Senate budget this is reductions to various departments
or divisions within the Department of Administration. Item 66, this is a
transfer the general government budget is transferring the great crises
program, the domestic violence center and domestic violence center fund
to the Department of Public Safety also with the Domestic Violence
Commission, the Commission of Domestic Violence, there are no cuts to
any of the grand programs or any of the administration and this transfer
is a total transfer. The account will remain with the Department of
Administration. Item 67, this is reduction with general ____[04:37]
services contract this was in the Senate budget as well as the
Governor’s budget. Item 68, this is same as in the Senate reduction to
utilities expenditures within the Department of Administration. Item 69,
this is the same as in Senate Budget this was an operation reductions
for the offices came in human resources, any questions on…

Office of State Human Resources to Lisa Hallowell. Item 70, this is a
reduction of the learning management system. Last year there was
appropriated money for a learning management system and this reduces the
spending closer to actual. Item 71 is a position elimination within the
Office of Human Resources. State Ethics, this is a slight change to the
Governor's budget but same as in the senate. It's a reduction of
operating expenses to the State Ethics Commission. And Daniel Sader will
be the one covering any detailed ethics questions. Item 73, this is the
same as in the Senate budget. It's the elimination to the Aid to County
Veteran's Services Offices. This is a grant program that goes back to
County Administration for various Veteran's services that they provide.
Item 74, is a technical fix. It was in the Governor's budget and in the
senate budget. This basically allows the Veteran's homes to operate at
their current budget with the opening of two new Veteran's homes. Item
75, you heard about when Lisa Hollowell presented the general assembly's
budget and the Governor's budget. This is the transfer of the Youth
Internship and Youth Legislature program. With this transfer, one
position will be going to Governor's office along with the funding for
the internships and relevant funding for operations to run the
internship program out of the Governor's office. One position will be
going to the General Assembly to run the Youth Legislature or Youth
General Assembly as it will be called. And three positions are
eliminated. Page J31, this is a new item. It's a reduction to the
e-Commerce reserve on a non-recurring basis. 2.13 million dollars will
be transferred to general availability. Page 33, this was in the senate
budget also and the Governor's budget. This is a technical fix for the
Veteran's Trust Fund. This just appropriates funds from the Veteran's
Trust Funds to the Department of Administration's budget to run the
Veteran's Homes and adjust receipts. Page J35, again this is a technical
fix. It was in the Governor's budget and also in the senate budget. This
appropriates funds for the Motor Fleet Management to get Motor Fleet
back on its normal replacements cycle and also add them to expend funds
that they collect. Page J37, temporary solutions. This is a technical
fix. It allows temporary solutions within the Office of State Human
Resources to expend funds that they collect for the provision of
temporary services. Page J39, again another technical fix to a special
fund page. This was in the Governor's budget also in the senate budget.
Allows State Park and system to expend funds that they collect and also
adjust receipts accordingly to essentially to true up their budget. Page
J41, The Housing Finance Agency. This budget in its entirety is the same
as the senate budget. Item 66 reduces the Home match by 2%. The Home
Match Program is a program funded from the federal government from the
Housing and Urban development department. And it is essentially block
grant program for housing that the states receive. And the states have
to put up a 25% match. Item 77, reduces the Housing Trust Fund recurring
appropriation by 2%. Item 78, is the Workforce Housing Loan program.
This creates a low income housing program within the housing finance
agency that will connect with and sort of mirror the old, expiring State
Low Income Housing tax credit. Next page, page J42, Office of
Administrative Hearings. Again this budget, with obvious changes to the
compensation, is the same as in the senate budget. Item 81, this is an
operations reduction to the department through various line items that
you see below. Page J43, this is the treasurer's budget. Item 82 and 83
are compensation adjustments. Item 84 was in the senate budget and a
modification of the Governor's budget. This is a reduction in operations
to the Financial Operations Division. Item 85 is a modification of what
was in the senate budget. This appropriates nine new positions within
the Investments Division to reduce the expenditure on 3rd party vendor
contracts within that department to internalize investment operations.
The hope there is that we will save potentially on contracts that are
being used to manage the state's investments. Item J44, is a new item. A
couple of years ago with the state, the state created a 403b plan for
teachers which allows for, essentially it's a 401k plan that is.</p>

. . . given to educators. There is going to be a need for some start-up
funds in order to manage the contract with TIAA-CREF. And so what this
will do is it will allow the transfer of funds from the Qualified Access
Benefits arrangement, which is a fund within the Treasury and within
Retirement System to be used to fund these start-up cost. The funds will
be repaid over a longer period of time back into the fund. Page J-45,
this is a new item, this is the Blount Street properties. Within the
Treasurer's office, there is about 5.4 million dollar fund that's made
up of proceeds of the sale of the Blount Street properties. This reduces
that amount by 2.4 million non-recurring and transfers it into general
availability. I believe, back in 2003, the Blount Street bills passed
regarding the sale of Blount Street properties. Up to 5 million dollars
of that sale was to be appropriated to this fund for the provision of
maintaining the Governor's mansion. Right now, after 5 million dollars
was deposited in the fund, it has grown to 5.4 million dollars, and 2.4
was taken out.  Page J-47, Fire, Rescue, National Guard and Pensions
item, this is a Salaries and Benefits item, but I will report on what is
happening here. The Firefighters' Pension Fund is the same as in the
Senate. This allows for a reduction based on the annual required
contribution, but again it allows for the increase in benefits to the
Firefighters Pension. National Guard, this reflects a change. There is a
reduction, but it's less than it was in the Senate budget, because it
allows for an increase for up 5 dollars per month for retirees benefits.
Item 89 is the same as in the Senate. This reduces the Rescue Squad
Pension Workers Fund on the same basis, on the annual required
contribution, but also allows for a benefit increase, as was in the
Senate budget. And that concludes the General Government Budget, and I'm
happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions? Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madame Chair.  I have several questions.
The first question is how much altogether has Gen Gov contributed to the
general availability this time around?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A lot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A whole lot?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A whole lot.
SPEAKER CHANGES] We don't have a whole lot to start with. This is pretty
disturbing to me. We're looking at, I don't know, how many millions of
dollars we've been able to scrounge up for general availability. Any
round figures on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We had . . .  if I may, Madame Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess, Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We initially were going to take the 5.2 million FICA
monies . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] . . . and we've had done this in the past to help our
budget with non-recurring cost. In our first meeting with the ??, we
were told that that was their money, we couldn't use it. So we had to go
shopping for some money or do some drastic reductions. And in shopping
for the money, we came up with the two sources that you've heard. And
hopefully going forward. Those two sources are going to dry up quickly
if we have to use them again, and hopefully going forward for
non-recurrent cost, we'll be able to dip where we've been dipping in the
past.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher has got 9.7 million dollars
general bill money.
SPEAKER CHANGES] Going back to page J-29 - and you knew I would ask you
about this - Item number 66, I know that this was in the works, that
this has been a conversation ongoing for awhile, about the transfer of
these funds to ?? public safety, but tell me, is this a new House item?
Did it originate in the Senate or the Governor, or. . . ?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Ma'am, this is a new House item. This was not in
the Senate's budget and it was not in the Governor's budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you tell me what the thinking was behind it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The JPS part of our government, they have grants and
funds to mirror what the domestic violence people do, and the main
thought behind it was, to put it all together so everyone understands
what funds are available, where they're coming from, and just get a
handle on the total program and not have it basically working out of two
agencies, two areas.</p>

The council for women has been administering these programs for quite
some time. And I'm wondering now what funds will be available to the
council of women for the programs that they've been administrating for
years and years.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The council for wom-- go ahead, Jim. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am, so the council for women will no longer administer -- It
will be in the special provisions -- but the council for women will no
longer administer any grant programs. They will remain intact to advise
the state on activities within that council. But the grant programs for
rape prices and domestic violence will be moved underneath the
department public safety. The department of public safety will also
receive the domestic violence commission under the provision and they
will be, they will be allowed to administer and place where those grant
programs go, sort of where they see best for them to go.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]
So, will the council for women now be put in the position of having to
apply for grants in the department of public safety, for the programs
that they have in place to help women, families, children; as they've
been doing for some time now?[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am, potentially if they were to start offering those sorts of
programs, should the house budget become law, and they would need to
find sources of funds to provide those programs.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And then one last follow-up. This leads me to a question about the
displaced homemaker program. There is a program that has been happening
all across the state that yes, women or other family members back on
their feet after a loss of a spouse or if for some reason someone has to
return to school, or do some sort of career prep to get back into the
workforce, where are those funds?[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am, last year that program was eliminated in the budget. It was
on a phased elimination, so this current fiscal year it received a
lesser amount from the divorce filing fee. Next year where you see
nothing from the divorce filing fee, so as a result, that program did
not transfer in the special provision and the elimination of that would
take place. The total divorce filing fee that was collected for the
displaced homemakers and the domestic violence center, that total fee
will transfer to domestic violence with this transfer. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, I thought that was my last question. This is just really disturbing
to me. And I guess the reason I have so many questions is that I'm
wondering now how will these programs be funded that have always been
able to go to the council for women, will they now go to the department
of safety with these kinds of issues?[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am, that's correct. The statues that followed these programs, so
the opp-- what they have been operating now under current statues and
administrative rule will transfer a type to the department of public
safety. There will be no change, or should be no change, in how they are
funded. The requirements for who is eligible for funding will remain
exactly the same, and statue once they go to the department safety. Now
in terms of the administration of, you know, forms and that sort of
thing, that obviously could change depending on how the department of
public safety would choose to manage those items. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Harrison[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. Work on -- page on Item number 68. ?? So, I
guess state construction isn't from the administration’s bill?[SPEAKER
CHANGES]
Yes, that's correct.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is this utility setting a result of the requirement that our state
government buildings be more energy efficient? ?? Do you know?[SPEAKER
CHANGES]
Ma'am, I don't believe that is probably a requirement -- or a result of
this. Essentially the state budgets -- the state budgets what's called a
certified budget. So the budget that you’ll pass will be the certified
budget for the state. When OSBM then administers the budget, they issue
what's called an authorized budget. So normally their authorized budget
is done at a level much below the certified budget for utilities. And
looking over the past 3-4 years of expenditures, the state has not
expended the amount of the certified budget in utilities. So it has been
just sitting there and reverting back, so we're cutting that closer to
actual -- is it a result of utility savings? I would probably hazard a
guess</p>

...say no, the only building that we have that really would have fallen
underneath that rubric would have been the Green Square building, the
other buildings in the state government complex have not received a
whole lot of R&amp;R or refurbishment since that bill passage. So
potentially for that one building for Green Square that might be the
case, but probably, state complex wise, I say no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions from the committee? Representative Floyd?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh goodness.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My first question, my first one is [??]... and that's the [??] hundred
and thirty-eight dollars for the county. Given the [??] across the
nation, as it relates to [??], you know I would really like to see that
money somehow remain. There's an article in our paper today saying [??]
the state impatient trying to get some kind of assistance from out DA.
This program is very important.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, I can respond to that too and we'll let Mr. Vaughn
do as well. That's just- it's a very small amount of money to each
county, it's almost negligible, and we've had to look so hard, I
understand your point fully. I really do. And it's a shame, but that's
what we had to do. You haven't- you want to respond to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know, we talked about- I mean, I know it's like four thousand
dollars per county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, it's not even that much
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's not that much. It's a little over a thousand, isn't it? A little
over a thousand?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Eight hundred, nine hundred dollars. Six hundred dollars
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we talked about this last year. We almost eliminated it last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We talked about it. We attempted to keep this military [??] and I think
that it would really help that if we- some kind of way looked through
this and see if we can't find a hudred thirty-eight thousand dollar
investment, that's just something that I expected from [??] The other-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I expect to request that we look at that in some kind of way and I would
totally appreciate  it if [??] across this day [??] county that provides
this valuable service. The other is, the total of [??]... the total
amount of money that was appropriated day one, and now day two, what is
it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lisa? Do you have that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You said Lisa? The total, [??] now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What's the change in-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??] - general government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
General government: It was about 900,000 decrease from the start of 5 14
15 budget. So it's less than a 1% increase, [??] 2-3 percent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Paula?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Paula?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tell the position to eliminate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The title position was eliminated...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thirty
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thirty-five
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thirty-five positions, and that should not include the transfered
positions to other departments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Total positions created?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will be twelve positions, three for state board of elections and nine
for the treasurer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And there're positions we're creating in [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ah, that's right, and there are positions in revenue that are
non-general fund funded.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And my third, my last question is, somebody can help me here, raised the
question at the last meeting [??] fifty-six thousand dollars, and I was
trying to [??] to see if I can find an attorney in the district. [??]...
drop off
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that, Representative Floyd, that it was in the Department of
Administration's budget, it was a vacant position. The Department of
Administration had filled a number of those positions, or had offers out
to them, so that was...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know I didn't see it, that was just...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's when they got the flexible...

Further questions? Representative Cunningham
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
J-29, I [??]... I understand you said that the home the [??] home [??]
was told the council of women would actually function on their own now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mm-hmm.

Okay, so if this, the transfer of the [??] price [??]... to go into the
GPI, or the DPS or whatever, will that staff be going with him because
they are specialized in that field?

There’s 14 people. The entire staff is going over. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions? Representative Queen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] just a general question so I understand what we’re
doing. On page J 37, the Temporary Solutions of Budget Adjustment, we’re
adding almost 22 million dollars to Temporary Solutions this year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen, this is a result of a Governor’s
executive order that requires all agencies to utilize Temporary
Solutions. Before not all of them were utilizing it, and now because
this is a temporary service agency, so this is fixing the budget where
there are so many more agencies utilizing it. That’s the increase. The
money’s coming from the rest of state government, these other agencies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is Temporary Solutions a state agency? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
It’s within the office of state Human Resources. It’s a placement
agency. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And so you’re consolidating what each agency
was doing on their own under this administrative group? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. The executive order requires almost all of the agencies to
utilize this service. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And
what has been the history of this sort of Temporary Solutions-type
spending? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well the budget you see before us at about
the 20 million was probably the level it’s been at the last few years.
There’s a special provision in here for ya’ll to consider that’s being
proposed that would look at Temporary Solutions, the surcharge that it
has on agencies, what it actually pays for and how many staff it has,
try to compare it with a private outside entity, and for this study
though, I have some recommendations for ya’ll to consider next year. So
I think the proposal is to try to look at and get into the Temporary
Solutions operation, to get a better handle on it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
further questions? Seeing none, we’ll go to special provisions. Ms. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair and members, if you will turn to the first
page of your special provisions document – it’s actually page 192, and
these first ones relate to the Department of Cultural Resources, and
section 19.2 follows the money, and this further explains the cap on the
grants for the library program. So it caps the grants – it’s a municipal
or single-county library grant – at 400 thousand; again, only effecting
Wake and Mecklenburg Counties. 19.4, this is a new item in the House
budget; was not in the Senate’s budget but was in the Governor’s budget.
So this is Queen Anne’s Revenge Project special fund, so this is an
accounting-type special provision. It allows the Office of State Budget
and Management, or requires them, to create a special fund to house any
funds that come in – any receipts, donations and so forth – from the
Queen Anne’s Revenge Project. So these funds, once they’re deposited in
this account, they would become non-reverting. It is a special fund.
19.5, this builds upon a special provision the law changed that was in
your budget for the current year last year. Ya’ll exempted the
Department of Cultural Resources from some fees, and now this includes
the operating hours so that they can actually set the operating hours at
the various historic sites based on the needs of that site, and exempt
them from the rule-making which can sometimes be time-consuming. Page
193, 19.6. As I mentioned earlier, this prevents the Department of
Cultural Resources from closing the Mountain Gateway Museum during the
14-15 year because the history division had taken a two percent
reduction there. 19.7 is a new one with the House. This is budget
integrity This is directing the Office of State Budget and Management in
the development of the biennial budget for 15-17 to look at those
under-funded line items within DCR, specifically within archives and
records, historic preservations and personal services, and to fix those
budget line items. There are several issues related to specific…</p>

…Whereas the personal services maybe budgeted at one level and it
doesn’t match the appropriation. So, there are some things that need to
be changed, one item that was in the Governor’s budget was some funding
to fix this but this direction is for them for always be into fix it in
the development of the continuation budget. Often times there are things
are covered in a continuation budget. 19.8 this modifies the roles
around the ___[00:30] commission and it brings it more into the
department of cultural resources and eliminates it from being a stable
owner independent commission and 194 and 195 are the changes to that,
low change and moving over to 196 as well, 197 also we are hearing
establishes a few more exempt positions within the ___[00:59] Commission
they at the bottom or at the middle of the page, the Executive Director,
Assistant Directors and Curator shall be exempt from the personal.
Moving down to 197 to the Department of Insurance, this raises the
insurance regulatory surcharge rate from 6 to 6.5% beginning January,
2015 and it also adds an eligible expense to the regulatory surcharge on
198 at the top to the list that already exist for this fund. Now, on
line six it says that the appropriated to the North Carolina Industrial
Commission for support of the commissions duties. So, there are some
fees that are going away for businesses regarding worker’s ___[01:50] in
the industrial commission and the funds will be able to be utilized from
the insurance regulatory surcharge for the industrial commission and
that would begin July, 2015. Section 22.1 creates the Joint Legislative
Committee on General Government and this follows the money and is
slightly different than what was in the Senate’s budget. Page 200 is
study in the cost of the health insurance mandates this follows the
money item for the general assembly of 500,000 on a non-recurring basis.
So, we still look at what is the impact of the mandates, the cost
impacts of the mandates on all of these different entities, the 500,000
was specifically be used to look at assessing the feasibility and cost
of the study so the General Assembly will be looking at what it’s gonna
take to complete the study because there are so many pieces to it. And
then on page 201, this is the office of State Human Resources 22A
discontinues the use of the automatic exploring and screening of
applicants for the State Government employment. Item 22A.2 is a review
of the temporary solutions and Representative ___[03:05]lays out exactly
what the study would include looking at the surcharge, looking at the
administrate structure that currently exist with temporary solutions
maybe making some recommendations or the surcharge should be and looking
at the outside entities, looking at accounts payable and receivable,
there have been some issues with agencies paying temporary solution,
looking at this account often times it’s in the negative because some
agencies don’t pay timely. So, this will be a study and ideally this
would be completed at some point next year by January 30th, 2015. Then
22A.3 extends the reorganization through the reduction and this is a
Voluntary RIF Program that was set by June 30th end of this year and
this continues for one year so that’s where an individual can volunteer
to be RIF and then the agency can take the position and repurpose it and
ideally save some funds with how they utilize that position. We are
moving on to the office of the Governor, this 23.1 is the Education
Reward Force Innovation Program it changes a match requirement as well
as the composition of this commission and this is located here within
office of the Governor but really more education and workforce focused.
On page 203 the Officer State Budget and Management 24.3 it eliminates a
reporting requirement that’s been on the books for always be in so it’s
a staffing announces the state agency business functions so it
eliminates that they were doing that annually. And then moving on to the
office of the state auditor…

Point one requires a private audit of the states pension fund. So, the
state auditor would contract with another entity to have, to have the
pension fund audited. Looking at all of the phase and everything that's
involved there. 25.2, it expands the state auditors authority to publish
reports and to provide discretion when charging and collecting costs of
certain audits. This primarily goes to boards that may or may not have
ability to pay for the audit. So, it lays the discretion to the auditor
and whether or not she collect the fee and the other pieces that she'll
be able to publish reports, maybe on her website or however, through
emails that she sends out, on audits that are not conducted by her
office. Page 205, this requires the state auditor to report any evidence
of criminal misconduct to either the state bureau of investigation or
the district attorney for the county in which that, the alleged
misconduct occurred. It's practice that they do that already but this is
now a requirement in the law. And Madam Chair I'm happy to take
questions. [CHANGE SPEAKER] Questions from the committee on these
special provisions. ?? [CHANGE SPEAKER] Thank you very much. Oh, sorry.
[CHANGE SPEAKER] ?? [CHANGE SPEAKER] The misconduct one? [CHANGE
SPEAKER] No, the second one before that. [CHANGE SPEAKER] Okay. [CHANGE

Representative Floyd on 205, on Page 205, item 14, the exact words are
here, it says, in addition the auditor may publish on his or her website
any reports from audits of state agencies not directly conducted by the
auditor. And I think that is to get to exactly what you're talking
about. If there are some audits out there that may have some findings,
may not have findings, or whatever this is. They may go nowhere, they
may never get posted and now she can actually post those on her website.

To protect the investing ?? capital formation and economic development.
Madame Chair, that’s it from my perception. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That was
short. I take it there’s no comments or questions on that short amount.
Are you sure Representative Ford? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Too quick. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Sorry, on page 206, line 36 Department of Administration,
Section 30.1, again this follows the money, it follows the elimination
of  the grant and aid program to county veteran service officers. Item
42 is an item that was in the Senate budget and it’s also in the House.
Prohibit the closure of certain Veteran’s Affairs offices in Garner and
Wilson. Item 48, this follows the money, this is a transfer of the youth
council to the  - youth internship and council  - to the office of the
Governor and the youth legislature is renamed as Youth General Assembly
and transferred to the legislature. Going to page 208, line 10, this is
transfer of domestic violence and rape crisis center funds to the
Department of Public Safety. That again follows the money. Page 211,
this is line 5, the Housing Finance Agency. This is for the Workforce
Housing Loan Program. This is a modification of the Senate budget;
essentially this makes this program technically correct. Originally,
what it did was it would have looked back and funded programs that had
already received an allocation. This looks forward and funds prospective
programs. Again, it ties to the Low Income Housing Loan Program – or the
State low income housing tax credit that will be expiring at the end of
the calendar year. And then the last item, line 44 from the Department
of the State Treasurer, this allows them to hire up to 2 positions for
the retirement system to look at compliance with existing retirement
laws and regulations. So, to prevent pension spiking and that sort of
thing, this was a recommendation from a House Study Committee on
Pensions and Investments. And that concludes the general government
special provision list. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Comments? Questions? What our
plan is, is to adjourn for lunch – not adjourn but to recess for lunch.
Excuse me. And we’re going to ask – we really finished up earlier than
we thought. Still want to do 1:00? We want to give you enough time to
eat and we want to give you enough time to write your amendments. What
we’re looking at is if you have amendments, to have them to the clerk at
12:30 and then we will come back and resume our meeting at one. Is there
any objection to that? Does that sound like a plan? And the clerk will
be in the LOB 417A. Amendments will be accepted up until that time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Where will the clerk be? [SPEAKER CHANGES] She’ll be
in 417A. And we are now passing out guidelines for those amendments.
Please adhere to those. If you don’t – Would you like to come up here
real briefly to see if there are any questions, comments or
clarification? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair, Members, all of the
amendments must be offered by formal amendment. So, you’ll want to see
Myra and Matt and/or any of us, if you want to get an amendment drafted.
They cannot increase the total spending within the proposed subcommittee
report. So you can’t add to it, it’s got to be managed within the
enrolled budget. Amendments can only affect appropriations within the
department, agencies, or programs within the jurisdiction of the
subcommittee and may not cause a change in another subcommittee’s
appropriations. So, there are several items being transferred, or at
least one item being transferred, out to DPS so that would be up to the
Chair’s discretion but likely ruled out of order if there is an
amendment affecting that budget – the DPS budget. Amendments cannot
adjust salary and benefit appropriations for the departments, agencies,
or programs within the subcommittee report. Amendments cannot spin
reversions or include language that says</p>

Shall not revert or carry forward language. Amendments can not use
non-recurring reductions to fund recurring items. Amendments can not
change the recurring and non-recurring designation of funds. Whether
recurring, non-recurring if there's an item, well any item that is a
non-recurring cut or a recurring cut then you've gotta find recurring
money or non-recurring money to replace it. Amendments can not change
substantive police or law, it's gotta be directly related to the budget.
Amendments may not fund items with management flexibility reductions.
There are several items within the money report that's a management flex
cut. Like within the office of the governor, there's a management flex,
but you may not, I guess go there and increase that cut, according to
these rules. Amendments may not affect agency or program transfers to
other sub committees, we talked about that, and amendments may not
include phase or other finance related maters. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Does
anyone need clarification on any of these items? Good Enough. We are in

$530,000 ?? and will be ?? taxes moving out of the county and city ?? as

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The money that Representative Cunningham wants to take
this from is the $173,000 that's going to the office of State
Controller. The State Controller asked for $608,000. This is a
continuing problem they have in using a fund to cover their costs of
operation, and we're trying to get them out of dipping into that fund so
that it is used for what it is supposed to be used for. I do not thing
that's a good idea. We're trying to make people whole, and this isn't
going to help. So anyone else want to speak on the amendment. And I'll
mention, Representative Cunningham mentioned a privilege tax. Along with
the privilege tax going away, most municipalities and counties had a
considerable increase in sales tax because of the tax plan we passed
last year, and if they continue on the way we're going and continue the
tax plan the way I understand it, there will be more sales tax money
coming in to the municipalities and counties. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma'am, Representative
Cunningham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. As of yesterday in my city the
taxes have gone up to 8%, we were at 7.5%, there has just been an
increase. ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I sympathize with you, my county raised
the property tax 11% and my city raised it 9 cents, excuse me, my county
raised it 11 cents, my city raised it 9 cents and the rationale wouldn't
work up here but they're getting it done. Any other comments on the

Representative Cunningham, would you explain your amendment, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My amendment moves to amend the Joint Government money
report on page J2 which is the ?? and remove it to the libraries, only
asking for 1% to go back to the libraries. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representrative Cunningham is taking the money to have this 1% reduction
from page J8, item 19, which is the investigators for the board of
elections, which I adamantly oppose, and on page J29, item 68, by
decreasing, or by increasing the reduction for utilities expenditures.
The utilities expenditures as explained during our budget explanation
earlier, was taking a reduction that was obvious from their
expenditures. I don’t think taking more money from their utilities is a
smart move because it doesn’t show in the data that it would benefit or
help paying the utility bills of the state. Are there any other comments
on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] GO
right ahead, Miss Cunningham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. On the
investigators, I only ask for reduction of 1 because several people have
already been hired at the board of elections that will be participating
in some of these events with the investigators for the voter ID fraud. I
ask for just ?? of the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To my knowledge,
only one campaign finance person has been hired at the board of
elections. And I’ll reiterate, the board wanted five positions, and they
have quite a backlog of items that they’re trying to take care of. Any
further discussion? All in favor, say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
Nos have it. The amendment fails. Representative Harrison, would you
explain your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, thanks Mr. Chair. So my
amendment restores the funding cut to the ?? ?? Schedule. And then we’ll
research in the break, thank you, and we have historically funded this
program of $100,00. Actually, prior to that when we had more money, we
were at $200,000. And this is an important program the natural, the ??
??. They fund a lot of programs in this state into the very small
communities with microgrants, and I think my $20,000 doesn’t make much
difference, but they said it really would help them supplement some of
the funding at the very local level pursuing ?? cultural programs</p>

I just compare that to the $7 plus million that we're funding the North

won't make up the difference and I know that we're increasing the energy

[SPEAKER CHANGES] You, ?? to speak on the amendment. I'll point out that
again I don't think it's a good idea to increase the reduction for the
utilities. I'll also point out that the Humanities Council has in excess
of $1 million that they bring in every year, they support a staff of 5
and they do their grant funding, and $20,000, although it sounds like a
lot of money to us who don't have a lot of money, I don't think it's
going to have much effect on the Humanities Council. Representative
Queen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd just like to say about the Humanities
Council, it's a small amount of money but it's our state's share of what
this Humanities Council does, it's the North Carolina Humanities
Council. So to keep state government as a partner, they do do a fabulous
job of fundraising on their own, over $1 million, so our taxpayer's
contribution is leveraged very substantially and the issues they ?? on

think this is just a reasonable gesture and ?? utility. So I urge your

auditor, gives her permission to publish audits done by third parties,
that she may be privy to and may come to her office. And my concern
about changing the shall is if she gets audits that have no findings in

publish them? And in addition, in changing it to shall might require her

There has to be a cost. If she has a hundred audits and she goes through
the audits and say 65 of these should be published because there's

I get the rest of the eleven passed out to members. This looks familiar.

Budget, there were enumerated positions that were to be taken. The
administration asked us to give em the flexibility to determine what
positions would be eliminated, and we said yes, as long as that dollar
amount remains the same . In effect what we’re doing, if we pass this

positions. Is that not right that they’re asking to ?? into? [SPEAKER

preserving the veteran’s services, is that what we’re doing? [SPEAKER

[Speaker Changes]
Go right ahead, dear.
[Speaker Changes]
You stated that the Family Stabilization Program Fund affects another
department. Well-
[Speaker Changes]
There's a little- okay. The fund that they're trying to set up, first of
all, it is trying to take a program that this committee said would
sunset next year. Everyone in that program knows that it was sunsetting
and everyone in that program knows that if they expand their services a
little bit  they can still apply for grants. And we're moving all of
that to JPS.

our House committee cannot make ammends to what is under our bailiwick

Mark [??], Fiscal Reseach, under Item ten, &quot;Ammendments may not
