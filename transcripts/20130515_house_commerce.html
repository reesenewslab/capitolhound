Like to welcome everybody to the full House Committee on Commerce and
Job Development. Our illustrious Chair is representing one of two bills
in another Committee so he has called in the second string to be my
Honored Chair today’s Committee. I’d like to recognize our pages, we
have Anna Huffman. If you could just stand up when I call your name.
Sponsored by Representative Riddell we have Robert Jenkins, sponsored by
Representative or Speaker Tillis, Curtis Johnson, sponsored by
Representative Steinburg, Ed Jacob Helms sponsored by Representative
Brody. Our Sergeant-at-Arms that have helped set up the room today are
Patrick Mason, Joe Crook, and Martha Gaddison and Bill Bass as always,
we can’t do it without you so we appreciate your hard work. Our first
bill on the agenda today would be House Bill 112.  And as I’m looking
for the bill sponsor, the Committee will be at ease.  Thank you
Representative Lewis, members of the Committee, Representative Lewis
will stand for this bill as staff explains this great bill to us so at
this point I’d like tor recognize staff. Mr. Roney will explain the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think I’m just going to read the first line of the summary.  Basically
substitute for House Bill 112 would require the state controller and the
government business intelligence competency center to collect and
analyze data related to workers comp, claims, what this bill does is
there was, in the budget act that was session law that would ?? statue
and session law that created this business center that would collect a
lot of data that’s’ in different silos and that’s the term the technical
people use throughout the state and this intelligence center would use a
data mining tye program, business intelligence software to look for
patterns I this data.  The purpose fo 112 is to expand the existing
efforts of this business intelligence center to also focus on workers
comp fraud.  And what this does is amend into the budget act to create
the authority for the business intelligence center to collect data fromv
various agencies  that would give them information about workers comp
fraud.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Roney.  Representative Millis moves that the ?? Committee
Substitute for House Bill 112 be before us.  All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed.  Motion passes. Does that conclude your explanation? Very
good. Members, this came to us as recommended by the Joint Legislative
Committee on Workers Compensation instruments, coverage, compliance, and
fraud prevention and detection.  At this oitn I would entertain any
questions from the Committee. Representative Carney?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a study, correct? We just heard that and directing to expand
what they’re doing now just to add this piece into the study ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Roney?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Its not a study, it actually expands the existing systems to include
this  effort to find workers comp fraud.  So the backbone is already
there and this is adding another initiative. But ti’snot a study.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The result of a study, an ongoing study.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well at the appropriate time, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you’ll hold that motion.  Any additional questions fo members of the
Committee? Representative Lambeth?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think this is a good bill, I did wonder why do we have to have a bill
to do this, it seems like it ought to be a part of what we’re doing
anyway, looking for fraud.  Is It because it’s a unique program that
we’re going after or what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
M. Roney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the main need for the bill is because the data is in a lot of
different places and.</p>

So does the old incorporates publications long battle holders for by the
data into this column collecting body as business intelligence center
and so the abyss was gone for the other missions of seven or but this is
being added to do so without this, they will be some effort unsure to
walk a worker's comp fraud that this is bringing in battle from other
sources that they would not normally be available and is also putting
the auction into this existing of business intelligence center that's
supposed to have sole foreign expertise on to do this better than on the
existing agency without any additional questions from the committee or
somebody having closing comments regarding the bill (SPEAKER CHANGES)

their chance of this effort would be more of business cost for their

Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. Motion to favorable on amendment 848.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion is to adopt the amendment to House bill 848. All in favor
will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed? Motion is adopted. Next up, we're back on the bill.
Representative McGrady are you finished with your presentation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am, unless there are questions, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. I know that we'll have plenty of materials to
use in this study. I applaud the Representative for bringing this bill
forward, and I would like to make a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you'll hold that motion, Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative McGrady. The study's fine. Is there any wisdom
in creating a separate study commission as opposing to have this looked
at by the child fatality task force which is already in place?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that the child fatality task force looked it and recommended
the legislation. But, in a bipartisan fashion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They recommended the legislation or an additional study?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They recommended the legislation is my understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So this is going back to the study then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is going to a different group, trying to create perhaps more
consensus on it, but you're right in your observation, completely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any additional questions from members of the committee? Representative
Lucas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chair. My concern is if there are other states having
the same problem and it seems like the federal government is looking at
this too, are we looking at this at the center of disease control down
in Atlanta, and if so, will our study be commensurate to what they're
doing, and then are the federal regulators on food and drug, are they
looking at this? Since it seems to be a national problem, and if they
are, why are we allowing these chemicals to be in our baby food?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The federal toxics laws are, really gotten scrambled, and the federal
government is way behind in doing, in my opinion, the range of things
that it ought to do. This issue probably ought to be dealt with
nationally, but because the federal government is not taking action, the
states are beginning to take action. And that's what's occurring, and as
a practical matter, Representative Lucas, if you think about it, let's,
let's talk about baby bottles. If fifteen or twenty of the states
ultimately ban Tris from baby bottles, the fact is that Tris is not
gonna be in the baby bottles because manufacturers of baby bottles are
not gonna want to have one set of bottles for one set of states, and
another set of bottles for another set of states. Though this is,
interestingly, this is one of these issues where the states are taking
action and asserting their right to protect their citizens in the
absence of federal, and so the study I would add is, I don't anticipate
this group is actually gonna go out and do all these studies. There's
plenty of studies out there, and my hope is that they will bring back
all that information and report back to the general assembly again, with
a recommendation for a specific legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher, you are recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. I move that we roll the amendment into a new
PCS for House bill 848 and that House bill 848 be given a favorable
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion being properly before of the committee, all in favor will say
aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed? The motion passes. Thank you Representative McGrady. With
no other business before the committee, we are adjourned.</p>
