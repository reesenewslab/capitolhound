  Against this heat we&#39;ll be able to finish this up approximately 2
o&#39;clock or maybe a few minutes early depending on your questions but
this is an opportunity for us to have a Finance Committee meeting. Our
co-chairs Senator Rabin and Senator Tillman, any comments you&#39;d like
to make. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No mine&#39;s been [??] twice. I can&#39;t
say it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, Senator Tillman refuses to speak
today. Well, let&#39;s just see. I don&#39;t think we have. We do have
sergeant at arms but I don&#39;t have the names in place, so thank you
for being here. We appreciate it very much. Today&#39;s goal is to begin
some discussion on economic development. This is going to be probably a
hot topic for this session. I believe the House it working on a plan to
come this way and we need to be knowledgeable of the portions of
economic development that hopefully work or at least know the ones that
don&#39;t work and make some decisions as we continue on with our tax
reform principles and the rules. That being said, let&#39;s have Ms.
Avery, would you begin and bring forth the information. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yesterday Dan and I spoke to the House
Finance Committee and the handouts that you have before you are the ones
that we used there and in mine we covered a little bit of other things,
but because we want to focus today on economic development you&#39;ll
have to sort of fast forward through that handout to get to this section
of the presentation. When we start looking at economic development, you
realize that a lot of it is on the appropriations side but when the
state first went down the road of economic development incentives it
started here in the Finance Committee and the Finance Committee has
always taken a very strong interest in economic development. Prior to
1996, North Carolina made very little use of incentives to lure
companies to come to this state. It didn&#39;t need to. It relied
heavily on its educational system, in particular the community college
system, its transportation system, its low cost of doing business in
this state, its trained workforce but then in pressure from other
southern states in the 1990s who began to offer tax incentives to lure
companies to their state, this state began to also look at what it
needed to do. It was perceived that we were at a weakness that we needed
to overcome. The response in 1996 was an array of statutory tax credits
that were collectively known as the Bill Lee or the William S. Lee
incentive program. That program had two goals, it was to create high
quality jobs and to promote widely shared prosperity throughout the
state. In the coming decade, the General Assembly began to enact more
and more tax credits or tax incentives to lure companies, and I just
listed a few. I was surprised when I looked at all those different
credits how many of them were enacted after 1996. For some reason I
thought they&#39;d been there a lot longer, but it wasn&#39;t, the a
lot, the Ports Tax Credit, the Historical Rehab Tax Credit, the Low
Income Housing, Renewable Energy, all of these tax credits that you all
are discussing today are things that came about from beginning in the
mid 1990s and what you notice when we did tax reform was that many of
those tax credits had sunsets on them, even the Bill Lee credit had a
five year sunset because at the time the General Assembly enacted it it
was seen as a type of experiment, that in five years this body was gonna
look at it again and determine whether those incentives were
cost-effective or that they actually affected behavior or whether they
merely provided tax reductions to businesses that would&#39;ve located
or expanded here anyway, and as those who have been around a while know,
we actually let the Bill Lee Credits expire and we replaced them with
the Article 3J tax credits. Also beginning in about 2002, in addition to
the statutory tax credits, we begin to make more use of discretionary
programs such as JDIG, the Job Development Investment Grant Program.
There came a point, I&#39;ve entitled this slide Points Colliding. I
won&#39;t go over

  <p id="05:00">
  Too much of the tax modernization studies because we&#39;ve talked about
that at length over the past four years, the different studies. But I
just listed on the right hand side the basic recommendations that all of
the tax reform studies recommended. This was something that you all
talked at length about in 2013 as you did your major reforms to the tax
code, but what was also happening simultaneously to a, during those tax
reform discussions was a discussion about your incentives. There was an
increased use of incentives in 2006 and in 2007, and with that increased
use of incentives, there was an increase in the conversation about
whether or not those initial questions have been answered. Are these
incentives effective? Are they doing what they need to do? And that was
the catalyst to a committee called the joint select committee on
economic development incentives. One of the main things that that
committee did was it contracted with UNC Center for Competitive
Economies to do a report, a study, primarily looking at your article
three J tax credits, your, as well as your discretionary spending
programs. And that slide has a link to that study. Some of the major
findings of that study was that the statutory tax credit spending, the
amount you spent on those tax credits, greatly exceeded what was being
spent through the discretionary programs. It also found that those tax,
statutory tax credits weren&#39;t necessarily achieving the stated
economic development goals of high paying jobs, quality jobs, and of
prosperity shared throughout the state. What that study found was that
most of the statutory credits were going toward investment, not job
creation, and that most of those credits were going to companies located
in your metropolitan areas. So there was less correlation between what
the stated goals were and the outcome of those statutory credits. It
found that with your discretionary incentive programs, the, you had more
control over whether or not they were being used to meet the goals. And
lastly, it found that reducing the North Carolina corporate income tax
credit would be a viable alternative to the various statutory credits.
Now I said points colliding is because that as you all looked at that
legislation in 2013 and you made your policy decisions, one of those
decisions was to eliminate those statutory tax credits. And it, we have.
We&#39;ve let many expire. We&#39;ve repealed several others. You can
see that there&#39;s another group that is going to expire in 2015, a
couple more that will expire 2016, and in lieu, in replacement of that
was a reduction of a corporate tax credit. One of the other things that
came out of that study was the thought that this body needed a permanent
group that would look at economic development during the interims. You
have the joint select committee on economic development and global
engagement. One of the key things that that committee has done, Senator
Brown has chaired that committee, was it asked the fiscal research
division to put together an, an economic development inventory so that
the group, this body would know collectively what money it is spending
on economic development. And that study came up with five major
expenditure categories, and the last one was done in March of 2013, and
so that&#39;s where these numbers come from, but you can see that the
money spent or lost by the state for economic development is heavily,
was heavily in your tax expenditures, your tax credits. $1.2 billion as
opposed to your grants, which were $37 million, and then your various
other things. And that&#39;s just sort of my lead in now for you, we, I
feel like the group has spent time evaluating. You&#39;ve at least made
some initial decisions about your corporate tax rate, about your tax,
statutory tax credits, and what you have left now in your arsenal are
your discretionary spending programs. And so what I’ve tried to do is
sort of give you a little bit of the history and be the warm up band to
Dan who will come in now and talk to you specifically about how your
discretionary spending programs work and what the requirements are, and
as you go down the road of economic development

  Um, give you sort of a base of knowledge. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Miss Avery. Members of the committee, this is designed to bring everyone
up to a level of knowledge, some first time coming to the General
Assembly, some first time coming to Finance, and what we will do is also
at some point is get one of the authors of that study from UNC to come
in, briefly describe what has been, you know, in the study and then come
forward and offer some updated information as regarding incentives and
their effectiveness and what should be the metrics as we look at them
and decide if indeed they do deliver the intended goal. Miss Detef, if
you&#39;ll present we&#39;re glad to have you here today. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Good afternoon, my name is Dan Edifaw and as Cindy and Kay,
I&#39;m gonna be reviewing some of the specific economic development
incentive fund programs with you. So, also as Cindy shared, economic
development efforts in North Carolina have evolved over time sort of
from the left to the right of this slide, and that&#39;s because we
moved towards tax simplification, the study that Cindy referenced, and
so these incentive funds have played an increasingly important role in
recruiting industries to our state. The primary tools in our incentive
funds are JDIG, 1 in C, the utility account, site infrastructure
development and JMAC. The job development investment grant program or
JDIG as it&#39;s commonly called is sort of the flagship program of the
state and it was created in 2002 as an incentive for jobs to create,
excuse me, an incentive for businesses to create new jobs in the state.
When the program was created, the objective was to incentivize high
paying jobs and since high paying jobs typically result in higher
withholdings, the program correlates the incentive amount paid with the
withholdings of the jobs created. In fact, the amount of the incentive
is equal to the withholdings of the created eligible positions
multiplied by a percentage between 10-75%. JDIG agreements are not
allowed or may not be entered unless certain prerequisites are met, and
those are listed on the slide. I&#39;m gonna draw your attention to
three of them. First, that the business will have a net increase in in
state employment, that is they will have a larger employment footprint
in the state because of the JDIG agreement. That the project would not
locate in the state but for the JDIG agreement and finally that the
benefits of the project outweigh its costs. For purposes of making this
last determination, Commerce uses a couple of models, the in-plan and
the Waldon models. The in-plan model measure inputs such as investment,
jobs created and salaries associated with those positions and accounts
for multipliers such as the type of the industry and the ability of the
industry to bring in induced and indirect benefits such as supply chain
manufacturers in its wake. The in-plan model is then paired with the
Waldon model to evaluate costs versus benefits with the goal of ensuring
that there&#39;s a net state benefit or a positive general fund impact,
at least by the end of the JDIG term. In order to be eligible to
participate in the JDIG program, a business in the agreement must create
at least 10 jobs that&#39;s located at tier 1 and at least 20 jobs
that&#39;s located at the tier 2 and tier 3 area. Certain businesses
such as retail establishments and professional sports teams are
ineligible for participation in the program and there are also health
insurance and OSHA compliance requirements that apply to all agreements.
Programatically, the General Assembly has put certain constraints on its
overall JDIG obligation. These take the form of cost caps. Historically
speaking, agreement caps, and term limitations on each JDIG agreement.
As originally enacted, the calendar year JDIG commitment cap was $10
million per year. Two years later in 2004 this was increased to $15
million per year, and as a matter of statutory concern, that has been
the persistent cost cap for the program until this day. That being said,
there have been temporal deviations from that, so for example in 2006
for that year alone the cap was raised to $30 million, in 2007 for that
year alone the cap was raised to $25 million. More recently we&#39;ve
seen JDIG availability increases take the form of collapsing future time
periods in with the future time period, so for example in 2007 the
calendar year was collapsed into a physical bianuum period and that
effectively took half of the money and half of the year from the
following calendar year and put it into the current time period.

  Allowing the department to go ahead and begin committing that portion of
the funds. Turning to agreement limitations as originally enacted, the
Department of Commerce could enter no more than fifteen new JDIG
agreements per year. This was subsequently increased to 25 agreements
per year, and then the agreement cap was eliminated altogether. Finally,
a JDIG agreement with a business cannot have a term of more than twelve
years. Okay, so how does the actual process work? How do we go from
being interested in a business and vice versa to a consummated agreement
where they are making investments in the state and creating jobs in the
state? Well, personnel from the economic development partnership of
North Carolina begins working with potential JDIG participants, and
using a JDIG pricing model, they come up with a preliminary calculation
of the incentive amount based on project location, job count, average
salary, the investment the business is bringing, and the industry type.
The committee, excuse me, the company submits a draft application for
review by commerce staff, and they then work with the company to make a
finalized, accurate application to submit to the department, along with
an application fee. The application is considered by the economic
investment committee, which is comprised of the secretaries of commerce
and revenue, the director of OSBM, and one appointee each from the House
and from the Senate. The application must contain certain pieces of
information, including the name of the business and financial statements
of the business, where the project will be located and the project
activity type, the proposed new jobs that will be created by the project
and the associated withholdings. The application should also disclose
all other considered locations and the incentives associated with each
considered location. The EIC then evaluates the application and chooses
program participants pending the negotiation and execution of a
community economic development agreement. This is going to set the
requirements related to and the amount of the incentive. I&#39;m not
gonna mention all of the things that must go into the agreement.
There&#39;s roughly 25 statutory requirements. I do want to draw your
attention to a couple of them. First, you&#39;re gonna see mentioned the
utility account, and we&#39;re gonna discuss that program in detail in a
few minutes. But relevant to the JDIG program, if a project is locating
in a tier two or tier three area, the amount of the incentive to the
business is reduced by 15% or 25% respectively, and that percentage is
automatically diverted into the utility account. So natural question
might be what is a tier two or tier three area? These are rankings done
by the Secretary of Commerce to determine relative economic health of
all the counties in the state. The 40 most economically distressed
counties in the state are classified as tier one, the 40 next
economically distressed counties are tier two, and the remaining 20
counties are tier three. In determining these annual rankings, the
secretary uses four statutory factors, average rate of unemployment,
median household income, percentage growth and population, and adjusted
assessed property value per capita. Turning back to the required
agreement terms, one other thing to note is that while incentive
payments may not exceed a term of twelve years, a company that enters
into a JDIG agreement must agree to maintain operations for at least
150% of the grant term. So if the grant term is twelve years, they have
to maintain operations for eighteen years. Oh, I probably should have
done that halfway through. Sorry. So what happens when things don&#39;t
work out, when they don&#39;t go according to plan? The JDIG program has
three primary ways of protecting the state&#39;s investment. These are
active callbacks, requirements regarding when funds are actually
dispersed, an then monitoring, auditing, and reporting of requirements.
So I just mentioned the JDIG participant must agree to maintain
operations for at least 150% of the agreement term. If they fail to do
so, the EIC is empowered to recapture some or all of the incentive
payments that were paid. Regarding disbursement of funds, if a business
fails to meet the terms of the agreement during the year, during one of
the years of the agreement, the term of the incentive or the amount of
the incentive must be reduced proportionate to the failure. If a
business fails to maintain or meet its performance metrics for two
consecutive years, then one of two things happens depending on whether
or not you&#39;re in the base period. The base period is the ramping up
period. It&#39;s the period of time that a company has to make the new
hires associated for the eligible created positions that forms the basis
of the calculation for the JDIG incentive amount. So

  <p id="20:00">
  a fair way to meet performance metrics for 2 consecutive years and
you&#39;re in the base period then subsequent years grant payments are
withheld until the business comes back into compliance. In that
situation, the EIC has the discretion to increase the base period for up
to 2 additional years. If the business fails to meet performance metrics
for 2 consecutive years and you&#39;re outside of the base period, then
the agreement is terminated. Also dealing with scheduling of the
disbursement of funds no JDIG amount is disbursed to a participating
company until the Secretary of Revenue certifies to the EIC the amount
of the withholdings that were received in that year from the company.
Turning to &#39;Reporting and Monitoring Requirements&#39;. A JDIG
participant must submit annual payroll records to the EIC and the EIC
may audit the business at any time. The EIC in turn, reports annually on
the program to the general assembly and conducts an annual study for the
purposes of determining the minimum funding level necessary to implement
JDIG. To help contextualize this and bring to the fore, how these things
work out, I&#39;ve put together a simple illustration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ve got a question come to mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You&#39;ve got a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright. I hate to interrupt - he&#39;s on a roll. But now, when
you&#39;re my age and you think of it, you&#39;ve got to ask it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s what you have a pencil and paper there for Mr. ?? *laughter*
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, no. I don&#39;t write very well and I think worse than that.
*general laughter*
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How much of the JDIG money is upfront money and how much is reimbursed
after expenses are incurred? I know in the beginning period that there
may be some funds that they&#39;ve not incurred the cost on yet. I need
that explained because we&#39;re at that point now where I need to know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just got to know and if I don&#39;t know right now I&#39;ll forget it.
*general laughter*
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And ?? correct me if I&#39;m wrong. There&#39;s no money that&#39;s paid
upfront. A JDIG calculation is based on the withholdings that are
generated so you&#39;ll have a year where the company is meeting its
performance metrics - it&#39;s remitting its withholdings and it will it
will report on that information. The Department of Revenue will certify
the validity of it and then the calculated percentage in the agreement
is applied to the withholdings generated and it&#39;s submitted to the
company in the following year. And I&#39;ll talk about that a little bit
in the [INTERRUPTED]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That helps. Is that in the base period or at any point?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have to follow up through the Chair please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chariman, followup.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is the case in each year of the agreement including the base period
so, as they&#39;re ramping up their employment, if they plant to create
400 eligible positions andthey create 100 during the base period, you
would calculate the withholdings that they&#39;ve actually remitted on
those 100 eligible positions and then you&#39;d apply the percentage of
the JDIG percent to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s even better than Rucho could&#39;ve explained it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Dan. Please continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This will tie in nicely. We&#39;re going to go into an example that sort
of illustrates this. So let&#39;s say that in 2015, Stark Industries
enters into an agreement with the Department and they create a
sufficient number of jobs with sufficient withholdings and the JDIG
incentive to Stark is one million dollars for a twelve year term. So the
first question presented is &quot;What is the total potential JDIG
obligation to Stark?&quot; Well, if Stark meets all of its metrics each
year of the agreement, the JDIG incentive is one million dollars times
each year of the twelve years for a total JDIG obligation to Stark of
twelve million dollars. In fact, generally speaking, whenever you think
of JDIG availability: for every dollar of JDIG availability, in your
mind you should be thinking of a potential twelve dollars of obligation
over each year of the maximum twelve years for an agreement. The second
question is &quot;How much do we appropriate for Stark Industries in
2015?&quot; and this ties into Senator Tillman&#39;s question. The
natural response might be to think one million dollars but remember,
there&#39;s no disbursement from JDIG until the department of revenue
certifies the amount of withholdings received during the year from the
company. So for 2015, there&#39;s no JDIG disbursement but if Stark
spends 2015 meeting the performance metrics - remitting the required
withholdings, then the department will certify that and a disbursement
will happen the following year in 2016. So, if Stark meets all of its
metrics for each year of the agreement for 2015 through 2026, it will
receive JDIG disbursements in the amount of one million dollars for each
year in years 2016 through 2027. The last question is going to show you
sort of how [END]

  <p id="25:00">
  Of these awards begin to layer on year over year, so assume in 2016
Ultron Industries enters into a JDIG agreement and the amount of the
incentive to Ultron is $10 million per year for 12 years. So in 2016
again you&#39;re going to have, so in 2015 you&#39;re going to have
Stark meeting it&#39;s metrics, remitting it&#39;s withholding, it&#39;s
going to get $1 million in 2016. In 2016 Ultron&#39;s going to be
meeting its metrics, remitting its withholding and it&#39;s will get its
first disbursement in 2017. In 2017 you&#39;ll see the layered effect of
$11 million in total commitment representing but JDIG obligations to the
two participating businesses. That will continue until 2028 when your
JDIG obligation for appropriations purposes is going to drop back by $1
million as Stark will term out after 12 years of participation in the
program. The following year Ultron too would term out after 12 years so
you would have no JDIG obligation in the absence of any new JDIG
agreements entered during that time period. I also want to touch on the
appropriations process for JDIG purposes. Each year hopefully it&#39;s a
little clearer now after the example that we need to appropriate enough
money to the JDIG program to meet all the state&#39;s collective
obligations to all participating businesses, but that amount is
necessarily going to depend on how well each of the participating
businesses hit their metrics, so for planning purposes based on a study
that was done by the Department of Commerce, we determine that as a
place holder for the past couple years and probably for this year and
maybe the next one going forward, there&#39;s a base $63 million
appropriation for JDIG obligations. Now, that amount is less than what
would be needed if all participating businesses hit all their
performance metrics. To my knowledge that has never occurred. You can
imagine that in down economic times like out of the great recession that
we&#39;ve just come out of, companies were underperforming. In that
situation, the $63 million may fall short of what&#39;s actually needed
to meet the state&#39;s collective JDIG obligation to participating
businesses. That&#39;s going to result in a non-recurring surplus for
that year. Similarly, during boom economic times or recovery periods,
companies may typically perform all the metrics, they may fully perform
and may be entitled to the full amount of the obligation. In that
situation the $63 million may fall short of the state&#39;s obligation
and in that year you&#39;re going to have a non-recurring deficit.
You&#39;re gonna have to have an additional procreation to meet the
state&#39;s JDIG obligations. It is only after we received the funding
study by the EIC that we&#39;re able to true up those numbers, the $63
million place holder and the actual obligation of the state. So that
covers one of the five programs we&#39;re gonna discuss, but it does
have the largest fiscal footprint, so we&#39;re going to move a little
more quickly through the remaining four, and I want to touch next on the
1 in C fund. This is as I called it yesterday, the old man of our
discretionary funds. It was created way back in 1993 although it was not
codified. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you want members to ask questions
specifically on this JDIG before we move on? Would that be helpful?
Members of the committee, you would prefer to just listen to the whole
thing or specifically? Okay. Well, I&#39;ve got yes and no. Alright, if
it&#39;s specific to JDIG, Senator Alexander. It might be good because
while it&#39;s fresh in your mind you can ask the question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, I&#39;m some kind to Senator Tillman I do believe and
proud of it. I understand we had a couple of companies, Chiquita and
Dell who came to town and came to our state and things didn&#39;t work
out and now we&#39;re working a claw back. Can you tell me how well that
claw back is working? I&#39;m told that they don&#39;t have to give the
money back until they leave and what is the definition of them leaving?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I certainly with respect to monies that have not
yet been earned under JDIG, you don&#39;t have to worry about clawing
that back. In terms of payments that have already been made, we have
Commerce here, they might be able to speak to the process of the clawing
back. In terms of the statute there&#39;s not really a mechanism in
place. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is somebody from Commerce able to answer
Senator Alexander&#39;s question. Just don&#39;t all stand up and say
yes, I know that answer. Okay, we&#39;ve got, would you please come
forward and identify yourself and see if you can share that answer to
that question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Stewart Dickinson, I&#39;m the
Director of Commerce. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can&#39;t hear you. Turn on your
mic. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, Stewart Dickinson, Director of the Commerce
Finance Center. The claw back in the case of the two specific companies
you mentioned, Dell paid their entire amount back, it was approximately
$1.1 million of the discretionary incentives to Commerce

  30 days after they notify the department that they would be closing that
factory down. They in fact didn&#39;t close that factory for several
years. But they did pay that right away they did not have to but they
did. In the case of Chiquita we have been notified by Chiquita that they
are going to be exiting Charlotte and the funds that they&#39;ve
received which is a little bit over a million dollars in discretionary
funds will be paid by the end of this calendar year by December 31.
[SPEAKER CHANGES ]Senator Alexander, right why are you up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES]The amount of money if I remember correctly was in the hundreds
of millions between the state and the local with Dell and they were here
what three years? Other than discretionary money what else did they get
that they didn&#39;t have to return? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well the part the
that we wouldn&#39;t know about is any tax credits. However I doubt that
there would have been any tax credits that they would have had to profit
to pay tax credits on being here such a short time and having losses in
the early years. The Community College investment and the workforce was
not in my knowledge was not paid back to the state but that created a
trained workforce in that area. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay I&#39;ve got
Senator Bill Rabon [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have
a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir [SPEAKER CHANGES] One specific
question I have is I read the bill from the house last night but I did
not and I did not see and there may have been and I may have just
overlooked the fiscal note of the House bill recommending 45 million
dollars and increasing or extending the sunset on the jet fuels tax.
Does fiscals have a a note on that yet? Do we know what that&#39;s going
to cost the state? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Jet fuel or JDIG? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jet fuel this was the whole package they gave. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can we
stick to the JDIG right now? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay we&#39;ll stick to
the JDIG on that I figured that the bill itself would have a fiscal
note. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hello I&#39;m Aubrey Enright from fiscal
research I&#39;d be happy to answer that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So the full impact is forthcoming in a memo of a note
rather a note now that it&#39;s public. I can speak specifically to the
maximum liability associated with JDIG in that legislation. The increase
to the current program is a 15 million dollar increase of the liability
cap if you multiply that over 12 years that&#39;s a 180 million dollars
and the extension of four years equates to a 720 million dollars you add
those two together the maximum liability would be 900 million dollars.
As Dan stated the actual liability is less than the maximum liability
but 900 million max. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you. Follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Rabon. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That was the number
I was looking for thank you very much on that but I have a question
about JDIG now and the jobs that they create or that are supposed to be
created. Is there any mechanism by which we know how many jobs these
industries bring with them to North Carolina and then get paid as part
of the JDIG compared to how many North Carolinians who get hired by the
administration of this fund. In other words how many of their employees
are home grown and how many do they bring with them? And if we don&#39;t
address that I would certainly suggest that moving forward we do address
it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So there&#39;s no breakdown in JDIG in terms of
required reporting of homegrown versus imported employees. JDIG is
relatively agnostic as long as you&#39;re creating a position and
creating with holdings there are some factors when you&#39;re trying to
determine the 10 to 75 percent. What percentage to use there are some
some factors in there that are to be considered in terms of whether
you&#39;re hiring residents of a development zone and other economically
distressed areas. Those would be home grown but I believe that it is the
only provision. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay
Senator Cook [SPEAKER CHANGES] Of the companies that take part of this
JDIG do we have any data on how many of them actually go the full term
and how many jobs in total that they end up contributing to North
Carolina&#39;s economy? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I bring ??

  Fiscal Research. There have been 201 JDIG grants awarded through the end
of calendar year 2014. Only three have gone to full term. 73 have
terminated or withdrawn. I do have a total job number on the number of
jobs announced initally but that is not those that have been actually
created if that would be useful. I&#39;m looking that up right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanna dovetail on that just a little bit in terms of
only three have gone full term, you have to remember a lot of these
agreements are 12 year agreements so we&#39;re still trying to determine
whether, a number of those are still sort of in progress so those, of
course, have not gone to completion. So I don&#39;t want you to get the
wrong idea with only three going to completion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And we
do have this available for the committee members? Is that possible?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think, would everybody
appreciate seeing that information? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We need to know
this stuff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And then to the minimum number of jobs
announced as provided by commerce was 64,141 jobs. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, follow up, Senator Cooke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry. I&#39;m just trying to get a good feel for the
impact, the success, [phone rings] oh Lord. [laugh] [SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, Senator Cooke, it&#39;s your turn. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. You talk about [??] What was I saying? Oh, yeah. Success of the
program. Just in the numbers I heard a moment ago it doesn&#39;t sound
very successful but you make a good point, we haven&#39;t had time for a
lot of these companies to go full term. That&#39;s your point. Is there
any way to get a better handle on the success of this program than those
metrics? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I think it&#39;s about $1.4 billion
that&#39;s been committed so far in JDIG awards, so you&#39;re looking
so far over the term of the life from 2002 to now of roughly committing
$1.4 million and 64. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Million or billion? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Billion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, billion right? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No. Million? Billion? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aubrey Gobryer, Fiscal
Research, $1.5 billion has been announced as awards to those 201 JDIG
grants. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. 1.5 billion,
64,000 roughly jobs, so that might be one of the best ways to get a
general idea of a snapshot of where we are in terms of how much
we&#39;ve put into it and jobs, created jobs that&#39;s come out of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. $1.5 billion has been committed so far and
64,000 jobs have been created? [SPEAKER CHANGES] 64,000 jobs, $1.5
billion. I&#39;m not a mathematician, but thank you. Thank you, sir.
Somebody wake him up. That sounds like an awful lot of money per job to
me. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is a decision for the body. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I can add a little nuance to that $1.5 billion, as Dan mentioned the
Utility Account structure is in place. Out of that $1.5 billion, $330
million has been committed to the Utility Account which is used in tier
1 and tier 2 counties which is used for economic development
infrastructure for those economically distressed counties, and in terms
of the success of the program, I would also speak to an internal process
that commerce goes through prior to awarding a JDIG grant. They have a
model that they run in partnership with NC State&#39;s Dr. Waldon that
requires any awarded JDIG to demonstrate a net positive impact on the
general fund over the term of the grant. That&#39;s just more nuance to
this complicated program that might be helpful. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now,
the chairman is going to allow a lot of, any questions it want because
this needs to be understood and we&#39;re going to have meetings next
Tuesday and Wednesday, Economic Development and Revenue and Single Sales
Factor and all the others. So there&#39;s plenty of time. I want you all
to have a chance to ask your questions and become knowledgeable about
this. Okay, you all set? Good. Senator Rabin. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
thank you. In sort of follow up, I think that we have to consider having

  some measure of effectiveness installed, so that we know if we have a
successful program, or a program that needs fixing, or some way to look
into the future on that. I&#39;ve gone about near blind in the other eye
reading reports in other areas and we seem to be sort of deficient when
it comes to demanding measures of effectiveness on these programs, so we
can&#39;t get a handle on the cost-effectiveness of any of them. Follow
up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It seems to me, from when you were describing base
year and what goes on and ramping up and all of that, the workforce
thing was brought up by the gentleman who just spoke, that there&#39;s
potential for cranking into the JDIG program a workforce internal
development part that could be supported by our population and our
community colleges as part of the incentive for bringing them in here or
as part of the package, so that we know we&#39;re not importing people
to work, but we&#39;re giving jobs to people who live here, and have
been paying the taxes, who are paying for the JDIG program. I think that
might be something that someone has got to sort of research and look at.
And the last one
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You all set?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ll probably come up with more, because I&#39;m
awake now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s wonderful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can wait until the end of the thing, and I&#39;ve
got a pen, so give me a couple more minutes. I&#39;ll put you back to
sleep.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good point, Dan. I will just to make a point. Now, the
money that you said that is obligated definitely goes toward future
availability. And I think what we talked about is $1.5 billion. It&#39;s
out there. That goes against availability going out over the 12 years. I
don&#39;t know if that point was quite made?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. And of course the 1.5 represents a
collective of all the agreements. The ones entered in 2002. The ones
entered in 2003, 2004. And so those will, that represents the amount
that has been collectively obligated should all the performance metrics
be met over the entire term of the first agreement. If it hasn&#39;t
already rolled off, it&#39;s probably getting close to the most recently
entered ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right. And they keep intertwining, and by doing so we
have accumulated 1.5 potentially liability that cuts into availability
on every year going out. Correct? ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. I just want to speak to the total potential
liability of the current footprint of the JDIG program is $1 billion if
companies maximize performance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ve got Senator McInnis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I understand the 64,141 announced jobs. Do we have a
feel for jobs created versus jobs announced? I understand jobs announced
doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that any of them, for that matter, were
filled.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, we do have a feel for that. There&#39;s an
economic development grant report that requires Commerce to share actual
jobs created within job development grants. It does not encompass the
full time horizon of the JDIG program, but it goes back to 2007. I
don&#39;t have that number available right now, but could get that to
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please see that the entire committee gets that part of
that report. Senator McInnis, you all set?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And just to verify, and I think I&#39;ve heard it a
couple times. It&#39;s $1.5 billion is the liability that is on the
state of North Carolina right now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to nuance that a little bit. 1.5 billion were
awarded over the total program history. Currently, the existing
liability for the program in its current state with its current sunset
date at January 1 of 2016 is $1 billion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ve got Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have one question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Great.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My previous one was answered. When I hear my local
economic developers and community folks telling us we maxed out of the
JDIG program, and if we don&#39;t get more money they won&#39;t have
JDIG available as an incentive, can you explain to me what they&#39;re
meaning by that, and what kind of limitation are we currently under with
JDIG?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. So under JDIG currently, the statutory cap is
$15 million in commitments per year. So the department can

  commit no more than $15,000,000 in this calendar year and each… well not
this calendar year. As a statutory matter, generally it’s $15,000,000,
and each new calendar year brings a new infusion of $15,000,000. That’s
subject to deviations by the General Assembly, so right now we’re
dealing… instead of a calendar year cap, we’re dealing with a biennium
cap of 2013 to 2015 of I believe $22,500,000. As of July 1, 2015,
there’ll be a half year cap of 7.5 million, and I imagine what you’re
hearing from the locals is as soon as… let’s go with a traditional
calendar year cap. If you have awards being committed by the department,
once they hit 15 million in committed awards, they can’t award anymore
by statute. They would have to come… the department could come and let
us know if we were in session, and then the General Assembly could
consider either collapsing a future time period in to bring some of that
money into the time period, or increasing the amount. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So where are
we right now in terms of the current cap and the amount and what’s
available for economic development projects? [SPEAKER CHANGES] So of the
22.5 million for this biennium, they’ve got roughly $25,000 left.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve got Senator Tillman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. We’ve danced all the way upon that, sir. Oh, it’s on. You
want me to look at it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Cook, I believe you were on the right
track, and you stopped short. I think you asked how much had been
expended and how many jobs we’d hired since the conception of JDIG, and
I heard the number of jobs and I heard the 1.5, but nobody did the
division. [SPEAKER CHANGES] 23 thousand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] $23,000 per
job. That comes from an expert over there. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ve got Senator Clark. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My question has been answered,
Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator McKissick. Good to
have you with us today, Senator McKissick. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely,
as always. Well I was sitting back listening; most of my questions have
been answered. In fact, I was trying to get the math straight on that
1.5 billion, but it that an accurate number and it works out at about 23
thousand per job if we look at the 64 thousand jobs? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now let me ask you this: How does that compare to
averages within, say, the southeastern states with what is being offered
as incentives to get employers to come within their respective states?
Do we have that comparative data? I’m sure we must. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
can’t speak to the cost per job created, but I can speak to other states
in the southeast having similar JDIG-like programs, and Commerce
regularly competes against those states with this tool. I don’t know if
Commerce would say more or if they know more about a cost per job.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It would be very helpful in a… [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s a follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, Mr. Chair. In a
comparative context to see… The 23 thousand sounds like a lot, but when
I think about what I’ve seen in terms of some federal averages, it would
not appear to be disproportionate, but having said that, is there
somebody here from Commerce who could answer that question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You have an answer? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It doesn’t look like
there is. If staff could get back with me, that would be… [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We’ll get staff back with you on that one. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be fine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good. Senator Cook. He’s gone.
I’ve got Senator Jackson – Brent Jackson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. Dan, I know we’re getting down into the weeds on this
thing and we’re picking at it, but you mentioned the utility fund a
while ago. I think it would be beneficial to this audit that we
understand with this JDIG money that it’s not only helping the big
cities and metropolitans where these companies move to, but it’s also
helping the rural because of that utility fund. Could you…? And you
might not want to do it now, but Mr. Chairman, I think that would be a
good point to be explained. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The point is well-taken,
but he’s going to talk about the utility fund after the JDIG, even
though there is some tying together. But that’s probably a better time.
Dan, is that okay with you? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s fine. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’ve got Senator Alexander. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You made mention
you were going to be talking about the utility fund after the JDIG?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll defer my question
then. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Wells? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Over here. This applies, as I understand it, to all of our incentive
funds, so I started to save this for the last, but since you went into
the tier system on the JDIG, I thought I’d ask now. The latest numbers
I’ve seen from staff of all this big pot of incentives money committed

  We&#39;re talking about 3/4 of it has gone to the 20 wealthiest tier 3
counties in the state and of that 3/4, 3/4 of that went to two counties.
Had there been studies, discussions, any ideas on how we might allocate
incentives money in maybe a little more equitable manner across the
state of North Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let&#39;s break the question
up if we may. Can you tell them how much money from the inception and
recently had the JDIG money been distributed to certain urban centers
versus rural? Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So, over the life of the program,
approximately 67% of awards to companies have gone to Durham, Wake and
Mecklenberg. In the past two years, 83% of awards have gone to, the
value of the awards, not the number of awards. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And
that handles your first q

[SPEAKER CHANGES] That corrects my intial understanding, but it's worse than I said. Again, have there been any studies, discussions, any way we might spread this out across all 100 counties? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, there are ways that you can disincentivize locating in tier three areas. I think one of the tricks involved is companies aren't necessarily comparing the most economically distressed county in the state as a possible location with say Raleigh or RTP, they're comparing Raleigh versus Austin, TX. So part of this is an inability to control where it is, an industrial suitor is willing to go in the state, but there are certainly ways that the program could be modified to lower incentive amounts in more wealthy areas. Does that answer your question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Senator Wilkes, I think it's this committee's discussion that will hopefully explore some of the areas that will modify the JDIG program to reach the metrics that we wanna do if we want all 100 counties to be prosperous. Okay?

So we can continue that discussion. Okay, I've got Senator Rudolph. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One of the questions have already been asked, so when you spoke about the three tiers, but I also want to know about the stem of these funds. You say you started this in 2002 and the grants was that some kind of way connected some of this money with the grant program? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Was it originally like Federally funded do you mean? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't believe so. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, ma'am, not to my knowledge. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, cause you got to stem this money into the study I wanted to know was it included in these JDIG programs. I just wanted to know. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's strictly state money, okay? I've got Senator Rabin. I'm sorry, Senator Ford. I apologize. Go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I do. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it's important to put a little bit of context and historical

information on the table as we're gathering it, Mr. Chairman, as it relates to the income tax revenue that is produced from the counties that are being talked about here as it relates to where the JDIG funds are going. Can we get staff to produce that for us, sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So you want to understand the total withholdings associated with counties and how much the companies are getting back based on that total withholding? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, ma'am. I want to look at the total revenue that the state receives from income tax withholdings from the companies that are receiving the JDIG money. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, your question is good. Dan, would you spend a minute explaining how that money is distributed up to 75% and the withholding based on the contract or the grant that's there? This'll go in the direction that you're wanting to talk about and then ultimately lead to a question of yes, we gave so much grant money back because that was what was the 75% of the withholding.

I guess the question you want asked is how much money was left that actually went to the state coffers once the grant was paid for. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So going sorta to the way the system works, and I won't give a specific example with numbers cause I tried that one time in a committee meeting off the fly and it ended in epic failure, but the way it works is if a company says I'm gonna create x number of eligible positions then you look at the withholdings associated, that the
