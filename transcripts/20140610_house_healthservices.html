If everyone would take their seat, I’d like to call our committee
meeting to order. We do have a rather lengthy agenda for this day.
There’s lots of information we’re going to try to cover. I’m not sure
where the committee’s at. Carl, thanks for being here. There’s
Representative Martin coming in. Where’s she at? Well they will come in.
We had a press conference earlier. I know some of them were in that
conference. Let me just give you sort of the schedule for today. We will
go until noon and then we will break at noon, and then we will be back
at one and then we will finish up at three, and I do ask – I’ll have to
mention this again when the committee gets here – that we have all
amendments in by noon. We do have our Sergeant-At-Arms here; Young Bay –
he’s coming in, Martha Gaddison, back in the back, David Collins, behind
me, and Carl Morello, and we thank them for what they’re doing. We do
have several pages with us this morning, and if you’ll just raise your
hand as I call your name. Dajia Gainey, Gates County; Rachel Harris –
where’s Rachel? – from Wake County; Tyler Cop, Brunswick County; Mary
Manon, New Hanover; and Kate Maxwell from Cumberland. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll reiterate that when the committee
all gets into our session. Amendments. Why don’t we wait a couple
minutes to see if the remainder of the committee arrives? So at ease for
a few minutes as we distribute information as well.</p>

We do have a very long agenda that we need to work through today. I will
mention again that we need the amendments requested of staff by noon. So
if committee members have any amendments, please request those of the
staff by noon so we can keep things moving today. I have asked fiscal
research staff, Susan Jacobs, to talk about the rules for sub-committee
procedure. So, Miss Jacobs will come forward and start this morning.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. chair members of the committee, Good morning. Susan Jacobs, fiscal
research. You should have a single page in your handouts that is titled
rules for sub-committee procedure. The majority of these are the same
that you saw last year and in previous years. The first amendment says
that of course amendments have to be offered by formal amendment.
Amendments can not increase total spending within the proposed committee
report. Amendments can only reflect appropriations within departments or
agency programs, so within the department of health and human services
it is not limited to divisions within this agency. Rule number four is
actually a new amendment, amendments can not adjust salary and benefit
appropriations in the department. You saw in both the governor's budget
and senate budget that the salary changes or actually included within
the sub-committee money reports this session. Generally, they are
included in the salary and the reserve section of the bill. This year is
different. So there is a new rule that says that amendments can not
adjust those items. Amendments can not spin reversions or include funds
shall not revert or court carried foreign language. It also means that
you shall not have amendments that say that the agency shall fund the
item within existing resources. You have to identify where the funds
will come from in order to fund an item. Number six, amendments can not
use non recurring reductions to fund recurring items. Amendments can not
change the recurring and nonrecurring designation of funds, is number 7.
Number 8 is amendments can not change substances, policy, or law.
Amendments can not fund items with management flex cuts. Amendments may
not affect agency or program transfers to other sub committees.
Amendments may not include fees or other finance related matters. Mr
Chair, that is a review of all the rules. I am happy to answer any
questions with those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mrs Jacobs. Any questions of the committee? ...
I know there were some hard copies distributed, but this information is
also on the website for those of you who may have not obtained a hard
copy. So you can go to the website and follow along as well. We will
proceed right into the committee reports. We are gonna go through both
the documents and then will respond to questions. Jot down your
questions, hold your questions and let the staff go through. Some of
your questions may be answered as we go through the presentation. We
will start with Susan Jacobs, again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, as well as the money report you also have a document that is
entitled &quot;Governor and Senate items not included in the house
budget.&quot; As the staff goes through each individual agency we will
refer to that, I think it is about a 3-4 page document, and let you know
which items are actually in the senate or governor budget but are not
included in the current house proposal. Item number 1 on page G1 is a
senate modified item, it is a compensation increase reserve of 7.5
million dollars. The senate had this funded at approximately 6 million
dollars. Item number 2 is the corresponding benefit increase associated
with that salary adjustment. It is also a senate modified item, the
house budget has it at approximately 1.9 million dollars recurring.The
senate budget had this item funded at about 1.1 million dollars. Item
number 3 is a governor modified and senate modified item and it is
contracts and vacant positions,reductions department wide. The senate
had this item included at 16 million dollars recurring. The governor had
limited this reduction to contracts only, and it was a reduction of 3
million dollars. The current house proposal is a recurring reduction of
8 million dollars. Item number 4 was an item included in both the senate
and governor's budget. It is a maintenance cost allocation item of -----</p>

<p id="010:00">
dollars recurring. And it allocates allowable federal funds from
maintenance expenses at the division of child development early
education. Item number 5 is also a senate and governor item, and it
funds the NCTracks system within prior year earned revenue. On page G2,
item number 6, NCFast similar to the NCTracks item, it funds the ongoing
funds for this system, out of prior year earned revenue so there’s no
general fund appropriation necessary. It’s the same as it was in both
the senate and governor budget. Item number 7, the competitive block
grant transfers, was not in the senate budget, was not in the governor’s
budget but it was in the senate budget, and it carves out two items that
you will see in two divisions in just a few minutes. It moves items from
the competitive block grant and the office of the secretary into the
division of social services and the division of, I’m sorry the division
of public health and division of mental health. Competitive block grant
additional funds. This is a senate modified item. It addes $375,000 to
the competitive block grant and the office of the secretary. The senate
had funded this item at the same amount but in the first year, fiscal
year 14 15, had actually required that these funds go for non-profit,
specifically Big Brother Big Sisters. And the house budget simply
increases the overall block grant by 375,000 recurring. Item number 4
creates two actuary positions. You see one FTE in the description
because these positions are funded 50% by federal Medicaid funds. It
creates two actuary positions in the office of the secretary. It’s the
same as was included in the senate budget. Item number 10 is the health
information exchange and funds that item, it’s actually matching funds
for the health information exchange. Four million dollars. If these
funds are matched at 50% the total available will be eight million
dollars for this project. Mr. Chair, Deborah Landry will cover the next
three agencies within the committee report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Ms. Jacobs. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning Mr. Chair, members of the
committee. I am Deborah Landry with fiscal research division. We’re
going to start on page G3 with the division of aging and adult services.
Item 11 is a house only item and funds $100,000 non-recurring for senior
capital projects. The senate had a home care and community block grant
to reduction of $969,000 which is not included in the house budget. On
page G4, we’ll begin with the division of child development and early
education. The first item, item 12 is a governor and senate item, and
it’s a ?? funds for pre-K, and it’s a swap-out of ?? grant funds of
$15,842,334 non-recurring. And it simply swamps out ?? funds for state
appropriations for no change in total funds for pre-K. The next item is
a house only item. Item 13 is pre-K lottery funds. This replaces general
fund appropriation with lottery receipts on a recurring basis for pre-K.
It is a house only item and it brings the lottery receipts for pre-K
program to $124.7 million. Item 14 is a governor item that’s been
modified and the same as the senate. It’s administrative savings due to
efficiencies in cost allocation. It is mostly using child care
development block grant funds for administrative purposes in the
division of child development. It does also budget $60,000 in
over-realized receipts, and there is some efficiencies achieved by the
division of child development and early education moving to Dix campus.
Particularly they are now sharing some staff with the division of social
services in the reception area, so there is one position that’s being
eliminated and it is a vacant position. Item 15 is a governor modified
same as senate item. It’s child care subsidy block grant swap out for
$13.9 million. The governor had it at $13.8 million, and it does use
child care subsidy funds and temporary assistance for needy families
emergency contingency funds to swap out those dollars. On item 16 on
page G5 is a senate modified item. It is child care subsidy eligibility
changes. The current childcare subsidy is 75% of state median income.
This changes it for children 0 – 5 and special needs children to 200% of
poverty, and</p>

<p id="015:00">
Children age 6 to 12 to 133% of poverty. The change from the senate is
the implementation date is now October 1st instead of September 1st. And
also the house, from children currently receiving they will have their
eligibility determined at the new levels with their first
recertification after October 1st. Item 17 is a senate modified item.
Childcare subsidy co-payments set at 10% of income. Currently families
pay 8, 9, or 10% of their income for gross income as a co-payment for
their childcare subsidy. This makes it 10% for all children and the
change from the senate to the house is it’s effective October 1st
instead of September 1st. Item 18 is Childcare subsidy co-payment is no
longer pro-rated for part-time care - 2.1 million dollars. It is senate
modified; the change is the effective date is October 1st and also
because of the effective date, the previous item and this item is
slightly lower than the senate because of the one month change. The
Senate had 2.3 million dollars for this one and the house has 2.1. The
three items we just went over – 16, 17, and 18; all the savings from
those items are reinvested in items 19 and 20. Item 19 is a senate
modified item. It provides funding for the childcare subsidy wait list.
The senate had 15 million dollars in this item. Item 20 is childcare
market rates. This is a house only item. This provides money for market
rate increases for the childcare subsidy program. The childcare market
rates are increased by 40% of the difference between the current
childcare market rate and the 2013 childcare market rate survey
recommended rates. And that is effective January 1st, 2015. Item 21 is
Pre K and it is a senate modified item. There’s 5 million of
non-recurring State appropriation. And the difference between the senate
is there is a 4 million in additional temporary assistance for needy
families emergency block grant funds. This item is also to ensure that
because of the teacher pay raises there is no loss of slots in PreK
because the per child cost will go up. And there’s also funds for
additional slots. There is a Governor’s only item that is not included
and it replaced Prek funding with a combination of lottery receipts on a
recurring basis and TANA funds on a non-recurring basis. The lottery was
14.75 million recurring and 17.1 million non-recurring TANA funds for
the Governor. On page G7 is the division of Social Services. Item 22 is
a Governor and senate item – the State County Assistance Case loads. The
case loads for county assistance has been decreasing so this just takes
the funds that are not going to be needed next year because of the
decreasing case load. Item 23 is state funding for county MEDICAID
administration. It is a Governor and senate item. Counties will now be
able to get an enhanced match for MEDICAID administration. So this money
that was going to them, 1.8 million is being taken and they’ll get their
enhanced federal match.  Item 24 is Adult Care Home Case Management.
It’s eliminating funds for a program that ended last June, June of 2013.
So it’s just budget that’s not needed any more. Item 25 is county Child
Protective Services case loads. It provides funding to replace 4.5
million in Federal block grant funds that counties lost coming into this
year and also provides additional funds so that the total funds are 8.3
million dollars and it is to try to get the Child Protective Services
case loads down to the recommended 10 cases per worker. Over on page G8,
item 26 is to enhance oversight of County child welfare services. It’s a
Governor modified item and it’s identical to the senate item. For
$750,000 for 9 positions with the  division of Social Services to
provide monitoring, technical assistance, training for county
departments of social services. The Governor had 30 positions at 2.6
million dollars. Item 27 is a senate item also. It’s Child Welfare
In-Home Services expansion. It provides 4.5 million dollars for counties
to provide in-home services for child protective services cases. Item 28
is a Child Protective Services statewide evaluation. It provides
$700,000 of non-recurring</p>

… unclaimed dollars to evalauate child protective services from the
county to state administration also. It’s to look at case load sizes,
performance, administrative structure, funding, worker turnover, and
also is to include recommendation on improving the child protective
services system. Item 29 is a Senate item. Child protective services
pilot. Provides funds to develop and implement a private pilot program
to improve communication with local county offices of social services,
local law enforcement, the court system, guardian light up program, and
any other agencies the department requests. I also point out from item
25 to item 29 these were our recommendations out of the legislative
oversight committee. Item 30 is a governor and senate item. These are
foster care case load has been increasing. This is money to fund for the
foster care system payments to foster care parents. Item 31 is a senate
item. Susan mentioned earlier about this swap out of the competitive
block grant. The maternity home funding is taken out and put into the
maternity home fund, which exists in the division of social services.
That consists of 375,000 dollars. Item 32 is a house only item. It is to
provide funds for the implementation of the drug screening and testing
for the work party program as past and section 2013-417. There’s 218,000
of reoccurring dollars and 125,000 of non-reoccurring. The non
reoccurring is for system implementation. The senate also had an item
that changed eligibility for special assistance programs from the
current level to %100 of poverty and that is not included in the house’s
budget. Mr. Chair that concludes my section to this conference.
Someone’s coming is to talk for the next couple of agencies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks you Ms. Landry. Denise Thomas will be up next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good Morning. Denise Thomas, division of fiscal research. I am going to
start on page G-10 with the division of public health’s budget. Item 33
is the AIDS Drug assistance program or ADAP. This is a modified
governor’s item. This is identical to an item included in the senate
budget. It is basically a carrying over of unanticipated higher than
expected revenues that the ADAP program received this year from
pharmaceutical rebates and from federal receipts. This is a one time
reduction of about 5.8 million dollars. These funds will be carried over
into FY 14 and 15 and thereby the house is taking a one time reduction
of the 5.8 million to the budget next year. The governor had recommended
about 3.8 million, but in looking at the expenditures year to date it
appeared that the receipts will be much higher than that. Item 34 is a
governor’s item and also in the Senate budget. This is eliminating the
100,000 reoccurring that was remaining in the UNC incubator project
budget. This is a program that the general assembly has been ratcheting
back over years. The only amount left was 100,000 dollars that was being
used for a contractor for the UNC Institute of public health. This money
is eliminated and the health departments will continue to carry this
work on their own. Item 35 is a governor’s item and a senate item. It is
eliminating the remaining funds in the vector control program. Again,
this is a program that the funding had been reduced over the years.
There was very little left. It was being used to provide small grants to
just a selective number of counties for mosquito control. Item 36 is the
child and family support team. It was a governor’s item and a senate
item. This is a reduction of about 251,000 and it is eliminating the
funding for child and family support team. This was a pilot program that
was started several years ago. It has been fully implemented around the
state and the start up funds are no longer needed. On page G-11. Item
37. Operational Efficiencies. This is a governor’s item that was also
included in the senate. It is a reduction of about 298,000 dollars
reoccurring. It is in several units and the division of public health in
which they are identifying operational efficiencies and positions, five
positions that may be eliminated. Effective July 1st. Item 38. Public
health program adjustments. These are some residual funds that were left
in the budget from programs that basically no longer exist. The purchase
of medical care. The early detection and intervention and the tobacco
prevention and control programs. The reduction is for about 337,000
dollars reoccurring.</p>

<p id="025:00">
Item 39 is a Governor’s item also in the senate. And this was an
expansion of $350,000 for the Vital Records Unit. And these funds will
go into the Vital Records Automation fund to be used for the enhancement
of the electronic birth record system. Item 40 is also a Governor’s item
and it was a senate budget also. It is providing a million dollars
recurring expansion for the office of Chief Medical Examiner to address
some of the operational deficiencies that have been identified in the
Medical Examiner system in the recent months. The final item under
Public Health on page D12 is item 41, Well Water Testing. This is a
Governor’s item, was also in the senate budget and it was a request that
is budgeting increased receipts that will be realized from increasing
the fee that is charged by the State Public Health Lab to analyze
private  well water samples. The fee will increase from currently $55 to
$74. The full amount of the increase is to cover the increased cost of
the supplies that are used to analyze the water samples. The fees will
be collected by the public health lab and will be retained in the lab’s
budget. So there is a net impact of zero for this item. There were two
items that were included in the senate budget that are not in the house
budget. One item was to reduce the funding for the School Nurse Funding
Initiative and that reduction was about 3.5 million recurring. It would
have eliminated the funding for about 70 school nurse positions and
would have target the remaining 166 positions to the 41 tier one
counties only. The second item that is not included that was in the
senate budget, was to transfer the On-site Water Protection section from
the Environmental Health branch back over to the Department of Natural
and Economic Resources. It was to transfer the On-site Water Protection
Unit that is currently in the division of Public Health in their
Environmental Health Branch. It would have transferred that unit only
back over to DNER. The Division of Mental Health’s items start on page
G30. Item 42 was in the senate budget. This is to reduce to take back
those 16.6 million dollars non-recurring, that was provided in last
year’s appropriation act and it was provided for one-time funding to
purchase equipment, furniture, and IT infrastructure for the new
Brighton Hospital. That at that time was anticipated to open in December
of 2014. Due to some construction issues, the opening of this facility
is not scheduled to take place until May 2016. So these funds are being
eliminated from the reserve and they will be reconsidered during the
long session. Item 43 is a Governor’s item that has been modified. It
was also in the senate budget. This was the elimination of 2.4 million
dollars of funding that had been used for two IT claims processing
contracts. This was to process the claims for community services. These
community service claims are now processed in the NC Track system. Item
44 Local Management Entity and Managed Care Organizations. This is a
reduction of 1.8 million dollars recurring. It was a Governor’s item and
also in the senate. And it was reducing the budget for LME-MCO
Administration by 1.8 million in anticipation of the consolidation of
the current nine LME-MCOs to seven or fewer LME-MCOs in a year from now.
And the savings were mainly coming from the elimination of
administrative positions in these LME-MCOs. Item 45 is for $448,000
recurring reduction to the central office administrative budget. And it
was identifying some operational deficiencies that could be achieved by
eliminating some vacant, 7 vacant positions. Item 46 is a senate item
only. It was also a modified item in the Governor’s budget. It is
LME-MCO General Administration. There had been a 6 million dollar
financial risk reserve that was held at the department in case one of
the LME-MCOs became insolvent and the department needed to pay
outstanding claims for the providers. But you passed the bill last year
that really strengthened the responsibilities at</p>

<p id="030:00">
Had to take their oversight responsibilities for monitoring the
financial solvency of the LME MCOs and so the governor had proposed
eliminating, removing the $6.1 million reserve. Item 47, the brain
injury association this is recurring funding of $225,000 and Susan
mentioned removing this funding from the competitive block grant process
under the central management division because we wanted to retain these
funds to be used exclusively for the contract with the brain injury
association of North Carolina. Item 48 is a house item only, this is
providing expansion of $5 million recurring for community based crisis
services. This was one of the recommendations that came out of the
mental health subcommittee of the joint HSS legislative oversight
committee and these funds are to be used to develop crisis services in
the community to divert persons from going to local emergency
departments or having to be referred for in-patient services at the
state operated facilities. Item 49 is also a house only item, it’s for
unpaid LME liabilities for about $7.3 million nonrecurring. For several
years the department has been carrying over some liabilities of funds
that it owes to the LMEs in prior years from budget shortfalls and so
they would withhold the last payment for June and carry it over to be
paid out of July which would create a shortage for the upcoming fiscal
year. This is $7.3 million is being provided to address that issue with
some of the LME MCOs. Item 50 is critical time intervention, this again
is a house only expansion of $750,000 nonrecurring. This is again
another one of the recommendations that came out of the mental health
oversight committee and it is providing funds for short term case
management services for persons who are leaving the in-patient
psychiatric facilities, adult care homes, and other institutions. Item
51, the final item is a house only item. It is providing $41,000
nonrecurring expansion for assistant technology to be used for persons
who have mental and other disabilities who are transitioning from
facilities to live in community based settings. There were several
governor’s items that were modified. The items 43, 44, 45 and 46 had
really been combined into one item in the governor’s budget with a zero
impact. It was basically the governor’s basically identifying about
$10.8 million in reductions which he was then proposing to transfer to
address the shortfall in the facilities. That item was not taken in the
senate and also in the house. The house just took the resulting $6.1
million and took the cut to the risk reserve. Another item that was in
the senate budget but was not included in the house budget was an item
to close the Wright school. And Mr. Chair that concludes the mental
health and public health and Mr. Owen will now come, oh I’m sorry one
more on page G16 for the division of vocational rehabilitation there’s
one item that was a governor’s item, also it was in the senate, and that
was reducing the budget through operational efficiencies by about
$575,000 recurring and that was basically from the elimination of about
21 full time positions but equivalent to 11.95 general fund equivalents
from several of the units within the division and it would not affect
the delivery of services. Steve Owen will now come up to do the health
services regulation and Medicaid.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Ms. Thomas. Mr. Owen.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chairman, Steve Owen with the fiscal research
division. Beginning on page G17 is a health service regulation. Item 53
is a governor and senate item. What this is is a new receipt where costs
will be allocated through the Medicaid administrative claiming process
to create a match through the Medicaid program of $263,000. Item 54 is
also a governor and senate item. This is budgeting over realized
receipts for the health care personnel registry. Beginning on page G18
is Medicaid. Item 55 is a senate item only. What this is recognizing a
reduction in the contract for high tech imaging services with..</p>

Item 56 is a senate modified item. The senate budgeted $9.4 million, the
house has $8.1 million. What this does is implement ??? new retention
for the assessment under the physician UPL program for UNC and ECU. Item
57 is a senate item only. What this does is reduces the payment for
hospital outpatient services at UNC and Vidant Hospitals to 70% to be
consistent with other hospitals in the state. This is a reduction of
$6.1 million. On page G19 item 58 is a senate modified item. This
appropriates nonrecurring funds to address the projected shortfall from
this year. The senate had budgeted $143.8 million, the house has $75.3
million. Item 59 provides funding to change the pricing methodology for
paragard IUDs so that they’re consistent with other IUDs. Item 60
provides $100,000 nonrecurring for a dispensing fee study, and this is a
house item only. Item 61 is another house item only, this provides $4
million to restore the 3% reduction taken January 1st, 2014 that will be
effective January 1st of 2015. This restores the 3% reduction that was
taken in last year’s budget item for the shared savings plan. Item 62 is
a senate modified item. The senate had budgeted $200,000, the house
budgets $300,000 nonrecurring to provide funding for a study to look at
personal care services to really design a new program as well as look at
the adult care home inspection processes and procedures. Item 63 is a
house item only. This provides $1 million of funding for consultants,
contractors, and staff to perform or to support the Medicaid reform
process.  There are a number of items in the governor’s and senate
budgets that were not included in the house budget, specifically in the
governor’s budget the governor restored $6.2 million of savings that was
put into last year’s budget for provider payments under the shared
savings plan. This was handled through the rebase in the senate budget.
The governor also had a reduction for private duty nursing rates to
create a differentiated rate for ??? vs. LPNs. The governor had a
reduction of $1.2 million. The governor and senate also had $6 million
reduction for mental health drug management which would have implemented
prior authorization for these medications. The governor and the senate
also had an assessment for LME MCOs of just under $60 million. It was
ultimately proven that we could not do that. The governor and the senate
also had a budget reduction to increase the retention for the hospitals
gap assessment plan from 25.9% to 28.85%. This would have resulted in a
$15 million reduction. The senate had included an item to de-link the
eligibility for county state special assistance individuals. It would
have affected about 5,200 individuals. The senate also had eliminated
the medically needy individuals as eligible. This would have affected
about 33,00 individuals and would have reduced spending by about $3.6
million. The senate also had frozen the case mix for nursing homes which
would have reduced spending about $2.2 million. The senate also included
the implementation of average acquisition cost for drug pricing as well
as a change in dispensing for a net impact of $975,000 savings. The
senate also had a 2% rate reduction for FIFA service providers. This
would have excluded nursing homes, it would have excluded all cost based
providers, it would have excluded those providers where CMS sets the
fees or the payment rates, it also would have excluded the LME MCOs. The
senate also had a single base rate for all hospitals which would have
resulted in about $10.8 million reduction. The senate included a
provision for personal care services so that the rates would be adjusted
down further to compensate for the additional 50 hours that were added..</p>

As a result of the state plan amendment that was just approved. The
senate included a rebase of $206 million. The senate also had
non-recurring funds for consultants, contractors and initial staffing to
develop a new organization for division of medical assistance. Health
choice begins on page G21. Item 64 is a governor modified and it was
also in the senate budget. The governor had budgeted $8.5 million
surplus in the rebase and the senate and house budgeted 14.5. Item 65
was a governor and senate item. This realigned and readjusted
administrative expenses to reflect expenses more in line with what
they’re actually spending today. In terms of health choice there was one
item that was included in senate budget that was not included in the
house budget and that was the impact of the single base rate for
hospitals. Mr. Chairman that concludes my presentation. Joyce Jones is
going to comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Owen. While we’re in
transition, your other document, special revisions, I would remind the
committee that if you have amendments, please request those of the staff
by noon. And that way the staff can work on it over the break and we can
come back at 1:00 and deal with amendments. Ms. Jones. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and good morning members of the committee. I
am going to be walking you through your special provisions for the
health and human services part of the budget. And we are actually going
to start on page 72. My colleague Lisa Wilkes will cover section 12A.1
on page 71 when she comes up. Right now we’re going to start in the
division of central management and support. Page 72 of your packet.
12A.2, funds for state-wide health information exchange. This is
identical to a senate provision. It follows the money, and you’ll notice
that in subsection A it states the general assembly’s intent to maximize
receipt of federal funds for state-wide health information exchange,
with the non-profit entity known as NCHIE leading these efforts for
fiscal year 14 15 in hopes of receiving a sufficient amount of federal
matching funds to eliminate or reduce participation fees imposed by the
non-profit entity on hospitals that are required by law to connect to
the HIE network. Beginning with fiscal year 15 16, it is the general
assembly’s intent that the department of health and human services would
take primary responsibility for drawing down these federal funds.
Subsection B requires the division of central management to allocate a
sufficient amount of appropriated funds to the non-profit entity NCHIE
to represent the state share for maximum amount of approved federal
matching funds for allowable Medicaid administrative costs related to
the HIE network. The next provision 12A.4 on page 72, this is a new
house only item. It repeals last year’s budget provision that required
the department to implement system modifications to the replacement MMIS
also known as NCTracks by January 1, 2015, in order to allow contract
entities like the LME NCOs to perform Medicaid claim adjudication within
the NCTracks system. The next item, 12A.5 on page 73, funds for
replacement MMIS. This is a new house only provision but it is
technical. It follows the money. It simply revises the amount of prior
year earned revenue that may be used for the replacement MMIS during
fiscal year 14 15, for consistency with the money report. The next item
on page 73, 12A.6, funds for NCFast. This is again new, a house only
provision that follows the money. It just revises the amount of prior
year earned revenue that can be used for NCFast during fiscal year 14
15, again for consistency with the money report. I’ll be turning now to
the division of aging and adult services, so if you could flip with me
over to page 81 of your packet, page 81. Section 12D.1 clarification of
eligibility for state county special assistance program. This is a
senate modified item. The house version clarifies eligibility for
special assistance with respect to age and disability. As Debra Landry
previously stated, the senate version set</p>

<p id="045:00">
Eligibility for this program at 100% of the federal poverty level
effective November 1st, 2014. The House provision does not include that
adjustment.
Subsection B. The House version does not include a subsection B. The
Senate version just grandfathered eligibility for all SA applicants
approved to receive SA prior to November 1, 2014.
Page 82. State, county share of costs for special assistance program.
Section 12(d).2 This was identical to the Senate. In order to implement
proposed reductions for the SA program, this deletes the statutory
requirement compelling the department and county DSSs to maintain the
appropriations for this program at the same level as in the fiscal year,
12-13.
Page 82. 12(d).3 Examination of ways to improve the public guardianship
system. This is also identical to a Senate item. By October 1st, 2014,
the department is directed to develop and submit to the HHS Oversight
Committee a plan for improving the process by which it evaluates
complaints pertaining to wards under the care of publicly funded
guardians, as well as a plan for transitioning wards to alternative
guardianship arrangements when a guardian of a person is unwilling or
unable to continue serving. It requires the department to study whether
use of coordination services would safeguard against a conflict of
interest from guardian service paid providers. This is also identical to
a Senate and House bill. And, again, as a recommendation of HHS
Oversight.
On page 82. 12(d).4 Status reports filed by corporations or
disinterested public agents serving as guardians for incompetent wards.
This is identical to a Senate item. It amends the contents of status
reports filed by corporations and disinterested public agents serving as
guardians for incompetent wards, and it requires more detailed
information about the ward’s wellbeing and about efforts to restore
competency, seek alternatives to guardianship, or seek opportunities for
more limited guardianships. It authorizes the clerk or other interested
party to move for modification of orders appointing guardians. This is
similar to a bill that is currently Senate Bill 803 or House Bill 1179.
It’s a recommendation of the HSS Oversight Committee.
On page 84. 12(d).5 Development of strategic state plan for Alzheimer’s
disease. This is a new item. It only appears in the House budget, and it
adds to the statutory duties of the Division of Aging and Adult
Services. The development of a strategic state plan for Alzheimer’s
disease, and that plan must address 16 different issues related to
Alzheimer’s.
Page 84. 12(d).6 Reinstatement of volunteer development program as a
service under the Home and Community Care Block Grant, or HCCBG. This is
also a new House only item. It also is a governor’s item. It requires
the Division of Aging and Adult Services to reinstate the volunteer
development program as a service category under the Home Community Care
Block Grant. And it allows counties to use this program to provide
services to older adults from these funds.
Moving now to the Division of Public Health, page 84. 12(e).1 Children’s
Developmental Service Agencies. This is a Senate modified item.
Subsection A requires the department to close four of its state operated
CDSAs by January 1, 2015. This differs from the Senate in that the House
is also requiring the department to consider expanding its use of
contractor-operated CDSAs in order to continue delivering uninterrupted
services in the areas that will be impacted by the closures. It requires
the department to report to HH Oversight identifying the CDSAs selected
for closure, as well as any plans to expand use of contractor-operated
CDSAs. And that report is due March 1st of 2015.
Subsection B also requires that for the 14-15 fiscal year, the
department maintain the same eligibility requirements for this CDSA
program as existed on June 30th, 2013.
Page 85. 12 (e).3 Increased fee for private well water testing. This is
an identical Senate item. It follows the money and it was also in the
governor’s budget. It increases the fee for analyzing water samples from
private wells from $55 to $75. And it expands the Division of Public
Health’s authority to test</p>

<p id="050:00">
And charge the fee for analyzing water samples not only from newly
constructed wells, but also from existing wells. 12B.6 operational
efficiencies for office of the chief medical examiner. This is a new
house only item. It changes the current method of appointing medical
examiners. The chief medical examiner will still make the appointments
but will no longer be bound by referrals by the county medical society.
The chief medical examiner must give preference to physicians licensed
to practice medicine in the county, but may also appoint licensed
physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, coroners or EMT
paramedics. Subsection B requires the division of public health to study
and report to HHS oversight any inadequacy of the current fees paid by
the state and counties for death investigations and reports. And as well
as for autopsies. Subsection C directs that a portion of the money for
this office be used to establish an oversight system to achieve greater
operation efficiencies and approve quality assurance of death
investigations. It also requires the department to develop and implement
uniform protocols for conducting death investigations in accordance with
established best practices. Page 86, 12B.7 is an adjustment to the
reporting date for diabetes coordination. It extends the deadline by one
month just to make it consistent with the due date for a similar report
on chronic care coordination. Both reports are both due on January 1 of
each odd-number year and this is a new house only item. Moving on now to
mental health, page 86 12F.1 traumatic brain injury funding. This is an
identical senate item. It requires that $2.3 million of funds
appropriated to the division of mental health, developmental
disabilities and substance abuse services be used to support specific
TBI services, namely contracts for the brain injury association of North
Carolina and Carolina’s rehabilitation to support TBI specific
residential programs and to support individual consumer requests for
support as deemed necessary by that individual’s LME and primary care
physician. 12F.3 report on strategies for improving mental health,
developmental disabilities and substance abuse services begins on page
87. This is a senate modified item. Subsection A requires the department
to develop and submit a report to HHS oversight on various strategies
and plans for improving delivery and availability of mental health,
developmental disabilities and substance abuse services. The house
amends subsection A3 by inserting a reference to the Medicaid state plan
definition of facility-based crisis programs for children and
adolescents. Subsection B of this provision requires the department to
report to HHS oversight on the development of a comprehensive strategy
for addressing the dearth of licensed child and adolescent inpatient
psychiatric beds throughout the state, and meaningful outcome measures
to assess the impact of impatient treatment at our ??. This was a
recommendation of the HHS oversight committee. Section 12F.4 on page 88,
report and plan regarding budget shortfalls within the division of
mental health, developmental disabilities and substance abuse services.
This is a new house only provision. By December 1 of 2014, it requires
the department to report to HHS oversight on the budget shortfalls
resulting from liabilities associated with community services for mental
health, developmental disabilities and substance abuse, and state
operated health care facilities under the jurisdiction under the
department. 12F.5 funds appropriated to implement recommendations of the
joint legislative committee on health and human services regarding
behavioral health crisis services. Page 89, this is a new house only
item. It requires the division of mental health to use $5.2 million of
the funds appropriated in the 14 15 fiscal year to increase the number
of behavioral health urgent care centers that provide outpatient crisis
services and facility based crisis services at the same location. It
also requires the use of those funds to increase of facility based
crisis centers designated as involuntary commitment facilities with
priority given to those areas of the state currently experiencing a
shortage of these</p>

Types of facilities as well as to provide reimbursement for services
provided at those centers. And finally it requires the department to use
funds to establish facility-based crisis centers for children and
adolescents. Moving on now to the division of health service regulation
on page 89, 12D.1. This is just a technical correction to last year's
certificate of need exemption for replacement of previously approved
equipment. Page 90 12G.3 is a study of expansion of healthcare cost
reduction and transparency acts to additional healthcare providers. It
requires the department by December 1st of 2014 to report HHS over site
it's recommendation for extending that out to additional healthcare
providers. And this was a recommendation by one of our legislative
research commissions. On page 90, 12G.4 Moratorium on Home Care Agency
Licenses for In-Home Aid Services. This is a Senate-modified item.
Subsection A, the house version extends this moratorium by two years
until July 1, 2016. it was set to expire this year on July 1st. The
Senate version made this moratorium permanent, and required that the
general assembly take legislative action in order to lift it. Page 90,
prohibition on using tanning equipment. This is a new house-only
provision. effective on October 1st, 2014. It increases the minimum age
for the use of tanning equipment from 13 to 18. And it repeals the
exception for youth below minimum age presenting written prescription
from a medical physician. Mr. Tanner, that concludes my provision and
now Lisa Wilkes will come up and review her areas. Thank you.
??
Good morning Mr. Chair and members of the committee. I'd like to ask you
to turn back to page 71 of your provision packet. We have one provision
that will cover regarding the division of central management and
support. On page 72, item 12A.1, HHS Competitive Grants Process
Provision. This is a Senate-modified provision that follows the money,
and under subsection A, it removes from the competitive grants process
and funding the brain injury association and North Carolina and
maternity home. And it also clarifies the reference to source of funds.
It also provides the additional $375,000 for the competitive grants
process and is distinguished from the Senate version. It removes from
the funding, the competitive funding, the Big Brothers and Big Sisters
Triangle Funding for the fourteenth-fifteenth fiscal year. Now if you
turn with me to page 73, we'll begin the division of child development
and early education. Page 73, item 12B.1 Childcare Sub C rate provides
co-payment. This is a senate modified item and it follows the money as
well. Under subsection A, it says beginning October 1, 2014, it
establishes new eligibility levels based on a percentage of the federal
poverty level versus 75% of the state median income which is current
law. Again, it says for ages 0 to 5, as well as any child with special
needs, the poverty level will be 200% and for 6 to 12 year olds, it will
be 133% of poverty. Termination. This is again the distinction from the
senate version, which did not allow for maintaining current eligibility
until re-determination. Also another distinction, is that is referenced
September 1, 2014 as the beginning date. Subsection B, it says beginning
October 1, 2014, it revises the co-payment to 10% for all families
regardless of family size and requires full co-payment for part-time
care so there's no longer a pro rated care for that group. Again,</p>

Speaker 1: …version, had it at September 1-20-14. Subsection B1 is new
to the House version only, and it states by January 1-20-15, it requires
DCDEE to revise its subsidy policy to include in the policy’s definition
of income unit a stepparent, stepparent’s child, and nonparent relative
caretaker, or the caretaker’s spouse or child when the parent of the
child receiving subsidy is not in the home. It also makes various other
clarifying changes. On page 74, Item 12B.2, Smart Start require
fundraising assistance, codify 10 of MOE requirement: this is a Senate
modified item; subsection A, which is new to the House version, requires
NCPC to hire three staff to assist local partnerships with grant writing
and fundraising. Again, the Senate version does not have this
subsection. Subsection B is the language that codifies the $52 million
10 of maintenance of effort required of local partnerships. Page 74,
Item 12B.3, Study Child Care Subsidy 11 and 12 year olds: this requires
DCDEE to study child care subsidy for 11 and 12 year olds to determine
available options for before and after school care, available resources
other, than subsidy, to pay for before and after school care, and
average cost of care for 11 and 12 year olds. A distinction with this
House version is that it requires the report to include separate
findings and recommendations for each age group. Page 75, Item 12B 4,
revised child care allocation formula: this is a Senate modified item;
Subsection A1 makes a conforming change based on the revised income
eligibility of child subsidy under Section 12B 1 of the act; Subsection
C requires the department to include the market rate increase in, versus
outside, of the formula when implementing the formula under subsection
A; subdivision 1 of subsection A further provides, beginning 2014/15,
the department is to use 1/3 implementation of new census data
allocation formula for every two years, however, for the 2014/15
allocations, a county that did not have a subsidy waiting list in the
2013/14 fiscal year, does not receive an allocation based on the
allocation formula; also, beginning 2015/16, a county whose spending
coefficient is below 95% than the previous fiscal year, does not receive
an increase in its allocation in the following fiscal year, or 2016/17.
It also provides for a waiver based on this last exception, due to
extraordinary circumstances, and it also would requires report by the
department due October 1 of each year, on the number of counties granted
the waiver pursuant to that subdivision. Subdivision 2 provides that,
immediately upon the release of new Census data, the department show you
1/3 by annual implementation reflecting a six year phase in approach for
each census cycle thereafter. Again, the Senate version had a new
Subsection B that requires that any reallocated funding, in the 2013/14
fiscal year, become part of that counties allocation in future fiscal
years. Beginning with fiscal year 2014/15, the revised formula applies
to both increased and decreased allocations. Again, the Senate version
did not contain Subsection C. Moving on to page 76, Item 12B.5, child
care market rate adjustments, this is a new House only item, and it
adjusts market rates for 3-5 star rated child care centers and homes to
40% of the difference between the current market rates and the 2015
study market rates. Page 76, Item 12B.6, NC pre-k audits, this is new

administering the NC pre-k program be subject to audits required under
current law. Page 76, item 12B 7, Childcare License Certification by
DHHS. This is a new House-only item and allows the division to assume
responsibility for issuing certifications for childcare early educators.
Moving onto the Division of Social Services, page 76, item 12C.1, Child
Protective Services Improvement Initiative. This is a Senate-modified
item and it follows the money. Under subsection A, it provides various
findings and intent regarding child protective services, and these are
based on various findings under the HHS Oversight Committee. Subsections
B through F again relate to items that my colleague Deborah Landry
referred to, based on the funding for various items under the
initiative. Subsection B provides 8.3 in funds for CPS workers to reduce
caseloads to the recommended standard. Subsection C provides funds for
in-home services for child safety and protection, family preservation
and prevention of abuse and neglect. Subsection D provides funds for
nine positions to enhance oversight of child welfare services in county
DSSs. Subsection E provides funds for a pilot program to enhance
coordination of services among the various local agencies involved in
child welfare services. It requires a progress report to the Senate and
the House of Representatives’ HHS appropriations committees and fiscal
by March 1 2015, and requires a final report to HHS Oversight by March 1
2016. Subsections F provides fund for an independent comprehensive
statewide evaluation of the state’s CPS system. It list the specific
criteria to be evaluated and requires a report to HHS Oversight by
January 1 2016. There was just one slight distinction in one of the
listed criteria. Instead of saying “any funding needs” under the list,
it says “adequacy of funding”. And under subsection D, it requires DSS
to study conflicts of interest regarding public guardianships and CPS.
This was a recommendation of the HHS Oversight. Again, it lists out the
criteria to be studied and requires a report to Senate and House
appropriations committees as well as fiscal research by February 1 2015.
Page 78, item 12C.2, Clarify Work First Family Assistance Income Levels.
This is an item identical to the Senate, and clarifies that Work First
Family Assistance income eligibility and payment levels remain unchanged
from the levels in the 2013-14 fiscal year. Page 79, item 12C.3, Eastern
Band of Cherokee Indians, Assumption by Tribe of Various Human Services.
This is an item identical to the Senate. Under subsection B it provides
the purpose, which is the enable to eastern band of Cherokee Indians to
assume responsibility of certain human services. Under subsection B, it
provides that beginning October 1 2014, the tribe will begin assuming
responsibilities for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or
SNAP, and in doing so, state laws relating to the provision of SNAP
services by the county DSS for members of the tribe shall not apply to
the tribe, and the responsibilities relating to SNAP are delegated to
the tribe. It also provides that by October 1 2014, and with the
exception of services related to special assistance, childcare and adult
care homes, the tribe shall assume responsibilities for certain other
programs of public assistance, and in doing so, again, the state laws
relating to the provision of those services will no longer apply to the
tribe, and the responsibilities relating to those programs will be
delegated to the tribe as well. Subsection C revises the law to add a
new subsection to require that once a federally-recognized tribe assumes
responsibilities of certain human services programs previously performed
by a county, the county is no longer legally responsible. Subsection D
revises current law…</p>

services commission, this is a new House only item, and it revises
current law that governs membership on a social service commission to
have 13 members appointed by the governor and a general assembly: 5 of
those appointments will come from the governor, 4 from the speaker, and
4 from the president pro tim. It also further requires each appointing
authority to appoint at least one member form the east, west and central
regions of the state. Subsection B expires the terms of all current
members on the commission: it requires appointment of members in
accordance with this subsection by October 1, 2014. And lastly, if you
will turn ahead with me, I am going to cover the block grants provision,
this is on page 102 of your provision packet. Page 102, Item 12J.1,
block grants, this revises the HHS block grants and it also follows the
money. Just to give some highlights: it appropriates nearly $93 million+
grant funds for the 2014/2015 fiscal year. A few items of note: it
provides NC pre-k swap out of 10 block grant funds that matches the
reduction of general fund appropriations, it increases funding of child
subsidy in the child care development block grant, and 10 contingency
block grants as well. In the provisions, beginning on page 114, there is
a clarification to the requirements of the outreach plan, and that is to
Subsection 12J.1T, regarding the low income energy assistance program
block grant, and the change to the outreach plan is to ensure eligible
households are made of assistance, ensure the plan includes efforts by
county DSS’s in contacting other local agencies, outreach and the
receipt of applications, and it also requires prior approval of the plan
by county DSS or the human services board. And lastly, there is also
funding provided to establish a calling center for veterans. Mr. Chair,
that concludes my remarks, and my colleague, Mr. Ryan Blackridge will
continue with DMA.
Chairman: Thank you Ms. Wilkes, and we will call on Mr. Blackridge.
Blackridge: Mr. Chair, members of the committee, Ryan Blackridge. I am
going to cover about half the Medicaid provisions and then Jennifer
Hillman is going to come up and cover the rest. Medicaid is on page 91,
it starts with 21H.1. You will recall, when we went through the Senate
Budget, the Senate had a very lengthy 12H.1 which called for both
reform, and for some reorganization of the department. This provision
does neither of those, instead, it states that the $1 million, dedicated
to Medicaid, may only be used for remain, not for any other purpose.
Sections 12H.2, 12H.4, 12H.5, 12H.6, are all identical to what was in
the Senate, and in the interest of time I will just mention that and if
you have any specific questions we can address those later. Turn to page
92 please, Section 12H.8 deals with drug reimbursements…</p>

<p id="075:00">
Speaker: …the federal government is considering switching to average
acquisition costs. It is a different methodology than what we currently
use in the state. Just as a reminder for drug pricing, there is the cost
of the ingredients that the state pays, and there is also the cost to
dispense the drugs. Average acquisition is going to be lower ingredient
cost as what we have right now. So what this provision does says if the
federal government does make that change then the department needs to
increase the dispensing fees so that, on the whole, the change is budget
neutral for the pharmacists. The Senate provision wasn’t conditioned on
the federal government requiring the change, instead, it made it
effective January 1, and it required a savings of, I believe, $975,000.
So again, the House version is budget neutral on adjusting those
dispensing fees. Section 12H.10 is a contracted study of personal care
services. Most of this language was in the Senate version. The Senate
version had this study, but additionally had some adjustments to the
rates that Steve already talked about in the money report. The House
version does not have those adjustments. Over on page 93, 12H.11, that
is identical to the Senate. There is a statutory requirement for report
– just haven’t been receiving it. This is a directive to the department
to reinstate those. Section 12H.12 deals with regional base rates. This
is different from what the Senate did. The Senate required a shift to a
state wide based rate for hospital services. This modifies last year’s
budget provision to require the department to perform a study of what
those rates might be, and then come back and report those. Continuing on
page 93, 12H.13: this provision deals with the supplemental payments to
UNC and ECU physicians. This is very similar to what the Senate had,
with two changes that I would like to point out: on the top of page 94,
lines 1 and 2, an additional requirement that the supplemental payments
shall not be made for services provided in Wake County; and also down on
line 28-30, you will see two percentages, those percentages are
different than what was in the Senate, which had 28.5% - that
corresponded to a percentage change on the hospital provider assessment
program that the Senate made and the House does not make that change, so
it retains that 25.9%, which is what the hospitals currently pay under
their assessment. 12H.14, Subsections A and B are the same as the
Senate’s, it is a repeal of the shared savings but it does maintain a 3%
rate withhold. It clarifies that withhold although is a true reduction.
At the top of page 95, though I would like to point out: line 8, the
item there, i.e. nursing homes, is struck through, that means that
nursing homes, effective January 1, 2015 will get their 3% back. This
differs from what the Senate had, which struck through items 4-7, that’s
optical services and supplies, podiatry, chiropractors and hearing aids.
Section 12H.18 is new to the House. The Senate had something different –
it had the [xx] LMEO assessment – that’s not included in this budget;
instead, there is here an assessment on 1915C innovation waivers. There
is currently an assessment on intermediate care facilities for
individuals with mental retardation, also known as IFCMR. There is an
assessment on those entities, but the 1915C innovation waivers are an
alternative to that. So there are several states that are trying to get
the federal government to allow an assessment on those services. The
federal government currently does not allow that. What this provision
does is give three year authorization to the department to implement
those waivers if the providers of the services are agreeable to the
implementation. So it is conditional on federal government, changing law
regulation, and also those providers agreeing to it. I would like to
talk about one more provision, before Jennifer comes up, that is over on
page 100, 12H.36. There is a provision here regarding the appointment
and confirmation of the Medicaid director.</p>

This is new to the House. It would require that the Medicaid director
position be recommended by the Secretary of Health and Human Services,
actually appointed by the Governor, but subject to confirmation by the
General Assembly. There’s some additional details here on some of the
mechanics. It would be an appointment for a five-year term, and they can
be removed for some of the grounds that are set forth for removal for
commission such as malfeasance and nonfeasance, but the idea with this
is that it would be a five-year term of office. With that, Mr. Chair,
Jennifer Hillman will cover the rest of Medicaid. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Blacklidge. Ms. Hillman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chair, members of the committee. My name is Jennifer Hillman. I’m with
the research division. I’m going to continue on with 12H.20, which
begins on the bottom of page 95 in your packet. This is a
Senate-modified item. The Senate provided for the elimination of the
CC&amp;C contract, and this House provision instead directs DHHS to
submit – sorry, to draft wavers, to allow primary case management
entities such as CC&amp;C to require duel eligibles to enroll in primary
case management programs. It also allows LME-MCOs to do primary care
case management for duel eligibles with a primary diagnosis of mental
illness. It requires a report of the draft wavers to the appropriations
subcommittees. Item 12H.21 is a Senate identical item. It was also a
recommendation of the LOC. 12H.22 on page 97 is a Senate-modified item.
It requires the consolidation of program integrity contracts into one
program integrity contract covering the functions of post-payment
review, data analytics, medical necessity reviews, investigations,
recovery audit contracts and pre-payment reviews beginning September 1st
2015, and prohibits the department from entering into contracts for
these functions that would extend beyond that date. 12H.26 on page 97 is
a Senate identical item. It clarifies that DHHS may include two related
findings in one notice of overpayment, and clarifies that DHHS may use
contractors to send notices to providers. 12H.27 on page 98 is a
Senate-modified item. The Senate version made additional changes to the
recipient appeals process including shortening the deadline for filing
an appeal, but the House provision only makes one change which would
allow for the dismissal of a case – of a recipient appeal case – if the
recipient requests mediation but does not attend the mediation without
good cause. 12H.30 on page 98 is a Senate identical item that follows
the money. 12H.31 on page 99 is a new House provision that requires DHHS
to issue a request for proposal for a contract to manage the statewide
non-emergency medical transportation services, beginning January 1st
2015. 12H.32 is a new House provision that directs DHHS to study the
practice of reimbursing for ambulance transports that would direct
individuals in mental health crisis from the emergency department to an
alternative appropriate location for care. DHHS is to examine current
pilots, including the Wake County advanced practice paramedics pilot,
and requires a report on the findings to the appropriations
subcommittees. 12H.33 follows the money. It requires DHHS to reimburse
for the ParaGard IUD using the same methodology as used for other IUDs.
12H.34 is a new House provision. It directs DHHS to report on the PACE
program. It actually requires two reports – one in September of 2014 and
one in December. It requires a report on the number of individuals who
are being served and in which service area they’re being served, the
cost of serving them, cost of serving them in the PACE program as
compared to cost of serving them in a nursing home, as well as a
proposal of how to make the program more sustainable. And then 12H.35 is
a new House provision that would exempt individuals who are currently
served by the 1915 BC waivers from the Medicaid county of origin
requirement. It requires individuals to be served based on their current
county of residence and requires that 1915 C slots be portable on
counties. And that concludes the Medicaid provisions, and I believe that
concludes our review of…</p>

<p id="085:00">
All the provisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you very much. The staff, both fiscal research
and the legislative drafting staff have worked very very hard and very
long hours over the past few weeks so thank you for not only the reports
this morning but the work that you’ve been doing over the last few
months. Okay we will open it up to questions by the committee members.
We’ll start with Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I think I asked this question
earlier maybe during the senate presentation but I’m interested in the
swap money for TANF. It looks like either that we got new TANF money in
or else that we have cut some programs that were funded by TANF earlier
so if you could clarify that again for me.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ms. Landry.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir Deborah Landry with fiscal research. There is
an additional about $7 million more in regular TANF funds and then there
are additional TANF emergency contingency funds also that were received
by the state in order to do these swap outs so there is no cut to any
programs.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Other questions? I know we went through this very fast.
Representative Earle.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. I just want to say that I like this budget
much better than the last time we were here looking at budgets and I
want to thank you for that. I have a couple of questions, I don’t have
them all together but one jumps out at me. On page G7 number 22 the
decrease in the state county special assistance case load, could
somebody help me understand at one point this was a very popular program
if I’m thinking about what I think it is, it was a very popular program
and it was almost like we had a waiting list for people wanting to get
on state county special assistance and be able to stay at home and not
have to go to a facility so I’m trying to see if I can get a little
explanation as to why the case load has gone down to the point that we
can take $4.2 million from that? I don’t know who would address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] We’re going to ask Ms. Landry if she would respond to
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Deborah Landry again with fiscal research. There are
actually three different special assistance programs or three programs
within special assistance. There’s adult care homes, special care unit,
and then the in home program. The in home program is continuing to grow
but the other two programs have seen reductions in their case loads over
this last year and of course when we put together the budget over the
last few years there was increases for each of the two years of the
biennium so those increases aren’t needed for next year as well as the
reduction in the case load in those areas. In home is a lot less
expensive even though it’s growing than the adult care home and special
care units which are decreasing.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’m sorry but I’m not sure I understood everything you
were saying. Could you? We’re talking about state county special
assistance where adults get..
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up, I’m sorry. Where adults get assistance to
stay in the home is that?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The state county special assistance program was
actually originally created to provide assistance for individuals to be
in adult care homes and so the adult care home population had been
increasing over the years and then over this last year it’s been
decreasing. There’s only a small portion of the program, the in home
program was created a few years ago to try to help people stay in the
home and it’s a much smaller program out of the whole special assistance
program and it does continue to grow, but it’s a less expensive part of
the program than the two programs that have a decreasing case load.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, got you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Thank you Ms. Landry. Ms. Farmer-Butterfield,
Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair. My question is on page G18 number
57. I wanted clarity on the statement on the reduction and settlement
percentages being factored into the supplemental payments. Could you
give me a little bit more specifics in terms of what that will mean to
the hospitals involved?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Owen.

Speaker: …are settled to 100% of the cost, hospitals receive 70%.
Reducing them to 70%, as other hospitals, if they are treated as other
public hospitals are, what will happen is that the dish plan will
actually restore that 100% , the effect of this reduction will actually
be felt in the private hospitals, what it will do is remove dish funds
that typically go to those hospitals, to restore this, and those
hospitals will receive less dish funds, will require them to put in more
of their gap plan assessment, so that is where the effect of this
particular reduction will be felt.
Chairman: Representative Enscoe
Rep. Enscoe: Thank you. This is also a question I asked of the Senate
Budget, and I do not have the page of that one, the changes in the House
changes of the child care subsidy, could somebody tell me how many
children will be losing subsidy. I think in the Senate budget, 10,000
lost but we were adding 5,000 back; so, can you tell me under this
budget, how many children will be losing subsidy support?
Debra Landry: This is Debra Landry again with Fiscal Research. What I
can tell you Rep. Enscoe is that over the course of a year, in state
fiscal year 1213, the average monthly children receiving subsidy are
about 77,000, but over the course of a year, there is over 110,000
different children served. So, the number I have is over the 110,000
different children served. So for ages 0-5, there would have been about
2100 children that would not have received, with the new eligibility,
about 9800 for age 6-12, and about 7 for children ages 13+. So, that is
about 12,000 children, out of the 110,000 served, that, with the new
eligibility,  would not have been served. What the House does, by
reinvesting those savings into the child care subsidy waiting list,
there is about $500,000 that is going towards the subsidy waiting list,
which, I will find how many children that is in a second, when we
annualize all the changes from the eligibility changes that is
reinvested into the market rate and the child care subsidy rate on an
ongoing basis, there are about 2100 children that will come off the
waiting list.
Rep. Enscoe: Okay, thank you. I have a couple of other questions. On #36
in the many report, child and family support teams, so, this is
eliminating the administrative support for the school based child and
family support teams, and so, I believe you said that program was fully
implemented and functioning and that these administrative support
positions were not needed because they were only part of the start up?
Did I get that right?
Denise Thomas: Denise Thomas, fiscal research. Yes, Rep. Enscoe. If you
recall a couple years ago, the funding for child support teams was
eliminated from the social services budget and the mental health budget,
and it was done so because that was only start up funding, and was only
provided to about 14 of the 100 counties. It was operating in all 100
counties, and so the other counties were using their own funds and at
that time, the funding for those two divisions were eliminated, for the
family and child support team. So this eliminates the final child and
support team that is there in the department because they were provided
to get the program started, initiated, and it has been running for quite
some time. So these are no longer needed.
Rep. Enscoe: Just a follow up to that question. So, the child and family
support teams are functioning across all 100 counties – I would be
surprised if they are in every school?
Thomas: They are functioning – the initiative is operating in every
county
Enscoe: Those are school based teams, they are not social services teams
– they collaborate with the social services?
Thomas: That is correct. It is a collaboration between the LEA’s, the
social services, and the health departments.
Enscoe: Okay, thank you. Then I have #46, this has to do with a
reduction in the LNE general administration…</p>

That was money held in reserve for risk management so do the LME MCOs
still have significant fund balances? We’ve looked at that several times
so it is true that they have issues with cash flow where they need to
actually have money to pay bills before they get reimbursed.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ms. Thomas
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes Representative Insko they are still required to
have their risk reserves and their fund balances, this is not the risk
reserve that each individual LME MCO retains, this was an amount of
money that was held at the department in case there was a problem with
some financial insolvency by one of the LME MCOs and they needed to pay
the providers.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Okay thank you. ??? review the projected Medicaid
shortfalls that were in the governor’s budget, the senate budget, and
the house budget so we can just sort of see the differences in those and
if anyone has any comments to make, I’m not sure how those figures are
reached, but if we could just see a difference that would be a help.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ms. ???
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Insko, ??? on fiscal research. Is your
question relevant to this year or to 2015?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Projected shortfalls.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I think she’s talking about the $75 million that we put
in there to cover this year’s shortfall.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] This year’s shortfall. There are shortfalls projected
in both, there is a shortfall this year and the projected shortfall in
this year is different.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Correct. What’s being put into the budget in the house
budget, the $75 million represents the liabilities that are going to be
carried forward from this year, from this fiscal year, which pretty much
is the backlog. There will actually be in this fiscal year a cash
surplus. We have a backlog of liabilities that amounts to $75,250,000
and that’s what’s being put into the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] So are those figures the same in the governor’s budget
and the senate budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The senate budget had $143.8 million. The difference
between the house budget and the senate budget, the senate budget had
been forecast using a backlog, the worst case scenario for backlog on
claims and enrollment. The house budget used the governor’s backlog
numbers to actually run through the model, that’s what’s in the house
budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] How about next year’s budget? Have we come to some
agreement what the Medicaid budget will be? Do you project a shortfall
for next year too?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The senate budget had $206 million included as a rebase
for next year. I believe in the house budget it’s $117.8 million.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Okay thank you. And I want to make a comment, and I’m
not sure where this is, but there’s a provision I believe in the special
provision that has a study done of why we are having repeated shortfalls
in the MHDDSAS budget and then at the same time, and I don’t know where
this is either, you all are asking for MHDDSA to spend $5 million on I
believe it’s on establishing crisis services. Did I get that right? Do I
have those two things right? So I’m curious about and I think we are
concerned about the shortfall and part of the problem is that when we
send somebody to a state institution we pay 100% of that and when we
have people coming in through the emergency rooms and rotating in and
out of the state facilities it’s hard to project how many people it’s
going to be so that’s really hard to project how much money is going to
have to fund the state facilities. This is a comment, when we have so
many people who have mental illness who have no health insurance at all,
it’s very hard to get providers to provide care for them and so they end
up more often in our emergency rooms and so one way to keep them from
going into the emergency rooms and the state institutions is to put more
money into our mental health services that are funded for the IPRS
system that’s funded..</p>

…percent with state dollars. Our population has grown. We have more
people in this state with mental illness problems. If anything we’ve cut
that fund. We haven’t expanded it. It makes a lot of sense to me that
that division would have a shortfall every year. In addition to that,
I’m curious about how you can…I mean I support setting up these crisis
centers. I think it’s really important to do that. I’m curious about
taking the money out of MHDVSA. Was that? Maybe I’ve got the wrong?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Thomas. Let’s see if we can clear that up. (metallic noise)
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Denise Thomas, fiscal research. Representative (??) the money is not
coming out of the division. There are two separate expansion items being
provided. One is the 7 million dollars non-reoccurring to address some
of those shortfalls and liabilities that is owed to the specifically to
the LME NCO’s from prior years. That should help a little with paying
them back for community services that they had provided but hadn’t yet
been paid for. Then there is that second 5 million dollar reoccurring
expansion item specifically for crisis services in an attempt to address
all of the people who may be referred to…(interrupted) that is new money
to provide new types of crisis services. Particularly, urgent care and
facility based services to divert persons from going into the
facilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And, that will help cut down the shortfall in the division? Because if
we can get people provided with services they’re less likely to go into
the state institutions. If we could just get them into homes, and with
jobs, we would reduce that expense even further. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A lot of work by the sub-committee over the last several months on
mental health. A lot of that is incorporated into this budget which I
think is a very positive step as you say. Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I want to ask a question about guardianship on page
83. It’s section 12-d 4 around line 25. What, 39 maybe? My question is,
are we putting more mandates, un-funded mandates as well as more work on
the guardians? If they have to have notaries in terms of the status
reports that are already being required in the statutes anyway? Some
clerks require that they be notarized, and many don’t. Those who are not
in an agency, such as local social services, and don’t have notaries
with them in their offices such as the corporate guardians, they’re
going to have to make sure that they find someone to notarize them. I
believe there’s a cost for notaries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Jennings, you want to see if you can respond to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, on page 83 there is new language that requires corporations or
disinterested public agents to submit more detailed information in their
status reports. This is an expansion of the information that will be
required. The intent is so that the courts will have better information
about the status of these guardianships. One of the issues that we heard
during the sub-committee is that there is a need perceived to have
greater oversight of these guardianships so that the ward’s best
interest would be attended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Much of this has already been recorded in the reports that I’m familiar
with. They were created by people many years ago who had to do them for
the courts and there was no formal form in place to use. The thing that
I’m particularly looking at here is medical and dental examinations.
Those reports, they are many times difficult to get from doctors and
dentists who are very busy. I’m thinking that a summary might be
realistic and some documentation on attempts to get that information
when you don’t get…</p>

summary on the phone from a nurse who never talked to you. I think that
might need to be amended somewhat. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll look at that.
Representative Ford? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Page G7
25, were counties picking up the slack on this, and how many projected
workers are we talking about statewide? G7 25. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms.
Landry? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ford, the counties in the ?? at
one point had 4.5 million dollars directly for child protective services
workers. When they lost that money, how each county reacted to it I
can’t specify. I’m sure some counties did different things, but they are
required to provide child protective services. And then the additional
money that’s here was to ensure there was to be about 71 workers to get
the caseload down to10 per worker. This was based on old data because
the Division of Social Services didn’t have current data, and it was
before they lost the federal funds. The counties lost about 23 million
dollars in federal funds coming into this year that were used for child
protective services and child welfare services, and about 40 counties
were over the recommended rate of 10 per county, and many counties even
had over 20 per worker. So about 4.8 million dollars would be about 71
workers, so it would be about 140 workers, but some of it will be used
to replace money they were receiving for workers, so I can’t say it’ll
be that many additional workers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Proceed. Go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I know some case
workers that had 20 plus, but I thought the recommended caseload was 12,
but 10 is… what did the 10 come from? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Landry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Deborah Landry again. The 10 is in the Division of
Social Services Child Protective Services Manual. They’ve said it’s 10
per worker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Martin? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have a clarifying question I think probably for
Ryan on the prescription drugs, and two things. One: we’re not
addressing at all the mental health component that was included in the
Governor and Senate. Is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, that is
correct. There was a prior authorization requirement in the Senate
budget that is not included in this House budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well
I’m glad about that; I think that might have cost us more in the long
run. And the second one, where you were explaining the changes, just to
make sure I understand that there’s not really any change in the House
budget on… It’s just if the federal budget changes then there’ll be
provisions, so there’s not any change in the prescription drug. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, that is correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, and second
question, Mr. Chair? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Proceed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This
is just more of an overview to make sure I understand. Several times we
talked about the money is being moved from a grant to a different place,
and I heard this will have no impact on services, and I think we talked
about an area where it will impact services is possibly on the childcare
subsidies where we changed that formula, and in the Senate budget there
were provisions that definitely had an impact on eligibility that we did
not include in changing our Medicare eligibility, and then there’s
several things on personal care services and then on pre-K with the
changes. So the bottom line is, can you highlight for me areas where we
are decreasing services to individuals in this state that fall out of
this budget? It seems to me we’re not really… we’re not eliminating the
Wright School, so are there things that come to mind? I think this is
well done – great job on the budget overall – but I want to make sure I
understand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Jacobs back here, behind me. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Martin, member of the committee, you’re correct.
The majority of eligibility changes, specifically those that decrease
eligibility, are not included in the budget, and those included are
changes in state county special assistance, changing how the eligibility
was delinked form the maximum payment. Maximum payment is out. The two
eligibility changes that were in Medicaid are out. The one area that you
mentioned was child protective service, and while I think Deborah gave
some specific numbers on how those are changing, it basically is
changing who will qualify rather than the number of people who will
qualify, and the one primary thing that’s different in the House budget…</p>

…This does not immediately result in people losing their subsidy. It
waits until the next time the person is re-applying. Then that
eligibility is re-applied.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is significantly different in the house budget overall than it was in
the senate budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What about personal care services? There are a number of provisions
there. Is there any impact or long term strategy?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative (??). I’m sorry, Susan Jacobs, fiscal research. There was
a provision that required a reduction in the PCS rate because of the
additional fifty dollars that was passed last session. That item is not
included. Additional money has been added back into Medicaid rebates in
the house budget to take care of not requiring the rate to go down.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Earl?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. My first question is about, not really a total question. It
is on G-7 and 8. It is about the child protective services. I’m glad to
see that money has been appropriated for to reduce the case load. It
looks like 25 all the way to 30 are kind of connected.  I’m just glad to
see money has been put there to reduce the case load. I guess my
question and my concern is about the number 26, the oversight and the
evaluation. The oversight. Do we get any kind of follow up on that
oversight? Specifically, I see where it says that they’re going to be
looking at, but I’m still concerned. I’m very disturbed about what’s
happening with our children across the state. It’s always something
where a worker didn’t follow up with information that they received.
There’s something going on in Mecklenberg in Gaston County right now and
it’s just terrible. This oversight. Who gets a report on the oversight
that is currently being done and what this additional funding… I mean,
will we get to see what they…what they’re looking at? What the results
of this oversight. I see where the evaluation. We’ll get that in a year
and half. I’m just concerned about the oversight. If they’re just
reporting to each other what they’re finding. It’s still going to mean
where the system is going to get better. To me there ought to be more
answers. Better than what we’re doing now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Landry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Deborah Landry, fiscal research. On item 26 of the hands
oversight of county child welfare services. This will be under a
division of social services that will be have the staff. There will be
staff that goes out into the county. The division of social services
does have some reporting online. There is not any specific reporting,
special divisions at this point from this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there something…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, I’m sorry.  Is there something that maybe we could put in a
provision that will get us more feedback information of the report with
the oversight? I’m just not happy with what’s going on across the state
with our children. As far as abuse and neglect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative. Members of the Committee. Susan Jacobs in fiscal
research. You pointed to item 28 which is the child protective services
state wide evaluation. I will tell you that fiscal research thinks that
this is a critical item. We want to be in a position to help make
recommendations to the general assembly on how to improve the child
welfare system. We believe that this evaluation needs to include both
the state functions as well as the county functions. There’s a long time
allowed for this because we wanted it to include both the state and
county functions. We hope Representative Earl that after this evaluation
is complete, we’ll be in a better position to inform both LOC as well as
the general assembly appropriations committee on where you can actually
make improvements. Frankly, it is a matter of not having all the data
that we need to be able to evaluate which counties where we are lacking…</p>

We hope that this evaluation will help that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I want to move to another issue. About the tribe. Is this
something that the federal government is directing us to do or is this
something that the tribe is requesting. Or, is this something that we
are imposing on them. I just don’t quiet understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Wilks?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lisa Wilks, legislative drafting. Representative Earl, as we understand
it, this is something the tribe has requested regarding this transition.
They have already transitioned and are in the process of doing other
functions and this is just additional responsibility that they are ready
to begin the process of assuming.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We were told they were already doing it. They asked for this provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more follow up. The liabilities … I’m sorry. It’s about the unpaid
LME liabilities on number 49 on G14. That 7.2 million dollars that’s
going to be given to them for I guess the unpaid liabilities. Now, if
some of these LME’s I’m assuming this is liabilities that they have
incurred over the past whatever. Some of these LME’s have I guess merged
or done something that they no longer exist as they did at that point.
Where is this money going to be going to and does it just, whatever the
liability was going to be at this point does it still apply? Or was it
just going to one entity? If you could just explain to me how that’s
going to be used.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before we go to stand, just a reminder that we are approaching the noon
hour and we will break. If you have any requested amendments please go
ahead and proceed to get those to the stand. They can work on those over
the next hour. Ms. Thomas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Denise Thomas, fiscal research. Representative Earl, we haven’t received
an up to date listing of the individual liabilities. But, at one point
it was almost 20 million dollars that was owed to about ten of the LME
NCOs. Right now, as written the flexibility is left up to the department
as far as how they would use this one time money to pay back those LME
NCOs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin you have one last question and then we’ll break.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. This is another general one on all the administrative savings
that we are asking the department to come up with. It sounds like they
are mostly coming from vacant positions, were there any positions that
were eliminated? Secondly, we have a lot of discussion in the oversight
committee on IT issues. I see in here we’re funding these programs and
not other programs. Is there a comfort level that we have the money
needed for IT or is that covered in a separate budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Jacobs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin and members of the committee. The two IT systems
that were included for funding in the governor’s recommended budget are
being identified and paid for with receipts. They are included at the
governor’s recommended amount. Of course you have a separate IT section
in the complete money report that we had an analyst in our division call
in and can probably give you some information on how the statewide IT
funds are being handled. As of right now, in the Senate budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We need to break. The Sergeant at Arms will secure the room over the
lunch break. We will need to clear the room and then we’ll start back
probably about one o’clock and go through any amendments. If we finish
early that’s okay too. We’ll leave early. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman if you would please take your seat. We will be
starting momentarily. We are in the process of getting everyone into
positions to start on their amendments for this afternoon.</p>

While we’re waiting to get the amendments logged in, I’d like to welcome
a new group of pages for this afternoon. When I call your name, if you
would please stand and be recognized. Halley Turner, Mecklenburg County.
Chad Wiley, Wake County. Taylor Nordon, Wake County. Zacheas Raspberry,
did I get that right, from Lenore? And Tate Repeledge, from Wake County.
Thank you guys for being here. [PAUSE] We’ll start with an amendment put
forth by Representative Susan Martin, S 744-AMG-49 version 1. It’s being
distributed to committee members. [PAUSE] Representative Martin, would
you explain your amendment please, ma’am? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, yes ma’am. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I think they’ve distributed my amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ve got it. Yes ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Thank you. This is a
very simple amendment. It’s on page 89, dealing with a facility based
crisis. This came up earlier today. The work that we did in the mental
health subcommittee, where I was able to co-chair, and then since that
time we’ve had a working group with the department in trying to figure
out how to move that forward, and this is just a very minor change in
the wording of that, the outpatient crisis services and facility based
crisis services could be co-located, or operationally linked. And this
is just a practicality, that they’re not always the same, in the same
building. So operationally linked is recommended by the department in
order to make this happen, and I would ask your support of the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Martin. Are there
any questions from committee members regarding the proposed amendment?
If not, then all those in favor please say aye. All those opposed please
say no. The amendment passes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Next we will take up an
amendment by Representative Insko. S44-ALU-29 version 4. Representative
Insko, would you please explain your amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Madame Chair. Members, if you will look on the budget bill, page
109 line 12 and 13, you will see that there’s an increase in the
appropriation to the Carolina pregnancy care fellowship. This is
actually an umbrella group that has a network of pregnancy crisis
centers across the state. And my amendment has to do</p>

<p id="125:00">
With the services that are provided, not just by those organizations,
but by any organization in the state ,including Planned Parenthood, that
provide reproductive healthcare services or educational reproductive
healthcare counseling. First of all, there’s a misunderstanding about
abortion in general. I was on an airplane one time, flying somewhere,
and the woman across the aisle from me was having a conversation with
her seat mate. And she was talking about a presidential candidate who
was pro abortion. And so, I did say, “I happen to know that person and
that person’s not pro abortion and as a matter of fact, no one is pro
abortion.” That we all would like to reduce the number of abortions. And
so I am fine with crisis pregnancy centers that help women who want to
have their pregnancy go to full term, who want to have their child
adopted, who want to go ahead and raise that child. I think that any
Planned Parenthood, also if a person goes into Planned Parenthood, and
they want to put their child up for adoption, Planned Parenthood
facilitates that. If they want to keep that child, Planned Parenthood
facilitates that.
But some of the crisis pregnancy centers do not provide information on
both sides of the issue. For example, one of my earlier sessions here in
the General Assembly, it was brought to my attention that some crisis
counseling centers only talk about the dangers of abortion and how
abortion is dangerous. I mean any health condition is dangerous. But
it’s also true that carrying a child to term and having a child, child
birth, is actually more dangerous, creates more healthcare problems and
more deaths than abortion. And so it’s really important for people to
provide both sides, non-directive, medically correct health
information. And so that's all this amendment does is just says that
anyone whose receiving tax payer dollars under the Maternal and Child
Health Block Grant, should provide comprehensive, non directive
reproductive healthcare counseling. So if there’s any Planned Parenthood
organization that’s not providing options about adoption, and carrying
your child to term, this would require them to do that. And if there’s
any crisis center that’s not  talking about the options, especially of
contraceptive health, they would be required to do that. So this is a
neutral amendment and I hope you’ll support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are there any questions from members of the Committee? Representative
Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanted to ask the sponsor of the amendment a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko, could you tell me what the opposite that’s going
on right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I beg your pardon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you give me an example of how it’s being done right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I’m sure that there’s a variety. First of all, the crisis
pregnancy centers really are not healthcare providers. They’re not
licensed healthcare providers. Some of them have a medical staff
associated with them, some of them don’t. And so typically, at least
some of them, will require a person to watch a film that talks about the
dangers of abortion. But it’s really one sided. And, with tax payer
dollars, that’s not neutral. It doesn’t explain all the options that a
person has and doesn’t really provide a person to make an informed
decision on their own. So that’s my goal is that a person has all the
options laid out and they can make a informed decision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions? Representative Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Statement. I don’t see how having a baby can cause more deaths than
killing the baby. And with that being said I’ll be voting no on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well it is…</p>

<p id="130:00">
A matter of fact that childbearing and childbirth is still dangerous.
There are still many medical conditions that arise with a pregnancy and
with child delivery. And we, our medical profession does a really good
job with that, but it’s still true that there are more healthcare
problems and more serious problems with actually carrying a child to
term and having a birth. That is just a fact of medical care. We do as
good a job, but sometimes you don’t intervene in a problem early enough,
so I hope that you would vote for this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any additional questions or comments? The Chair will take the privilege
of making a comment. I question, to some degree, if this is a true
budget item, and not a policy issue, and whether it belongs in a budget
bill. So, with that said, I still will let it go forward with a vote,
but I ask the members to consider making types of policy issues like
this when it needs much fuller, complete debate with the full body is
something we should avoid. So, at this time I will take a vote. All
those in favor signify by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those opposed signify by saying no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion fails. At this time the committee will be at ease for a few
minutes while we check to see if we have any additional amendments.
The committee will come back to order, and will somebody check outside
and see if it’s snowing. We have no more amendments. At this time I’d
like to make a motion. I move that the House Appropriation Subcommittee
on Health and Human Services adopt the Appropriation Subcommittee report
as amended. And further move that the staff be authorized to make
technical corrections and conforming changes related to reconciling the
various amendments adopted. And that the appropriate totals may be
adjusted accordingly. All those in favor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would just like to speak on that motion, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
By all means.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would to, once again, compliment the Chairs of the Health and Human
Service Appropriation Subcommittee for doing a really good job. You did
a good job last year on the budget, and you followed this year with
another good budget. So, thanks a lot for your work.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further comments or. We don’t mind hearing more kudos. By all means,
please. I want to make those midnight meeting endings worth it. So,
therefore, motion to approve, as stated earlier, those would signify by
saying yes if you’re in favor of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. All those opposed. Motion carries. Thank you very much. There being
no further business that I know of, meeting is adjourned.</p>
