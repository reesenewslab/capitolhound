  I&#39;ll be whatever you need me to be, whatever gets us through this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have one page here today and his name is Bryson Hill. How are you,
Mr. Hill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Where are you from Holden Beach, Brunswick County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, man.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What year are you in high school?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m in tenth grade at West Brunswick High School.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have plans to go to college?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, maybe UNC State.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There&#39;s hope yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a sergeant at arms, it&#39;s Barry Moore, B.H. Powell, and David
Lippum. We have two bills for today and one of them is involving my
seatmate, Julia Howard, if you can sit right there and explain the bill.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that controversial. We have a PCS. It&#39;s a
motion by Representative Arp to have the PCS before us. All in favor say
aye, those no, and the aye&#39;s have it. Ms. Howard, you&#39;re
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Davie County has a rather unique situation. The
folks that have been preparing the meals for our inmates have retired
and so their contract was terminating anyway and they are no longer
available. The county commissioner&#39;s went out to bid and we only
received one bid back and that was also that we would have to spend
about $200,000 to upgrade for commercial kitchen. Since we don&#39;t own
the land where the jail is, it&#39;s owned by the state and we&#39;re
only leasing it, and of course that&#39;s a big expenditure, we
didn&#39;t feel that was a very good option. We also asked four
non-profits, different non-profits if they would be willing to prepare
the meals and it&#39;s seven days a week, three meals a day. So the
agreement now is that the Davie County school system will prepare the
meals for the inmates for the county. It&#39;s just a unique situation
and, Mr. Chairman, I&#39;ve talked to everybody I know. It is not in Mr.
Riddell&#39;s bill, and I hope it don&#39;t get [??] in that twist, but
we just have a unique situation and at the appropriate time I would move
for a favorable report, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any que4stions of Ms. Howard? If not, I have a motion for a favorable
report. Any further questions? If not, all in favor of the motion let it
be known by saying aye, those no, and aye&#39;s have it. Thanky ou, Ms.
Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next one is Representative Lambeth has a bill. Representative Arp, moves
to have the PCS before us, all in favor say aye, opposed no, and Mr.
Lambeth, you&#39;re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thakn you, Mr. Chairman, and the PCS cleans up the bill some, so
there&#39;s nothing material in that. Actually this is a very simple
bill but it has generated lots of discussions and interest in this bill,
just to remind you that an advanced directive is also known as a living
will, in which a person specifies what actions are to be taken regarding
their health if they are no longer able to make those decisions on their
own. Because these documents are central to effective planning for
healthcare and end-of-life decisions, North Carolina, like many states,
has statutory forms for advanced directives which can be completed by
laypersons. North Carolina is one of only four states that require both
a notary and two witnesses to execute the documents. Those states, South
Carolina, West Virginia, and Missouri. In North Carolina, among other
conditions, a qualified witness may not be a relative of the person
signing the document, a member of the signer&#39;s medical team, or an
employee of a treatment provider or nursing facility where the signer
resides. Because conversations regarding health care planning often
occur

  while it is in House bill 117, which is $20 million for primarily big
projects. It&#39;s a grant. It&#39;s not a loan. This is completely
different. This would be available all throughout the state, not just a
few, particular states. The terms of the loan, depending on your tier,
is 0 or 1 or 2% interest, secured by first lien by the state. Now it
also has a provision suggested to us by some bankers that in some cases
banks might be willing to lend, in these relatively depressed areas, if
they had equal priority with the state&#39;s loan. Not higher priority,
not lower priority, but just equal priority. So that&#39;s a provision
that was put in at the suggestions of bankers, of one of the high
muckety-muck bankers. This was endorsed by the Governor&#39;s Economic
Development Board, which expired last summer. But they did endorse this
concept, and I have here a letter from the Governor that he likes the
concept, and he had seen a draft of it. It&#39;s not the exact draft
here, but it&#39;s very close to it. So with that, I&#39;d like to ask
the chairman to recognize very briefly the other two primary sponsors,
and then four witnesses, and then be glad to take questions from anybody
else, or hear from anybody else, or amendments or whatever.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think Representative Stam said
it perfectly. This is about helping some of the parts of the state that
so desperately need it. Providing shell buildings so that we can provide
opportunities for businesses and the much needed jobs. This is about
loaning it to local governments, not private businesses. And I give no
better example of this is where economic development would make a lot of
sense. I was a primary sponsor on House bill 117. Skip was probably the
most forceful opponent to the bill. But yet we both agree this is the
correct path forward. I think it&#39;s a great bill. We certainly hope
you&#39;ll support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I thought this was a great idea
last session when it came forward, and I guess it just needed a little
more work. And I reached out to the economic development directors in
both communities that I represent, Wilson and Pick Counties, and last
year you recall that we did away with the eastern region. And they had
had a unique situation where they had the license plate funds that had
been collected and then were to be distributed out to the different
counties for economic development purposes. So that was unique and not
everyone had that, but both of my counties, their top priority for
economic development was to have a shell building. And they took those
funds and created a shell building and used it very successfully. And
support that it&#39;s not as easy for every community, and the more
rural who don&#39;t have funds available would most benefit from this,
and it would help all across the state. So I got a lot of input from
folks, and am very supportive and excited to bring this forward. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Stam. Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could just give you a brief introduction first of
Bob Leek who, while he&#39;s coming to the microphone, managed North
Carolina&#39;s recruitment program for 12 years, managed South
Carolina&#39;s recruitment program for 8 years, served as president of
Research Triangle Park, and he has worked in over 40 states with
companies looking for sites or new and expanded, basically he&#39;s had
45 years of experience.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Stam. Mr. Chairman, members
of the General Assembly, I&#39;m proud to be here as a supporter of bill
108, because after almost 50 years now, Skip, I have noticed many, many,
many times that the lack of ready-to-go sites and/or buildings has been
a real detriment to the attraction of business and industry to this
state. And I want to just go back a little bit. I started my career with
North Carolina in 1959 when Luther Hodges was governor. And as you may
recall, Luther Hodges was a real champion for economic development. And
later on, when I got my feet wet working with prospects that were
looking at North Carolina, I realized that many of the companies that
were looking here were not happy with the way our communities did not
have ready sites or buildings. So I&#39;ve grown up with that, and
therefore I&#39;m very, very supportive of this concept that you&#39;re
dealing with today.

  <p id="10:00">
  I think that it’s gonna be told many times that the local communities
are desparate to have product as Skip says on the shelf when an industry
comes to visit. When we started a program in North Carolina back in the
Scott Administration called the Governor’s Award Time Program, it was to
help the small rural communities get ready for industry and it was a
very successful program, more than 300 small communities under 20,000
population entered and won the governor’s trophy for that program. In
dealing with the small communities, though, it became quite apparent
that even though one of the requirements was that they have sanctioned
buildings available most of them didn’t have enough money to make that
happen in their small communities so this bill would go a long way I
think to addressing that problem and I know it continues to exist today
in many of our smaller communities so I’m very much in favor of this
bill. I hope it will pass and it will help the smaller towns,
particularly and all towns in North Carolina in the attraction of
business and industry and I leave you with one thought, when a industry
comes to look at your community, if you don’t have a site ready you
cannot hang that industry on a skyhook. It has to have a place to
locate, so thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Stam next speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well Steve Yost is
coming up. He serves as Co-Chair of the North Carolina Economic
Developers Association. He’ll speak on behalf of that group. He has lots
of experience. He’s also the President of the Southeast Economic
Development Region and Steve, you specifically speak about the need for
buildings as opposed to sites. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you
Chairman Ross and Representative Stam and the committee here this
morning. I’m Steve Yost and I’m President of the Southeastern Regional
Partnership. We are a regional economic development organization of 14
counties in the Southeast region and for those legislators who are here
this morning on the committee from the Southeast region you know that we
go from Wilmington to Wadesboro and Fairmont to Fayetteville, so we have
a big swath of Southeastern North Carolina, particularly rural areas,
rural counties in Southeastern North Carolina and the, I’m also a member
of the Board of Directors for the North Carolina Economic Developers
Association and also a Legislative Co-Chair of NCDA and we have several
of our NCDA members here today who are also local regional economic
developers, and we’re here to express our support for House Bill 108. We
think this is a very, very important piece of legislation to support our
efforts to be as competitive as we possibly can be in our economic
development recruitment efforts. The site building and development fund
I think would be a really important, useful tool, particularly for our
local rural counties in their efforts to attract and market their areas
for industry. I think all of you know that there’s a lot of factors that
go into recruiting industry. I won’t get into all of those but among
those is having really good quality industrial buildings to market. It’s
very, very important for counties to have that capability in order to
get recommendations, in order to get looks from prospective companies in
industries. In product development and particularly in developing
industrial buildings or shell buildings is one of the most challenging
aspects of economic development. It is, it’s an expensive endeavor to do
that but it’s a very necessary endeavor for us to be competitive and I
think what we’re looking for out of this bill is another tool that we
can use to help develop that product and those buildings that we need.
I’ve been a local, state, regional economic developer for 21 years. I’ve
worked with hundreds of industry projects, all in Southeastern North
Carolina and I can tell you what I’ve seen during that time working with
all of those projects, that product is absolutely critical for us to be
competitive and companies just are not going to consider areas without
available industrial buildings that are marketable, have infrastructure

  <p id="15:00">
  Sure. And that make the parameters and criteria that companies look for.
We all know how competitive it is in business and industry recruitment
and so I think with this particular idea, this bill, we’d have another
tool to kinda add to our toolbox to recruit to industry. As mentioned
earlier by Bob Leek this program would help all counties but I think it
would be especially helpful to rural counties who have the vision and
leadership to develop industrial buildings and sites and product but
don&#39;t necessarily have all of the capacity and the financing and
funding that they need to be able to do that successfully. And so we see
that as behind a key part of this particular bill and being able to help
them do that. I do want to say that we have several rural counties in
the southeast region, I know of others across the state, who have had
success in developing industrial buildings and sites and they have some
unique very proactive programs. If you had a program like this fund, it
would only enhance their abilities on what theyre able to do but I do
want to site one county in my region its Bladen county, its a rural
county, tier 1 county of 32000 people, that several years ago had no
product, no buildings and sites really to offer to industry and so they
developed their own regional, their own nonprofit real estate
corporation to develop those buildings and sites because they knew no
one else would come in and do that. Its been a successful program. It
can be even better with access to this sort of program. Last thing I
will say that I think is really good about this bill, we are not asking
the state in providing this loan program to be 100% responsible for
helping our local areas develop product but we&#39;re asking you to be a
partner, and to be a trigger in helping us to leverage other resources
in helping to develop this product and we think that product development
at least in general is most successfully done when you do leverage
multiple resources to get the job done. NCDA and my organization the
Southeastern Partnership is very very supportive of house bill 108 and I
will tell you we will put this program to good use if it were approved
and implemented. So we appreciate your time this morning.
(faintly) Thank you ??
CHANGE SPEAKER
Thank you. Representative ?? I&#39;d like to remind the speakers
let&#39;s try to keep it to two minutes if we can.
CHANGE SPEAKER
While repr-, while Crystal ?? is coming up Ill note that she is the
president of the Wayne county developer- development alliance and has
been head of Lincoln county economic development as well.
CHANGE SPEAKER
Good morning. Again, Crystal ?? with Wayne county development alliance.
I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to present before you. What I
want to speak about is just an experiences on both ends of the spectrum.
Coming out of Lincoln county, North Carolina, just a suburb of Charlotte
region, we experienced in that community back in the late 80s, early 90s
developing an  industrial park from private citizens who got together,
collected their money, build a speck building, and actually build a
couple of them in that park. It took quite a while to fill those
buildings and get that park rolling along. Fast forward to the end of
the 90s, early 2000, we had a private developer come in. We had 650
acres of land, a private developer saw the opportunity there and decided
to invest their money and purchase over half of that acreage. They came
in, developed that land. It was a great situation for us. We were a
rural county. We had great transportation between two major metropolitan
areas but we had no funds to develop a park or market in competition
with the people around us or the counties around us. This developer was
a great example of how that works. Fast forward again, we filled that
park up very quickly. Within 12-13 years. That 650 acre park was
narrowed down to only 45 acres left at the end of 2014 with 17
industries in there. When we went to develop a second park, the private
sector was not willing to do that.

to do that and this bill her will certainly help local bills local
communities local government economically in the rules sector specially
from the Lincoln county specially from the nice part of the state  we
don&#39;t have at anymore we don&#39;t have that ?? this bill will
provide us ?? toll and other tool box to have the option to use not

  Behind restricting these business, qualified business entities from not
doing a retail or professional office space, etc. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
These categories were suggested by the economic developers to
strategically limit it to those who have more to do with economic
growth. I mean these are all fine things but they’re not the kind of
things that multiply other things. These are more the consequence of
economic growth rather than the generators of growth. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So what kind
of qualified business are they looking for? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, so
many. I mean, manufacturing, anything not in that list. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I mean, if you wanted to delete
one of those or two of those it wouldn’t hurt my feelings, but this is
on the advice of those folks who are the experts in that area. So it’s
not just any building for any purpose, but rather things that will
really most strategically make the thing grow, and that’s the reason for
the strategic plan, the first thing you asked, so that this is not
coming strictly from the local government, just some good idea or some
cousin happens to own some land that needs to be improved, you know, but
rather it’s a strategic plan that Commerce is trying to locate these in
cooperation with cities and counties where it’ll make the most
difference. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m for the bill. I think it’s a good bill. I think
it’ll help a lot of the rural areas for which I represent quite a few.
That’s just a couple of questions. It doesn’t mean that I’m not against
it I was just trying to clarify some things. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Alright, next I have Representative Hager. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Stam, I have a couple questions
here for you. One, I’ll just jump down to the bottom of my list. Is it
possible at some point in time with this program and with a city and a
county creating a shell building could end up being in competition with
private industry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes and that’s why that would be
coming from Commerce particularly in areas where that is not an issue.
Like I’ll just give an example, the district I represent is one of the
most prosperous in the state. I would be shocked if they ever did one in
my district or Representative Jeeter’s district, but as we went around
the state we found a lot of places that just have nothing to offer.
Nothing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Is it possible, and have you,
and I don’t think you have, I didn’t see it in here, is there a
limitation, you say you wouldn’t see this happen in Wake County maybe in
Northern Mecklenberg County, or the great state of Mecklenberg County I
should say, Representative Jeeter, you say it couldn’t happen, but is
there any limitation in this bill that keeps most of this money as we
see in JDIG from flowing to tier three counties. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well,
actually there are parts of tier three counties where it might. I was
referring to my district not to all of tier three, and if staff could
help me find the page and line it does state that it is primarily for,
could you all help me fine it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Oni. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes there’s a preference in here when the
Department goes through and reviews applications for lower, less
developed counties. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, Page 2
line 35, right, page 2, line 35. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr.
Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You mentioned
another program that’s earlier by $20 million for bigger type buildings.
Is it possible that this legislation, I guess what I’m trying to say,
could you piggyback those two programs? Could someone that’s very smart
piggyback these two programs together and get a larger building with
this program also. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s not intended for that. Is it
possible? Yes. This is not in competition with NC, with House Bill 117.
Is it theoretically possible, yes, I would hope it wouldn’t be used for
that much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Last but not least, Mr. Chairman. Last
question, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At the
end of the day you talk about infrastructure, you  know, completing
infrastructure, these projects. Would this allow you to complete private
owned infrastructure such as gas lines or private sewage systems or
water lines, these infrastructures, or are you just talking about

  municipal systems and infrastructure. It&#39;s bringing infrastructure
to the site so it could be, I don&#39;t see any limitation that it could
not be a Duke Energy electric line to the site or a gas company to the
site, making private.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Next I have Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just kinda need some
clarification in trying to figure out the flow here. Initially I thought
this was, and I think, Representative Stam, that you cleared it up, that
it was a locally motivated idea that they go to the department and ask
for money and it&#39;s reviewed and given money. But I gathered from a
comment that you made, it&#39;s more department-driven as they look
statewide for economic development?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I may have misstated that. The strategic plan that
would be developed professionally would say what kind of places, what
kind of, types of structures and pad-readies??. But I do think it would
be, the specific applications would be driven by the local government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In that case, we have this build it and they will come
sort of mentality. Are we talking about that sort of speculative
building, or are we talking about things that are a little bit more
imminent in terms of being able to find a lessee or a buyer for this
municipal or county developed property?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, not if, it&#39;s not primarily designed for
something that is already coming. It&#39;s designed to attract people to
come, and I think, I received an email I think from Mr. Yost, I believe,
that 80 to 85% of all inquiries to local economic developers specify
that they want to see a building as opposed to a site. And if you
don&#39;t have a building, they just don&#39;t come, and even look at
other things. Now is it possible that you will occasionally have a
stranded building? Yes, it is possible, but that&#39;s possible today
where cities and counties can already do this with private financing or
gifts. What this is saying is the state will lend the money for the
cities and counties if it complies with the state&#39;s strategic plan,
where it is much less likely to be a stranded building, because then you
have Commerce also trying to push it as part of their, all the other
tools in the toolbox that they have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Final question follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On page one, in section C on line 31, where you talk
about the requirements for the non-profit, the issue in number two about
a non-binding pledge that the local governments have to enter into,
explain exactly who that gets off the hook and how it works and the fact
that even though it&#39;s non-binding, we&#39;re still gonna get our
money back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Realize first, the first line of defense for getting
your money back is, unlike almost any other loans that the state does or
grants or claw-backs, this is a secured first lien. So the vast
majority, if not all the money, will come from the property itself.
Then, if that&#39;s insufficient in the assets, I mean you have this
Economic Development Corporation. In other words, the non-binding pledge
is from the city or the county to the lender. It&#39;s not from the
Economic Development Corporation. And it&#39;s hard to get a city or
county to appropriate money for the future. You can&#39;t bind a future
assembly. But it&#39;s not as much of a practical problem here for the
very reason that I mentioned first. It&#39;s secured first lien on real
estate and all the improvements.
