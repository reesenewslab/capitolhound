[UNKNOWN] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. And thank you for
starting this year and I had a lot of conversations with our
Representative Jones regarding concerns he had for a constituent in this
regard. And then I also had concerns for constituents myself. So he and
I both ran parallel bills. And as time went on we saw how to two bills
could tie together. So we combined the two bills and that’s what you
have before you today. Section One of the bill has specific language. If
you remem, if you remember last year we transferred guardianships from
social, from mental health to social services. So in doing so Section
One prohibits a corporation from being appointed as a guardian for an
individual to whom it provides mental health without mental disability
or substance abuse services for compensation as a part of a contract or
other arrangement with a, an LME. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Randleman we
have a lot of committee members who say they’re ready to go. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Okay. Sounds great to me. [LAUGH] Well, I was a former clerk
and I can tell you I have appointed a lot of guardians, I overseen a lot
of guardians and this needed to be expanded to cover more people than
just immediate family. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And Senator Tucker moves for a
favorable report to the [UNKNOWN] committee’s substitute unfavorable to
the original bill. Any questions or comments? Hearing none. All those in
favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed? Thank
you. [SOUND] Committee stands adjourned.</p>
