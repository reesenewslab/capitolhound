Lets have the Finance Committee come to order.  First thing first, it
says the Sargent in Arms who helps us run a very smooth and orderly
meeting, Steve Wilson, Anderson Meadows and Justin Owens.  Thank you
folks for your help.  We've got pages today.  Dee Anthony, Senator Hunt.
 Dee?  Am I missing... Thank you, appreciate you being here.  I've got
Sara Finney, Senator Tucker, very good.  Jackson Yelvetin, is that
correct?  Yelvesin, I'm sorry.  Probably should probably put my glasses
on.  Senator Pate, Jenna Johnson, Senator Rabin, Mattie Tarte, Senator
Rabin, Spencer Hutchison, Senator McKissick, and Davis Colton, excuse
me, thank you.  Senator Woodrick.  Thank you very much.  We appreciate
it.  I hope you enjoy your stay here and find it very rewarding.  I know
Senator Rabin's Bill is first but we'll go ahead and we will take up
Senate Bill 159, which is requires certain general reappraisals.
Senator Tarte.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you Mr. Chair.  Can everyone hear me okay?  For
those are missing out on and waiting for Season 4 of Downtown Abbey, two
books that we are going to be working from today is Chris McLoughlin's
The Fundamentals of Property Tax, which is fascinating reading, and I
know Mr. David Baker from DOR here, appreciate you being here today
David, is dealing with the Machinery Act.  What we have is a Bill before
you that is to address three objects.  One is not to impede the current
work from Pearson Appraisal that they're doing on a number of appeals of
property tax valuation work in Mecklenburg County.  The second action
item is for Mecklenburg County to go through a process to update and
validate the tax data base records for all the residents in Mecklenburg
County, and then the third action item is to compel them to redo the
2011 property valuation.  The basis for that is an independent review
that was conducted by an outside appraisal firm that has determined we
had major flaws in that reappraisal work, which has led to a number of
invalid valuations. As a basis of this going forward, we really have
three purposes to see achieved from this action in this Bill.  One, is
again, to see this reevaluation corrected, as I mentioned, to restore
literally the trust and confidence in our county governments over this
process, and the last thing really the bottom line, is to ensure that
every property owner has a fair and accurate value determined for their
properties.  To give you a little background on this Bill, I think this
is a classic example where going forward we finally break down the
partisan lines.  This has  gotten support, and I reach out to my
colleague Senator Joel Ford, who has been a prime, primary supporter of
this Bill.  I thank you for that support for all of our residents.  On
the House side there is a companion Bill that is being run by
Representative Bill Brawley and Trish Cotham is the primary sponsors so
we have both parties represented.  For background, also note that the
Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners chaired by Pat Cauthen, who is
a Democrat, and all nine members of that Board have come and asked in a
resolution that we provide the vehicle so that they can redo this and
refund as appropriate on inappropriately assessed properties.  So, that
is the basis of this Bill and I would entertain any questions at this
point.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  I'm Senator Hise.  Just looking at Section 1 of the
Bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Yes Sir.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  It puts out a lot of qualifications for the county
that this applies to.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Correct.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Kind of summarize all that...does this apply to any
county other than Mecklenburg?
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Well, it potentially has the ability to apply to all
the counties in the state but when all four applied, at least to my
knowledge right now, Mecklenburg is the only county impacted.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Any additional questions?
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Senator Clodfelter.</p>

<p id="05:00">
I need to be able to answer this question when it's asked of me, what
happens if on this reappraisal it's determined that values were too low
on properties?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well let me answer both sides of that, Senator. If properties were
overvalued, then refunds will be due with interest, and if properties
were undervalued and increase, they will be assessed additional taxes
for those without interest. So you will owe back taxes if you are
undervalued.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Clodfelter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have been asked the question which I need to ask it to be sure I know
the right answer. There are taxpayers who contested their evaluations
and got them substantially lowered under the process of review. If the
new appraisal as of 2011 goes and raises that back up,  there will not
get the benefit of that process they went to to get it lowered?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well what happens in this process  is you will get an accurate and fair
value for your property, and you will have the ability per statute to
appeal that to determine or if you disagree with that valuation. But it
would, to your prior question, it will undo potentially or change the
value from what you had agreed to through any prior appeal process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think because of the fact that this  decision, the database was flawed
because it hasn't been updated in 17 years, and I hope everyone in this
audience takes close attention to the fact that there were serious
mistakes made, and it was flawed, and therefore it's almost like a brand
new re-evaluation to make sure everybody's treated fairly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just think we need to be sure that folks know what's going to happen
on that. I'm supporting your bill by the way,  but I just wanted to know
what kind of answers I need to give when we're asked, and I guess I'd be
interested in- do we have any sort of body who said it's okay to
retroactively collect additional taxes from people? ?I know you can give
the refunds,  but are we convinced that it's okay to go back and collect
more tax for a year that's already in the past?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure. Senator, here's the conversation we had with a number of sources.
I know Mr. Coen may be here, I thought I saw Jerry earlier, we talked
with Jerry from legal counsel, we talked with folk from the school of
government because our original intent was not to allow them to go back
and do that. Whether we can do that later on, but we've been told you
can't treat groups of citizens by different categories, therefore we're
required to go through that step.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dan, do you have anything  you would like to add to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That pretty much covers it. We did have discussions, as Sen. Tarte
mentioned, with the school of government specifically with Chris
McLaughlin who wrote the book, and it s a very good book, a useful book.
We talked with him, and we've had osme conversation with the dept. of
revenue and I think there were conversations with Jerry Coen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
Sen. Blum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, you probably answered this already Sen. Tarte, but the county
commissioner's  association have any position at all on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know, I really haven't heard from them one way or the other, and I
think that part of that was predicated on the fact that Mecklinburg
county board of commissioners. They're a full board on an aye/no vote,
endorsed going through a process that would enable them to re-fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any additional questions?
I've got Sen. Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Mr. Chair. On the question of going back when the property's been
appraised and it's been determined the value is too low, how many years
can you go back in arrears and collect your taxes for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dan, would you can help us with that please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well you'd only be able to go back to 2011, the year of the reval.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, your question answered?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Alright.
Sen. McKissick, question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me ask this: Under current law, I mean there's obviously the appeals
process through the board of equalization, but is there anything that
prevents a county from going in and doing the appraisals on a mass
inventory within their boundaries? I mean they don't have to wait 8
years, I've heard of people going in after 4 years and reappraising it,
is there some minimum window of time within which they cannot conduct
the reappraisal. See I know in Virginia, they're doing it  like every 18
months, every 2 years. Fairfax county and other places in Virginia, so
what is it under our current law that would prohibit them going back and
doing the math reappraisal that this bill apparently allows for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a great question, because I've got a Yale law grad and a Duke
law grad asking somebody who's never been to law school. I don't know
the specifics, other than that you have</p>

<p id="10:00">
Perform the revalue within 8 year period. I don’t think you can
necessarily go back retrospectively, which is the purpose and part of
the reason for this particular piece of legislation to enable that to
occur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wait a second, you got a question. Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A county can do a reevaluation as often as they like. Every year, if
they want. Practically speaking it would be difficult to do that because
of the amount of data. Usually they require at least two years. In terms
of retroactive changes that is specifically disallowed under current
statute. If you look at your summary, the first footnote addresses that
1.5 287c,  any change in appraisals and non general rebound year may
take effect in the current tax year only, and not retroactively. GS105
296i, changes made informally by the assessor prior to the first meeting
of the Board E&amp;R may effect only current year appraisals. GS105 322,
authorizes a board of E&amp;R to make changes  as permitted by G105 287,
as needed to result in timely filed appeals of the current years
appraisal in GS105 325 authorizes boards of county commissioners to make
changes only to the current year appraisals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So it seems like right now if the county has authority to have
retroactive application which is what this Bill will help accomplish.
And the commissioners all support it and they want the authority to do
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Think so. Daniel, anything you would add?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In terms of the authority, that’s true. I couldn’t speak to the county
commissioners.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Appropriate time. I’ll move for a favorable report. if it hadn’t been
moved for all ready.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Let’s go see if there’s any additional questions by the Committee.
Alright, see none. Anyone in the audience would like to spend a minute
or two in any comments. Alright, see none. I have a favorable report for
Senate Bill 159 from Senator McKissick. Any questions? Comments? See
none. All in favor of Senate Bill 159 favorable report, please say
“Aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed “Nay”. Ayes have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chair, one comment, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to thank all of you today for what you’ve done. Because you
send a huge message to the residents of North Carolina that we are
committed to doing the right thing by our citizens and being responsible
for our actions. This is a big day for the state as well as Mecklenburg
County. We have a number of residents from Cornelius and Mecklengburg
county here today, that have invested a year and a half of their time
ensuring this gets corrected. So I tip my hat and I thank you guys as
colleagues. Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Tarte. Okay, Senator Rabin. We have Senate Bill 268.
Sunset Beach Canal dredging maintenance fee. We should at least let him
say “hello”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister Chairman. This is a local bill that adds to the list
of four already so doing municipalities in  our area and up the coast
who charge a maintenance fee for dredging and maintaining their canals
on the beach property. That’s it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do have a favorable report from a Senator Jenkins on Senate Bill 268.
Any questions or comments? See none. All in favor Report for Senate Bill
268, please say “Aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed “Nay”. Ayes have it. Tomorrow we will have, I believe it’s
263, Senator Brock and it will be for discussion. Thank you very much.
Meeting’s adjourned.</p>
