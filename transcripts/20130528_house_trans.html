McKorn being present the House Committee on transportation will come to
order.  Our Sergeants at Arms today are Carlton Adams, Martha Parrish,
Young Bay, Jesse Hayes, and we have four pages today,  Elizabeth Paulson
from Wake, Savannah Putnam from Burke, Savannah Potee from Cleveland and
Lucy May Rascoe from Chowan.  First item on today's agenda is House
Bill, Giles Perry and Brenda Carter, our staff, as usual who will
perform brilliantly I'm sure as usually as we go along today and keep us
out of a lot of trouble.  House Bill 475 Ferry Tolling Alternatives.
Representative Tine is recognized or Representative Jeter is recognized
to present the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I do not believe we have a
PCS in front of us as the original bill.  In essence we have seven, I'm
gonna try to be brief and be happy to answer your questions.  We have
seven ferry routes in North Carolina.  Surprisingly we have the second
largest ferry system of all 50 states which was surprising to me, second
behind only Washington. Traditionally the ferry routes had been free.
We're in the process of getting ready to toll those ferry routes. Two
are tooled now are getting ready to extend those to the other five.  For
most people you think of ferry routes  as particularly on our coast
being Harris or ?? or whatever these most tourist routes.  You have to
remember a lot of  these like ?? Beach, Cherry Branch and some of these
things are commuter routes, people going forth to and from work every
single day.  So this is a significant impact on their life.  What this
bill attempts to do is to put off tolling for a year and allow the ferry
division of NCDOT and the local communities to come up with ancillary
revenue streams whether it be selling naming rights on the ferry lines,
whether it be selling advertisement actually on the ferry boat itself.
We're not going to allow permits of license on the back of the ferry
because I don't want that discussion again.  Also concessions in other
things.  So it's a way of looking at basically using advertising
sponsorship and concessions to augment the cost verses tolling our
citizens that have to use this to get back and forth to work everyday.
This is a bill that has got bipartisan support.  Representative Tine who
lives in that area.  Representative Iler who lives in that area.  Then
myself and Representative Torbett who are 250 miles away from the closet
one.  We all took a tour out there and toured the ferry system and met
with the people and we strongly believe this is the right thing to do
for the community and a good thing for the state and ask for your
favorable report.  We're happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Iler is recognized to send forth an
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman wholehearted support the bill,
except on one little detail.  The bill has got zero tolls.  There are
three routes that are tolled currently .  My amendment will do only one
thing, keep the tolls the same while we're going through this process as
they are.  This says May 1st, but basically as they are right now.
Don't change the tolls.  The Southport route and the two long routes I
call them will still be tolled at the current rate, will not go up, and
it will keep it just like they are now, not go to zero, not jerk DOT
around.  That's all the amendment would do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Jeter is recognized to comment on the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  We're not opposed to the amendment. It wouldn't  be
our preference, but we're ok with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I want to speak on the bill when we get through with
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Ok.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chair.  A question for the amendment
sponsor.  Does your amendment essentially negate the need for a fiscal
note?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I believe that would negate the need for a fiscal
note.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Could we confirm that with staff?  I believe that
would be correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative this would receive a serial referral
to finance and I think a fiscal note would definitely be required to be
presented at that time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chair.  Further discussion for the
debate on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Can I modify my response to Representative Moffitt?
What I meant was no fiscal effect.  I didn't know if it was a fiscal
note required or not.  I</p>

Speaker Changes: further discussion further debate on the amendment
Representative holly,
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr.Chair i got a question if this bill passes
and they come up with,
Speaker Changes: on the amendment
Speaker Changes: on the amendment that's what I'm saying what the
amendment parted this bill if everything goes to or the toes that others
go make the way if we always stay so they wont be considered as part of
the other five that means appropriation,
Speaker Changes: what I'm gonna ask with general AD to hold that
question to see whether the amendment pass or doesn't because that
really a question about t the would or not this specific on the

now debating the bill as amended the Representative holly is recognized

could be as not required to be Representative ?? ,
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr.Chairman when you were looking at
alternatives  what all do you a longer list than the list you have here
,
Speaker Changes: i mean in essence the list yours is is the list in for
of you we don't necessarily eliminate the list ?? we are trying
legitimate ways to waste revenue ?? coming back after second a fairy
system cost 35 million dollars to operate in North Carolina thus case in
area if we told every round money s cost to collect it if you talking
about somewhere Around five million dollars and then a 3.9 million ??
that a same ten percent of you will ?? in order to offset the total cost
and our point is we were trying to find ways operate ?? in what the
revenues would be created so we are looking in essence of five million
dollars and these are ways in what we could talk about the ??
representative ?? went out there and talked to the different peoples
these were things united with chambers and commerce and county
commissioners and E DC's and we will end of the business and we felt
like avenues that could raise funds necessary not to implement these
additional thoughts ,

Want to go, but they don't have a choice. We  went out there, and I tell
you  the one thing that hit me home. And  I'm gonna take a comment form
Torbett. Unless he tells me not to cos he don't know what I'm going to
say. People say, “well you knew they were on an island. You knew there
weren't roads.” But they also knew we had a free ferry system going to
that island. Trust me if we could fish I-12, highway 12. if we could
build this billion dollar worth of bridges, everybody on this island
would preferred it, because. We talked to a woman who had to take her
kid to a dentins. Its a three and a half hour trip. For a 15, 20 minute
dental appointment. Because of the way the system is working. Trust me
if they thought they could get a billion dollars of bridges build here.
You wouldn’t be hearing this. You be having this room packed full of
people. So they don't have a choice, to drive. There only option is this
NC ferry system. All that they are asking is that they not be penalized
for it. Well they could swim.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative  Starnes
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you mister chairman. Members of the comity, well is not a simple
solution to the problem, or we would've already figure out a long time
ago. But I think that under the current law, if nothing happens. The
fifteen dollars tolls are going to go to 27 dollar plus so much per
passengers. The tolls are slated to increase, and the reason they are
lated to increase, is because of the operating deficit that they have.
It cost more to operate them than the money generated. So I think that
what the bill sponsors have attempted to do. Lest see if there is
another way to generate income to help pay for this tolls. Whether you
get it as advertising, naming rights, charge for Internet access. Well I
think that, that's good. But I thing were I'm having trouble with the
bill is you should use this additional resources of revenue. To
complement the existing tolls not to supplant them. When you look at the
title of the bill and the intent of the original bill say.  An act to
remove mandatory tolling and I don't think we want to go back that far.
If you look at the language line 10 though 13 that's been stroked. You
basically says that we've establish a policy that Okra cock to Harris
ferry will be for free and the Nox island ferry will be free. Because
those are the only road access out there. They don't have another choice
but for the other ferries they are charging a fee. Representative Boles
amendment says that they can continue to collect the same amount of
fees. But I don't think we want to go in the direction of abolishing
all the tolls on the ferry system. Because we cant afford to operate
what we got. I poll the sponsors of this bill, of trying to find the
ways. To enhance the revenues by this alternative means. I don't thing
that you wanna say that one of the options is to remove mandatory
tolling. And I really think that we need to fix the title of the bill as
well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. chairman if I could respond real quick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Alright representative Jeter go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Starnes I'll be hones with you. I'm optimistic we are
going to be able to find enough money to offset the entire cost. I think
this is, do I think we can do it in year one, no. do I think we can do
it in year five. I don't know. This to us is the first step, in trying.
Even if we toll every one of this ferris you are talking a bout 5
million dollars, on a 36 million dollars cost. To toll it to the point
were it actually covered the cost would diminish the economic ?? the
community to a point. That the ferries almost become. You are going to
kill business. If the toll were at the level to cover the 36 million
dollars in total cost. So we are looking at ways of augmenting that. I
would like to think that at some point we could come up with enough
strategies as representative Bumgardner eluded to earlier. Are there
other avenues. I'm sure there are. But we haven't thought of them jet.
But to me this is a step, to  try to get us, to try to find a way to pay
for this system. With  out tolling someone that we don't currently do
for the most part in our interstate system. And for this people this is
there interstate</p>

Does remove mandatory ??, because the language in the bill is being
stricken through, says that the department shall collect tolls, as
established by the board of transportation. It also says, the board of
transportation shall establish tolls for all ferry routes. That is being
removed. The bill does in fact remove mandatory tolling?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
That means we don't have to change the title? Okay. Titles good.
Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I understand what the bill sponsors are trying
to do. This has been an issue, it has always been an issue. I think that
we should, today, move this forward. The bill sponsor said that it's for
one year. However, it does not say that in the bill. So, would you be
willing, with our amendment, we've now got a year. The tolls are staying
in place with no change to help the people on the coast that live there
and have to deal with this everyday of their life. It doesn't affect the
current revenue that's coming in for the ferry's, we're talking one
year. Would you be open to an amendment that would . . . I guess I'd let
staff find out where to put it in, but to put in here that in one year
you'd report back to transportation oversight with what you have found
through the department about the generation of new revenues.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Carney, would that be something we can take to finance,
because we're up against a hard stop at 12:50pm.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman, I'm totally open to that since I'm on finance. I just want
to make sure that the members of the committee that have concerns about
voting it out today, knowing that that will happen, that we'll give this
a year and we'll put this in finance in a bill, if you could support
this bill to move it forward. We need to have this conversation.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll try to be quick. I think this is a good
bill, I hope that the committee will support it. It may be something
that I am missing here, but I think of North Carolina, as largely having
a free systems to of roads for all its residents. We who live closer to
the mountains, I think, would be very disturbed if somebody said, well
lets start charging all of the tourist that come across the line and
they're going up to Chimney Rock, and Asheville, and Lake Laurel, and ??
Rock. We're going to start charging them a toll for going over the
roads. As I understand for these people, where this ferry runs there is
no other option, essentially available for many of them. When we talked
about tolling Interstate 95, we said we had to keep lanes open, because
we wanted to give people another option. And, if they choose to use the
fast lane and pay the toll, that's fine. I understand that between
Durham and Raleigh that they've an expressway, but it's not the only
route a person has to choose from. The proposed, Garden State Parkway,
maybe its not Garden State, Garden Parkway. Which may not get built
would be an alternative route that people could pay a toll on. This
seems to me inappropriate for tolling because there is not another
alternative. We don't want to spend the money to build the bridge, which
would be the traditional road, so a flatbed truck or a ferry seems to me
an appropriate choice. I feel like doing this for one year is the right
way to go.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Art.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, one quick question. I keep hearing about the year, I'm confused, is
that in the bill or what are we doing with the year?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
We just agree with Representative Carney, if you take me at my word, and
I hope you would. That we would make sure that that is included in
finance, that is the intent. It's not specifically outlined in the
current bill, we will fix that in finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Will somebody else give me their word?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Pittman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr Chairman. I move to favor a report on House Bill 475, as
it was amended to referral to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Pittman moves that the House Bill 475, as amended, being
incorporated into a new PCS, favorable PCS, unfavorable at the original
bill, referral to finance. Submitting in favor of the motion say aye.</p>

Opposed? Motion carries. Representative ??. House bill 556 various
special plates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll try and make it real quick. I had house
bill 556. ?? PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ?? moves PCS on 556 without objection, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The original house bill 556 was three innocent
little plates. This is the annual plate bill. And I had a first ??, town
of ??, and volunteers in law enforcement in the original bill we rolled
everybody else's requests into the annual plate bill and you see the
list on page one and two. Then you see the fees which accompany these
and I haven't found it in the bill, but I'm sure it's there, that if
they get up to three hundred applications for a plate they will be
produced. I believe that's the basics of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
After we handle these four amendments it will be the appropriate time. I
have one representative ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be correct Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is H556-ARWF-47 version two. YMCA. Does everybody got it? Does
anybody have it? Do you need to have it? Do you have city county clerk
?? clerks? Have you got the removed phi beta sigma fraternity? That's
representative Ford, I believe. Will you explain the amendment, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They asked to be removed. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion for the debate. Representative Ford moves that phi
beta sigma be removed at their request. All in favor say aye. Opposed?
Motion carries. Have you got YMCA now? YMCA issued motion by
representative ??. All in favor? Any further discussion? Further debate?
Hearing on the motion amendment for YMCA plate all in favor say aye.
Opposed? Representative Brown city county clerk change to ?? clerk.
Please explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. All this does is really take out the city part of
the bill and substitute the principalities for that and that will
include of course townships as well as cities. There's no objection,
it's just a clarification. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion. Representative ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How is the plate going to read? Is it going to have the acronym?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it will. Line eight will show you exactly how it will read. Further
discussion, further debate? In favor of the amendment say aye? Opposed?
Opinion of the chair, the motion carries. Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I've got a question for staff. Are there any
instances where the 300 plate minimum is waived or not considered a
threshold?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's included for all the plates in this bill. All must have 300.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. That's fine. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for comment, I think many of you may have been contacted about the
full background for the smokeys plate. That's not part of this bill.
That will be a separate discussion. Representative Carney recognized for
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to move to give house bill</p>
