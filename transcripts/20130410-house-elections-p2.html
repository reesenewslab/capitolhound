<p id="15:00">
a democrat and a republican in 2003 sponsored the bipartisan legislation
with the provision for signature attestation. Says voters have to attest
who they are by signing their name when they vote and there's a felony
charge against them if they lie. This simple procedure works. It has
been working for decades. It is not broken. Your own admittance and
admittance of much research is that there is no voter fraud. We've had
elections 237 years in North Carolina without a so called voter id. 237
years and only after the massive turnout of African Americans, Latinos,
Progressive Whites, Students and the Elderly fundamentally changing the
electorate in the south did the false witness and distortion about fraud
begin and the cry for voter poll tax disguised as voter id. It's those
of you pushing this bill are scared of true democracy. Scared your
narrow agenda may not be successful if all of us vote. Let the people
vote. You won with the people voting. Let the people vote. Since 2004,
?? North Carolina has had the greatest increase of voter participation
in the nation. SO, to say that North Carolina should be like other
states like Georgia or Indiana makes no sense. I went to Georgia last
week, Augusta by the way. My grandmother's from Georgia and the citizens
there contradicted the claims of the secretary of state Bryant Kent he
claimed here last week. People in Georgia say photo id requirements have
been hard on voters. They know the large number of people who cast
provisional ballots, who never return with the proper id. If one
person's vote is denied in this democracy, it is a violation of
everything we hold true. The same is true in the Indiana case. The
supreme court did not give broad approval for voter id laws. Indiana's
voter id cost ten million dollars even though when they were pushing it,
the legislation said it would only cost  700,000 and they did not
present one case of voter fraud in that case that would have been
prevented by voter id. When we go to court on this, the facts in North
Carolina are much different than in Indiana. This new poll tax,
disguised as voter id wants to require people without driver's license,
mainly the poor, the elderly, disabled, to obtain. We believe it
violates the principles of the 14th amendment, the 15th amendment, the
24th amendment. Our experts say, I'll say it again for emphasis, that's
what an expert does. The experts say that it will cost 50-100% for
transportation time, and by the way, you all didn't interrupt anybody
else, so please respect me too. It will cost 50-100% for transportation
time waiting in line and gathering documentation. That is a poll tax and
it is wrong for these loyal citizens, who are disproportionate people of
color, seniors and women who may have changed their name. People who may
not have birth certificates from this state to be affected in this way.
African Americans are 22% of all active voters, but they are 31% of the
registered voters who do not have a North Carolina photo id. Seniors are
18% of active voters but 26% of those without a North Carolina photo id.
Women are 54% of active voters, but 66% of those without North Carolina
photo id and we do not fall for the we need voter id for prescription
drugs. Id for drugs. To use a credit card to fly a plane. We know why we
need it for sudafed because people use it to make meth and you're not
going to make meth by voting.  Secondly, we also know that these things
are a privilege. Voting is a constitutional right protected by more
constitutional amendments than any other rights we have as Americans.
We, as a nation, don't provide constitutional rights based on false
analysis, and polls or popular thinking. Constitutional rights are given
to keep the majority from exercising tyranny over the minority and so,
we come here today to say that when we talk about voter suppression and
voter id, we are leading this state down a dangerous path. We have
already fought these battles. What we should be focused on is economic
sustainability, poverty, jobs, education equality for all, healthcare
for all, dealing with the proven disparities in our criminal justice
system and protecting and expanding the voting rights of all people.
This, and only this, should be the goal of any legislative body and
anything else is an affront to every claim of justice we hold dear and
we will fight--</p>

Any attempt to undermine the rights ordained by God and guaranteed in
our Constitution. I thank you for this respectful time, and pray God
speed upon you on your deliberation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You sir, I’m glad that you could be here with us
today. Ladies and Gentleman, our next presenter is Mr. Jerry [Bonnet].
Mr. [Bonnet] is the Chief Legal Council and the Co- Director of
Elections for the state of Indiana, he is a licensed attorney and has
degrees from Indiana University, the University of Tennessee and the
University of New Orleans. So, the Chair has asked him to come today and
speak about his experience photo IDs’ and Mr. Bonnet is here. Sir we’re
glad you’re here, you have the floor.  Welcome the House Committee on
elections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Chairman Lewis and Chairman Moore. I’m
humbled to follow such an eloquent speaker and I apologize, I’m actually
the 3rd stringer, Indiana Secretary Connie Lawson would have liked to of
been here. She was a Senator before she became Secretary of State and
she was Chairman of our State Elections Committee in 2005 when they were
deliberating the voter ID laws that Indiana passed back then. Also, the
Director of our Election Division couldn’t be here, who is more
knowledgeable than I am. We have a legislative session, they have
Election Committee hearings today and he needs to attend those. I know
you have been deliberating this a good while so I’m not going to make a
long presentation because I’m fearful that I’d probably be telling you
things that you may have already heard or may have already discussed, so
I’ll try to leave time for questions. I am from Indiana, but after law
school in Tennessee I accidentally ended up in New Orleans and I
practiced law for 18 years in Louisiana and then by accident after
Hurricane Katrina I returned to Indiana because it was my home in the
fall of 2005 and I think they felt sorry for me so they gave me a little
job in state government. The job I had involved this voter ID law that
had just been passed. I wasn’t in Indiana during the deliberations of
it, but I was a given a charge, and it’s a charge I have to this day, by
the Secretary of State of Indiana Election Commission which was to find
out if there is anyone in the state that can’t vote because of this law.
Find out why and report back to officials about it, and that’s what I’ve
done in every one of the 12 elections that we’ve had since the law was
passed. Studied the provisional balloting very carefully, go out and
interview people to find out what are the facts behind provisional
ballots that aren’t certified. To spite projections and studies that
prognosticated many individuals not being able to vote, wide spread
voter [disinfrangement], different types of doom &amp; gloom. That isn’t
what happened, when we had the first election 2006, the first sate wide
election, I had the state helicopter and state airplane on stand by to
go anywhere in the state in a matter of almost minutes to find out if
there were going to large number of people being turned away from polls
and it didn’t happen. In addition to being an attorney, which has taught
me to take a critical view of writings and of studies, I spent 2 years
working on</p>

my Pd.D. in organizational leadership where I also studied very
carefully statistical analysis and academia and academic papers and the
difference between peer-reviewed research and research that is largely
based on opinion and I've come to have a pretty dim view of a lot of
research that makes suggestions and inferences about the disfranchising
of ID laws. I agree very much with the Representative about citizens'
rights, but Indiana had a concern about citizens' rights to competence
in the outcome of election, the NVRA had made it easy to create an
environment for our voter list to become oversubscribed. It's easier to
get on and to be subscribed multiple times through motor voter, people
move, people pursue their education, it's relatively difficult and
there's a challenging administrative process to get peoples' names off
of those voting lists. When surveyed, individuals expressed concern, and
even belief that, not all elections were completely fair, particularly
in certain counties that have had decades and generations' old stigmas
for not having complete fairness at the precinct level, the ward level,
and the county level. So, the ID laws, I think very much we are
addressing a competence issue. People's beliefs, I believe, need to be
respected, and surveys have shown that in Hoosiers ?? Indiana, respect
the law, appreciate the ID law, it's been called the strictest in the
nation. The candidates for secretary of state in the last two races,
neither the democrat or republican candidates campaigned on changing or
overturning the law, our candidates for governor, democrat or republican
also didn't campaign on trying to overturn turn the law. There's been
very little, almost no modification to the law since 2005. What has
changed since 2005 has been administrative rules. The position that the
state has taken is that if there is anyone who that can't vote either
with an ID or through one of the alternative methods, it's the
acquisition of the ID or one of the alternative methods that need to be
reviewed, not the requirement. Indiana has made rules, which again you
may have discussed, about conforming names, there's 13 ways that a name
could be expressed on an ID that could be different from the name on the
poll list, and if there's a difference the person only needs to write in
the name they're using and sing it on the poll list and that would be
accepted. Addresses are not required to match on an ID from the poll
list, it's recognized that people move. That's a rule, administrative
rule, not in the statute. State university, initially not accepted
because they didn't have an expiration date, and some universities it
would not fit within their procedures and policies to put an expiration
date on their university ID, but arrangements have been made for some of
our state universities to supply a list of expiration dates prior to the
election so that they can be verified. So through that way, we've been
able to accept university IDs, so long as the person at the poll can
verify that.</p>

The  and Indiana has been challenged by the Justice Department and him
and by seven new out-of-state voter rights groups over the list
maintenance is either culpable as maintenance or purging of polls SSS
the politically incorrect word that and at the county level where the
goal is to maintain there is there is a diversion into removing people
you removing a name for the list and the secretary stayed in election
commission that they really challenge to pursue counties from maintain
that list so and the fact that those lesser known to be in inflated and
is what know causes the release of sensitive to the idea of having a
window of a certain final check for the in-person voting on and ask the
why we have that out I haven't looked at North Carolina's election is
raising very carefully in a public lobby and how remind you and Indiana
the secretary state which is the chief elections officer is is is very
weak when it comes to election authority election administration in
Indiana is this strictly bipartisan from the Indiana election commission
which has a number of Democrats and Republicans to the election division
and which also a weekly column on those are because there is in tools in
the present Democrat Republican dinner every position same way the
county level, county election boards and out on our polls on election
and represents only that is because I'm if there were laws that were
unfair and network disenfranchising speaking as a civil servant and
speaking on behalf of of the individuals over 15,000 volunteers on
election day they just wouldn't have it there would be our selection
administration designed so that if if the Democrat Republican don't
agree then things stop until they do disagree that that happens in our
election commission they just definitely remake they don't meet Pinot
Gris and how election he conducted them available to election health
sitdown that hasn't happened and I have surveyed personally at the
county level throughout her 19 counties at the precinct and were level
talk to Chairman Flickr party chairman and were captains and an acid
wife widely are either other numbers of voters in your precinct in your
neighborhood you are not loading and the answer is there not a they
don't out if if they were there were so we have tried at all times to
address any case of any individual that could be found who can't vote on
our VMD has a office without setup that works with individuals who are
challenged because of their documentation may be because it hasn't
cultural preferences circumstances to to make sure that they they have
an ID and asked not just voting as stats for all types of civic
engagement and certainly since his 2011 the perspective has is changed
on the issue of what the meaning and that the use of an IV is south of
sunrise I think Indiana election officials and civil servants and
citizens of all election process has had a good dinner of a positive
spirit about the voter ID law was to the work to assure confidence in
elections and to resolve any issues that were that were noted out
secondly I was involved with the courts with the US Green court in state

<p id="35:00">
You may have discussed that, but there are two issues in constitutional
law. There's the facial view, which is the law on its face, and the
court will say, &quot;Well, given what this law reads word-for-word, is
there a way that it can be constitutionally applied or is there no way
that it can be constitutional?&quot; And then there's the as-applied
issues. I think the courts were very uniform in that on its face, this
law, ID laws can be applied fairly and constitutionally, and the courts
view them with little difference from whether people have travel to the
precinct, how many precincts there are, whether they register, when they
have to register, different requirements. On the other side, though, as
applied, the courts were not in complete agreement. Some of the
sentences (??) were pretty harsh, but the plaintiffs, in those cases,
were not able to identify the individuals who were harmed. There were
projections, theories, but the actual individuals couldn't be. I think
you'd agree any law could be applied in a way that was unfair and
unconstitutional. I think Indiana has tried very hard to apply the law
in a way that is fair and to be open to challenges and to address those.
We wouldn't be supporting it administering laws if they had this unfair
basis. And finally, I'll mention it again, the voter list maintenance
issue is a real challenge to confidence (??) and the amount of money
that we believe that we would have to spend would be in the tens of
millions too, and the procedures would be invasive, involving
investigations to scrupulously make sure that every voter became
registered and didn't get removed from a list because they'd moved or
something. To do that maintenance is not simple, not inexpensive, and
not un-invasive procedure. We had one case of vote fraud from the
primary election where an individual had moved from Wisconsin and he
voted absentee in Wisconsin and voted in Indiana where he'd registered
when he got his ID. When he got his driver's license he was registered
to vote. And that's sort of an example where the system created the
opportunity for- I've met with the individual, it's been discussed with
the ?? department, and the individual was sort of put in that
circumstance, we don't believe he was devious, we don't think he had the
ability to try and change the outcome of the presidential election, but
he had that opportunity and he took advantage of it. So thank you very
much for allowing me to come and hopefully I'll try as best I can to
answer questions you might have. Yes?

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for coming to visit. I

went into effect and he and I did a leadership program together, and so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Secretary ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah. I just had a question about obtaining the ID. Is it free in
Indiana?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Indiana provides a free ID for any individual over the age of sixteen
who does not have or is not applying for some type of voter
vehicle-related license. In 2005, it's by regulation-</p>

<p id="40:00">
through the DMV that it was endorsed by Gov. Daniels at the time. Gov.
Daniels has a reputation as being a spendthrift, and they allocated $2
million during the first year, but I want to mention that in 2005,
Indiana also was an early adopter of the real ID, the federal real ID
standard, which is a high standard for all state-issued IDs requires
this birth certificate, social security number, proof of citizenship,
results in a holographic ID that is registered with federal agencies.
Some states have not adopted it, but it was in that context also as well
as the voter ID that Indiana persued the free ID law because they
recognized an individuals, for all the purpose would need an ID, would
be getting a real ID from Indiana. And so it was not just about the
photo ID.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, may I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I have 2 or 3 questions. Is that alright if I-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
So I just want to be 100% clear: Unless you're trying to get a drivers
license or something other, if you just want a photo ID in Indiana
including with all the bells and whistles of being a real ID, it's free?
Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My next question goes to you had said that the IDs that you accept don't
have to- they could have an incorrect address on it or not the person's
current address because you're really just trying to determine that
person is whom they purport to be. Is that my understanding of what ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it's been described as having to do with matching the face based to
the face much as people have said, you know, traditionally you match
your signature. Signature matching was the way traditionally. It's
recognized that you are allowed to, even if you move within 30 days of
the election, it's a federal election and you haven't changed you county
or congressional district, you're free to vote. In a presidential
election, you're free to vote anywhere as long as you're in the United
States. So yes, the address is not a disqualifier for the ID being
accepted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
But you said if the ID had expired, say a student ID, you wouldn't
accept that and so I'm trying to understand whether- why an expired ID
would not qualify if all it's about is figuring out that you're matching
the face to the face?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not sure the why part of it, the ID expiration cannot- an ID can be
expired, the limit- outer limit- is the last general election, so that's
generally going to be going back a little bit less than 2 years. So if
it was a good ID for the last general election, even if it expired
immediately thereafter, it would be good for the next primary and the
next general election. And I don't know what the- why that particular
time period was set. I recognize that Michigan has a different scheme on
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one more question and then I had a comment.
When people go to vote in Indiana, are they asked to state what their
address is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They are asked to verify in signing their poll book that that's their
address and then they are able to, if their address has changed, write
in the poll book, initial it with the new address, and that would
initiate a change in registration prior to the next election.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But they don't, They don't have to say what their address is before the
poll book, before they sign the poll book. So in North Carolina, we- the
laws that you're supposed to say &quot;What is your address?&quot;, and
then the person has to say what their address is so that you make sure
that they're voting in the right place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's not required if you are registered, you know if you're in the
poll book and you're registered,</p>

[??] may vote, although you are certainly under an obligation not to
vote if you are not in fact a resident. There are laws about how long
after a person is moved can returned to that poll. In fact, the former
Secretary of State Charlie White who was convicted of vote fraud and
removed from office, had voted in the precinct and it was shown in a
county court that he had moved from that place to be with his Fiancée
and his step children, same county, same town, same state, but it was
some bitter medicine that was dealt out. What went around came around,
in that case. That was the instance there, he did vote and it was shown
that he had not lived in that precinct for 30 days before he voted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].Representative Ross, if you will, the chair is going
to recognize Representative Avila for an inquiry and then the chair is
going to invite both of our previous speakers if they can to remain
after we conclude to address other inquiries. Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is a question I’ve been
wanting to ask for quite some time and I feel like your at a level of
expertise that you can give the answer to it and that is; we keep making
the statement there is no voter fraud because the people voting is
someone else. If we’re not asking to see their identification, how do we
know?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, that is a good question. That is the belief the
and It is pervasive, I mentioned in particular counties, in particular
towns and particular areas of town, there is this urban myth, that at a
poll maybe when no one is watching that a vote or votes will be recorded
in the name of people who aren’t there. It didn’t lend itself to law
enforcement, even though there are studies that say there has not been
enforcement of in person fraud, were questionable and challenged because
it’s hard to get county level law enforcement records, they are not in
the kind of date bases that you have for other law enforcement
activities. Which, is a long way of saying I don’t know. I think that is
a question that the ID requirement attempts to address, one of the
issues it attempts to address.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Director thank you so very much for your time
today, please feel free to stay, if your time permits. I’m sure some the
members would like to ask you further inquiries. The chair did announce
that we were going to begin discussion on House Bill 589 today and that
is what we’re going to do. Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And staff for some information that maybe helpful
going forward. I’ve heard speakers and I see it in Bills sometimes, it’s
under Penalty of Perjury, like that is this big weapon that we’ve got
that’s going to stop anything. Can we get some figures, I think I read
recently that perjury cases are just incredibly rare, I mean in any
setting. Can we get some information on how often there are, how many
people have been convicted or charged with perjury? Because, I’m worried
that we’re trying to use something that really has become almost
non-existing anymore and we may need different way to put some teeth
into the law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Thank you Representative Blust, the staff is

to Representative Blust and all the members of the Committee on the
elections. At this time, move on to House Bill 589. The Chair will
recognize Representatives Warren, Murry, Moore, and Samuelson to present
the bill in the time that we have, and as was announced earlier, we will
not vote on this bill in any way today, and this bill will be back on
next week's Committee ??.
Representative Warren, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
State your purpose, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
This is simply for discussion today, I heard you say that they're, the
three presenters are just going to discuss and then we're going to
adjourn and go to our 2:30 meeting, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Warren, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Voter Information Verification Act, or
VIVA, is the result of many months of research and of listening to the
people of North Carolina. More than 65 percent of whom have voiced a
strong desire for improving the security of the voting process. And by
giving careful and thoughtful consideration to the concerns expressed by
those opposed to securing the vote. VIVA provides for increased
participation of eligible voters through an aggressive bipartisan
program of voter education and voter registration initiatives at the
grassroots level across the state over a two year period. VIVA
aggressively addresses allegations of voter suppression and dispels
predictions of disenfranchisement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Excuse me, Mr. Chair? ...conversations, I'm trying to hear.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The Chair thinks the lady of the Committee will please come to order.
Representative Warren has the floor, please give the gentleman your
respect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I will try to command more attention, sir.
VIVA enhances integrity in the balloting process in a comprehensive and
considerate fashion by making reasonable improvements to in-person,
provisional, and absentee balloting. We believe that just as if one
person is denied a vote is intolerable, so is one person's vote being
cancelled out by a fraudulent vote intolerable. Representatives Murry,
Samuelson, and I will go over the bill for you now.
Representative Murry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Representative Warren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank
you, members of the Committee. I'm going to describe Section 4, which
deals directly with the photo identification piece of the legislation.
And, also go through Section 5 and... I'll just go through, likely the
absentee provisions as well, so...
If you'll look at Section 4, we have a list of the identification, the
types of photo identification that will be available to count in order
to be able to vote in North Carolina. There are multiple forms of
identification, all of which are issued by a state, including the state
of North Carolina, but any state ID would be available. So if you moved
here from another state and had a valid driver's license from another
state, that would be able to be used as photo identification as well.
The photo identification, in order to be valid, has to have either an
expiration date or a date of issuance, and for it to be valid it has to
be, it can't be expired more than 10 years on either of those dates,
whichever is later.
For individuals that have disabilities as defined under Federal law or
are over the age of 70, in particular to the age of 70, if the ID was
valid on their 70th birthday it will be valid from then forward. So it's
kind of an extended expiration date for senior citizens or...
So that's, you can see the list of ID's. They are all government issued
photo ID's, state institutions, or universities, if it's under part of
the university systems state of North Carolina, that is valid under this
legislation as well. The main theme is a government issued photo ID will
be required to vote under this legislation. We do have exceptions as
well for people who have a religious objection to have their photograph
taken that is consistent with most photo voter ID legislation that you
see around the country.
From a procedural perspective, when you go to vote</p>

<p id="55:00">
you will have to do a signature attestation as well as present your
photo ID, so this just adds the photo ID presentation to the current
procedure. That's in section 6. If you do not have a photo ID, you will
be allowed to cast a provisional ballot. That is section 7. And section
8 continues the discussion about how the provisional ballot is required
if you don't have a photo ID.
Section 9 deals with counting and provisional ballots, and after
the-before the canvas, a voter has to come back to the board of
elections with a photo  ID in order for the vote to be counted. If you
continue the implementation date, we're going to have kind of a soft
launch, and it will be the ultimate requirement would begin on Jan. 1st,
2016, so we will begin asking voters whether they need a photo ID in
2014. I believe that's correct.
Absentee ballot section is ??-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me just a minute, Rep. Murry, I think Rep. Richardson has had an
inquiry and I wanted to ask you to stop before you moved on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Indeed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Chairman.
Yes, I do have an inquiry about the institutions that can provide voter
ID. I notice you have the University system and the community college,
but what about our private colleges and universities?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We allow for state issued photo IDs to be counted in the voter ID law,
so private institutions are not state institutions and so we would not
allow that in this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, one follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So if they're those institutions, then they would have to get a special
ID?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They would need a government issued photo ID like a driver's license. or
a non-operator's card from the DMV. We do have provisions in the
legislation about absentee ballots, and that is in section 13.
Section 13 begins, you have to have 2 witnesses and we are also having-
we also are establishing a request form instead of a hand written
process that we have now, a state-based, a state form that you can fill
out to get a absentee ballot and then have the 2 signatures for return
on the envelope.
Let's see here. That the method for requesting absentee ballots is in
section 13c, so that all the sections of section 13 deal with absentee
ballots and voting.
Section 14 is Rep. Murry's, Rep. Warren is going to discuss about the
methodologies of promoting this new program, but I would say the goal of
this legislation is to make sure that the person that is presenting
themselves to vote is the person who they say they are. That's the goal
of the legislation, it's very very simple and if one person's vote is
stolen it's a violation of all the rights that we hold dear.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and I'll be brief since you all want time to discuss. I'm
just gonna cover the state issured cards. If a voter does not have the
voter identification, we've got a long list and Rep. Richardson this
would include as well if they go to a private college and they don't
have any of the other forms, then they may get a non operator ID from
the DMV. The fee for that card will be waived for those who cannot
afford them as well as fees for any documents like birth certificates
and such that have to be retrieved from any state agency that are
necessary to get the card. One of the plusses that we want you to
remember is that even though someone may get that non-operator ID card
from DMV, it will be good for other purposes for which they may need an
ID. So it kind of gets a dual purpose of anyone in this society who does
not have a photo ID probably is impaired in some way from other
activities, even things like getting certain pharmaceuticals. So this
would enable them, they then have a card that yes its good to tell who
they are when they go vote, but that they can also use for other things.
And I didn't mean physically impaired, I just mean you're not able to do
certain things.
To get a card without cost an individual, under penalty of perjury,
acknowledge that they do not have the funds to pay for that card. And
we're trying to make that flexible as possible, but just to recognize
that we're trying to provide these for people who can't provide them for
themselves. But it's not a hard</p>

test to pass and so that's basically it on how you would get a non - If
you need a non operator ID card. Also, the program that representative
Warren will cover in a minute, part of the whole gist of this will be
there will be running at the same time a voter outreach program to reach
out to the people who indicated that they cannot, that they do not have
a  card and they want help getting one. So, we're trying to make it as
easy as possible to help those people get the cards they need.
[speaker changes]
In this bill, we create a program called VIVA or Voter Information
Verification Agency. This is a board that will be created, comprised of
three to five members at the state level forming an advisory board. They
will have, beneath them, fourteen employees, one state level employee to
watch over the program throughout the state and then thirteen field
operatives to work with the county parties in a bipartisan effort and a
volunteer network to create a program of voter education and voter
registration. To involve more of our folks in the electoral process.
Some of the responsibilities that the agency and the field operatives
will be responsible for on page one of your bill lines 19 - over to page
2, line 5. I'll let you read through those rather than taking up a lot
of time reading to you. The program will start in January of 2014 and
because the hardfast voter photo id requirement doesn't start until
January 1, 2016, we are phasing this in over a generous two year period
of time to help people secure getting a photo id and there' s more than
eleven different types at this time acceptable forms of photo id. In
addition to this, this bill directs the state board of election to begin
the study going digital and by that I mean creating a statewide digital
photo database where we can migrate folks who find it easier or just as
part of the system to create a photo database where the system for
voting could be so simple that you go up to your poll, identify
yourself, they confirm your address, type in your name and your picture
pops up. This program that we're looking at and considering would have
to have the latest state of the art technology and software and things
that incorporate facial software. There's a couple exciting parts of the
program that look beyond just requiring a photo id but looking at
improving the system  going forward and keeping in touch and in pace
with the technological advances that we are experiencing.
[speaker changes]
And then in terms of next steps of course, today, there is the public
hearing afterward now that we've got the bill out for everybody to look
at. We are receiving suggestions, ideas, all kinds of things so be on
the lookout in case a PCS comes out before your next committee hearing
next week. We're, of course, available to answer any questions. Mr.
Chairman, I believe you've got it scheduled next week for a vote. Is
that correct?
[speaker changes]
That is the intent of the chair.
[speaker changes]
if you have questions that come up here or afterward, do let us know. We
are open to tweaks. I've never seen a bill quite like this one where
there were so many moving pieces and we were trying to make sure that
they all line  up and conform as they're supposed to. So, we're very
open if someone catches something that we've missed by any chance. Thank
you.
[speaker changes]
The chair saw Representative Ross' hand, Representative Avila's hand and
Representative Starnes' hand. That will probably exhaust the time that
we have today. The chair will assume the lady wishes to pose an inquiry
and do so at this time.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and this time it's only one. Will we have a
fiscal note by next week?
[speaker changes]
Thank you Representative Ross. We are still waiting for additional data
from the state board of elections to determine the disconnect between
the DMV records and the state board of elections since the last
analysis, two ?? thousand motors have been removed from the road since
the last analysis by the state board of elections. We're trying to get
that and I expect fiscal note and a serial referral to appropriations
??, but I think
[speaker changes]
One follow up, Representative Ross.
[speaker changes]
In that fiscal note, it would be good to know how much it's gonna cost
for this facial recognition technology and these employees. It's both
providing the ID and setting up the bureaucracy.
[speaker changes]
Certainly. A significant portion of the database is going to be up to
the board of elections to do an RFP. You don't want to do that in this
legislation. We're delegating a significant amount to the state board of
elections as well.</p>

representative ted avail you are recognized for an inquire thank you Mr.
chairmen on page 10 of the bill in the absentee ballot we changed back
to two people its been two for years and years and we had people who had
issues with two and Ive actually gotten some emails why are we thinking
two is going to work is that necessary. that is also some of the ones we
have gotten some messages on the idea of having two have had some
complaints where one person would go and get lots of people to sign up
but if you had two if your not having them have to produce a photo on
the by having two you kinda offset the fact that others have to have an
id one quick follow up. your recognized . are we going to be using this
requirement up through the local elections as well all through threw the
time we go forward. yes. representative stores your recognized for and
inquire. Thank you my question is on page six section twelve b.
registered deeds have some concerns of the free verse certificate of
course we know required deeds certificates are required basically to be
self sustained and we operate on the pee-sly generate is there
registered deeds that will eat this cost or  will there be a prevision
from the state to reimburse them for the ten dollars per birth
certificate. the plan was to reimburse the offices the registers offices
for the for intent that's to be sure that anyone with a financial
hardship will have a photo verifier to have a photo id and that's one of
the pieces of documentation that DMV requires for a non operating
licensee or, i think the intent is to is a reimburse that we would not
bury registered offices to bury this burden financially thank you. i
think they will feel better if there was some language in effect. the
other inquire they had was in other words someone could come in with a
birth certificate for a pass port and say well i want to get it for a
low id that's confidential hardship there suggestion was that you have
them go to the board of elections to have them document and have them
say i need this re birth certificate for voting purposes and that would
only be for voting purposes thank thank you for that comment. ladies and
gentlemen until 4 a clock when this committee reconvenes for additional
input and the public hearing we stand in recess.</p>
