[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Judiciary two if favorable finance. Messages from the senate if there
are any and there are none.
Members of the house would come to order. Before we take up the two
bills on today&#39;s calender we have a number of special guests the
chair would like to, would like to recognize. If the members could give
your attention to the chair I wanna read out a number we do have a
number of special guests with us we&#39;ll go through. First of all on
motion of representative Lewis of Harnett county. The chair is happy to
extend the courtesy of the floor to Evelyn Langston and her son Eddy
Langston. Evelyn has served in the North Carolina school system, get
this, for sixty three years. Miss Langston if you&#39;d please stand
we&#39;d like to thank ya and welcome you today to the floor. The chair
would also want to point out that a number of other family members of
Miss Langston are with us today, Phillis Langston Turnage who is here
daughter, Benita Langston her daughter-in-law, and Caroline Brewington
are also with her and I think they&#39;re in the gallery. If you could
all please stand so that we could welcome you as well. Thank you for
being with us. And also on behalf of all members of the house and
particularly representative Michaux of Durham county the chair extends
the courtesies of the floor to a very special guest. Sam Jones his wife
Gladis and Lavelle Moten who is the North Carolina Central University
basketball coach. And want to read a few other things about Mr. Jones I
was provided. Mr. Jones is a native North Carolinian he was born in
Wilmington. Attended and graduated from North Carolina Central
University then North Carolina College where he was a four year letter
winner. Jones scored, get this, one thousand seven hundred and forty
five points. Which is still second in school history. Now, Mickey
Michaux tells me he has the top score that he actually beat that. I
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true or not we&#39;ll find out. He was three
time all CIAA selection. He then played all of his twelve seasons in the
NBA with the Boston Celtics. He was known as a clutch scorer with
fifteen thousand points in his career. He participated in five all star
games and is usually recognized as one of the best shooting guards of
his generation. He was named the all NBA second team three straight
years, nineteen sixty five to sixty seven. Played on ten championship
games from fifty nine to sixty six and sixty eight to sixty nine, a
total only exceeded by teamate Bill Russell in NBA history. His perfect
form when shooting a jump shot along with his great clutch shooting led
opponents to nickname him the shooter. So what I think we&#39;re
probably going to be able to do when we have this basketball thing we
play the senate this year, we&#39;re going to bring you out of
retirement and let you and Michaux be our ringers this year on the
basketball. Again welcome to the house floor we&#39;re honored to have
you.[applause]
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham representative Michaux
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Point of personal privilege Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman has the floor to speak to a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of the house it is an honor for me
to present my friend and I&#39;m happy to speak as extended the courtesy
of the floor to my friend Sam Jones. I have to tell you a few things, we
go back many many years and Sam, one reason I wanted you all to know it
is because we sent several stellar athletes out to the world from North
Carolina. But you&#39;ve never had an athlete that has five national
championship, ten actually ten national championship rings. Ten rings.

  <p id="010:00">
  So there’s only one other person that has one better than [??]. It’s his
teammate in Boston, Bill Russell. Bill has 11 rings, but not only that,
but he’s a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame, he’s a
member of the National Basketball Hall of Fame, he’s been selected to
the 25 year all time NBA team and the 50 year all time NBA team. He is a
native North Carolinian, but that does one other person that I really,
Mr. Speaker, really want to introduce you to. Now, Sam went from North
Carolina to Boston. We have another visitor on the floor here that came
from Boston to North Carolina and he is making a name for himself. His
name is Lavelle Mote, and he’s the coach at North Carolina Circle
University. Lavelle just, well, tonight is his last game, but in the
MEAC, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, it is a team, a conference
composed, a division one conference composed of 13 historically black
colleges and universities in the country and they’ve run from Maryland
to Florida. Central, North Carolina Central’s record up to date is 15-0
in the conference, 23-6 overall. Win the game tonight against our
arch-enemy from AMT, win the game tonight the team will be 16-0. Forget
about the tournament is next week, last year they won the tournament and
got an automatic bid to the March Madness. This year we’re looking for
the same thing, coach, to repeat going to the big dance, but I wanted
folks to know that North Carolina, you’ve heard all these other
athletes, you’ve heard Michael Jordan, but Sam Jones is a legend in his
own time. No question about it. Anybody who can earn 10 championship
rings with the same team. I’m also happy to have my godson, his son, the
last born, Ashley, sitting over here with him and the most important
person in that whole group is sitting beside Sam is his wife, Gladys,
and let me tell you, both of them graduated from North Carolina Central.
They’ve been married 58 years this year. [applause] And neither Sam nor
Gladys can deny it because I was there. I was his best man. They have
five children. As I said, Ashley’s one of them and Ashley’s my godson
and in addition to that what is it? 16, 14 grandchildren, so Mr.
Speaker, ladies and gents, I just wanted to let you all know that there
are folks in North Carolina who are citizens who have been great
contributors to the history of North Carolina and here you have them
sitting right before you. Mr. Speaker, I hope you will recognize the
folks that we have in the gallery. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We will
do that now. On motion of Representative Michaux of Durham County, the
chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery additionally to
the following individuals, Chancellor Debra Saunders-White of North
Carolina Central University, Athletic Director Ingrid Wicker of McCree
North Carolina Central University, Lula Thorpe, friend of Sam and Gladys
Jones, Jean Micheaux, wife of Representative Mickey Micheaux, Pam
Thorpe-Young, Director of External Affairs for North Carolina Central
University, Chief of Staff Wendell Phillips of North Carolina Central
University, Ashley Jones, son of Sam and Gladys Jones, Charles Barrett
and wife Martha, former Board of Trustees members at North Carolina
Central University. Again, on behalf of the House we welcome you to the,
to the House today and glad to have you with us. [applause] And again,
on behalf of myself, Mrs. Langston, Mr. Jones, I want to thank you for
the contributions both of you have made in different ways to the state.
You honor us with your presence here today and we’re certainly glad to
have you here with us. Thanks again for coming. Additional courtesies.
On motion of all of the members, the Chair is happy

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman may speak to a moment of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I’ll make this brief. You know, when you
have greatness in your midst a lot of times everyone will climb on and
try to claim some affiliation or association and so I wanna make sure I
join that line too and what I wanna do is make sure that you know Sam
Jones got his real start in basketball in Laurenburg Institute in
Laurenburg, NC. That name was not mentioned in all the accolades that
were read off, but certainly he did get his start there in basketball
and Representative Wells, Representative Pierce is not at his desk right
now, but wanted to lift up Laurenburg as being the home of Sam Jones,
the start of his basketball career. He’s also in the hall of fame in the
Laurenburg Institute and I wanted to make sure it’s in the record that
great things come from small towns in North Carolina and they go on to
be world-renown and he’s an example of it. So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 117. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representatives S. Martin, Jeeter, Collins, Stineberg, A bill to be
entitled an act to, North Carolina Competes Act. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For
what purpose does the lady from Wilson, Representative Martin rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
lady has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. We
had an excellent vote on this bill yesterday and I want to thank all of
my colleagues for taking the time to thoughtfully analyze these
proposals and provide insight on both sides and we had a full debate and
I stand prepared to answer questions if necessary. I just wanted to
share one quote which I think sums up a lot of things that we’re talking
about and this comes from a business leader in my community who had the
opportunity, he’s part of a global organization which is looking at
where to expand and he helped us to compete to make that expansion
happen in North Carolina and not at another facility around the globe of
which they were looking at Italy. We might should’ve looked at that, but
here’s what he said. North Carolina will need to have a place at the
table in order to assure that we have an opportunity to compete.
Incentive offerings provide a significant metric as companies weigh
future expansion and relocation opportunities on balance, this is a
really important word, on balance, the state must continue its efforts
to create a global contender for jobs and investments of the future by
enhancing our pro-business positioning, keeping taxes low, reinforcing
the strength of the research universities and community college systems,
creating a fair regulatory environment in our view would convey to the
world that North Carolina is open and ready for business. So my bottom,
my point here is that although we’ve had a lot of philosophical debate
on both sides, this is a great opportunity for us to all come together
and get great results for our citizens. We can have a multi-pronged
approach to grow jobs in our state and I would appreciate your support
of the bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Wake, Representative Jackson rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to
debate the bill [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen, yesterday I voted no on this bill. I didn’t speak and I
wanted to let you know that I wanted to vote for it and I wanna tell you
why I wanted to vote for it. I have family that’s from Pearl City, AL,
and for those of you who don’t know where Pearl City is it is located,
probably the nearest city to Lincoln, AL, which is where Honda
Manufacturing decided in 1999 to build a factory there. the median
household income in Pearl City, AL in 2000, the year before the
construction started, was $37,250. In 201, which was the last numbers I
could find, it was $48,408, ad I wanna compare that to a town that I
represent, the town of Windale, which in 2000 was $39,750 but in 2012
was only $37, 214. I can tell you that once construction started, almost
overnight they got a hotel. They got restaurants, they got commercial
development, then came the

  There’s some of you all who are just deadset, you’re gonna vote for this
no matter what. You have that right. You certainly do and I guess if you
all want to take a nap while I’m talking you might as well. I wanna
address some of the other folks who may have really been in opposition
to this bill but, you know, I heard yesterday that a lot of people were
being pressured to change their vote and vote for this. Oh, so and so
out there is watching. They’re gonna hold you accountable if you vote
against this. I understand that pressure’s hard to face, but you know,
there’s a lot of money in this bill and I’m thinking there might could
go a long way towards helping us repair or replace bridges that are
about to fall down or build new roads or repair the ones we have or even
to help the judiciary as Chief Justice Martin asked us to do yesterday.
A lot of good things that are government business that could be done
with this money instead of giving it to private businesses which I think
is totally inappropriate, so I just ask you to think about this. You
know, a lot of times in life we only get one chance to do the right
thing, but here in the legislature we have a second chance to do the
right thing. It’s called third reading. That’s where we are now. Yes,
funny to me they never come to me to try to twist my arm. I don’t know
why, but I heard that that happened to some of you all yesterday and I
just ask you be who you are. Stand up for what you think is right and if
you think this bill is wrong, vote no, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For
what purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover, Representative Catlin
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. I wanted to give you, I need a longer cord here. I wanted
to give you a personal perspective on this from an independent business
owner that I started my business 30 years ago in my garage and I have
grown it multistate and international. I have offices in Wilmingtion,
Raleigh , Atlanta, America’s Georgia, Charlotte, Charleston, Tampa and
Leipsig, Germany and the people that I’ve worked with, the
subcontractors and my partners in my company we have created thousands
of jobs over that 30 years and incentives were never, ever even on our
minds. They were not, none of my clients had incentives. None of my
partners had incentives. None of the subcontractors I work with had
incentives, so for us to think that incentives are a big part is wrong
because I have, I had spend my whole life working and I don’t even see
that. I have never been involved with people that get incentives, so I
would say that the incentive part is probably less than 0.01% of the
jobs and the real businesses in North Carolina. My perspective. Now, but
I’m still working to build jobs. I’m working with a company from Texas
right now, their first pilot program where they’re gonna spend $3
million building that here in North Carolina this year and they’re using
private money for that. If they are successful, they could create
100,000 jobs or more in over $10 billion a year in products that we can
export to make North Carolina extremely successful and they have told me
no incentives, please because we do not want government involved in our
private business. It takes away our efficiency. That’s the real world
that’s out there. We need to know that and I wanna bring up the
emotional issue for me is how we pay for this. Where does the money come
from? One of my concerns are, in addition to education and
infrastructure is the, in 2013 we took away the medical deductions for
our senior citizens. These are senior citizens that have worked hard and
created lots of jobs and businesses and now are in medical disasters or
they’re spouses are in those disasters and they pay for all of this
theirself. They get no money from anybody else for that and we took away
their tax credits for their medical deductions which has cost them $38
million. If we vote for this bill

  This incentive bill, we&#39;re taking away the money to support the bill
that I have filed to restore those medical deductions, so we&#39;re
actually choosing.  Are we going to be loyal to our senior citizens who
are working hard and paying their own costs and not raise their taxes,
or are we going to give it to corporations that are bribing North
Carolina to come here?  I cannot do this, in my heart it is a sin.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Rockingham,
Representative Jones, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask if my friend, Representative Jackson, would
yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman
from Rockingham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir, thank you for yielding, and I just, I
appreciated you comments about the town in Alabama, and how the average
pay had gone from, I believe, about $37,000 to about $48,000 since 1998.
 I just wanted to ask you if you were aware that if you apply the
Consumer Price Index on inflation from 1998 to the present, that $37,000
in 1999 would be equivalent to over $53,000 today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, thank you.  Thank you, Representative
Jones, yes I was aware of that fact.  I was trying, in my comments, to
compare Pale City, Alabama to one of the towns I represent.  I will,
however, tell you that if you look at the statistics for Pale City,
Alabama on their website, they put the State of Alabama statistics, and
their growth is much higher than the state as a whole.  So it&#39;s very
clear that you can tell that since 2001 when the manufacturer has
started being built, it has made a big difference in the town and
surrounding areas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.  Does the gentleman yield to an additional
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You would agree with me that the present value of
$37,000 in 1999, which would now be more than $53,000, that is more than
$48,000?  We would agree on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, yes, Representative Jones, I would agree
with your math, however the numbers I was using, and I want to make sure
we&#39;re clear, were from 2000, not 1998, and are through 2012, not
2015.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
Representative Luebke rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House.  I
want to focus on some items that have not been given a lot of attention,
although one of them has been spoken to very eloquently by
Representative Jackson just a moment ago.  A lot of what we have in the
bill are benefits for major corporations that we think are going to come
into the state only because we have the benefit package in here that is
in this bill.  That&#39;s a question that could be asked for a long,
long time, whether it&#39;s really true.  Representative Stam has spoken
to that and he cited academic studies that actually show that you
don&#39;t need these kinds of huge dollar giveaways in order to bring
companies to many states, including North Carolina.  So, it&#39;s a bit
of a myth to assume that we know that except for these huge J-Dig
appropriations we would not have the companies in the state.  We&#39;ve
always been able to sell our state on the basis of quality
infrastructure, in particular our education programs of our state.
That&#39;s the way we&#39;ve done it in the past, and the presumption
now, that we can, we don&#39;t need to  get companies but for this
expanded, expanded giveaway program is, to me, a mistake.
Secondly, I want to talk briefly about the fact that in the bill,
it&#39;s a small point but an important point, I ask about whether the
health care coverage that the company has provided, 50% level to the
employees, whether there was a definition of health care coverage in the
bill.  It was indicated by Representative Martin on behalf of the
Chairs, think that there is currently no definition of health care
coverage and what that means.  And what it does mean though, I think, is
potentially the company could come in and offer a bare bones policy that
would provide really not real help for the assistant, for the employees,
and it would meet the criteria of the bill.  So my request of
Representative Martin and others is that you work with the Senate to put
a definition of health care coverage in, one that is genuinely helpful
to the employees.  I think that is the minimum that we can do for the
employees who would work

  Speaker changes:thank you on that point and then i wanna talk about two
issues that have really concerned meme in case for direction of these
bill ?? one of them i have herd Representative Jackson speech and the
thing bout sales tax and the 2013 session many many people in this house
voted for the tax bill ??  also think that we debated the whole life
last session ?? sales should there be  sales tax on ?? of the bill same
advocates of the bill that we can afford to give tax break we cant ?? to
give  tax break ?? on why to capture everything but suddenly we came lg
?? now the  ?? our gasoline tax yesterday will be going ?? any one in
this chamber please rise hand if you think that American airlines would
be leaving Sherlock because you does at get the 12 million dollar tax
before without the 12 million dollars ?? there is no way that they are
leaving
Speaker changes:speaker
Speaker changes:for what purpose does the ?? Representative cedar ask
Speaker changes:  ?? to yell for  quick question
Speaker changes:does the gentlemen from ?? yell for quick question
Speaker changes:i don&#39;t yell I&#39;m finishes
Speaker changes:he does not yell this time
Speaker changes:so in fact that we know that 12 million dollars??
similar way the sales tax grow on electricity look on the power bill you
see it having giving the huge corporation incentive perhaps 10 million
dollar to come into our ?? they get that sales tax rte without promising
 job ??  Microsoft and Facebook incentive off course it&#39;s not ??
narrowing up  sales tax base where we are widening the sales tax base ??
movie theaters county theaters ?? they are paying more tax?? why we
spare tax break for ?? companies why we  tax break for American airlines
?? and all we need to think all bout the sales tax break that we focus
big corporation ?? or to the small business in our state thank you
members,
Speaker changes: for what purpose does the gentlemen from ??
Representative ??,
Speaker changes:to debate the bill the gentlemen has the floor to debate
the bill,
Speaker changes:?? Representative Luke agree on something so i be
careful driving home tonight it is false of ?? to take the ,American
airlines issue to the fuel  issue it&#39;s just not the same thing the
irony of the jet fuel issue is the assumption being made is,

  Don’t extend the existing policy, which by the way was put in place
years ago by my friends over here. My guess is and I don’t know this for
a fact, and I’m going to start trying to be factual on the floor, but my
guess is my good friend Representative Leubke probably voted for it when
it was put in place. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
yield now, based as I said I didn’t know for sure. He clearly didn’t, so
I give him credit for that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Durham, Representative Leubke, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Representative Jeter yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll
yield like he yielded to me. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman does not
yield at this time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I just wanted him to
know my record on incentives ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] As I said ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The Chair would remind the gentlemen that they are always free
to step outside and have this conversation as well, if they would like.
[LAUGHTER] The gentleman from Mecklenberg continues to have the floor to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But the reality you have to
understand is that there’s a false perception that we are taking 12
million dollars out of the state coffers on the jet fund. Jet fuel tax.
That is not true. American Airlines pays two and a half million dollars
in fuel tax to the state of North Carolina. Every year. If you think
that they won’t make a decision based on the cost effectiveness of
operating out of a hub, go ask Pittsburgh. The reason they’re profitable
is because of their ability to make good economic decisions based on the
effectiveness of their business model. Hubs are in a incredibly viable
part of the Charlotte Douglas Airport. If we don’t extend this tax
credit we will artificially increase the cost of doing business there.
If you think their business model works with Dallas, Charlotte and Miami
all being major hubs, I’d ask you to go research some of Skip Stam’s
economic studies. They don’t! The reason Charlotte’s there is our cost
in plane passengers is the lowest in the nation. We are not giving up
twelve million dollars, it’s actually ten million dollars if we pass
this, we will be leaving two and a half million dollars out of our
coffers that will not be there anymore. Because they won’t be here to
pay fuel tax, and then we’ll be going, “Well heck, we were right, but we
just lost two and a half million dollars.” [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative Blust, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker and members of the House and I do hope Representative Jeter will
be careful tonight going home especially if you have to drive over any
bridges. My head’s still a little bit spinning from yesterday’s debate
on both bills, and there’s a verse in the Bible, “The last shall be
first and the first shall be last” and I’m thinking we may need a
corollary to that here. The Republicans shall be the Democrats and the
Democrats shall be the Republicans, because it was hard to follow based
on having been here and seeing what people have said in the past on some
of the same issues and to know, wait a second. That used to be them
saying that, and that used to be us saying this. What has changed? And
the reason I’m speaking today and I know it’s third reading and it’s a
Thursday but yesterday we had a lot to do to major bills and the State
of the State, and I didn’t want to hold up anyone’s dinner. One of the
bill sponsors said that we were standing in the way of members’ dinners.
But this is a very important bill, as is the next one, because I think
it goes to the very core of what we have held ourselves out to the
public to be. And I have to defend my vote and I don’t know that I’ll
influence anybody’s vote but I do want to take this opportunity to
explain mine. I don’t, I think Representative Jeter makes some good
points on that issue. I lay that aside. That would have been a great
issue to take up in another bill. The single sales factor, I probably
support that. My biggest problem is with the JD, the J-Dig or whatever
we’re calling it now, aspect of this bill. Mainly because to me, the
gravamen, the argument for doing this and we all do hate incentives -
everybody says that - but the central argument that if it’s not true,
all else is meaningless, is this

  <p id="050:00">
  The reason for the decision is the incentive in the JDIG. What leads to
the decision on where to locate? I worked on a case once. There was a
startup. The kiosks in grocery stores that you put your member&#39;s
card in and you got specials tailored to your buying habits. This
company needed to reach a certain level of participation from grocery
stores, just got there, and then one of the major chains of the country
pulled out and breached the contract, or at least it was alleged and
there was a settlement. But working on that case, I spent days doing
nothing but looking at boxes full of documents, literally in a warehouse
the size of about half to a third of this chamber. And approximately
half of the documents in those boxes were pro forma projections based on
all sorts of variables and based upon all sorts of changes in those
variables, some minute. And my point is, the companies, when we&#39;re
talking about these big companies, these are important decisions, and
Representative Jeter is right, they&#39;re looking for profitability.
Where can they locate to maximize profitability? They look at logistics.
How close are they to suppliers? How close are they to their market? How
easy is the transportation system? How can they move goods? What&#39;s
the cost of labor? What are the taxes? That&#39;s a huge. What&#39;re
the taxes? What&#39;s the cost of regulation, the education, the
workforce? And you add up all those. And those can be run over
multi-years, and those savings are huge. So in my example, those savings
are a $20 bill. The incentive, as much as it sounds like to us $3
million for something to locate here. That&#39;s a quarter. And I&#39;m
just throwing out coins. Of course it differs in proportionality. But
you&#39;re telling me I&#39;m supposed to vote to use taxpayer money so
that we can dangle a quarter, and they&#39;ll pass up, they won&#39;t
care about that $20 they&#39;ll save. They want that quarter. And my
point is, I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s what drives the decision. I
don&#39;t believe it. I think the literature shows it. I think anecdotal
evidence shows it time and again. I&#39;ll give you an example. A member
of this body yesterday told me a story about how he was the chairman of
the Wake County Board of Commissioners, and he got a call from Governor
Jim Hunt that we got a chance to get Cisco Systems to the Research
Triangle Park, and you know Cisco is a multi-billion dollar corporation.
And the deal depended on Wake County. Durham County&#39;s throwing in.
Wake County had to throw in a million dollars. And this member turned
them down. And the company came, and it&#39;s there, and it&#39;s
successful, and it&#39;s thriving, because that million, as much as it
sounds like to us does not mean anything in the vast yearly carrying on
of these big businesses. And the reason I said earlier this goes to the
gravimum of who we are, is we on the Republican side sell ourselves as
we&#39;re gonna be careful with your money. We&#39;re gonna look at
everything, we&#39;re gonna prioritize, and we believe in the free
enterprise system. We want the market economy. And in so many ways this
flies against that. In just so many ways that some of the other members
have already articulated. Now the other thing that struck me during the
debate on the two bills, is the use of some of the language. I feel like
I&#39;ve been scolded now by some of my own. I&#39;ve heard, you&#39;re
a purist. You people are purists. That was one of the epithets. And
I&#39;m thinking, no, I&#39;m not a purist. Honestly, if somebody wanted
to tailor a bill narrowly for an auto company, I would have to think
long and hard before not voting for it. If there were enough people that
told me we absolutely needed to do that. I can see myself from time to
time on rare occasions, like so many of you all. I know you do.
You&#39;re holding your nose to vote for this. And I know enough people
have said that. So I can see having to do, or maybe do, I still
don&#39;t know if I&#39;d have to, but I sure wouldn&#39;t, I don&#39;t
now if I&#39;d want

  But take that risk in some situations, but I just don&#39;t believe in
the bottom line this is what we have to do, these are tax payer dollars.
 This isn&#39;t just about an auto company, this is a huge check to the
Governor, and Republicans used to call this, when it was Bev Perdue, her
walking around money.  And they used to say kind of bad things to the
Democrats that you&#39;re giving your Governor your walking around
money, and it&#39;s strange to me a little bit to hear, to see the shoe
on the other foot.
The other thing, I know there is, and I&#39;ll close on this, there are
some things that seem to be different, we take different positions over
time, there is one constant though, I think, in this House chamber that
you can count on.  When Representative Luebke stands up to speak, the
light are gonna start to go on.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Rockingham,
Representative Jones, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I just want to make a few
brief points.  The first thing I wanted to do was just follow up with my
conversation with my friend, Representative Jackson, and just to be
factual.  He said he went from 2000 to 2012, so the value of $37,000 in
2012, from 2000 to 2012 went t5o $49,333, so that&#39;s still more than
$48,000.  And so the point is, that I think if anybody&#39;s listening,
attributed those comments to say that the pay went up because of what
happened in the region, I think you would have to then say that it
actually fell below the CPI inflation index and actually didn&#39;t keep
up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash,
Representative Collins, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To see if my good friend, Representative Jones, would
yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentleman from Rockingham yield for the
gentleman from Nash?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Jones, you&#39;re saying that inflation
took care of the rise from, what was it, $38,000 to $49,000, I think?
Would you not agree, though, that he said his home area of Wendell, I
know there&#39;s a, I heard it&#39;s probably Wendell, because it&#39;s
named after Oliver Wendell Homes.  Where I&#39;m from, we incorrectly
call it Windale.  But, anyway, in Wendell or Windale, which ever it
properly is, the wages actually went down by $2,000.  Should you not
agree that if we were having the same degree of success in an area
without an auto plant that they do with it, that indeed those wages
should have gone up.  We should consider that in relation to inflation,
also, and that not only did we lose to inflation, we actually lost out
in even on the amount of the dollar figure, and that we should include
that inflation factor on both ends of his argument.
Representative Collins, I think there are a lot of, a lot of variable
factors that would make a difference between Wake County, North Carolina
and this town in Alabama, and the point that I was trying to make is
that for someone listening to the comments that were made, it would be
easy to extrapolate from that that there was a fair amount of increase
in the salary there because they came in.  That&#39;s the only point I
was trying to make, I didn&#39;t really want to make a federal case out
of it, I just wanted to say that the first time that I heard those
figures it occurred to me that we at lease ought to talk about
inflation, that&#39;s the only point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does Representative Jackson rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To ask Representative Jone if he would yield to
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does he yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Now, Representative Jones,  the statistic you cited
about, the CPI, that&#39;s the Consumer Price Index, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does he yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Would you agree with me that generally the last decade
has been known as the lost decade on wage increases which was what I was
talking about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative, my point was, again, that the present
value of that money, looking at it in $2,000, was the fact that the
increase that you cited meant that they had basically stayed level.  And
I just didn&#39;t want someone listening to the conversation to say that
it went up by $11,000 simple because there was an auto manufacturer
there.  Now, there are a lot of variables, as I said, my only point was
that I didn&#39;t want people to misunderstand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Do you yield, Representative Jones?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Just one more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]And, just so we&#39;re clear, but the number you cited,
the 30 some percent, that was not for the average wage increase from
2000 to 2012, is that correct?

  My number was calculated by the consumer price index calculator,
2000-2012. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis is recognized to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think I still have the floor if I
may, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I apologize. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Continue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will be
brief. I have to go back and explain my vote like every one of us here
does and I understand. I’m not standing here to change anybody’s vote
but I do want to say this, coming from a tier one rural county I cannot
go back and tell my folks that I greatly expanded a program that only 9%
of JDIG funds have gone to rural counties as opposed to 91% to the urban
counties and 59% of JDIG funds have gone to just three counties in the
state, so as we all vote our own districts, that’s one thing I have to
look at. Another thing I’m concerned at is that the Federal Government
has not only been successful at pitting states against each other, we’re
pitting North Carolina Counties and communities against one another.
Let’s be honest. Last summer it was about Western North Carolina. Now
it’s Eastern North Carolina, and many of us have talked about it, and
yes, when it comes, if it was my county and there were tens of millions
of dollars that were going to be coming in, I don’t blame these
representatives for doing what they’re doing, I’m just saying that it
saddens me to see how areas and communities are being pitted against
each other. Representative Catlin spoke about the cost and the question
is where does it stop, and I don’t think it does stop. I don’t think it
matters what party’s in control. More is always better and we can say
this is good, the question is about priorities like another
representative said. Is this our best priority? I was gonna say
something briefly like Representative Blust said, but, you know,
apparently God forbid that North Carolina would be the only state in the
region without an automaker, and if that’s the goal, maybe there
should’ve been a narrow bill that we establish an automaker fund or
something like that. My concern is is what if we don’t land the big
fish. What if it’s not the automaker. We’ve established the precedent.
We’ve put the money out there and you can guarantee that the money’s
gonna be spent somehow if we have the opportunity even if we don’t get
that, so that does concern me. Let me just close by saying and I think
the die is cast at least as far as the House vote, I truly do hope that
this transforms the region like we hear. We hear it’s gonna transform a
region. I truly hope that that happens, but it does concern me. In fact,
it frightens me when we talk about one region of our state being so
dependant on a company, and what happens down the line when the
incentive payments run out and the others come calling and the pasture’s
greener on the other side and we’ve seen it happen before, what happens
to the devastation of that community when it became so dependant on one
job? I’m not smart enough to know all the answers, I just have to vote
my conscience just like you and I’ll have to vote no. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the bill that we have
before us obviously cites an interest to all of us that our passions
because I don’t think there’s a person in this chamber who doesn’t want
the people that they serve to be better off as a result of something
that we may have done when given the chance to serve in this chamber. I
think everybody’s motives are truly to make North Carolina, to make our
respective communities, a better place to live. To make the lives of the
working families that we serve a little bit easier. There’s been a lot
of debate on this bill and the speaker thus far has indulged us to
debate this bill, to debate House Bill 998 from last session, to debate
various things along the way. I’d like to make a few points, mostly
about this bill as per the rules and I may have to respond to a few
other things that were said. First of all, the JGROW program has been
asked two or three times, and I’m not going to put anybody here on the
spot, it’s been asked two or three times, where does the money come
from? How much is spent? What happens where? Well, according to our
fiscal research staff, that’s been spent on what we’re gonna call the
JGROW program, used to be called the JDIG program, it’s $163, 889, 208.
That’s a lot of money. Where’d that money come from?

  It came from the payroll taxes that were payed by the employers to the
state,in the amount of $416,543,040, a nearly four in one return, not a
bad investment.  Not to mention the individuals that got jobs, that
didn&#39;t have them, that went to work, that are now able to support
their families, who perhaps were not able to do so before.  We&#39;ve
heard lots of talk about the refund or the cap on the sales tax that
applies to airlines in the state, who pay the state in excess of $2.5
million in sales and use tax for the jet fuel that they buy.  There are
many of us in this chamber who believe that business inputs
shouldn&#39;t be taxed, they shouldn&#39;t be taxed because those costs
are ultimately passed along to the consumer anyway.  It also affects the
competitive environment of deciding where these businesses will and will
not do business.  So just to be clear, it has been the philosophy, at
least over the last few years of this chamber, that we would look to
make it easier to do business in this state.  And in the interest of
full disclosure, what the airlines would like to have, like most other
businesses, is for all the tax to be off the fuel that they buy.  This
bill simply extends a cap, after, and it applies to all airlines, after
they pay into the state $2.5 million dollars, they can stop paying the
tax.  So. I think it&#39;s a little, respectfully, I think it&#39;s a
little disingenuous to begin to talk about the sales tax of electricity
for consumers, and how it&#39;s right there in plain sight when in fact
we debated it at great length in this chamber that prior to the passage
of the tax reform bill last year there were hidden taxes that were
called franchise fees that were buried in the power bills that were
collected and remitted by the consumer.  This is relevant to this debate
because there&#39;s really only, with money there&#39;s really only
three things  that you can do with it.  You can save it, which is a good
thing, save, invest it.  You can give it away through charity, which
this body has made clear, that if you do a charitable act that that
money&#39;s not subject to tax.  Or you can spend it, you can consume
it, and it&#39;s on the consumption part that we feel the taxation
should be based.
I don&#39;t want, I actually had quite a few points that I&#39;d love to
respond to individually but the bottom line is, I am told by our
Governor and by our Secretary of Commerce that they need these tools to
be able to go out and compete.  I&#39;m told by our fiscal staff that
the investment or the refund of the taxes paid in to through the J-Dig,
J-Growth program has been a positive return for the state.  Based on
that, I don&#39;t see any reason why we&#39;d want to handicap our
state, restrict our state&#39;s ability to compete on the international
stage to give people jobs.  I respectfully ask for you to vote green,
it&#39;s time we move this state forward, it&#39;s time that we, there
have been great speeches made on both side, I&#39;m certain that
they&#39;ll be memorialized through the ages, but at some point
we&#39;ve got to get through the talking points that we&#39;ve all been
asked to make and  to vote to provide jobs for the people of our state.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman from Richmond, Representative Goodman is
recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  There&#39;s a guy that&#39;s
an economist at MIT named Steven Levitt, and he&#39;s written several
books.  He wrote Freakonomics and SuperFreakonomics, and he wrote one
called Think Like A Freak.  And what he&#39;s done, he&#39;s done all
these case studies on just all kinds of things like bizarre baby names
and sumo wrestlers and crack

  Dealers living with their parents and school teachers.  And he has one
hypothesis he keeps proving over and over and over again, and that is
very simple, and it is that people respond to incentives, and I mean,
you can&#39;t deny it.  We all do it, I got an American Express card in
my pocket that pays me 2% rebate on everything I buy and I got another
credit card that doesn&#39;t.  I use the American Express card.
I&#39;ve got a VIC  card that I get, so I go to Harris Teeter so I can
get that discount.  Now, that&#39;s a trivial thing, but if I am a CEO
or a major corporation looking for a place to put a plant, I&#39;m not
going to decide to expand or build a plant just because North
Carolina&#39;s offering incentives, but I am going to decide where
I&#39;m going to put it based on that.  We love the dirt in North
Carolina better than anywhere else, but again, if I&#39;m a CEO
somewhere, I would think the dirt in South Carolina looks just as good,
if they&#39;re paying me or giving me an incentive to come there and
North Carolina&#39;s not.  Now, we can love and hate incentives all we
want to, I know people on the hard right say when we have all these
government programs they incentivize people not to work, so clearly the
people on the right believe in incentives also, at some level, whether
you agree with that or not.  But the point I want to make, you can love
them, you can hate them, you can say we&#39;d rather not have the
businesses here, but you can not say that incentives don&#39;t matter
because they do.  So, I&#39;m asking you, I&#39;ve been quiet, I know
there&#39;s been a lot of debate but just listening to all of this and I
just wanted to make that point and to say, please vote for this bill,
the State of North Carolina needs it, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady from Randolph, Representative Hurley is
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak to the bill, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You may proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Last Saturday I went to the local mall to get a
birthday gift.   I went into Bell&#39;s and they didn&#39;t have what I
was looking for so I walked down the halls.  Hallmark was moving all
their cabinets, they had closed.  I walked on down the mall, Radio Shack
closed, store closing, walked on down, J.C. Penny&#39;s closing.  I
drove back home, Fred&#39;s, one of the local stores, has a lot of
stores, they were closing.  Aero International is closing because of the
ACA bill, because they&#39;re taxing medical devices, we&#39;re losing
300 jobs because of that.  Yes, we have a mega site that&#39;s out
there, hopefully we&#39;ll get somebody, maybe we won&#39;t.  And you
know it probably won&#39;t change anybody&#39;s vote, but I am a tax
payer.  I don&#39;t have any children in the school system, my taxes are
going to pay for schools, but I don&#39;t care because we need schools.
I don&#39;t have anybody in the prisons, but we need to pay for the
prisoners because they are in there and they&#39;re our wards.  There
are so many things our tax money goes for, why can&#39;t it go to pay
for our Commerce Department, to pay to bring people here?  And I just
hope and pray that you will vote green, we need these and I know
you&#39;re conscious, but I think you can tell your people, your
taxpayer money is going for a good cause, whether it&#39;s going to your
county, my county, where ever it goes.  The J-Dig helped my county, it
was one of the one&#39;s that did and I&#39;m a Tier 2 county.  My
Brands came from Minnesota, they opened a cereal company there.  They
did exactly what they were going to do, they brought, they helped bring
jobs to our place and then they increased, they added on to their
company and bought another block and brought more jobs, and it has
helped our county.  But as you see, we&#39;re losing others, so please
think about your conscience.  I know you&#39;re going to vote and
you&#39;re going to have to make this play, but we&#39;re all taxpayers
and our people, we&#39;re here to represent them, and we do need jobs in
North Carolina.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman from Rutherford, Representative Hager is
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to speak to debate the bill.
Guys, I don&#39;t think most of you know me, that I understand rural
areas.  I&#39;m a, I have two trucks, which in Rutherford County,
that&#39;s a great thing, for you all that live in urban areas.  I live
on a farm, a small farm and I live in a barn.  I wasn&#39;t raised in a
barn but I live in one.  Representative Luebke said companies come to
North Carolina for the infrastructure.  Well guess what?  I don&#39;t
have any infrastructure.  I don&#39;t have a Charlotte Airport, I
don&#39;t have  metropolitan water systems and sanitary sewer systems
and all those things.  But yet, in the time that I&#39;ve been down
here, we&#39;ve had some companies, and you guys know Facebook is in
Rutherford County, a billion dollar investment, paying an average of
$60,000 a year when the average salary in Rutherford County is

  <p id="075:00">
  thirty one thousand dollars a year, that matters. You know we have a
company called Horse Head that&#39;s two hundred and seventy five jobs.
New process, never done in the world came to Rutherford county. Not
because of the infrastructure because again we don&#39;t have it. We
have a company called Valley Fine Foods, make all organic pasta only
other company you have is in California we&#39;re they&#39;re east coast
location. Diamond Back Tactical and we&#39;ve got a new project. All of
these came because we have incentive dollars not because we had
infrastructure. I got a call last night from my county commission
chairman. Had a phone call this morning from my economic development
chairman, we have a new project. I think it&#39;s called Hummingbird,
two hundred jobs in Rutherford county. Let me take you guys back and I
hope you get tired of hearing this because it means it&#39;s ingrained
in your head. When I got elected the unemployment rate in Rutherford
county was above eighteen percent it is now below eight percent. Still
above the average. So two hundred jobs in Rutherford county means a lot.
Guess what? We&#39;re in competition with four other states. We
don&#39;t have JDIG dollars this bill would give us the ability to get
that two hundred jobs in Rutherford county. It means a lot to me, it
means a lot to rural areas. We talked about data centers. Representative
Luke you and I talked about this in finance I don&#39;t want to rehash
this but that is one issue that has worked for rural areas. Data centers
from Lanora North Carolina in that area I&#39;d call that golden
crescent all the way to Rutherford county provided jobs in excess and
sometimes double and triple the county average of yearly salary in the
county their in. That means a lot us and it&#39;s a psychological issue.
When you come into Rutherford county and you see Facebook data center,
the first thing you see where an old mill textile mill use to be, that
means a lot for my people it&#39;s a psychological issue. It may not
mean that thing for somebody that lives in Wake county or Durham county
or Mecklenberg county because you guys have that we don&#39;t. It means
a lot for us it means a lot for what&#39;s happening in Cleveland county
for my folks can work in also. That&#39;s been a sixty or seventy
percent drop in unemployment. Just because of incentive issues in my
district. Guys it means a lot to me you might say only nine or ten
percent is going to rural areas but that nine or ten percent has made a
dang big bang in Rutherford county. It&#39;s made it in Michelle&#39;s
district and some of the other rural areas. It means a lot. I don&#39;t
have a lot of people that make six figures. Representative Luke I
don&#39;t have a lot of six figure professors there. It&#39;s just the
way it is. So we have people that make thirty thousand dollars. We need
more jobs this is the way to do it. Please help the rural areas please
vote green.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
There&#39;s one member left in opposition, one member left in support. I
suggest that be the end of it. Representative special of Craven county
is recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Which side of the issue am I on? I told myself I&#39;m not going to get
up and speak today because I don&#39;t think there is anybody that
doesn&#39;t know where I stand on this. And the bottom line is we&#39;re
not going to change minds here. But sometimes you just feel like you
need to stand up and you need to say it you need to say something. And
when representative Blust got up and spoke it was like deja vu. Ten
years ago, twelve years ago, eight years ago sittin up in the gallery
listening to him say essentially what he said today. Only then he was
talking to Democrats who were in charge. And today he is talking about
he&#39;s talking to Republicans who are in charge and we&#39;re looking
at doing the same thing, I don&#39;t get it. I don&#39;t understand what
happened. I don&#39;t understand were our mentality went, where out
energy our vigour to support the people disappeared at. What happened to
change us? That we&#39;re going to support incentives that most of us
said we wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;ve heard comments about, well you know you
all can stand on your principle while people starve and don&#39;t have
jobs. I mean it&#39;s ridiculous. I&#39;m not standing on principles
ladies and gentleman I&#39;m standing on promises. I&#39;m standing on
promises I made when I asked people to vote for me. And I don&#39;t
understand why we&#39;re not all standing on those same promises. I know
people in here who promised, who made those promises as they campaigned.
And I see them getting ready to vote to support things they promised
they wouldn&#39;t do. We&#39;re hear the heart tugging stories about how
we need jobs in North Carolina, it&#39;s important and in my district
this and in my district that. We get that, that&#39;s not the issue. We
understand that, the question is, A do the incentives

  Work and the evidence says no, and B, is this something that we should
be doing with the people’s money and the answer there is no. So I’m
gonna end my comments by once again saying please, think about what
you’re doing. Remember why we came up here and hit that no button.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash,
Representative Collins rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me just say to start off I don’t have talking
points. As far as I know there aren’t any cameras, well, there is one
camera in here today. I apologize for that. I don’t care whether the
people back home read my, I very rarely read a newspaper so I don’t know
whether my name’s appearing in them or not. Could care less. I don’t. I
simply don’t. I talk to the press as little as possible. I’m winning
elections by 10% more every time I run in my district so I’ve told the
newspapers back home they can say, you know, when they’ve threatened
we’re gonna follow you in such a way based on how you vote on this bill,
I say what you’ve been doing’s been working for me. Keep it up. Why
change now? Doesn’t matter. So I say that to say this, I don’t have any
talking points. I don’t care whether people hear me or not. I
respectfully declined an invitation from the speaker’s office this
morning to be included in the press release and have a comment from me
made on this bill because it doesn’t matter. We’re doing what’s right. I
don’t care where the credit goes. Doesn’t make a bit of difference from
me. Now, no one is saying, I don’t think among our primary sponsors no
one is saying that incentives are the reason or even a primary reason
why people are coming to North Carolina. I haven’t said that. I haven’t
heard any of my bill sponsors say that. But, and I realize that if you
ask CEOs, I’ve looked at studies, I’ve read them, I agree with our
Speaker Pro Tempore Stam that if you ask CEOs it’s gonna appear 7th on
the list or something like that, but you know, it doesn’t matter. If
you’ve got 10 metrics that are on the check off list that you have to
meet before you get an interview or before you get a phone call it
doesn’t matter if it’s 10th on the list of 10. If you don’t have it,
you’re cut before you even get a chance to tell how great and beautiful
our state is and all that kind of stuff. Frankly I hope we can continue
this program and get companies to come here without ever having to use a
dime of the money. You know, I heard somebody say well all the money’s
gonna be spent. Well, one of the criticisms I’ve heard of the program is
that we don’t spend all the money. We don’t need the money because we
don’t spend it. Well, frankly I’d like to have the money available and
not spend a dime of it. I hope once we get checked and yeah, this
company’s great, and I agree the major reason people are coming here is
because of the tax reforms and regulatory reforms I’ve helped you folks
in this chamber pass over the last four years. That’s absolutely true,
but I want all the metrics to be able to be checked whether we have to
use them all or not. So whether the incentive is a primary reason or the
last reason on the list doesn’t really make any difference. That’s not
the point. I’ve heard people talk about this success of our recruitment
in the past, you know, and how great we’ve done. Well, two things about
it. Number one, we’ve had this program available. We’re extending a
program we’ve had, number two, we are still as someone reminded us today
the only plant named, I mean the only state named North Carolina or
surrounding state that doesn’t have one of these types of auto
manufacturing plants that we’re trying to get. Representative Jones
brought out a good fact today. It wasn’t his intention, but he did bring
out a fact that we all know if we’ve looked at it. In 2000, the decade
from 2000-2010 North Carolina had real wage decline and a real wage
decline worse than the nation as a whole and we’re turning that around
with policies that we’ve instituted since 2011. If anybody has been
coerced to try to change their vote from yesterday, I apologize for
that, but again, I haven’t coerced anybody. I don’t think Representative
Martin could scare anybody into voting for something. She’s not very
intimidating to me when she talks to me about things we disagree with.
If there’s been any coercion, I certainly don’t think it’s been on the
part of the bill sponsors and if you’ve been coerced to try to change
your vote one way or the other, I apologize for whoever did the
coercion. We’ve got a lot of charges flying in this chamber today. I’ve
heard a lot of saying well, it’s just all about my district, it’s all
about my district, it’s all about my district, and I’ve heard that
primarily from the folks against this bill because it’s not in their
district. I remind you of what I said yesterday. I voted last year for
something that would help a district across the state from where I live
gladly. I tell people every day in my district when they ask me what are
you doing for the district, 99.99% of what is good for the state of
North Carolina is good for my district. Those aren’t two separate
things, folks. that’s a false dichotomy

  Anybody who’s, I agree, if you’re trying to divide us up by district and
region and all that kinda thing I don’t have any use for that. I have no
use for that whatsoever. I’m glad, I’m happy when anything happens for
any district in North Carolina. I rejoice with that, and I’ve showed
that consistently with my voting in this chamber. I’ve heard that, you
know, I think one of our representatives talked about all the jobs he’s
created in this state and I’m very thankful for that and I agree there’s
a lot of entrepreneurs who are creating a lot of jobs, great jobs in
North Carolina, but I didn’t hear and maybe he didn’t name them all, but
I didn’t hear one Tier 1 area in the list of locations that he gave. You
know, Folks, I’ve been wanting to say this for a long time and I’m just
gonna say it straight from the heart, straight from the gut, cause
that’s the only way I know to talk. I used to hear this from the other
side of the aisle a lot. This year I’m hearing it from my side of the
aisle a lot and I’ll just say this, I’ve heard a lot of emotionally
charged words thrown around today and, you know, you know me, I like
factual stuff. I’m a numbers geek. I admit that from the start. I always
have been, but if you’re reason, if you’re point is that you’re opposite
position to me on the bill is because of your moral superiority to me, I
will grant you that for every member of this chamber from this day
forward. My understanding of the religious practice that I follow
teaches me that for me to get anywhere with God, the first thing I have
to recognize as the Apostle Paul says is that inside of me there is no
good thing. So any of you who feel a moral superiority to me on this
bill or any other bill, I grant you you are a morally superior being to
me this day and every day of your life, but my district, my area of this
state, needs the type of opportunity that we have here, and we can’t
guarantee this will make an auto plant come to North Carolina. Several
of them are looking, none of them may come, but if they do, if one of
them comes, it’ll be good for this entire state, and I would ask you
let’s just cut the emotional rhetoric and charging each other as sinners
and all this kinda stuff. I will admit that. I’m the chief of sinners in
this chamber, so any time you wanna preach that sermon from now on,
please just understand that I already know that. You don’t have to tell
me that, but I would beg of you for the good of not my district, cause
it’s not in my district, for the good of my region of the state and for
the good of the state, please vote green on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, we have a school group visiting us in the gallery from Sardis
Elementary in Monroe, NC. If you all would please stand we’d like to
welcome you and thank you for being with us today. [applause] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Catawba, Representative Adams rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
has the floor to debate the bill [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not gonna talk
theory and I’m not gonna talk about failures of incentives. I’ve seen
them fail and I’ve seen the succeed, but I’ll talk about a situation I’m
dealing with right now. We’re working on a project in Catawba County
that’s not an automobile plant. It’s not a huge project but it’ll
generate about 350 jobs. We’ve been working on this thing for a number
of months and we really have been in the lead. We’ve got the historic
labor force to do the job. We’ve got the community college trained
people, the new people to do the jobs. I don’t know how many of you
folks have worked in a furniture plant or any kind of manufacturing
plant, but I have, and the years that I spent working with 250 people to
build a product were some of the best years of my life. It’s a family
experience to be in a manufacturing plant and to enjoy the enthusiasm
that people have as they earn a living, to send your kids to school, to
buy the cars, the bass boats and to take the vacations and you live with
those memories, and we’ve lost a lot. I made a promise to my people to
create jobs and this is not a perfect piece of legislation. I’ll remind
you that what it takes to make this work is leadership. You know who
made Charleston, SC what it is today? A guy name Joe Riley. One guy. He
did it right. He had a vision and he made it work. What we have to look
for, and look at the Charlotte Douglass Airport. Who did that? Cherry
Ore. Leadership, that’s what it takes to make these things work. So we

Further discussion, further debate? If not the question before the House
is the passage of the House Committee Substitute for House Bill 117 on
its third reading. So many favoring passage of the bill will vote aye,
those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will
lock the machine and record the vote, 88 having voted in the affirmative
and 29 in the negative the bill is adopted. It is ordered engrossed and
sent to the Senate. Senate Bill 20, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senators Rabin, Rucho, Tillman, Senate Bill 20, a bill to be
entitled an act to update the reference to the internal revenue code to
decouple from certain provisions of the federal tax increase provision
act of 2014, to modify the motor fuels tax rate and to make certain
reductions within the Department of Transportation for the 2014-2015
fiscal year. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And before we take up debate, the chair would respectfully
remind the body that we did fully debate and vote on this bill
yesterday. For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenberg,
Representative Brawley rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I am proud to point out
that today is the 100th anniversary of the North Carolina Department of
Transportation. It was on this date in 1915 that the highway commission
was created by the act of the General Assembly and took over the
management of the nonexistent roads in the state of North Carolina. It
was a time when there was not a paved road between Charlotte and Raleigh
and today when I go home depending on the weather I may go 85, I may go
49 and 64, I might drop down and take 24, 27 and if it’s really bad I’ll
go all the way down US 1 and go in 74 because there will be so many
options on how to get home because of the work that’s been done over the
last 100 years. We’ve had two debates. One was the talking points. Is
this a tax increase. I’ve never said it was a tax increase regardless of
what anyone else may claim. It is less of a tax decrease than we would
have had. The question we’ve been facing is how do we maintain the
ability of DOT to continue to do roads as they have for the last 100
years. 70 of us came together yesterday on a first step to solving our
problems on this and I ask that those of you who were close yesterday
join us today. Let’s move this bill forward and go to lunch. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from New
Hanover, Representative Hamilton rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth
an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to send forth an
amendment and the clerk will read the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hamilton moves to amend the bill on Page 3, lines 25-29
by deleting the lines. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady from New Hanover has
the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Very simply, this amendment is similar to the amendment that
was run yesterday. It simply decouples the tuition, college tuition, and
allows us to offer a college tuition and loan deduction from our state
income taxes similar to how we do it at the federal level as well. We’ve
done this frequently over the years and this, the bill as it’s presented
to you would have eliminated that ability to have the tuition tax credit
or tax deduction and by removing that language that will allow the
tuition deduction or tax credit to stay in place. I ask for your
support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from
Mecklenberg, Representative Brawley rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To comment
on the lady’s amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor
to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This isn’t Charlotte, sir. I
do not object to the lady’s amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion, further debate on the amendment. Representative Gill, does
the lady wish to debate the amendment or is this on the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, further discussion, further
debate on the amendment. If not, the question before the House is
amendment 3 set forth by Representative Hamilton to the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 20. So many favoring the adoption of the
amendment will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open
the vote.

  The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 109 having voted in
the affirmative and 3 in the negative. The amendment is adopted. Now
back on the bill. For what purpose does the lady from Wake,
Representative Gill, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We have had
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We have had quite a bit of
talk in the assembly about increasing or making sure that we have money
for infrastructure, I mean transportation infrastructure. And I want to
ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Mecklenburg yield to a
question from the lady from Wake?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wondering if you thought about, or did you think
about the fact that if we allowed the 37.5 cents to be extended to
January, 2013, that we would generate more revenue for this
infrastructure versus dropping it to 35 cents?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is correct in what she has said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Guildford,
Representative Blust, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. And I
know it&#39;s third reading, and I know we debated yesterday, but there
were two very important bills that came up on the same day in a 2:00
session that we also had the state of the judiciary speech. And these
are very important bills that again, even more so than the previous
bill, go to the very heart of what we claim to be. Let me quote. I
can&#39;t use placards, but let me quote a mission statement that was
adopted on June 15, 2011, that I used to see on a lot of the doors here,
including the Speaker&#39;s door. Because I think it goes to the heart
of exactly what we have claimed as Republicans. Mission statement: To
develop a budget for North Carolina which brings spending into line with
available revenues by identifying the proper and necessary functions of
state government and then prioritizing them. And I just wonder if
we&#39;re really doing this now. Let me go through a little history.
Great cover was taken over time by the former majority party because
they had this automatic escalator built into the gas tax. The minority
party at that time, which is now the majority party, on a consistent
basis said that&#39;s bad government. To have, if you need the revenue,
someone ought to take responsibility by having to vote for them. That
was our clear position. In 2006, every Republican in the General
Assembly, maybe it was late 2005, signed a letter demanding a special
session, that Governor Easley call a special session to cap the gas tax,
and then I think it was 29.9. And one of the big arguments, particularly
on the Senate side, was you shouldn&#39;t do this to people when
they&#39;re having to pay higher gas taxes. We shouldn&#39;t be
profiting on their misery at the same time you don&#39;t have to take a
vote on it. You can claim I had nothing to do with it. That was a clear
position over time. In 2009, the then majority party put a floor under
it. There were members that were about almost apoplectic that, oh, you
guys, you&#39;ll ride it up, but you won&#39;t let it go down those few
times it goes down. And great stock was put on the explanation that,
well, the costs of the roads goes up when the cost of fuel goes up. When
it goes down, the price goes down. That was said to people for years and
years. Then in 2010 a great thing happened, in my opinion. The
Republicans took the majority, partly campaigning on this issue, among
others, and campaigning on the fact that we&#39;ll

And his revenues very precisely where prioritized when of the government
nailed down idea we&#39;d been lighted believe everybody here knows bob
Thompson of
some fact we&#39;ve done lightly voted to cap the tax officer was then
that 30 time at 32 when a cop is where they looked even the caucus that
did not want
to and I was to send them pass with that class of 22 am because they
have from an table and Mac Office said I&#39;d done here on this issue
I&#39;m not quite
what we need to vote on this now the senate died in the past one of the
senate adjourned in(SPEAKER CHANGES) Wisconsin  taken out the high
number about you not see
the band bomb of lowered a specially when it was clear clearly made to
the public think clearly made and used in Intel was debates on this
flower and
the other chamber and now when a difficult situation I anticipate what
that meant the gas tax rose to 37 1/2 in unanticipated doctors I sure
didn&#39;t
think of it was a map and attacks that depict price of gasoline show a
drop in outlook looking at a decrease of it is to go back up some on
January 1
if nothing&#39;s done you get some of the bounce back of bands given
what we said when we were willing to cap it before the limelight was an
offense to
prioritize and this should we do things first like stop the decision
because I heard yesterday people signed null you just Gotta have is to
build
about four thatched room while we taking all of this money 5¢ on the
dollar 5¢ on the attacks and diverted to other uses us this is such a
quality
we needed an adverse Indonesia that&#39;s 5¢ right thing and divide it
one of the look of some other practices for example I understand that
88,000,000
was spent last year are another th later recent years on paying Duke
Energy to relocate its Allies and we widen roads are order of work
nobody even
looks about is that really the cost would await we just haven&#39;t made
some of these difficult decisions (SPEAKER CHANGES)and we haven&#39;t
looked carefully what we said
we would and now we&#39;re gonna stick it to the public and I&#39;m not
trying to use of talking, but unknown that&#39;s what we said before and
I think we need
to keep all word I think we need to look at alternative why use and end
of not go down this while there&#39;s plenty of time before July 1 to 10
to go up
to go on other labs and then I just think we should look to discuss we
have is that this also an island on this bus isn&#39;t gonna be just
about this
issue revenues education as example in as many times have debates with
the outcome of the opposition where Benson we just have the resources
and less
than a few banks would have to lay off teachers would have to do this
and that move some of the second few prioritized when awesome banks
let&#39;s do
something else to save money this mod is necessary and another stand

it seems like we did tonight was the first inning but says it plans a
certain level of maintenance and you buy a five-sized projects based on

  To commend my colleagues on the Republican side.  I hear a lot about
promises that they&#39;ve made to their constituents, which I&#39;ve
made promises, I&#39;m sure we all have, and we want to keep those
promises.  And I just want to remind some of my friends over there of
one promise that they made, and they made it to Mr. Grover Norquist, and
that was not to raise taxes.  And I think as a consensus, whether people
admit it or not, that this is a tax increase if we vote for this bill.
But I just want to remind a few of you that you did sign a pledge to not
raise taxes, and I&#39;m just going to call some names.  Now, you know
who you are, I have a list, but I would say to you that if you made that
promise, not to raise taxes, if you vote for this then, of course,
you&#39;re breaking that promise.  So, I&#39;m going to employ to you
that you keep your promise to your constituents, I made some promises
too.  I didn&#39;t promise I wasn&#39;t going to vote for tax raises
because I don&#39;t know what happens in the future, so I wouldn&#39;t
make that promise.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll end up voting for some tax
raises at some point, but if I can vote for something that would reduce
taxes, then I&#39;ll do that.  But certainly I&#39;m not going to vote
for something that would raise taxes on, especially those people who can
least afford it, and we&#39;ll talk about our working people, the middle
class, and even those people that don&#39;t work but they have to drive
and they&#39;re looking for jobs.  So, I ask you, please, those of you
who voted for the bill yesterday, think about it, and think about your
promise that you made and vote against this bill.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Stam, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m in favor of the bill for the reasons I
mentioned yesterday, I just wanted to challenge Representative Blust to
a little math contest here.  He told us that 30 cents, or 29.9 cents was
the appropriate level of taxation on gas in 2006, but that&#39;s nine
years ago.  Apply the CPI index or the GDP deflator and I hope
Representative Blust will propose we set it at what that would be, which
is about 35 or 36 cents a gallon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Gilford,
Representative Blust, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Stam would yield for a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman
from Gilford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, did I say it was the appropriate
level in 2006, or did I say you signed a letter demanding that the
Governor then call a special session to cap it at 29.9?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, both.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
Representative Hall, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill, briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and a lot of ways for us to
approach this.  I think we all see it as being a tax increase on those
folks who would have to pay more than they would otherwise have to pay
if we did not do this.  So, we can break out the lipstick and do
whatever else we got to do on this, but that&#39;s what it is and
that&#39;s who it&#39;s on, and some level of fairness is going to have
to prevail.  I know it&#39;s inconvenient for this to be up at the same
time.  117 is up and people don&#39;t want that clear comparison to be
made, but it will be made.  And again, we have, a few of us on this
side, but the majority of you have the opportunity to do this the right
way.  The time is there to get it done if the will is there to get it
done, and I would implore you again because we do know the subsequent
fight that we&#39;re going to have with the Senate over doing this
correctly is going to be there.  So we have to start from a place that
we can defend and be on board, and this, again, ends up being a tax
increase against those who can least afford it.  So I hope you would
consider those folks, they&#39;re North Carolinians, too, many of them
are in your districts, too, and they want an opportunity, just a shot to
try to make it, but they can&#39;t carry the weight of this state on
their backs every time.  We just can&#39;t keep transferring the tax
burden to them at every turn.  Give them a chance.  Give your members of
your district, you citizens, give

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Give them a chance. Let them have an opportunity to
try to make it and not have to carry the burden that&#39;s not
proportionately theirs. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Dollar rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the House. Just one
quick point with respect to Representative Blust earlier. What was
happening at the time, and I was here at the time, and I spoke on this
issue at the time. What was happening at the time was gas prices were
rising dramatically and what we wanted to do was to cap it. We wanted-we
didn&#39;t want the gas tax to be flying up at the same time the cost of
gasoline on consumers was rising. What this bill does, and it&#39;s very
straightforward. It cuts the current tax by a penny and a half. It cuts
the current tax by a penny and a half. And then it creates, unlike what
happened previously when we had a ceiling, and that ceiling turned into
a floor, and we voted against that, you will remember that. This is a
ceiling and a floor. It&#39;s a flat rate. It&#39;s 36 cents, it&#39;s
not going to be subject, at least if this bill is enacted, it&#39;ll no
longer be subject to the fact that prices are going to go up. And what
if there&#39;s a crisis this afternoon and somebody shoots some more
missiles in the Middle East? We&#39;re already seeing gas prices go back
up, they could go up quite a bit more. We could have a doubling of the
price of a barrel of gasoline and we would look pretty good having
capped this thing at 36 because it could go well beyond that. But
here&#39;s the most important thing. The thing that I think is most
important about the argument, you have to have the resources. One of the
comments, and I&#39;m not picking on my dear friend, Representative
Blust, but he talked about, okay what about moving the highway patrol,
which is I think the biggest single expense that you could potentially
move to the general fund? But if you move the highway patrol, you&#39;ve
got to have a couple of hundred million dollars extra sitting around  in
the general fund to fund that. We don&#39;t have that right now.
That&#39;s not there. What we-where the situation that we are in today
is looking forward in the next few months, what will the money be? What
money will we have to do our maintenance and our safety for the citizens
that are riding up and down these roadways every day? I mean if you
don&#39;t want the rumble strips cut, If you don&#39;t want the safety
cables put up, you don&#39;t want the reflectors down the median. If you
don&#39;t want safety on your roads and highways, you want to cut the
maintenance, you want to have more potholes, you want to have more
dangerous situations, then vote against this bill. You&#39;ll get that.
But if you have that concern that many of share in this room, that
public safety is one of the most sacred things that we need to hold dear
as members of the General Assembly, then I would urge you, I would
implore you to vote for this bill and to think about the safety of our
families, of our citizens riding up and down these highways and do not
put that in peril.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House, is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 20 on its third reading. So many favoring
passage of the bill will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote,
72 having voted in the affirmative and 42 in the negative, the House
Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 20 passes its third reading, and
will be returned to the Senate. It is also ordered and ingrossed and
will be sent to the Senate by special messenger. And also Senate-House
Bill 117 is directed to be sent to the Senate by special messenger.
Members, I do want to ask our pages to come forward.

Then you may speak for a moment of personal privilege.

Members, when you drive into Orange County from the West, you may see a
highway marker that says Harriet Morehead Berry highway. This is the
100th anniversary of our current transportation. Harriet Morehead Berry
was largely responsible for that system. During the war, when she was
made head of the transportation board, she traveled across the highway
and lobbied businesses and governments to create a highway system to
take our crops to the market. So I&#39;d like to just urge you, check
out that highway marker when you come into Orange County.

Tuesday there&#39;s a special meeting for the environment committee. I
wonder if you could tell us whether that&#39;s to take up a bill or what
