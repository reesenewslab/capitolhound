The House will come to order. Members, please take your seats. Visitors,
please retire from the chamber. Members and visitors, please silence all
cellular phones and personal electronic devices. The prayer will be
offered by Representative Steinburg. Members and visitors in the
gallery, please stand and please remain standing for the Pledge of
Allegiance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and
it’s interesting that I was here to deliver the prayer on the opening
day of session, and here I am again on the closing day of session, so
this is quite an honor indeed. Members of the House and folks in the
gallery, let’s bow our heads in prayer, if we would. God of indefinite
love and wisdom and power before whom we shall one day appear to give an
account of the deeds done in our lifetime, mercifully forgive our sins
and grant unto us the peace that passes all human understanding. As thou
dose know not only collectively but individually our motives, desires
and weaknesses, we await the illumination of our minds and the
purification of our hearts. Then shall we go to our tasks rejoicing that
we are laborers together with thee. Too often we live in a little world,
circumscribed by material things and selfish interests. Wilt thou give
us greater perspective, a vision of a world in which all life and
service is unto God and not unto man? When this day comes to a close –
in fact, when this session comes to a close, may we be able to say
“Father, I finished the work thou gavest me to do.” For thy namesake,
amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
united States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one
nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

10:20 inside the capital. All members of the General Assembly are
invited to take part of the wreath laying to honor those who served this
first global war. Governor McCory will be in attendance as well. We will
do our best to try and make that meeting, but we will have to continue
the House’s business if necessary.
Senate Bill 744. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, conferees appointed to resolve the difference between
the Senate and the House of Representatives on Senate Bill 744. The bill
to be entitled An Act to Make Base Budget Appropriations for Current
Operations of State Departments, Institutions, and Agencies, and for
Other Purposes. The conferees recommend that the Senate and House of
Representatives adopt this report. Conferees for the Senate: Senate
Brown, chair, Senator Apodaca, Berger, Brock, Harrington, Hise, Hunt,
Jackson, Meredith, Pate, Rabin, Randleman, Rucho, Soucek, Tillman. For
the House, Representative Dollar, chair, Representative Johnson,

Lambeth, West, Murry, Daughtry, Boles, Faircloth, Hurley, Cleveland,
Shepard, Lewis, Moore, Hager, and Tillis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, it’s the intent of the chair to take the vote, the
third reading vote on the Appropriations bill at 9:50, therefore we will
let all members talk and be mindful of the limit of the debate on third
reading. In the event that we have to move the previous question, that
would mean that the vote would be taken around 9:52. Representative
Dollar, please state your purpose. .
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion. The gentleman is first
recognized to put forth the motion and then to debate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion is the adoption of the conference report for Senate Bill 744
on its third reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, let me begin, let me just
cover a few different things this morning. First and foremost, I do want
to once again extend my personal thanks and the thanks of this chamber
to all of conferees to the full chairs of the Appropriations Committee,
to the chairs of all of the Appropriations Committees in all the various
areas who did a tremendous amount of work this entire year and actually
this entire two years, on the budget. I want to also extend thanks, I
know most of the staff is not here this morning. We released them so
they wouldn’t have to be here this morning, but our senior staff is
certainly here in the back and I would like for them to stand up and get
a round of applause at this time.
And as was done yesterday, we have a tremendous number of...well, we
have some tremendous people who worked both for the Speaker and for the
majority in a variety of subject areas dealing with the budget in other
areas and they did just an outstanding job in this process as well. I
want to thank them. I want to clean up a couple of things from
yesterday. One, there was the question with regard to the hospital in
Pungo. I went back and consulted with a number of folks, and just to
clarify, the facility there is currently a 24 hour clinic. It’s not an
emergency room, but it’s a 24 hour clinic. It is my understanding in
consultation with Representative Brown that land has been acquired and
funds are already committed to doing a facility that I believe would
accommodate emergency care in that area so that’s something if you’re
interested in, please look into that. I do want to bridge off that and
just simply stay, for all of you who are concerned with your community
hospitals, with any of the issues involving health care as it relates to
Medicaid and what this state is involved with, there is going to be
before...</p>

<p id="10:00">
for this body in November what I think will be an historic landmark
debate and decision with regard to Medicaid reform, and I would
encourage all of you to look very carefully at the House version of
House Bill 1181. Get up to speed on that. If you were concerned about
your community hospitals in particular, among other issues, the House
version of 1181 is the version that you want to be up to speed on and be
supportive of, certainly in my view, when we come back in November. So
in addition to the elections, you’ve got some homework assignments while
we’re out. I also want to come back and talk about the budget, and I
particularly want to extend my thanks to all 68 members who voted for
the budget. These are revisions to the two-year budget, and I just
remember back to my days under Governor Martin. Governor Martin had a
couple very simple things that I have tried to apply in the budgeting
process, at least for myself because when he came into office, he said
“I want to keep it simple.” He said “I’m for better schools, better
roads, and more and better jobs,” and I think that over the two years of
this session, of this session of the General Assembly, that we have
worked on better schools in our appropriations budgets last year and
this year, we have worked on better roads in conjunction with the budget
and other bills that have been passed, and we have worked on and seen
the results, actually, of more and better jobs for this state, and he
always had another saying, Mr. Speaker, and I’ll end with this. He said
“The way you get there with limited resources is you have to set
priorities, and I commend the majority that voted yesterday, the 68
members of this body that voted for the budget. You have seen and set
forward, both last year and this year, a clear vision of how to set
priorities in the state of North Carolina. Our priorities is to get our
economy straight because that’s the long-term prosperity of this state,
the long-term resources for what it is this, the General Assembly, wants
to invest money in, and you set priorities in a variety of areas, most
notably education, and most notable education in this budget. That was a
top priority for this General Assembly, and as we said yesterday, the
promises have been kept by this General Assembly in this budget. You
have set the right priorities, you have funded those priorities, and you
have funded what is most important and most critical to the citizens of
this great state and for their future, and I commend you for your
actions yesterday and I ask for your vote again on this conference
report today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the adoption of the conference
report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of
the House, and again, we know this has been a difficult and complicated
process. We appreciate the vote, bipartisan vote yesterday, to make the
statement that this is not the way to optimally do it and that we’re
better than this, and we hope that you will continue to vote your
conscience today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Holley, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the budget. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to tell you a little bit. I want to just tell a little story. I
want to tell you a little bit about my mother. My mother had five
children ages one through five, so we were real close in age, and we
weren’t rich people, but she knew how to hold onto a penny until it
hollered, and there were some things that she would do. She was a master
cook, as you can tell. I got it from somewhere. Somebody fed me
something good at some point in my life. And she was this master cook,
but the meal that meant the most was the Saturday dinner because that
Saturday dinner was made up of all the stuff that she would put in that
was leftovers throughout the week that wouldn’t make a good dish. She’d
put old okra in it.</p>

She’d put roast beef in it. When you make a good pot of soup or stew or
something like that, sometimes you get something and you put it in and
it may not be as good, or the combination may not make it taste real
good, but it’s edible, and it’s like this budget in a way. Sometimes you
can put some stuff in there and it may not be so good but it’s doable,
but them sometimes you put something in there that’s just rancid and
just won’t work, and it ruins the whole dish. I think the attempts of
putting things in the budget like teachers’ pay, I truly believe in your
hearts and in all of our hearts we want to do something for teachers,
and I think that’s good. It may not be what you want to put in there and
do for teachers, but it’s edible, but some of the other things in this
bill, some of the cuts to the other parts of our educational system and
to our social services, has made this dish rancid and I can’t eat it. We
don’t have a good base. We don’t have that stock that makes it all gel
together because we didn’t give us the budget and the monies that we
needed to make it all just come together because earlier we overspent
and we gave money away to people like businesses and the rich that kept
us from making that good stock, and I just want to say today as we go
on, and I know this budget is going to pass, and I can’t vote for it
because I can’t eat that pot of soup, but let’s think about the new
term, and when we come back, let’s try to do something to help Medicaid,
and let’s try to do something positive to maybe build a good base for
that next pot of soup that we have to do. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Gentleman from Orange County, Representative Meyer is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to debate the
conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I know I spoke yesterday,
and I just have one more thing that hung heavy on me last night. We
talked a lot about teachers during this session. We didn’t talk a lot
about students, and I spent 16 years running a youth mentoring, tutoring
after school and summer school program, and probably the one cut in this
budget that bothers me the most is the nine million dollar cut to the
at-risk student fund because I do believe that those students should be
our state’s priority. I know those students, I’ve worked with those
students, I’ve helped them and their families, and I worry about what it
means to see hundreds, literally hundreds of programs that will provide
tutoring, summer learning opportunities, after-school opportunities to
help the most needy among our public school children pursue their
dreams, the American dream of getting a good education and going on to
achieve things that maybe people before them in their family were not
able to achieve, and I simply lament the nine million dollars that’s
going to come out of opportunities for those students. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman from Cumberland County, Representative
Lucas, is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak briefly on the
conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman’s recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I spoke yesterday and I will
not be long today, but as we examine this budget, I just want to again
remind you of some of the things that we’re doing to the least of these
in our society. We again would recognize that you did the very best that
you could with the resources and that resources are limited, but again I
will remind you that our resources are limited only by this body’s will
to provide revenue. We are the only agency capable of providing those
resources for members of our society, and one particular part of this
budget continues to bother me, and I hope that it bothers you, and that
is for those lower-ranking individuals who work their hearts out for us.
Specifically I mention school custodians. This budget provides a 500
dollar increase for them who are already at the lowest end of the
spectrum when it comes to finances. They’re loyal workers and they
really provide comfort for all of us, and the disparity between school</p>

custodians and state custodians still baffles me. I don’t understand how
one who provides a custodial job for the state can get $1000 increase
and one who does the same job for the county or the schools gets $500. I
don’t understand. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman from Haywood, Representative Queen is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I rise today, I didn’t speak yesterday, I listened. Several themes came
out that I thought were appropriate. One is the truth. We need to get
out the truth in this body. Our citizens expect it. One is fairness. Our
citizens send us down here to be fair and to take care of their
resources, their taxes in a way that helps everybody. Another one was to
ratchet down the partisanship. I agree with that. I come down here to
help all my citizens. I am for opportunity for every one of them. Every
Republican, every Independent, every Democrat. I’m here for educational
opportunities for all of them. Every Independent, every Democrat, every
Republican. I’m down here for clean air and clean water and vibrant
healthy communities for all of them. My agenda is not partisan, I assure
you. But what I can tell you is this truly is a historic session. I’ve
been in the General Assembly on and off, as you know, since the election
of ‘02. I’ve represented the two most Republican counties in this state,
Avery and Mitchell county as their Senator. I’ve represented the most
unionized per capita county in the state. I’ve represented the least
unionized county per capita in the state. I’ve represented farmers, I’ve
represented papermakers and industrialists. I’ve represented children,
women, Native Americans, African-Americans, all Americans, all North
Carolinians. We open our session every day with a prayer, that’s usually
the best part of the session. There’s a good one today by the ??, and a
Pledge of Allegiance to flag of the United States of America and the
republic for which it stands. All my citizens pay their taxes, and they
want to get the good out of their taxes. What’s historic about this
session is we have squinted at gnat and we have swallowed a camel. We
have thrown away, wasted, denied, $3.5 billion of our citizens revenue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our federal…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will suspend.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What does the….
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order. Are we on the budget. He’s talking about all other
things and complaints that have nothing to do with the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady’s point is taken. The gentleman will continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. We have...we’re here to serve our citizens. Our actions in
this historic General Assembly have denied $3.5 billion of their revenue
to come back to help them. What we have done, what this General Assembly
has done, now, what does that mean? What is $3.5 billion? We talked
about protecting BRAC and our military presence in North Carolina. We
have approximately $3.5 billion worth...</p>

the military contracts each in North Carolina, just throw it away.  It
doesn’t matter.  That’s what 3.5 billion would mean to Eastern North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Mister Speaker, the gentleman from Haywood will
suspend, having listened carefully to the debate, I cannot make the
connection at this time to the subject of the motion.  If the gentleman
could direct his remarks to the substance of the budget of the
conference report it would be appreciated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Well there’s two things about the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To see if the gentleman would yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I can only really yield at the end of my remarks,
just so I can get to a point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman does not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  	What does 3.5 billion mean?  We all have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Point of order Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman may state his point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Twice now the gentleman now speaking has refused to
accede to the rulings of the Chair.  His remedy is to appeal the rulings
of the Chair not to continue in his obstinacy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  This gentleman will suspend.  The gentleman’s point
from Wake is well taken.  The Chair given the day and the time
constraints is previously announced, is allowed some leeway, however if
the gentleman from Haywood cannot direct his remarks to the substance of
the conference report on Senate Bill 744 then the gentleman will not be
further recognized in his speech.  The gentleman may attempt to
continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Okay.  Let me go to a second point and maybe I can
find a way to get back to the first point before I, in staying your
sense of this budget, the truth, the truth about education jobs and
again this budget, well let me say this, let me put it this way,  I’m
trying to stay on the floor.  Representative Horn when you opened up the
education budget said that there were 761 new teachers positions funded
in this conference report and that’s true.  That’s provision 16 on F3 of
the money report and Speaker Tillis said that this budget doesn’t cut
single teacher assistance.  Well that is item 20 on page F4of the of the
money report.  When this is an either or proposition, either you cut no
teacher’s assistance from the 33 hundred of them or you fund the new 761
teachers, one or the other.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For what purpose does the lady from Cabarrus,
Representative Johnson arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I would like to maybe help the gentleman with his
understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does the gentleman yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative   would you like for me to explain
this to you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  When we created the appropriation act 414 when
compared to the budget for 2013-14 it provides 85 million less funding
for teaching assistance and 85 million more, initial funding for
teachers.  But the local schools have the budget flexibility to still
spend the 85 million on teacher’s assistance.  The authority for budge
flexibility</p>

is in North Carolina general statutes, 15C-105.255B as amended. Last
year’s budget bill already provided the additional 43362 for fiscal year
2014-15 more than the fiscal year 2013-14 for teachers in grades 2 and 3
to reduce the class size and under budget flexibility for teacher’s
assistance. And you’re conceding on your money report. This here budget
provides an additional 41,932,566 for fiscal 2014-15 more than fiscal
2013-14 for teachers in grades kindergarten and one. Under the budget
flexibility for teacher assistance, they have the authority to do as
they wish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Haywood has the floor and will continue and, again,
be requested to keep the comments to the budget. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think, if I’ve heard Miss Johnson correctly, we’ve put an additional
$85 million in teaching teachers. We’ve taken out about $85 million from
teaching assistants.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose the does the gentleman from Mecklenburg rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Queen would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the gentleman from Haywood yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I certainly would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen, I’m curious in the process of forming your well
thought out comments this morning. How many superintendents have you
spoken with about the current education provisions in the budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In this budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I’ve spoken to all of them in the period. This conference report,
I’ve not spoken to any of them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, Queen, you’re telling me that you’ve spoken to all 115
superintendents.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, just one follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen, are you aware. I just want to be clear...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker. Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will stay his point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Since we are interpreting germaineness quite strictly today, what
relevance does the number of people that the gentleman, Representative
Queen, has spoken to have to do with the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, if I may be clear, it’s to determine whether or not the
gentleman is aware of the structure of the budget and whether or not
he’s aware we’ve vetted this with this with the superintendents and the
superintendents have indicated that they appreciate the fact that we
provided the flexibility to use teacher assistant funding to fund
teachers, but at the same time have the flexibility to move that funding
back to the teacher assistants for that purpose. In other words, I just
wanted to be clear, and if it’s not appropriate I will withdraw my
question. I just wanted to be clear whether or not the gentleman
understands that the superintendents appreciate the fact that we’re
providing an allocation that can be used for teacher’s assistants, can
be used for teachers and can migrate back to teacher’s assistants. I
just wanted to be clear that the gentleman was aware of those provision
of the budget…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I withdraw my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question is withdrawn and the gentleman from Haywood continues to
have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am aware of the flexibility that these two provisions provide.
Representative Horn tried to clear me on that. I’ve talked to our staff
and I get the flexibility. The flexibility is either or. You can keep
your 3300 teaching assistants and lose over 1500 teachers. Or you can
keep your 1500 teachers and lose your 3300 teaching assistants. I think
it’s somewhere between 2700 and 3300 according to the staff I just
wanted to...there’s a range because they don’t all make the same. It’s
either or. We have not stopped the bloodletting of our educational staff
in this budget, in this conference report. We have cut, you can have the
mix you want. If your district wants to save half of their teachers and
cut a bunch of...</p>

teaching assistants and not take the teachers, they can do that, but it
is a cut of staff, one or the other. Now my point on the budget is the
budget is to drive our economy. That’s what we do. We want to make jobs.
We want to create the opportunities for our citizens, and when you deny,

[Speaker]: Gotcha. And that’s in the resolution that’s coming up? Okay.
[addressing the House] Ladies and gentleman I believe that the only
matter we have left is the Adjournment Resolution. It’s going to take
just a few more minutes in bill drafting to get that done. So the House
be at ease.
[House at ease 00:00:52 through 00:02:08]
[Speaker]: The House will come to order. Ladies and gentleman I thought
we would maybe use our time wisely. Representative Ensco and there may
be a few others who would like to be recognized for points and personal
privilege. So if the members will return to their seats we will take up
these discussions as we use our time. Representative Ensco is recognized
for a point, a personal privilege. The House will come to order.
[Rep Ensco]: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members we’re going to be moving
over in a few minutes to honor the people who participated in World War
I, recognizing their courage and their sacrifice. Many of us probably
have family members that have with stories from World War I. The War
that was to end all wars. That’s very appropriate.
It’s important for us to remember those points of history in our time
that bring us to where we are and make us proud to be in a country
that’s free. During those times of war, we often memorialize men. But
just as in World War II, there were opportunities for women to take on
additional roles. There was one woman who came to prominence in World
War I who wouldn’t have if her boss had not been called up to serve in
the army.
That woman was Harriet Morehead Berry. If you drive down I-40 right now,
through Orange County you will see a section of that road called the
Harriet Morehead Berry Freeway. Harriet Morehead Berry was born in 1877
in Hillsboro. She graduated from the school that is now UNCG. She then
joined the State Geological Survey. Her, I’m going to tell you her
bosses name was, she worked with Joseph Hyde Pratt, who was a state
geologist. They worked on the state geological survey, the good roads
movement that was coming about at that time.
So when Mr. Pratt joined  the army, she became the head of that
association. She drafted a Bill to bring before the General Assembly in
1918 to establish a statewide road system. That Bill failed but in
response to that she didn’t give up. She traveled across the entire
state. She went to 87 counties on these dirt, muddy roads over a period
of several years and talked to all of the editorial boards in those
counties. Talked to all the county commissioners and got the support to
actually get the bill passed. I’ll tell you what year that was.</p>

But her purpose was to connect all the farmers to markets so that they
could actually sell their products at markets. That’s how we actually
got our statewide road system. The General Assembly passed that, it was
all a process that started and was completed during World War I and soon
thereafter. We still had that good road system today and I think it’s
one of the best things about the state when we talk about economic
development in this state, we say that out of state companies ask first,
will you have a trained workforce that we will be able to hire, the
second question is, do you have good schools that our workers will be
able to attend their children? Do I want to bring my management team
here? Will their children have good schools to go to? And the third
question they ask is, do you have the infrastructure? I think that one
of the proud thing about this state is our good roads and I hope that we
will make a dedication to complete that in the future, but I also wanted
to take the time just to say that Harriet Moorehead Berry made a mark
during that time and I’d like to have that recognized. Thank you.

Most of you know that Marines are called Devil Dogs, that’s as a result
of the Battle of Belleau Wood in World War I. If you don't know the
story, I’m going to relay it to you real quick here.  At the expense of
hurting the feelings of my army comrades here. The French lost the
Battle of Belleau Woods so the American army went in and they tried to
take it and they lost. So they figured they had to bring the big boys
in, so they brought the Marine’s in. Marines too Belleau Woods, we
turned it into the real estate folks, which is the army, we said, here,
hold this. We left to go on and take some more real estate, but then we
found out that they lost it, so we had to come back again and take it
again. It’s happened a couple of times before finally the Marines
leveled the woods and took it back once and for all, but their
marksmanship and their fighting abilities were such that one of the
German colonels wrote a letter to his seniors saying that the Marines
fought like teufel hunden, which is devil dogs.

Representative Speciale, I appreciate your account of the battle and

Cleveland could have given us a first hand account of the battle?

[Rep Hall]: … in committee meeting, etcetera, whoever would chair the
meeting would not chair the proceedings over their own motion. So I’d
just like to point that out for the record if we need to clarify that in
the rules going forward or if we need to correct the record as written.
Of course it’s obvious the reason for that is to insure that the debate
is regulated so that  no one crafts the debate to get unfair support of
their motion and shut down those folks who might be in opposition.
Again, Mr. Speaker I hope that that would be corrected. If we need to
change the rules going forward for those of you who would come back next
session. I hope that this is not going to be a trend where you preside
over the proceedings when it’s your own motion.
[Speaker]: Representative Hall, I will consult with the Clerk and if
it’s in the least bit construed that it’s a violation of the rules, we
will do a reconsideration of the vote. While the Clerk is researching
the issue, we’ll move on to Representative Pittman. Please state your

[Speaker]: The gentleman is recognized for a Point of Personal

[Representative Pittman]: As we go over for the ?? and the ?? today,
you’re probably aware that the Museum of History is going to be
conducting a four-year commemoration of World War I. I just wanted to
mention to you that my wife’s grandfather, William France Odom from
Wayne County, was an army medic in France during World War I. I expect
his uniform to be on display sometime during this four-year celebration.
Thank you.
[Speaker]: Representative Jeter, please state your purpose.

[Speaker]: The gentleman is recognized for a Point of Personal

[Representative Jeter]: I always kind of considered myself, or at least
have recently as the general assembly jester. And we need some levity
this morning. I’d like to talk about a man that I met in 2005. 2005 I
decided to run for the Huntersville Town Board and I’m sure this is
germane to the budget somehow. I love you Joe Sam Queen. And there were
four incumbents running for five spots. Six people signed up to run for
Huntersville Town Board that year. I was the last of the six for the
theoretical open spot.
One of those six had just been on the Cornelius Town Board. He had moved
to Huntersville and signed up. Of course once he saw my name on the
ballot, he did the right thing and withdrew. Of course I’m speaking of
Speaker Tillis. I will tell you that this is in theory our last real day
of session. I have known Speaker Tillis other than his wife, longer than
anyone in this room. In politics as we see today as we’ve seen in the
last two years as we will continue to see in the future. We like to get
perception versus reality.
We like to get into what we think people’s heart is. I am a better
person, a better human being, a better legislature, a better father
because of the man sitting up there at the dias. I have had a large
change in my life because of my relationship with Speaker Tillis and I
know that this is your last session. I wanted to publicly thank you for
being someone who made me better. And I’m not going to get into the
campaign stuff and political stuff. I’ll let other people do that. But
as a person I just can’t thank you enough. I wanted to thank you
publicly and I also wanted to thank you for coming off the ballot in
‘05.

I was gonna say, the republicans are in the majority and republicans,
all of us over on this side of the room and large part because of the
efforts speaker ??, I'd like to say Thank you for all the hard work that
was done long ago to get us where we are and it's up to us now to go
forward from here and we'll see next year what happens but on another
notes, I'd like to also say, my grandfather was muster gased in World
War I and he didn't say it was World WarI, he didn't know it was WWI and
he lived until I was Thirty years old and miraculously I didn't realize
how good I had talking to him and we used to sit and talk about, he said
we went over there and fought a war against ?? Bill, that was what they
called them. If you ask people on the streets today, the average person
about World War I, they have no earthly idea of when it was or what it
was. All it was, was the beginning of the great realignment and the wars
of the 20th century. World War I and World War II really were one war,
they just called a 20 years ?? in the middle. We could talk rest of the
week about what happened and why it happened and how this group and that
group made this group crawl because they are on the top today, but
anyways, setting all that aside, it was fascinating to a hear about a
guy that went on a ship from America to France and what they had to do,
it was the last war that was fought with mostly horses that pulled
machinery. It was a transition period from old to new. They had machine
guns, right, but they also had horses to pull the machines guns up to
the front and they'd line up and slaughter each other and the reasons
they dug trenches were if they had, no body would have been left. How
would you like to be out there in the cold mud up to your waist and
water with big rats swimming around everywhere and people shooting at
you. That sounds like a lot of fun. But anyways, ?? ?? ??.

truly enjoyed working with both of you and you are leaders in every way
and I wish both of you, wherever your steps lead you, the lord leads
you, you may have the most success ever and I thank you for your service
to our state. I think the state is better today and also Annie Mobley

he had to pay, because I don’t let anybody stay free in the summertime,

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Two things, Mr. Speaker, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for two things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I want to first to thank you for allowing me to be the
unofficial rule person. I appreciate that and I remember when I got out
of service I was calling from New York back to Rocky Mountain to speak
to my girlfriend to let her know that I was coming in from Paris, France
and that I was arrive in Rocky Mountain, North Carolina in a reasonable
period of time. If you can recall Ma Bell, we had a telephone system
that we use. So I was communicating with my fiancee and they had three
minutes. I went five minutes and the lady on the other end, she said, we
allow a introductory statement. Then we allow a statement in between and
we allow a closing. The reason why I cut you off was because you had no
end to your request. I learnt that as a individual that it don’t take
all day to make a statement. I wanted to say that. And also that you
have been a fair person to all of us, including me, when I stood up and
say I know I can’t make the rule, but I’ll...I knew that, but you knew I
couldn’t do it, and I knew I couldn’t do it, but I got time. And the
last thing I want to say, Mr. Speaker, before I take my seat, is the
resolution before us now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, Representative Floyd I find it ironic that you spoke just
before I had to tell people that there may be a need for a brief recess
before we could do the resolution, but the gentleman’s commitment to
time management may position him well to run for Speaker next year.
Representative Torbett, please state your purpose. .

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, thank you. I don’t think anybody in this Assembly is here
without some love of the past. I think a lot of us study the history of
this great state and of this nation. In today’s world, a lot of closings
of celebrations of folks retiring of service is usually followed by
applause. Some years ago, not that many, it used to be followed by
appreciation of one’s efforts and one’s service by a simple hip hip
hooray, three times consecutively. If I could get my fellow members to
join me, I’d like to offer you one for your service of this great state.
Ladies and gentlemen, hip hip…

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t mind getting up and debating and asking questions. Very rarely
do I do this, ask for any kind of personal privilege. Back in 2009, five
years ago, I was in my office minding my own business, which is a
financial services business, and I got a phone call from somebody that I
didn’t know named Skip Stam and he wanted to meet me and talk to me
about the possibility of running for the House of Representatives, which
I never had any ambition whatsoever to hold a political office. I met
him at the Remington Grill in Lewisburg and he did what I used to do
with clients. He got out his yellow pad and started mapping out

What the job is all about.  What it meant and how often I’d have to be
here and if I could still work my regular job.  And I think he was
absolutely as honest as he could be trying to recruit me to run for this
office.  I told him I’d think about it.  I didn’t think a whole lot more
about it.  Middle of next week, these three guys show up in dark suits
in my office and I’m thinking is this the FCC, is this the IRS, I’ve
never seen a group quite like this walk into my office before.  It was
actually another representative named Tom Tillis along with two fellows
from the State GOP headquarters and he had come to close the deal.  And
although I didn’t give him a “yes” on that particular day, the two
gentlemen did eventually of course make their point and cause me to run.
 The thing I appreciate though about Speaker Tillis more than anything
else is that after I got here and began to go to conference meetings, he
told me the same thing he told me in recruiting me.  He told me to do
exactly what I had come here to do and I would not have run without that
understanding.  He’s always told all of us in our Caucus “Vote your
conscious first, vote your constituents second, and vote your Caucus
third.” And that’s what I appreciate about Speaker Tillis more than
anything else.

Resolution 881 to draw a resolution providing for adjournment of the
2013 regular session of the General Assembly to a date certain and
limiting the matters that may considered upon reconvening, providing for
a subsequent adjournment to a date certain and limiting the matters that
may considered upon reconvening and providing for adjournment signadi of
the 2013 regular session of the General Assembly.  The Senate resolves,
the House concurring.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Moore is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Members, the two resolutions
I can debate.  They’re essentially the same with the exception that if
you’ll notice on Section 1 of the Bill, we have the one adjournment that
calls for the adjournment to be today August the 2nd the other calls for
the adjournment to be on August 6th.  The reason for that to be the
Senate only has a skeleton session today so they</p>

they have to come back in and actually vote with a recorded vote on
Wednesday, actually they’re today, but they’re here at 10 o’clock, but I
guess they’re there now. They would have to vote to...either today or
they may have to wait and vote about Wednesday to adjourn us. You’ll see
the items that can be taken up in the session. We have a session that
commences August the 14th. There are nine subject areas that are listed
where bills can be considered. Those are spelled out for you in the
bill. And then also section three of the bill spells out that we will
adjourn when the Senate and House adjourn on the 15th, we will adjourn
to reconvene on Monday, November 17th at 6 PM. The next section, section
4, is when the regular session adjourns...excuse me, reconvenes on
November 17th, that allows us to come back in and deal with the Medicaid
reform provisions and also a joint resolution adjourning the 2013
regular session of the General Assembly. Those, I believe, are the
changes . Just making sure that the appointments confirmation language
is in there. Be glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Grier Martin, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and I will try to be brief since
Representative Speciale’s got a herd of fired up marines ready to go
over to the World War I ceremony. I don’t want to get in their way. I do
want to make a couple of points. Many of us, when we’ve campaigned or
when we’ve talked to our constituents, have recited the phrase that no
one’s wallets or body’s or otherwise are safe when the General Assembly
is in session. I think many of us have advocated for a citizen
legislature. A part time legislature. Many of us have been advocates for
small government. My concern is that the breadth of this resolution and
the fact that it contemplates coming back to work in a matter of days
and then coming back to work again in November goes against all those
principals. Regardless of which party is in charge, I think the public
is best served if we conduct our business promptly and get out of town
and I’ve concern that this resolution just perpetuates us staying here.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Representative Moore yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, this question applies to each of these
resolutions, the one on the board and the alternate. Items 4 through 9,
which could be considered in August 14th, are you going to construe that
narrowly or broadly as rules chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaking for the speaker, I will construe it narrowly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of Rules chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It falls along the same lines as Representative Stam just talked about.
It looks like what you were doing is putting a limit, a one day limit,
on that session coming in on the 14th, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which two days?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We come in on Thursday and leave on Friday?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we would come back if those...we would come back that day, and, of
course, we could stay. There’s no limitation, per se, but we’re limited
as to what we could do. My understanding from the chair is that the
chair does not plan on spending much time here at all. I think we’ll be
very short.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. It’s says when the Senate and House of Representatives
adjourn Friday, August 15th. It says when they adjourn. I’m just trying
to figure out the parameters in there is what I’m trying to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, will tell you the intent of the chair is to
potentially deal with a few matters that are delineated in the
adjournment resolution. Any matter that would take more than about two
days to complete will most likely be put off to the next session. And by
next session I mean the next legislature in 2015. We did allow
flexibility to not limit the number of days that we could be here, but
the chair would not anticipate that’d be more than about a two day
session.
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the passage of the House Committee Substitute to Senate Joint
Resolution 881 on its second reading. All in favor vote aye.</p>
