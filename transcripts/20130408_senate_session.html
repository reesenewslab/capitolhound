[Speaker Changes] Senator Bingham is recognized to  explain the bill
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chairman .Ladies and gentlemen of the
senate. This has been a long ongoing process since 2011.In 2011 Senate
bill 449 created a task force for reducing abuse of elder adults  and
were made during 2011 and 2012. The mission of the task force was to
clarify and strengthen laws to protect the elderly crime abuse. It’s
been a state wide effort and the members of the task force were divided
in to four groups  and made recommendations which where crafted in to
this bill. It’s been heard in health and in [??] and it has been well
headed and I would appreciate your support it’s going to be very helpful
to the state of North Carolina. Thank you Mr. President. Be happy to try
and answer any question.

[Speaker Changes] Senator Bingham do you yield?
[Speaker Changes] Sure
[Speaker Changes] First I want to commend you for this bill. it’s an
excellent bill.  I am Glad you are moving forward providing leadership
in this area. There were two questions that I had raised when it came
before the committee. And that was first of all who is going to pay for
the production of financial records and secondly what do  we do for
those entities that they need to serve that are out of state. They don’t
have a registered agent for services process purposes. Do those issues
get resolved as they move forward?
[Speaker Changes]  Senator McKissick.I think the recommendation was is
this will be banks customers of those banks unless it’s rather extensive
and they have to go back to archives and they would certainly expect the
[??]. I will be happy to tune the case. You are right . I think during
third reading we can clarify this if you wish .I thought we had this you
know everyone was in agreement on this NRJ1 Committee. But I will be
happy to clarify if I would
[Speaker Changes] If you would I think it would be good to clarify</p>

concentration in the country. Together they represent one point four
billion dollars of economic impact in the communities that they serve
throughout the state of North Carolina. Together they bring close to
nineteen thousand jobs in communities like Greensboro and Fayetteville
and Charlotte and right here in Raleigh, Elizabeth city.
These are institutions that not only educate our children, they provide
stabilities for communities and are really a shining ?? of North
Carolina economy.
Tomorrow, we hope you will open your doors and allow the students and
alumnis and the faculty members as well as the presidents and
chancellors who will be on the general assembly tomorrow and hear about
the great things that are happening at their respective institutions and
universities. And we personally invite you tomorrow at ten o'clock at
room 2126 at the legislative building.
The presidents and chancellors will be making five minute appeals in
reference to what is happening at their institutions in reference to the
great programs and the great students and all the things that are
happening that are moving their institutions forward and contributing to
the- moving North Carolina forward.
We encourage you to come out tomorrow to hear from the chancellors and
presidents. It's a great opportunity to hear directly from them all the
wonderful things that are occurring at historically black colleges,
universities ?? ?? ??, state supported institutions and five are
private. So that's tomorrow at ten o'clock. Again, at the legislative
building, room 2126.
Tonight, members of the legislative black caucus will be networking with
the chancellors and the presidents. Tomorrow, they will be paying a
visit to the governor to talk with him in reference to the university
system in general and specifically about the historically black college
