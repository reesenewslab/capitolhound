  The House will come to order. Members will take their seats. Visitors
will retire from the chamber. The sergeant at arms will close the doors.
Members and visitors will please silence all electronic devices.
Members, today&#39;s prayer will be offered by Representative Carney.
We&#39;d ask that all of the members stand and also all guests in the
gallery please stand during the prayer and please remain standing for
the pledge of allegiance. Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House. Today,
before we pray, I would like to just say I for one am grateful for life.
Today marks my six year anniversary of an event that took my life here
in this building. It&#39;s something that I live with every day, and I
am grateful, especially this time of year, in a time of renewal, spring,
resurrections, celebrations of life, and am grateful, but I want to
share with you a prayer today that was offered on April 2, 2009, the day
of my event. It was the last prayer that I heard before my event
happened, and these were given at that time by our House chaplain,
Reverend James Harry. So would you please join me in prayer. Sovereign
Lord, you reign over the universe and all that is in it. We cannot help
but marvel at the beauty of your creation. Thank you for providing us
with the abundance of nature&#39;s offerings. Help us to be people who
respect your world and the gift that it is. Remind us that some of our
natural resources are indeed finite and that we need to be good stewards
of all that you have given us. As we return home this afternoon, grant
us the grace of simplicity to admire the hue of the grass, the colors of
the trees, the smell of the blossoms. Let our trip be one of
thanksgiving and respect for your gift of the Earth, and ultimately for
thee. Amen.

  Flat Rock Elementary School, these students, if the body would give the
Chair the attention, you want to know this. These students suggested a
bill to have the Autumn Leaves Festival in Mount Airy declared the
Official Fall State Festival. It&#39;s House Bill 409, which was filed
this week. Could you please join me and welcome these assistant
legislators we have with us today. And you all should know that
Representative Stevens over here in the blue is working very hard for
your bill, so thank you, we&#39;re glad you&#39;re here, and we hope you
have a nice weekend and a great Easter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Surry, Representative Stevens, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for a moment of personal privilege. I will tell you I was--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to speak to a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I was invited to speak to this group last Friday, and we
spent almost an hour debating bills. They will make wonderful future
legislators.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, just for your planning purposes, we will have a recess in just
a bit. I understand that Representative Lewis would like to complete the
business the Rules Committee was working on this morning. They had to
stop apparently because of another committee that overlapped. So
we&#39;re going to dispose of most of the business on the bill, and then
go into recess, and during the recess is when we&#39;ll also read in, do
the introduction of bills. As you can see, it&#39;s quite lengthy.
Calendar, House Bill 195, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representatives Dollar, S. Martin, Avila, and Lambeth; House Bill 195, a
bill to be entitled an Act Amending the North Carolina Pharmacy Practice
Act to Allow for the Substitution of an Interchangeable Biological
Product. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Wake, Representative Dollar, has the floor to debate
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. Appreciate everyone&#39;s
vote yesterday, we have a strong vote and I would appreciate your
support again today. The only thing I would add is that I do believe
that this legislation brought before us is the kind of model that we
always have encouraged in the past, and should continue to encourage in
the future. And that is where all the major stakeholders, in this case
pharmaceutical companies, pharmacy benefit managers, pharmacists, health
plans, all of those parties involved got together, worked extremely hard
to be able to craft a bill that is a consensus bill and that helps that
move this state forward from an economic standpoint and from a
patient-safety standpoint. And again, appreciate your support yesterday,
and appreciate it again today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the
House is the passage of House Bill 195 on its third reading. Those in
favor will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open the
vote. Representative Warren, I&#39;m waiting on you. Representative
Farmer-Butterfield, in the chamber or Representative Alexander, either
one in the chamber? Representative McElfraft? No?  The clerk will lock

Representatives Stevens, ?? Floyd, and D. Hall. House Bill 215. A bill
to be entitled Act to Establish Procedure for Waiver of the Right to a
Jury Trial in Criminal Cases in Superior Court. General Assembly of
North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady from Surrey,
Representative Stevens, has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, in the last
session we did a Constitutional amendment to allow the defendant to
waive his right to a trial by jury. Once that amendment passed, we had a
problem. We had to figure out the procedure for him to do it. This bill
is a product of the Court&#39;s Commission in which we had four members
of the House, three members of the Senate, some Superior Court judges,
some District Court judges, somebody from Indigent Defense, somebody
from the Bar Association, somebody from the State Bar, Court of Appeals
judges, Superior Court judges. We hashed this bill over thoroughly. Not
everyone got what they wanted. But it&#39;s a great bill that allows the
defendant to waive his right to a jury trial and puts in some
protections so the system cannot be abused. The bill has been out there
for a while. It&#39;s in fairly good form. However, this morning some
people brought some concerns to me that we perhaps need to address. For
that reason, Mr. Speaker, I would ask that we displace this bill and
come back to it at a later point. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We will

  will displace House Bill 215 to be dealt with after the recess. House ??
just a moment. For what purpose does the gentleman from Harnett,
Representative Lewis, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may, is recognized for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House,
Rules was not quite able to finish its work this morning. We had another
committee scheduled for the room, so during the recess, immediately upon
recess, Rules will resume its work for what I think will be a very short
meeting so we can report out the permanent rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman believe if we were to recess until 11 AM, that would
give the gentleman time to complete, 11 AM, that would give the
gentleman time to complete the business of Rules?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, certainly it&#39;s time to complete the business of Rules.
There are a couple of amendments that I&#39;ve conferred with the clerk
on. It&#39;ll take--it&#39;d have to go through proofing and bill
drafting, so probably 11:15 might be better to give enough time to do
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. For what purpose does the Majority Leader, the gentleman from
Rutherford, Representative Hager, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For an inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, if we&#39;re going to have a Rules Committee meeting, can
we plan on maybe having a caucus, a short caucus after that? Can we
extend that time a little bit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If, what I could do, if I have a, if we recess until 11, 11:30, would
the Majority Leader want to have a caucus at 11:10?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, 11: 10 would be fine, yes sir. Certainly be, as quick as Rules can
get done, we&#39;ll want to have one right after that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for announcement if he wants to officially
announce that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We will have, the Republicans will caucus
shortly, right after Rules, right about 11:10 in the same room as the
Rules Committee will be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Representative Lewis, the Rules Committee will meet down in 1228,
where you met earlier today? Okay? For what purpose does the gentleman
from Durham, Representative Hall, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Democrats will caucus at 11:15 in 1425.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Jackson,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, other than House Bill 215 and the Rules bill that may come
out of Rules Committee, do you anticipate anything else being added to
the calendar?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s a good question. Let me look and see. Did we have any
other--let me ask this. Any committee chairs that met this morning, if
there are any chairs who reported out bills other than the one that was
read in, please rise and activate your light. I don&#39;t think
there&#39;s anything else. The only other thing that we could do, and I
don&#39;t know that there&#39;s much interest in it, would be to add the
local bills from Local Government. Now, they&#39;re scheduled to meet 15
minutes after session today. So I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think they
want to meet during the recess, that would probably delay us a good bit
if we tried to let Local Government--let me ask. Representative Davis,
would the gentleman yield to a question from the Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Or Representative Ford, either one of the gentlemen who are the chairs
of Local Government. Is it the opinion of the two of you that it would
take a considerable amount of time to go through the bills in Local
Government?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may, Mr. Speaker, Local Government had a special meeting yesterday
morning, and we did put out seven bills.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we&#39;re going to address different bills after the session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me ask this. Is there any exigency that either of the two chairmen
have for either of these bills, any of these bills--is there anything
time sensitive, where any of those need to be on the calendar this week?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not that I&#39;m aware of.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, but we do have at least to have to hear one of them today because
there&#39;s a bunch of people here wanting to speak--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct. You will be able to meet. My question simply is if you&#39;re
trying to get any bills added to today&#39;s calendar. Very well. We
will not take up any bills from Local Government today. Thank you. So
Representative Jackson, in answer to your question, it appears just the
bill we&#39;ve added and the Rules, and then the bill that
Representative Stevens has displaced will be the only other matters that
I&#39;m aware of that will be considered today. For what purpose does
the gentleman from Robeson, Representative Graham, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Immediately after recess, the Rule Working Group
will meet in Room 1425. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, we are going to stand in recess until 11:15, subject to receipt
of messages from the Senate, re-referral of bills and resolutions,
committee appointments, and introduction of bills. And that was until
11:30, not 11:15. We&#39;re in recess.

  The House will come to order. Special message from the Senate, the clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, it is ordered that a message be sent to the House of
Representatives with the information that Senator [??] report of the
conferees for House Bill 41 Conference Committee Substitute, a bill to
be entitled an act to make technical and clarifying changes to various
revenue laws and recommended by the Revenue Laws Study Committee. When
the appropriate action has been taken by both chambers, the bill will be

without objection today&#39;s calendar. So ordered. House Bill 215, the
clerk will read. The clerk is correct, the bill has been read and was
displaced for an amendment. The lady from Surry, Representative Stevens,
is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, as I said before, this is
our procedure to honor the constitutional amendment allowing a defendant
to waive his right to a jury trial. This is the defendant&#39;s right,
not the state&#39;s right. I think that probably a lot of you have had
your phones blown up by the DA&#39;s or emails blown up by the DA&#39;s
since we&#39;ve been in break and I am sorry for that. We have worked
very hard for several months on making sure that the defendant&#39;s
constitutional rights were protected without creating any unreasonable
delay of trial. What this does, it says the defendant has three
different ways in which he could waive that jury trial. We have a couple
of amendments that are going to be coming forward that address a couple
of the DA&#39;s concerns, and some of the others I&#39;m happy to
discuss if you have any problems. But, Mr. Speaker, and this point I
would ask that you recognize Representative Glazier to send forth an
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Glazier, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To set forth an amendment, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to send forth an amendment. The clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier moves to amend the bill on page one, lines 26,
deleting the phrase &quot;for a tentative trial date.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Cumberland has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. These are, after a meeting, as
Representative Stevens said, between a number of stakeholders as well as
lawyers involved in the discussion both with the district attorneys and
other folks in this bill. There are four changes the amendment suggests
that are agreed upon after discussions with Representative Stevens,
Representative Stam, Representative Duane Hall, Representative
Baskerville and myself. First is a request by the district attorneys to
delete the phrase &quot;for a tentative trial date,&quot; which is
really more a technical issue about scheduling and I don&#39;t think
there&#39;s any controversy over that. The second, Representative Stam
and I had looked at the bill last night and it is with no objection
from, I think, the DA&#39;s conference to this issue either, but a judge
in a non-jury trial, just as in a jury trial, can decide a motion to
suppress evidence and when the judge does we go on with the trial,
whatever the ruling is. There had been a sentence that had been put in,
and no one&#39;s exactly sure where it came from, that the state would
then be able to seek a recusal by the judge if the judge decided the
suppression motion, that we all think probably has no place in the bill
and also probably interferes to some degree with the defendant&#39;s
constitutional right to the jury trial. Rather than get in to that, that
can happen, a judge can do that if they wish but it shouldn&#39;t be in
statute. The third part of this makes clear that the defendant has to
make his decision, and it generally should be an irrevocable decision,
about whether he&#39;s going to go non-jury or jury and we said it
exactly as the district attorney&#39;s wished in the time-frame in which
they wished. But there was a thought that on occasion

  <p id="25:00">
  A defendant might get council or there might be an issue that within 10
days of that decision, they ought to have something right to simply
revoke their decision and go to jury trial ?? and this was discussed in
J3 yesterday. But it ought to be very limited. And this just says the
defendant&#39;s decision is generally final. If they decide to go to a
jury trial after asking for non-jury, they must do that within 10 days
in open court before the DA, or in writing to the DA, and that&#39;s it.
They don&#39;t get to go back and forth.
That decision is final binding and irrevocable. And Mr. Speaker, I
believe those are the changes in this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate, on the gentleman&#39;s amendment,
just on the amendment. The gentleman from Durham, Representative ?? is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just got one
small question, Representative Glasier. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
What happens if there, for instance, a defendant comes in, he&#39;s
represented by council. And he waves jury trial, and then something
happens. Some act of nature, anything happens during that 10 day period
passes and his lawyer dies, or something happens beyond that 10 day
period. What happens? Does he still have that right to withdraw?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Because there has to be, sort of, some finality to the
decision of whether to move or not and so the district attorney&#39;s
know and the judges know.
This says at the, essentially is gonna happen right usually at
arraignment. The defendant&#39;s gonna pick. And then this gives them 10
days after arraignment and that&#39;s it. If they wanna change their
mind and after that they don&#39;t  get to change their mind. If they
picked non-jury, we&#39;re going non-jury. If the judge consents, judge
could say &quot;I&#39;m not gonna consent&quot; and this case is going
to jury. But the other possibility is, of course, if it&#39;s going jury
and he&#39;s decided that he doesn&#39;t get to decide 10 days before
trial he wants to go non-jury.
In other words, we&#39;re gonna keep the defendant from yanking
everybody back and forth. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Kembal yield to an additional question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
there&#39;s no room at all in that, in not, for any delay or anything
like that? Something happens. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Some act of nature happens. Can the judge make the decision to allow
that person to withdraw after that period of time? Is there any leeway
at all? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
After the 10 day period, the bill does not allow that to happen. But I
would think, my sense is, that in an emergency circumstance or an act of
nature that affects the court system. If there&#39;s agreement between
the DA and the defendant and the judge, one would think they would be
able to do it by consent or stipulation. But I think it would require
agreement by everybody at that point. Because there&#39;s just no way to
keep adding 10 day periods in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to ask an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And does the gentleman from
Kembal yield to an additional question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just hate to keep
beating this horse, but it&#39;s very, I think very definite that
something should, is not in the law, that option is there. Either they
have to follow what&#39;s in the law. And even though the agreement, I
don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s going to violate the law and the result of
trying to do an agreement like that.
I&#39;m just looking for something in there that would allow that
defendant to withdraw it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I think the compromise
was initially the district attorneys wanted it to be totally final at
the minute of arraignment. Defense bar wanted to have options all the
way up to right before trial. And this was to say, cut a middle ground,
to say ?? really needs, does need to generally be at arraignment. We
know something could happen right after. So we&#39;re gonna give you 10
days to rethink it if you wish.
But after that, folks know. I don&#39;t think it takes away, for
example, at all the judges ability to continue a case. And which may
take care of emergencies and setting it over. And I don&#39;t think
again it bars the judge, the DA, and the defendant from some consent on
an emergency circumstance that they. So I don&#39;t think it takes that
away. But I really would. I think it was a negotiation that really sort
of the advocates for justice felt comfortable with.
And your argument was raised about how you deal with that. And I think
we&#39;re trying to cut a concise middle ground. But ?? the defendant
generally in. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what.

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Stevens rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could I attempt to respond to Representative Michaux
and see if I could be a little, hopefully a little clearer to what I
think is his point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just, just before you do I want to make you very
popular with your colleagues. Rule 12 d is suspended. All right, now the
lady may take the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux, it says the defendant can
choose to waive that jury trial, okay? And if, within the ten days, if
he says, &quot;Oh wait a minute I don&#39;t. I want to have that jury
trial.&quot; Then he&#39;s stuck. But if he goes along and then
something else happens, he can get one more, he can get one more shot at
trying to get his jury trial back. That&#39;s where he goes to the judge
and the judge has to find some reason that it&#39;s not an unreasonable
delay. We&#39;re not going to let you choose, get out, choose, get out,
so, so that portion is still in there. If he chooses to waive the jury
trial, and he doesn&#39;t revoke--which he can do without anybody&#39;s
consent--the first ten days, then he still has the right to say, &quot;I
still want a jury trial.&quot; But the judge then has to consent and
find that it&#39;s not an unreasonable delay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could I ask the gentle lady a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Durham is recognized to tender a
question to lady from Surry. Does the Surry-does the lady from Surry
yield. She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I, I think you&#39;re getting at the point ??. The
judge does have some discretion even beyond the ten days depending on
the exigencies that existed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct. Yes, yes, that&#39;s, that&#39;s the law. We
didn&#39;t change it, we just added that new exception that without the
judge consenting you could still change your mind in ten days. But we
wanted a place at which the defendant could still protect his right, but
once he makes that choice to jump back in, he can&#39;t jump back out
again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, does the gentleman wish to debate
the amendment or is this on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I
support the amendment, some of it was suggested by me. Just a little
background on this bill, including the amendment. This was a Senate
bill, constitutional amendment. I happened to manage it on the House
side. It was almost unanimous in the entire assembly. We had one fella
who voted no and he&#39;s the only one who has a right to say he
doesn&#39;t like that amend-amendment because we sent it to the people
and they voted for it. But, ever since it passed, there have been
attempts to gut the amendment that we just had the people pass. The
bill, with this amendment, will properly have procedure to ec-accomplish
the amendment that the people of North Carolina passed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
The gen-for what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative
Michaux rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker to speak very briefly on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And, and, and I&#39;m looking at it and I&#39;m still
bothered by the question I raised because of the very last sentence in
it that said, this decision to revoke is final and binding. And to me
that does not give the court an opportunity to do this. I&#39;ve got,
I&#39;m probably going to vote for it but here again, and, and realize
I&#39;m a defendant&#39;s lawyer. Any of y&#39;all get in trouble come
see me, but other than that, the, the, to me there is no opportunity
with that language in there. I just call your attention to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham-strike
that, the gentleman from Wake, Representative Hall rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members I have the same concerns that Michaux had
about this amendment, but without this amendment the defendant has
absolutely no right to withdraw his consent, withdraw his waiver of jury
trial. So this amendment is an improvement over the bill of which
I&#39;m a primary sponsor of this amendment. I hope Representative
Michaux and the rest of my caucus will look forward as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg,
Representative Brawley, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wonder if the gentleman from Wake, Representative
Stam, would yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman
from Mecklenburg?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker Pro Temp. Having been trained as
an accountant and dealing with numbers, the nebulous concept with which
lawyers deal sometimes leave me befuddled. Would you just be clear to
me, is this amendment a good thing and is the underlying bill a good
thing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Green and green.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion and debate on the amendment? If
not, the question before the House is the passage of Amendment 1, sent

[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Glazier]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If Representative Glazier wasn&#39;t getting old
and losing a lot of brain cells every second, he would have seen that
this clause was not in the amendment I just gave you that should have
been. So we quickly did this fix. This I had talked to you about that
would be in it, we just didn&#39;t see that it wasn&#39;t in. This is
the recusal line that Representative Stam was referring to as well. I
know of no objection to this amendment; it&#39;s simply deleting a line
that should have been in the first amendment. Thank you.

To speak on the amendment.

Representative Lewis, House Resolution 481, the House Resolution
Adopting the Permanent Rules of the House of Representatives for the

General Senate of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
The gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis, has the floor to
debate the Resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Lewis]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, the Resolution that you
have before you— I&#39;ll be as brief as I can. It makes a few changes,
many of which were requested by Members in the Chamber. Line two [2],
page forty one [41] adds the reading of Statements of Personal Privilege
to the Order of Business. I wanna explain to you— Many of you have
noticed that we haven&#39;t done resolutions yet this year. We still
have the capacity to do resolutions if we choose to. But we also have
the capacity to do what&#39;s called a Representative Statement of
Privilege, which is a written statement that you prepare, submit to the
Clerk&#39;s office, signed, and it goes— it&#39;s spread upon the
Journal, and at your request can be sent to the person, or the
institution, or whatever it is that you&#39;re choosing to honor. The
Speaker has also made it a practice to recognize—

  When members that are being honored arrived, he&#39;ll stop what&#39;s
going on on the floor and allow points of personal privilege. You all
remember on Tuesday this House paid tribute to Richard Petty. In the
past we would have had a resolution to do that. This time we had a quick
statement that was read and then there were a few points of personal
privilege. We were able to pay tribute to him and then move on to our
business. We&#39;ve been doing this since the start of Session. It&#39;s
worked pretty well, I think. I haven&#39;t had any complaints on it.
Page 3, Line 24 further talks about the procedure of statements of
personal privilege. Page 4, Lines 33 through 34 were suggested by
Representative Cotham. This is clarifying language for the use of phones
and mobile devices on the floor. Essentially what it says is you can use
your phone and mobile device but you can&#39;t talk on it. You can text
on it, you can tweet on it, you can check your email, whatever you need
to do to keep up with your constituents. But it does prohibit the
distractive act of actually talking on the phone on the floor, which is
in our current rules. But this just makes it clear that you can have
your electronic device on the floor. Page 9, Line 26 specifies that up
to two chairs of the Appropriations Committee can, or also voting
members of the Appropriation Committees in the specific subject areas.
Page 11, Lines 26 and 27. This was at the request of Representative
Glazier. When a vote is going to be held in Committee, the Chair will
begin to ask for the vote. A member has always had the right to call for
the Ayes and Nos. The Ayes and Nos have to be sustained by one-fifth of
the Committee membership. This specifies in black and white that the
Chair has to say, Is the call sustained? It&#39;s to remind folks that
if they want the Ayes and Nos they have to take an action. Page 13, Line
49, again dealing with statements of personal privilege. Page 14, there
are some date changes, the most significant of which is you have until
the end of the day to put additional filing requests in. You also have
until a week from Tuesday to file those bills. Under the temporary
rules, members would have been required to be here next week to have
filed the bills. This will give you a week from Tuesday to do that. It
also does raise the bill filing limit from 10 to 15. This was a request
from Representative Glazier. Actually it&#39;s not what he asked for,
but it&#39;s more than what we had. Page 20, Line 39 just says that when
amendments are given to the principal clerk they are also given to the
House Rules Chairman. Why is that? You&#39;ve all seen times when the
amendment&#39;s not been quite right and the speaker has had to stop the
debate and call everybody to the dais and figure out how to fix it.
It&#39;s not an attempt to stop anybody from offering them, just to make
sure that they fit in the bill. We&#39;ve been doing that since the
start of Session, too. I haven&#39;t had any complaints about that. Page
23, Line 29 was a suggestion from Representative Cotham. This adds
pregnancy and military service to the ability to have absence without
leave of the House. Page 24, Line 16. This was also at the request of
Representative Glazier but many members in our caucus asked for it as
well. There are times that bills pass out of this Chamber and go to the
other Chamber and come back and the bill sponsor may not agree with the
content of the bill. You have the right to have your name removed from
the bill if that happens. It will require an affirmative act from you to
request the clerk to do that. The clerk will establish whatever
procedures she deems necessary to do that. But it will give you the
chance, if you send over a bill and it comes back as something you
don&#39;t agree with, to take your name off the bill. Mr. Speaker, those
are the only changes to the permanent rules from the temporary rules
that this House has operated under for the past few months. I would
appreciate support of the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion, further debate? For what purpose

chance, thank the people that clean this building because Lord knows
this place gets hot as an oven but it won&#39;t clean itself and if it
wasn&#39;t for them we wouldn&#39;t be able to kick our way in here.
They do a very good job. Also, remember the people that provide security
to this institution because you don&#39;t know how many times they step
between you and disaster, and I learned that very quickly yesterday when
an incident occurred. Nothing happened, but they were there. I would
also like to thank the sergeant at arms, for what you all put up with,
we appreciate you even though sometimes we don&#39;t thank you but we do
appreciate your solemn work. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, we&#39;re drawing to the end and I want to take a moment of
personal privilege on a couple of things. One is I would like to ask you
to keep the family of former Representative Jim Horn in your prayers.
Representative Horn passed away, I guess, Mickey served with him, 98,
Julia did, Linda did, I&#39;m trying to think of the members here who
served with Representative Horn from Cleveland County. He passed away
this, I believe two days ago, was a leader in our community. He was
instrumental in bringing the American Legion World Series to Shelby,
which it draws a lot of people and a lot of tourists to our region of
the state and has been a milestone in what it&#39;s done for our area.
So he will be missed and he served a term here in the House and was, as
he was in our community was an honorable and hard working member of the
House of Representatives. I also wanted to take a point

restaurants around the country. And as it worked down, the final contest
came down between a barbecue restaurant in Shelby called Bridges
Barbecue and a barbecue restaurant in Alabama. So don&#39;t worry about

Bridges Barbecue. For what purpose does the gentleman from Rutherford,
Representative Hager, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A point of inquiry, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman can state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that Alston&#39;s or Red&#39;s?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It was Red Bridges, it was Red. We have two Bridges. So, they&#39;re
both good. But that was a nice--and the other thing I want to say, too.
I know there&#39;s a couple lights, is that I do think we&#39;ve been
very productive this week. We had a very long session yesterday, we have
really drained the cup as far as the bills that were in committee and
eligible to be heard, and I want to thank the members, I want to thank
the committee chairs for moving expeditiously through the process. The
only bills that are pending in committee now that would have been
eligible to be heard next week are the local government bills, and I
think the local government chairs have got those placed where
they&#39;ll be ready to be taken care of week after next. As you know
when we started session, we conferred, of course, with Representative
Hall, with the House minority leader, made sure that the minority party
was agreeable and supported the idea of a spring break. We checked with
our caucus and I heard nothing but agreement from all sides, that a
no-vote session would be a good idea. The Senate also followed suit. I
believe they&#39;re going to be gone a good bit of--well, we never know.
But the last they told me, was I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to be
here. And so, of course, staff will be here, I understand that
Representative Dollar is going to have the Appropriations members here
or the chairs working on the budget. But I just want to take an
opportunity to let folks know we&#39;ve worked very hard this week,
we&#39;ve gotten ahead, and I think that the break is well deserved. I
know a lot of us have young children. It&#39;s spring break. We
don&#39;t know how long we&#39;ll be here this summer, and it may be the
only chance some of us get to have any kind of vacation. So just, I
wanted to personally wish every one of you a happy Easter, a restful and
relaxing spring break, and know that, hope that you&#39;ll be safe in
any travels that you have, and encourage you to come back the week
after, ready to put your nose to the grindstone and keep pushing on to
get these bills out. For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston,
Representative Bumgardner, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
An inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What time do you want me to be at the barbecue place? You know I grew up
in Bessemer City and been there hundreds of times, and so--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
--you just need to let me know what day and time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You name it, you name it. We&#39;ll be there. For what purpose does the
gentleman from Craven, Representative Speciale, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to speak to a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know, as we look back on our lives, look at all the things that
we&#39;ve done, I mean I spent 20 years in the Marine Corps, ran five
campaigns, actually won a couple of them obviously, but all the things
that I&#39;ve done, and all the decisions that I&#39;ve made, could not
compare to the decision that I made 41 years ago, to ask a young,
16-year-old girl to be my wife. And Monday, we will celebrate our 40th
anniversary. And I just wanted to publicly say, I love you, Hazel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston, Representative Torbett,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry of the Chair, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is it

  <p id="60:00">
  is that my understanding that there will be a skeletal session on Monday
and Thursday and bills would be accepted for being filed on those two
days?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That--the Chair was going to announce, pursuant to our rules, rules may
be filed on the legislative days next week. Those days will be Monday
and Thursday. Those will be the two days, I believe, that we&#39;re
going to have the no-vote sessions. So, and I do want to address the
thing about next week. If members are here conducting business, whether
it&#39;s meeting with constituents, working on things, certainly you
should be reimbursed for mileage and per diem. I would ask that those
who are not here certainly waive that. There&#39;s a form or an email
you can send to, I believe Wesley Taylor&#39;s the person. So I think
the caucuses may have addressed that. So just remember that requires and
affirmative act on your part, so don&#39;t for get to do that. But yes,
bills may be filed those next two days next week. For what purpose does
the gentleman from Guilford, Representative Blust, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A moment of personal privilege.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I certainly endorse Representative Setzer&#39;s
feelings toward the Sergeant-at-Arms. They do a great job. But I would
have one request from the Sergeant-at-Arms. If somebody comes after me
or some people, let them come, okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Catawba, Representative Adams,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to speak to a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, feeling a bit of peer pressure and knowing that there is a record
of this, I want to take a moment to reflect on the fact that Saturday is
my 28th anniversary, and 28 years of bliss with my lovely wife, Donna.
Thank you.

Well, the Speaker delivered a revelation to me today. I never knew there
was any decent barbecue west of Durham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See, I tried not to go there, Representative Pendleton. For what purpose
does the gentleman from Rowan, Representative Warren, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I&#39;m just curious. Is local government still meeting
after this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe they are. Yes, they are still meeting after session. For what
purpose does the gentleman from Cabarrus, Representative Pittman, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Mr. Speaker, just a moment of personal privilege and--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to speak to a moment of personal privilege.

New Bern. Thank you.

A point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to speak to a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members of the House. As we go along this
Easter holiday, a lot of accidents happen on the highway. So just think
about the people and the families with blood, and this is Organ Donation
Awareness month. And just think about that. A lot of people go from a
happy time to a sad time to a time they have to make a quick decision.
And God has been good to my family, 2005, we were blessed with twin
boys. Twelve hours later, one was airlifted. He was six weeks, six days
old. He had a homograft, a donor valve, and 2013 he had another donor
valve. So God has been good to my family, He&#39;s been good to a lot of
families around here. And you really don&#39;t think about it until it
hits you. So this Organ Donation Awareness month, so think about that,
also it&#39;s Autism Month. And today&#39;s Autism Day. Think about
that. Everybody&#39;s special. Have a happy Easter, and God bless you.
