Let&#39;s pray. O, Lord, thanks for being here with us today. Whether
two or three or one hundred, help us hold on a little longer until that
happy hour of our deliverance comes. Help us to wait for You, Lord. As
we wait for You, help us to be watchful and tender. In waiting, keep us
humble and teach us how to serve as You have first served us. In
Jesus&#39; name we pray, amen.
