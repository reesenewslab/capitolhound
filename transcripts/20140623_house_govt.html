Thank you Mr. Chairman. Welcome back everyone. Durham Technical
Community College only serves two counties, Orange and Durham. Both
counties contribute to the maintenance of that community college through
contributions to its operating fund. Traditionally the two counties have
had one county commissioner on the board and they've alternated terms.
Both groups of county commissioners approached our legislative
delegation and asked if they could have one member of each county
commission appointed to the board so they share oversight. There is no
opposition from our local delegation or from either board of county
commissioners and we'd love to have your support for this bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher, you're
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Members are there any questions for the
bill sponsor? Seeing none, Representative Fisher you are recognized for
a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move that we give
House Bill 1120 a favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, the
motion is before you. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no. The ayes have it. Thank you Representative
Meyer. Our next bill is going to be House Bill 1248. Representative
Tine. Want to come up and regale us with your presentation, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Please keep the bar low, if
you would please. This bill, we had this last session also, where we for
Brunswick and Durham we passed that already. Basically what happens out
in the coast is every once in a while they'll leave vessels out in the
water to just sink instead of disposing of them properly and the
counties do not actually have the authority to remove that property so
this would add Washington County at their request to that bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd. Thank you,
sir. Members are there any other questions for the bill sponsor? Seeing
none, Representative Floyd you're recognized for a motion. Thank you
sir. That deep baritone voice carries well without a microphone. All in
favor say aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it. House Bill 1248 passes.
Senate Bill 845, being presented by Representative Iler. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is identical to a bill I filed in
sitting in this committee, House Bill 1236. This just gives Bald Head
Island, which was granted the authority to have a post office back in
1991, the ability to expand their service. They're served by ferry.
There are no roads. So there's no mail delivery. The mail goes from the
Southport post office on the ferry over to the Bald Head Island post
office and they have the mailboxes. This just gives them the ability to
also have package service. The only package service now is provided by
the developer there. This then consolidates everything there at the post
office and have package service and other services that normal post
offices normally have. So this just expands that. I wasn't sure why
we're voting on something like this but I'm told by the legal minds that
we have to. So this is Senator Rabin's bill. It's identical to the one
that I filed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Iler.
Representative McGrady. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion at appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland. Representative Cleveland,
you want to use your microphone, please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm curious.
We have contract post offices throughout the state. And it sounds to me
like the town wants to run a facility such as postal annex or something
like that. Wouldn't this be better served by a civilian organization or
a civilian contractor, with the postal service? [SPEAKER CHANGES] At
this time, on Bald Head, oh I'm sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead,
please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At this time on Bald Head, the package service
is run by the developer. And he's trying to consolidate it into the post
office. Apparently we didn't give the post office the ability in 1991 to
go beyond just mail delivery. So now just giving them the ability to do
it under one banner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ross. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Question. Would that mean contract with UPS or FedEX, something
like that? Because I know right now you can't get a UPS or FedEX
package. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me get a little bit better explanation.
The town manager is back here. Is it okay with the Chairman if he
answers that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, if you approach the podium back
there, the microphone back there, please state your name and position
for the committee? Press the green</p>

...??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Calvin Peck, Village Manager
for Bald Hill Island. Yes, it is to add UPS and FedEx delivery to the
island. The developer currently has that service and they're going out
of that business. They're doing what most developers do, which is pull
back once their primarily developed. Every business was offered the
service on the island. None of them can figure out a way to operate it
at a profit and so the village is stepping up and taking over that
service.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Representative Cleveland, did you have
a follow up question? You just looked puzzled. Members, any other
questions? Representative McGrady, you're recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that we give a favorable report to Senate Bill
848.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Forty-five, sir. Would you like 148, 45 as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me, it's a different number, 845 is it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, we have a motion for a favorable report on
Senate Bill 845, all in favor say aye, all opposed say no. The ayes have
it. Thank you, Representative Iler.
Senate Bill 848, Senator Hartsell? Or Senator Tarte. There you are, OK.
Excuse me, Members, this has a referral to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
Senate 848 is actually the culmination of, at least at this point in
time, eight years of work on the part of Childress Klein Properties and
Howard Hughes Corporation for the redevelopment of a mall-type facility
that would be constructed at the intersection of I-485 and Lawyers Road.
Actually, it's one of the most dangerous intersections in the state or
even identified that way. And this, like I said, the project is itself
been in the works for some time. Mint Hill has developed it's entire
land use plan around the potential for this project already and we're
simply trying to get this moving, finally.
Ultimately, the construction jobs will be about 1,500, the permanent
jobs will be about 2,000. I'll be glad to go into any other...then, in
its, and the language is identical to some authority that was given to
the city of Charlotte probably 10 years ago. We've added Concord and
Kannopolis to that. Actually at my request. One because of a project
that the city of Concord is already involved in, which its committed $12
million to for additional work in the vicinity of Exit 49. If any of you
have ever been to Concord realize you understand the problem. And
Kannapolis because of the research campus in which a private developer
has already spent $750 million. I will be glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Representative Pittman, you're
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For motion at the proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Members, do you have any questions for the
bill sponsor? Seeing none, Representative Pittman, you're recognized for
a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move favorable report on Senate Bill 848 and I see
no referrals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There is a referral to finance, sir. Would you like to
restate your motion as a favorable report on Senate Bill 848 with a
referral to finance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] With referral to finance. OK, it wasn't on here, so
all right. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My apologies. All in favor say aye, those opposed say
no. The ayes have it. Senator Hartsell, your measure passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Next bill up is Senate Bill 867. This will be
presented by Representative Goodman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This bill just changes the
term for the Mayor's office and the council for the city of McDonnell
from two years to four. The reason they want to do this is the town's so
small, it's just a few hundred people and it's just an expensive
proposition. They have trouble finding people to run and nobody's
opposed but I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Setzer, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion at the proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Members, are there any other questions
for the bill sponsor? Seeing none, Representative Setzer, you're
recognized for your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that Senate Bill 867 be given a favorable
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All in favor say aye, those opposed please say no. The
ayes have it and Representative Goodman, I understand you're going to
present Senate Bill 868, as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's the same story
exactly. Proctorville is a very, very small town and has the same
situation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Setzer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion at the proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Members, any questions on this bill? Seeing
none. Representative Setzer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that Senate Bill 868 be given a favorable
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's like deja vu, wasn't it? All in favor say aye,
those opposed...</p>

<p id="10:00">
Say no. The ayes have it. The next bill up is Senate Bill 865. Senator
Soucek is going to present for us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Members of the committee.  This bill simply, what it does is it
removes the extra territorial jurisdiction from the town of Boone. This
is a very almost identical to a bill we had almost two years ago. The
same issues are still at play and I think it's telling that in the two
years, there's been no movement from the Town of Boone to address the
concerns that I and the constituents have had during this time period.
The two reasons why I've brought this bill forward are one, my entire
time in Boone but especially the last two years, the outcry from the
citizens talking about how this is affecting them negatively, and how
they've asked me including a local resolution to continue pursuing this
resolution. And second is on principle. We have a foundation to our
democracy, to our system of government, is property rights. Written
about all the way by our founding fathers. And when you have a situation
where through abuse of an existing law, a gross abuse, the worst I've
seen anywhere in this state, we have people whose property is regulation
without representation. And I think that is something that is not
tolerable. It is harmful to our county. And my constituents have asked
me to address this. And so that's why I bring this before you and ask
for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ramsey. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, a motion at the appropriate time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Adams. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a couple of
questions. Where's the town on this? I mean I know you said you talked
to residents. But don't you have a town council? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure.
Yes the town is against it. But when you have an entity that is
oppressing its neighbors, of course they're going to be against you
taking away their tyrannical power. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Mr.
Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there a county
board of commission there as well? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there a county board, were you speaking of the city
council when you responded? So is there a county board there as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, there is a county board and the majority supports
this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman, just as a follow up to Representative Adams' question, is
there anyone here from the town of Boone that could address this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher, we actually have three people
who have asked to speak. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Very good. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I'd like to exhaust the committee's questions first. Representative
Ross. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess my question is in the particular area
that we're talking about, the ETJ and what happens after you absolve the
ETJ when a group of citizens comes in and has an issue, a zoning related
issue, and the town of Boone, what would they do? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, that's a great question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. They'll have the same
recourse that everyone else in the county has. We have elected officials
at the county level and at the state level that actually represent the
people in the ETJ. Right now the people in the ETJ have a dispute with
their neighbor or have a concern, they go to an authority that neither
can vote for in order to have the authority to impose that regulation on
them. I want to restore this to the proper level of government of people
that can actually be voted for rather than someone that is not electable
by the people in the ETJ. And just a further example, and remember this
is a local bill, and this is a place where we live and after I had filed
the first bill I looked at the map. I live personally within a mile of
the town of Boone. And not in the ETJ but potentially to be. When this
is abolished, all that will happen is I'm asking people to be in the
same environment that my family and I have been in and lived in for my
entire time in Boone. I'm not even asking them to do anything that one I
haven't experienced myself or willing to do myself. And I found it a
very good environment. So talking from extreme experience is where I
come from on this issue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me give you an example. I spent about
20 years in municipal government. I had a neighborhood just outside my
town limits that I went through the same thing, we don't get to vote, we
want out, and this went on for several years. Until someone came in and
tried to put a waste facility right next to the neighborhood. Then they
ran to city hall trying to beat the door down wanting to have
protection. If we had taken them out of the ETJ they would have had no
protection. So I guess my question is is</p>

<p id="15:00">
Do you see that that's what's going to happen here? I mean, that's the
way I see it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Repres-, I'm sorry the Chair's going to be lax on
this. Just respond to the questions as we give them to you, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. You come up with a hypothetical worst case
scenario. There are protections. You've got the county. They've got the
ability to do different kinds of policies. In fact, one of the
communities and I even see a member of that community here who had
concerns. In the past they've gone to the county and they implemented a
high-impact land use ordinance. They have mechanisms. I just want them
to use the right mechanisms with the right level and appropriate level
of representative government to have those disputes. Not someone, you
know, to step cross the line and tell someone what to do with their
property.
And you come up with an example that could cause some challenges, but
not all the thousands of people who are involuntarily for decades been
in regulatory limbo and that's who I'm trying to look at is the
thousands of people who are concerned about this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One short follow up. It's not a hypothetical. That
case actually happened in Burlington. The other question is, is it not
true that these people in the ETA don't pay taxes to the municipality?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct. They do not pay taxes but they're
still regulated and have fees, have limitations on their property. I had
one member come to me and talked about how their land became unbuildable
because of the regulations that the town of Boone put on them. And they
tried to take redress but there was no way for them to be able to solve
it. So there's some real concerns with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are we good, Representative Ross?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore. Representative Stone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Senator Soucek. We had this bill come up, I think, maybe two years ago.
It went through the House and I was a little concerned being a former
mayor pro tempore of my small city back in Sanford. I went out and
actually talked to several of my business partners in the community to
find out what they thought. And what I found out was was they were
pretty upset the fact that their rules and regulations did bound them
from doing some of the things they could do if they were in the county.
They were in the county but being an ETJ, they were not allowed to do
certain things because they were in ETJ. They had more rules and
restrictions put on them.
But what was even greater is I had another concern, so I called my city
manager and I said, &quot;I've got a question. What do you think about
this ETJ process?&quot; And of course, he said as city manager that
optimally they'd like to stay in the ETJ. They'd like to have it, but he
said if we didn't have it, we got something called a uniform development
ordinance which allows the county to do some zoning outside of the city
which was a good process because all these small communities, regardless
of what size, you got to have a long term plan of what you want your
city and your county to look like.
But more importantly it gives the county residences direct recourse when
someone passes a law that infringes on their rights. And that's what we
found out was a huge problem was start up businesses, small moms and
pops outside the city limits, that were trying to conduct business. They
were hampered with the laws that they couldn't vote for or against
anyone because the ETJ was controlled by the city limits.
So I just want to make sure I mentioned that as I went through it two
years ago with my community and a lot of talk from the small business
operators in my community. I'll give you that side of it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Stone. Representative Moore,
you're recognized for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I apologize for being late. I had another
committee. I'd like to ask Mayor Ball does he support or against this?
Because it's a local bill I understand what the Senator is saying, but I
want to hear pro or con from the mayor of the city. So, if you would
allow him to answer that question. What does he...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore? The Chair doesn't want to
interrupt you but before you arrived here the Chair announced we're
going to let the committee members exhaust their questions and we have
four people signed up to speak and then you can address your question.
Will that be acceptable?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's fine. He heard the question so whenever it's
his time to speak he can answer it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, thank you. Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I apologize for I was in
the same finance meeting as Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair understands where we stand in your
priorities.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, as a former Chair of the House Finance Committee,
yes you do understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I convey correctly my...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm also on that committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was here.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, we have our priorities. But anyway, to the
point. I heard some concern about the ETJ as not being appropriate but
the ETJ extra-territorial jurisdiction is something that the state of
North Carolina has allowed municipalities to have for a long time in
order to have ordered developments so that we don't have...</p>

<p id="20:00">
Not have a situation such as Representative Ross just indicated. This is
not an extreme case at all. The idea of having development next to say a
neighborhood, that is say, you fill in the blank. And as fault plan,
that's not extreme in terms of what might be allowed by a County, and
what ETJ would not allow. So I don't think really you, really have a
good case for getting rid of ETJ in my opinion because of the good that
ETJ has done across the, for the many years, across the State. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair recognizes Mr. Andy Ball from Talabou.
Sir would you just turn your microphone there? There's a word press or
push, and I'll turn your light on. If you would announce your, give us
your name and position. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman of the committee,
my name is Andy Ball. I'm the mayor of the town of Boone. I appreciate
the time today before the committee. And I appreciate the dialogue
that's Mr. ?? and Mr. Jordan have engaged with us in the past couple of
weeks. We did meet 2 weeks ago on this, didn't get too far in our
meeting, but we have discussed this in the past. We have a new counsel,
a new mayor right now. We're getting up to speed on all the issues, and
have asked our planning department to look through this and see what we
should do from here. First thing, is that the town of Boone has
communicated to almost every member of this committee as opposition of
this bill. We think it's extremely harmful and has adverse impacts for
just one community in the State. When you have almost 200 other small
towns and cities in the State exercise ETJ the exact same way the town
Boone is, there's nothing different about what goes on in Boone with ETJ
than goes on in other communities. That's an important to make. On
Representative Stone's example in his community, there's a very high
likelihood that in his situation that the County had zoning in place.
That they had some kind of unified development ordinance as he refers
to. Watauga County does not have a full zoning authority in the County.
They do not have a ?? they do not have a development ordinance that they
enforce County wide. So in your communities, you see larger urban areas
with county wide zoning. That is not the situation where we are in
Boone. We don't have the ETJ, it's eliminated, and the County enforces
the State building code, and that's what you got. There's no public
hearing process for residents to go and object to a property, or to put
in their 2 cents on a property or proposal. And so it's extremely
harmful to those neighborhoods that we have in ETJ right now. The last
thing is that this is a very controversial issue for a local bill, and
again we have not receive word from Senator Soucek or Representative
Jordan on what is different about what's going on in Boone and the rest
of the State. And other communities exercise this authority. This is the
front page on Sunday of ?? Democrat just yesterday. Mr. Chairman, and
members of the committee , Boone ETJ in jeopardy. The prior headline a
few weeks ago was, Soucek targets Boone ETJ again. So, this is a very
controversial local issue. A lot of comments being made on local blogs,
on local newspaper articles on this. At this time, we are asking the
committee today for unfavorable re pour on this bill, so we can sit down
and work through these issues, identify the issues first that are
objectionable, and then to work on those and find a solution that works
for all ETJ residents. At this time, for 30 seconds just briefly, I've
asked with your permission Mr. Chairman, for an ETJ resident to travel
in the 3 hours from Boone with me today. A resident and property owner
for over 30 years, to tell his story briefly to you. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, would you identify
yourself please? Excuse me. Just one second please. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman. If he has indeed traveled 3 hours, I'm sure you'd give him
more than 30 seconds. Would you not sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Thank you. I'm sure you would, but I just wanted
to check. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate your assessment of my
generosity. Sir, if you'd? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, my name is Lee
Stroopeni. And I do live in ETJ. I live in the Seven Oaks community,
which is about 2 miles out from the center of Boone. I'm on the East
side of Boone, and we heard one of the representatives talk about a
situation. I live in a situation where that ETJ protection is necessary.
I lived in a neighborhood before we had ?? territory jurisdiction, and
we had an asphalt plant that wanted to come into our valley, where we
had about 4 neighborhoods that. And you have to understand that our
mountain area is different from this ?? area. And so when you live on a
mountain top like we do, your view should look over the valley. Well we
had an asphalt plant that wanted to come into that valley and be
adjacent to the new river, right there in the ??</p>

[??]. We have no protection. So, we did everything within our legal
power to make our concerns be heard. And fortunately, we met all the
qualifications to actually- we met the population requirements, we went
through all the applications and we asked the town of Boone would they
grant us protection? And we got over seventy percent of the neighbors to
agree to accept the provisions of ETJ in a town that's accepted us into
the ETJ the county [??] and we've had protection for the last fifteen
years. Now our next fight was once we got the ETJ zoning there was a
business that was grandfathered in on unconditional use. Well that
business operated pretty well for a while, but then all of a sudden they
started violating the UVO. And one of the great things that you have in
ETJ, you have a way of recourse. You have a recourse. You have a way of
appealing. Or call into question any unappropriate business activities.
So we did, as a neighborhood. And that business admitted to eight
charges, eight violations, and one particular violation is still tied up
in appelate court awaiting a ruling. But the board of adjustments, which
I happen to serve, I couldn't serve on this particular case, but I have
served for ten years as ETJ representative, so I was giving voice to the
ETJ community. But if you pass this bill, that court ruling is still
pending. And that business can walk. This is our home, this is our
personal rights that we're fighting for. So thank you for this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, are there any questions for the two speakers? Representative
Ford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, I have a question for the last speaker. If
seventy percent of you in the ETJ wanted to be in the ETJ, why don't you
take the next step and ask to be annexed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, there's no problem with that, but I think the rules have changed
on annexation since the time that we started the process. We were
thinking that at the time. We knew the consequence of ETJ. But as
whatever the reason is, we're happy to have the zoning, we're not paying
the taxes, we're not [??] the services, and of course I'm sure we'd be
willing to consider whatever. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up? Follow up with the Mayor, please. Mr. Mayor, how large is
your ETJ?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have about a one mile perimiter of the town. By law you're allowed
two miles outside the town, we have about one mile.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And you allow- follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You allow ETJ to be on your planning board?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Of course. The planning board and the board of adjustments. And they get
representation on other committees like water committee and other
things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How many?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How many folks serve?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
About three on each board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Out of how many members?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Out of- they get a minority stake of course, but they'll have three
votes, say, of about nine votes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Depending on the board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, was your question answered? While we have the
Mayor up there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wasn't directly answered but I get the spirit in which he speaks and it
answers my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative [??] did you want to respond to either?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I heard two different things and want to make sure [??]. I think
Representative Ford said seventy percent of the ETJ, I'm pretty sure
that Mr. [??] said  that seventy percent of his community. And that is
the difference, because that was just one small subset of the ETJ. And
also to remind everyone that one of the purposes of the ETJ when it was
created was to force annexation. Now that the force annexation no longer
exists, they have the ability to voluntarily annex. It doesn't change
that at all. And so the big reason ETJ was created is no longer in
place, that's one reason why the gross abuses are even worse.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator, and my apologies for promoting you a minute ago.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have Jeff Templeton is signed up to speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, committee members, Thank you. I'm Jeff

<p id="30:00">
I’m a current resident of the ETJ; I’ve served the last four years as
the ETJ representative on the planning board. I understand that this
matter if of great interest to the League of Municipalities and that
they’re working very hard to defeat this bill, but before you make a
decision, I would ask that you consider the following items. First let
me ask a rhetorical question about what’s different about Boone, and
please keep in kind this is a local bill. The difference is that Boone
has a very unique topography. Unlike Wake County, Cabarrus County, any
other county in the state, Boone sits in a valley, and the city limits
run along the valley floor with the ETJ running along the mountainsides,
so for that very reason, Boone has not and is not planning to do any
expansion into the ETJ with the city limits. It’s too expensive to push
water up a hill, and therefore there are no plans to ever expand into
the ETJ. The citizens of the ETJ are in a permanent limbo with no hope
of ever getting the right to vote or becoming a member of the town
without voluntarily annexing. The second thing that’s different about
Boone’s situation is the town of Boone’s preferential zoning. The town
of Boone has passed ordinances that disproportionately impact the
properties within the ETJ. A recent viewshed ordinance severely lowers
density allowances and poses height regulations and restricts the amount
of land disturbance, all based on an arbitrary 100 foot elevation above
the nearest major traffic corridor. Since undeveloped properties in the
ETJ are primarily located in the hillsides surrounding the town of
Boone, they are disproportionally impacted by this ordinance. A quick
story: We have a local farmer who has property in the ETJ who wanted to
improve the road he uses to haul hay across his field. He applied to the
town to improve his road; they said “That’s fine, as long as you put in
curbing and guttering for your tractor.” So those are the kinds of
situations that are becoming obstacles to growth in the ETJ that we
would like to be alleviated from. Thirdly is Boone’s abuse of power. The
town of Boone, the council, has tried two separate occasions within the
last four years to either subvert or deny the Watauga County
commissioners the ability to select the ETJ representatives to serve on
the board of adjustments and the planning board, which by the way Mr.
Mayor, we have five ETJ representatives on a 13-member planning board.
That board is advisory only, and our town council routinely ignores the
recommendations of the planning board. My vote is meaningless as an ETJ
planning board member. The provisions of the GS168362 are inadequate at
best, and with the town of Boone’s attempts to manipulate the selection
process, the spirit of the statute is effectively gutted. And fourthly,
Watauga County’s authority. Watauga County has the ability and interest
to protect the interests of the neighborhoods in the ETJ from haphazard
development. In March of 2003, Watauga County established a high impact
land use ordinance that identifies and restricts many of the industries
and businesses that are incompatible with neighborhoods such as asphalt
plants, chip mills, chemical storage facilities, cement-mixing
facilities and so on. To summarize, the town of Boone has used its ETJ
authority to stifle the growth of Boone and trample on the property
rights of citizens in the ETJ who are denied the right to vote in local
elections. Speaking through our representatives Dan Soucek and Jonathan
Jordan, we respectfully request that you release us from this untenable
situation of regulation without representation, and pass Bill 865. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Representative Wilkins, you have
a question for one of the speakers or the sponsor? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No
sir. It will probably be for staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Fine. You’re
recognized to ask your question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I think it will be for staff. I was wondering, did we have the same bill
or a bill of similar ilk filed two years ago? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir,
I believe it was an identical bill that was filed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is
it Shelley Adler? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And a question for either of the bill sponsors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess Senator Soucek,
did Boone town council take a stance as to that bill as well? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. I’m sorry, that was one of the earliest questions. First
of all, it was two years ago made through the Senate. It never made it
to the House floor as we ran out of time in the short session, was never
voted on, and the town council has come up and they’re against the bill,
but any entity that is abusing their power, why would they not be
against someone reigning in their abuse of power against citizens that
can’t vote for them? So that seems like a natural position for…</p>

<p id="35:00">
Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a comment. I’m sorry if the question
had been asked or answered previously. I apologize for that. I too had
another committee, and I guess that tells you where I stand as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We realize your importance, sir. Representative Stone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to ask Senator Soucek a question, please.
Senator behind you. Thank you. We’ve heard a lot about the town of
Boone, and have we heard any requests or any comments from the county?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t believe we have a member of the county
commission here. We do have residents of the county. We had a local
resolution supporting this bill, and I have talked to the majority. We
have a 3/2 split, Republican/Democrat on the county commission, and the
majority supports this in the county commission. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So just to
clearly state, your county commissioners are in support and your
citizens and the ETJ are somewhat in favor of what you’re trying to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] County commission, yes, and there’s never been a poll
done but as I’ve spoken with people throughout the ETJ for the last
couple years, I believe the vast majority are in support of it and it
would do a lot of good to a lot of people. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Meyer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator
Soucek or Representative Jordan, can you tell us if there’s been any
work done to mediate this at the local level, so between the county
commissioners and the town council, and what role either one of you has
played in those conversations? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Before this bill was
ever presented two years ago, the first thing I did was I went and asked
for a meeting with the county commissioners and the town council to ask
questions about what the ETJ was and why I was hearing so many concerns
from residents, heard what they did and why they were doing it from the
residents as well, so from the very beginning that was my first step,
was to hear what their concerns were. Mediation… Two years ago I
presented this bill, virtually identical except for the effective date,
and in those two years, with all those concerns, the town of Boone has
just obstructed and delayed, and that’s been their strategy. They
haven’t met with me with any plan. As I asked them last time when I met
them, they haven’t met with me. They haven’t met with me with a plan.
Last time I met with them in my office, I said “Can you bring forth a
proposal?” and they still haven’t done that, so I don’t see any recourse
when they’re unwilling to right the egregious wrongs that are going on
in the ETJ. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, the Chair has one, two, three,
four, five members who have questions and we also have one more speaker.
The Chair wants to let the committee know we will vote on this at about
12 minutes ‘til 6, so I ask you to keep your questions concise, and
Representative McGrady, you’re next. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion at
an appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe Representative Ramsey
has that honor, thank you. Representative Floyd. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A
question for the bill sponsor, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go right
ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I wonder that how time-sensitive is this. The
reason why I ask that, because it seems that some kind of way,
communication has stopped. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Time-sensitive? Some people
have been in regulatory limbo for 20 plus years. This is something
that’s been on the table for… this exact issue on the table for 2 years,
and I don’t see any progress being made, and when the property rights of
citizens that are my constituents have a grave concern and I see no
viable recourse, then it’s time to take action, and I think the time’s
now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, Mr. Chair? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick
follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Then could it not be that an amendment
could be made sort of like to get the parties together between now and
the long session? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The strategy of the town of Boone
for over two years now has been to deceive and delay, and the time is
now to vote on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted just to say Senator
Soucek, I am glad that you made the effort two years ago to bring
parties to the table to talk about the problems that were being
addressed by this bill. I’m wondering, are the same people around now
that were there two years ago, and have you had the same “let’s get
around the table about this” at this point in history? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had a meeting with the town council in my office just a couple weeks
ago when I asked them to please being an alternate proposal forward and
I haven’t heard from them. I’m sorry, what was your first part of that
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I wondered if the same people were…</p>

<p id="40:00">
. . . the same people approached, have those people changed, is what I'm
saying. Two years ago you talked with some folks about this issue and
I'm wondering are the people different now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The majority, I believe, of the board is the same and
when I've seen a strategy, not of trying to work towards a solution but
the status quo for them is do nothing and then they get everything that
they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Followup, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: May I please [??]?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: A quick followup, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I just noted that I believe the mayor said that he
had just come on board and that this is not  something that he had been
around the table about two years ago.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: He was on council at that time, now he's mayor so
he's been around the table the whole time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Point of clarification, Mr. Chairman. If allowed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Yes sir. Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Well the point earlier about the county commission
being cooperative with this resolution, the county commission has not
passed, [??] County, any sort of resolution supporting this bill. They
have not passed any official action as a majority on this bill so no
action has been taken to that effect.
The town council and the county commission met in the fall of 2013, last
year, on ETJ appointment process, on the procedures by which we
cooperate to get ETJ  folks represented on the planning commission and
the board of adjustment. Those meetings were productive. We came to a
resolution. We worked through that issue and we have something in [??]
draft format now for that. So we have a point and processes for this.
There's a different majority of town council members than there were two
years ago, than there are now. I was not in the room two years ago when
Senator Soucek was there talking with the former mayor and the former
council. There are two members that still remain on the council at this
time, three new members. So we are jogging their memory on this issue
and educating them on this. We've directed our planning staff to look at
it as well. We're asking for more time to work on this issue because
clearly no points have been made about what is different in Boone than
the rest of the state. I would hate for other small towns in your
jurisdictions to have this issue against their will brought upon them as
has been the case in other communities. It's just something that we
don't understand at this point. We're looking for clarification from our
representatives.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to respond a little
bit to that. The reason this is a local bill is because we have seen the
things that Boone has done. This is not the only issue that they are
less than forthcoming on. They have had a number of issues where they to
into secret meetings in the back to discuss everything regarding water
inputs and other resources in our area.
They have constantly acted like this over the years. This is not a new
thing and the reason I'm standing here is the other member of the
delegation supporting this is because if you look at what an ETJ is for,
it is to authorize them to, based on their existing or projected urban
development, this is from school government, and areas of critical
concern to the city that are expected to come within their corporate
limits in the near future and allow for a smoother transition from
county to municipal services.
This is not going to happen in Boone. This has never happened in Boone
[??] voluntary annexations. They use it as control, as a control
procedure and that is all and we're asking you to remove it and give
these citizens who are currently under regulation without any
representation, a voice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Starnes. Members, Representative
Starnes is signed up to ask to speak on the issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen of the
committee and certainly I find myself in an awkward position having to
oppose my senator on a local bill but I own a house in Boone that's in
the ETJ so I am somewhat familiar with this. Yes, as Republicans we do
believe in property rights.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: A right to determine the destiny of your property.
But Boone is a unique town with a unique situation in two regards. First
of all, it's a college town and every fall you've got 16,000 people that
come into the town and then they leave. But at the projected growth of
ASU, they're looking at 20,000 students with just in a few years.
Well there's no land, there's no ability to absorb these new students in
the city limits and so all of the development for student housing is
going to be outside the city limits. It's unreasonable to ask anybody to
be able to plan for growth or you can't plan for growth if you don't
have some sort of ordinances in place. Now  Watauga County has no
zoning, period. So if the ETJ is taken away, unless the county ....</p>

Something basically there are no protections. Now the other unique
characteristics of Boon is that it is a resort town. You have people
that come into the mountains to buy summer homes. And you've got
residential neighborhoods that people have made huge investments into
and they want to make sure that their investment is protected. Now what
happens with these neighborhoods when you have tracks of land ajacent to
'em that are used for high density development now I'm talking about
hundreds of units. And it disrupts neighborhoods the zoning Boon
has...and I'm not gonna hold them up as a model or as an example of good
goverment, I don't...everybody has an opinion. Some, somethings that dos
good somethings that dos bad just like any town counsel just like the
General Assembly. But for the most part their ordinances make sense. And
it just tries to have orderly development so that residential
neighborhoods are protected and then you have other areas where you have
the high density housing. And let me give you another example of how in
my opinion, the ETJ worked for the advantage of the homeowners. My house
is on a deadend road a state maintained road there five houses there.
Well there was a person who rented their house to a college student. And
so then, they just multiplied before the year was out there were ten
students living in this one house they all had ten cars, they all went
in the humane society they all adopted a dog, they had ten dogs out
(laughter)...We not only had a dormitory we had a kennel out there. And
it's just those types of housing developments are not conducive to
neighborhoods. We went to the town counsel and asked could they help
us...?? through neighborhoods so that only two unrelated people could
live in a house at a time. Just stop the dormitory effect. These are bad
regulations as far as Representive Ford asking the people to annex you,
they can't. Boon doesn't have any water. They can't grow...even if
they...but of course we can change the annexation laws which I fully
support but it's not practical for a southern town...for this town to
absorb a lot of people and do it because they are limited by their
water. They don't have any water. But nonetheless, in spite of my
goodfriend Sindasuche, and this is a local bill, I think it sets a
dangerous precedent. This would be the only time in the history of North
Carolina, that we have removed the towns ETJ authority. It may not mean
a lot of difference, my town Agranite follows or some of these other
towns but in a University town and then a town where it is a resort
town, it can be disatrous to the value of the homeowners.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Sir I know where...?? if I could briefly respond to this before the
vote.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Briefly sir.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I hate to disagree with my well my good friend from Calwell whos...he
was my representative. There's several things that he said that were
inaccurate. There are protections from the county and still you're still
having someone say well I've got a concern and what I'm gonna do is is
I'm gonna go to a body that noone can elect to go an address my concern.
And I really have a problem with that fundamental law of having people
ruled over by people that can't elect them and I think that's not what
we're about in the state and Boon is a unique situation he talked about
some of the challenges that need to be overcome. What about I'll give
you one example, people tend to be very land rich especially in the
county and dollar poor. When their entire investment is a piece of land
that the town of Boon says, &quot;I like the way that looks so I'm going
to make that unbuildable and I'm gonna take your entire lifetime savings
and family inheiritance away just because we like the way your land
looks. That's a problem, I appreciate your support.
