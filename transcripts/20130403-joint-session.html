The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution, or the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker, members of the House. Let me just say that
procedurally, this is the only way that those of us concerned about the
nomination of Mr. Collins can move forward. Mr. Collins is being removed
in this amendment because he does not care about school safety for all
young people. His record is clear on the Forsyth County Board of
Education. When legislation passed for this general assembly came
forward through the Forsyth county school administration, as I
understand it from newspaper reports, Mr. Collins voted no on a
administrative recommendation that the statute be followed so that in an
anti-bullying statute. Mr. Collins, it's stated that he indicated that
he could not support the anti-bullying provisions that the
administration was sending forward because of his feelings about gays
and lesbians. That he felt in fact they were not entitled to protection
under legislation. Members of the House, this is wrong. School safety is
a critical issue. Our governor has just appointed a committee for school
safety. We have a bipartisan bill, Representative Holloway,
Representative Glazier, Forsyth, I'm sorry, Faircloth and, I'm sorry
that I'm forgetting the fourth member. But we have that resolution for a
bipartisan bill that is about school safety. In this particular case, we
have a nominee who does not care about school safety. His feelings as
expressed toward gays and lesbian citizens of our state are offensive to
me, I think to many of us in this chamber, and to many people in this
state. So again, the only way that this candidate can be removed from
the list, because I personally want to vote for the other five, is by
this amendment. I would also say that I'm speaking just for myself. This
is not any kind of statement from the House Democratic caucus or any
other caucus. This is my personal concern, and maybe others who share my
concern but I move adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Briefly debate the amendment and then for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, I find it very unfortunate that the member from Durham
would want to try to politicize the situation and would remind that
member that when our party was in the minority, we generally respected
the Governor's appointments and confirmed those, but regardless, while
the member is entitled to his opinion, I strongly disagree and I would
urge the members to give whatever credence you would like to to that,
but I would ask to be recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move that the gentleman's amendment do lie upon the table.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore has moved, duly seconded by Representative Edgar
that, Representative, Representative Starnes, that the amendment sent
forth by Representative Luebke be lied upon the table. All those in
favor will vote aye. All opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will lock the machine, record the vote. Seventy six
having voted in the affirmative, thirty seven in the negative, the
motion passes. We are now back on the bill. Further discussion, further
debate. If not, the question before the House is the passage of the
committee substitute for House joint resolution 21 on its second
reading. Those in favor will say aye. Those opposed will say no. The
clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the
vote. Seventy nine having voted in the affirmative, thirty four in the
negative, the House committee substitute number two for House Joint
Resolution 21 has passed its second reading. And without objection will
be read a third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House resolves, the Senate concurring.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the passage of the House committee substitute number two for
House Joint Resolution 21 on its third reading. All those in favor will
vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.</p>
