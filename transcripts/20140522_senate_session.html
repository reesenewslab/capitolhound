ahead and move onto the calendar. Third reading roll call, Senate Bill
786. The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 786, Energy
Modernization Act. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] State
your motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Rules be suspended ?? Senator Rucho can
have staff on the floor with him. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection,
so ordered. Senator Rucho. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister President
and members of the Senate. We had a very informative and vigorous
discussion yesterday and brought forth a lot of information, and Mister
President, I’ve explained it as much as I can. I would urge that the
members of the Senate support this effort as we move closer to energy
independence for North Carolina for economic growth and job creation,
and that is part of what this bill does, and it is one tool in the
quiver that we are making North Carolina the primary economy in the
entire country, and that is our goal. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Jenkins, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] After the lengthy debate yesterday, I did go back and read all
the rules and everything from front to back. Came across one little
issue that I hope will be received as a friendly amendment, and it had
to do with the disclosure of what was actually in the fracking fluids.
And this amendment, which is on the dashboard I believe, very quickly
says that the state - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jenkins, let’s have the
Clerk read. If you’re offering an amendment, let the Clerk read it in.
The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jenkins moves to amend
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mister President. What this amendment does is simply state that the
state geologist or his designee, or their designee, will review the
confidential information provided about the fracking fluids, and what
they will do is compare them to the state and federal lists of banned
chemicals, and if they find one that is either on the state or federal
list of banned chemicals, they are to report it within five days to the
Mining Commission. That’s what it does; I’d be glad to answer any
questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay members, the amendment is before you.
Any further discussion or debate? Senator Rucho? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President, to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have
the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jenkins, it would have been great
if I could have spent more time with you reading these 103 pages along
with the bill, but thank you for finding the time to read it all. Mister
President, we accept this as a good amendment and we would hope that the
members of the Senate will support this in addition to what we already
have in the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate on the
amendment? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the adoption
of Amendment 6 to Senate Bill 786. All in favor will vote “Aye”, all
opposed will vote “No”. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting and
the Clerk will record the vote. 47 having voted in the affirmative and
none in the negative, Amendment 6 passes and the bill…</p>

What is back before you. Is there any further discussion or debate on
Senate Bill 786? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hunt, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To offer
an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forth your amendment, clerk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s on the dashboard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hunt
moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hunt, you have the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate,
this Bill is a long(??) as it was offered yesterday that we need to
consider a minimum bonding amount for drilling for this propane gas.
This amendment stipulates that one million dollar bond will be posted
when these wells are drilled. As I mentioned yesterday also, I built,
developed multi-family housing in the Southeast from Savannah to
Richmond over the last 30 years and I wouldn’t consider hiring a general
contractor without some kind of bonding requirement to require a
specific performance as well as if anything went wrong, he had the
financial wherewithal to fix it. That’s all this amendment does, to make
sure the drillers have the financial wherewithal to fix any problem that
occurs. You know whether it’s damage on the ground, or damage
underground. The bonding company charges a premium of one to three
percent so a million dollars if you are a well-qualified driller would
be in the ten thousand dollar range. That’s pretty much peanuts in the
grand scheme of things. But the bonding company will actually do some of
your due diligence for you. The bonding companies typically require you
be in business for two years, that you have an active liability
insurance policy, indemnification of the owners is required. In other
words, the owners are going to have some liability. They can’t just
offer up a shell. The owners are going to be responsible. I basically
think if they can’t provide this sort of bond then they really shouldn’t
have that kind of responsibility to do the drilling. I would be happy to
answer any questions. I appreciate your support. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Duke, what purpose do
you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Thank
you Senator Hunt for your amendment. Colleagues, Senator Hunt has been
very involved and very concerned all through the process to make sure
that the state of North Carolina had adequate bonding of these
operations. He’s been involved with Senator Richard and Senator Brock
and myself, Dr. Warren and others, in discussion. In the last Bill that
we had, there was plenty of discussions about the bonding and I think
this is a good amendment that further tightens up where the minimum
would be for the bonding that’s required. So I would encourage my
colleagues to vote for this amendment. I think it makes sense and I
thank you Senator Hunt for working with us to continue to strengthen
this Bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President, do ask Senator Hunt a question on the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Hunt, do ye yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Reluctantly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, Senator I love your
amendment. I just have a question or two. My dashboard quit on me this
morning but I wanted to ask you, I didn’t catch the maximum amount of
the bond or what the high end of the bonding requirement would be in
dollars and who’s going to check out the capacity and the integrity of
the bonding companies. If you could answer those for me. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Okay. The minimum bonding amount is a million dollars. The
maximum amount of the bonding, of the bond would be established by the
mining commission or their predecessor, whoever that might be. And the
bonding company, they are evaluated by our insurance department so they
are not licensed, they should not be licensed to do business in North
Carolina unless they have sufficient license capacity to offer the bond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. Over here. Over here, sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Oh, sorry. There is a light that is supposed to light up but I
can’t see it, so Senator Barringer, report the purpose of your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have
the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I give this amendment full support. I have
been a girl scout for 45 years. I am a mother of three children in Wade
County, close to Jordan Lake. This is a good Bill, excuse me, a good
amendment and I urge your support. I thank you for bringing it to our
attention Senator Hunt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To ask the Bill’s final</p>

<p id="15:00">
Is this a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill sponsor, Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, I in-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold on just a second.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sIr, I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to get clear about the coverage of the bonding requirement
and I, perhaps, also should ask Senator Hunt a question because, like
Senator Tillman, my dashboard was slow getting everything going this
morning. But my understanding is the bonding requirement only covers the
site issues where the well, closing the well, where the well is dug and
also putting the site back in it's current state but it doesn't include
damage to adjoining properties or environmental damages, anything like
that. So could you review with me what this bonding requirement, though
I support the amendment, is gonna cover?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I would ask if Senator Newton would respond to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, hold on just a second. Senator Bryant is it okay to direct your
question to Senator Newton?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you Senator Bryant. In the last bill
that, 820, we, in a major way, addressed all the bonding requirements
for these operations. There's a bonding requirement for the surface
owner, there's a bonding requirement for the state as it relates to any
environmental aspects, and there's a bonding requirement to make sure
that the operator has the financial ability to finish the project. What
Senator Hunt's amendment does is set the minimum floor of a minimum
bonding requirement. The bonding will be determined by the NEC as far as
whatever the needs is, the size of the project and so forth. So the bond
could be much, much higher than a million dollars and what the amendment
does is just set the minimum floor of a million dollars. So, as far as
what these other aspects that you're talking about, if there was some
sort of contamination or something like that, I don't believe this
amendment addresses that, I'd have to check with staff for sure, but it
is covered in the previous law that that bonding is required.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, follow-up. For the other areas-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the other areas, such as the contamination, the adjoining property,
those other areas, is that minimum that $10,000 number or what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, we're talking about legislation from last session so I'm
gonna have to, you're gonna have to give me a moment. If you wouldn't
mind, and maybe for the procedures on the floor, if you wouldn't mind
letting me come back and answer your question in a second to be more
specific about it, but that bond is there from 820.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, just, may I make a comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I would just, I support the amendment, I would just, and I was,
like others, was, I'm having a little bit of trouble juggling everything
technologically to get all the information. Since the amendment is on
the floor I think it would be important for us, as a body, to just
understand the complete picture with the bonding even as we are making
this good improvement with Senator Hunt's amendment, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Bryant, and the Chair does understand the challenges
of technology. Is there further discussion or debate? Hearing none-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, yes, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's to ask Senator Hunt a question, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hunt, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, and my question is directly along the lines of
Senator Bryant. I'm looking at where the bonding requirement is put into
the bill and it's in the Reclamation of Surface Property Required
provision, and the bond runs to the state, and my question to you is,
once we resolve this issue among Staff Senator Newton and Senator
Bryant, would you be open to having the bond also run to anyone harmed
and known to be harmed or shown to be harmed by the process. Because
what I worry about is that a neighbor would have to bring in action
themselves and sure in tort and it would be much better for everybody
involved if that neighbor, if they can clearly show they were harmed by
the well drilling, to just claim against the bond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hunt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The intention of the bond was to protect the state against any kind of
damage, whether it was highway damage, environmental damage, so that
Diener didn't have to go in there and clean it up. I really hadn't
thought about applying the damage to neighbors. It was really to protect
the state if the driller did environmental damage.</p>

<p id="20:00">
For example, the state would not be required to go clean up or if they
did, they would get reimbursed for it by the insurance company. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Stein. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to speak on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
absolutely support the amendment for purposes that Senator Hunt just
spoke to, but I think that it would be wise for us to consider whether
we should expand it so that the bonding minimum also runs to anyone who
is harmed by the fracking process. We know that there are provisions in
there that deal with the landowner him or herself, on site reclamation,
and well closing, but I think we need to look out for people who can
clearly be shown to have been harmed as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. To speak for the second time on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t know that you spoke a first time on
the amendment, you responded to a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may,
Mr. President, I did encourage the members to vote for the amendment. I
believe I was the first one to speak after Senator Hunt. But [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.
Senator Stein, and I appreciate that we want to keep order here. I want
to put Senator Stein’s mind at ease. We’ve already addressed all this in
820. The operators are already fully responsible for any possible
contamination or problem they may have off-site on a joining property
owners. The bonding requirements are already there. And I appreciate
your concern, these are very valid concerns that why we already
addressed them in 820. Let’s keep this simple as far as the amendment.
This amendment just established the minimum bonding amount for the
surface owners as it relates to his bill. So I’d be happy to sit down
with staff with you, Senator Stein, to make sure you are comfortable
that is has already been addressed in previous legislation. Because
there is nothing wrong with what you are saying. We’ve just, we’ve
already done it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, just one moment, because I want to get something clear. I
would encourage the members to look at rule 14A of you rules. The rules
basically say that no member should speak more than one time on an
amendment. And so we have not here been enforcing that rule, and it
looks like we’re not enforcing it today, but we need to make sure that
if we’re going to have rules, we need to follow them. Okay? Senator
Stein, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator
Newton will yield for questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be within
the rules [LAUGH]. Senator Newton, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I
can work within the rules, yes I yield.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. So
tell me what H1E does in terms of the bonding requirement. Clearly it
establishes liability, if you harm somebody in the neighboring property.
But is the bond adequate. What is the bond as it applies to somebody
damaged by fracking on a neighboring property? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay,
if I may, I just want to repeat your question so I’m answering
specifically. You want to know what the bonding requirement is if there
is any damage to a joining property owner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Precisely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Give me just a moment, and I’ll make sure I give a
clear answer with that. That we’re clear. We’re going over old
legislation. Hold on.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] While Senator Newton is
conferring with staff members, the doctor of the day is now in Chamber.
Dr. John Ebert, of Charlotte, North Carolina. Dr. Ebert, thank you so
much for being here today. [CLAPPING] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton is recognized to respond to the
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Senator
Stein. And Staff is going to pull the section up so I can read it to the
members. This is all covered under the financial responsibility bonding
requirements of 820 that would reach out and</p>

<p id="25:00">
… mandate that they have adequate financial ability and the bonding
requirement for all of those damages that might occur offsite, and if I
may be permitted to sit, it might be easier. I’ll just read it. And this
is Subsection L and it says, let’s see… “Proper well-closure site
reclamation, post-closure monitoring and financial assurance. Rules for
financial assurance shall require that an oil or gas developer or
operator establish financial assurance that will ensure that sufficient
funds are available for well-closure, post-closure maintenance,
monitoring and any corrective action that the department may require,
and to satisfy any potential liability for sudden and non-sudden
accidental occurrences, and subsequent costs incurred by the department
in response to an incident involving a drilling operation, even if the
developer or operator becomes insolvent or ceases to reside, be
incorporated, do business or maintain assets in the state.” So I
apologize to members for being that technical. We did have to go back to
the old bill to do that because we waded into it again a little bit with
this bill, but as it relates to Senator Hunt’s amendment and your
questions, we’ve got it covered. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] to see if senator Newton will yield for a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Newton, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] What I heard you to say is that they just have to have
financial assurance, which is not the same thing as a bonding
requirement as it relates to damage on other property, and so my
question to you is would you all be open to an amendment akin to Senator
Hunt’s that protects the state, that would have them have a bond as it
protects anyone who’s harmed – a neighbor who’s harmed. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Stein. The requirement is it could be a bond
or other financial mechanism to ensure that they have the adequate
financial reserves even if they go insolvent or bankrupt. The MEC has
already addressed these issues and continues to do so, and quite
honestly, I think at this time it would be imprudent and may complicate
and actually make it worse to try and wade back into this in this way on
the floor at this time. I just, I would not be amenable to an amendment
in that regard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate on
Amendment 7? [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister President? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I had a
question for Senator Newton or Senator Rucho. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well
pick one. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Newton, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And this
is in follow-up to the previous question I was asking which sort of
started this line of discussion, and just to help clarify for me and the
members, can you share with us what the draft rules are providing by the
MEC for the minimum bonds for site reclamation, well-closure and
adjoining properties, which might just make the whole thing simpler? And
I’m sorry I wasn’t more direct initially. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Senator Bryant. I can’t. We’re talking about 103 pages of rules that are
online that you’re very welcome to go read. They’re out there for public
comment right now. I’ve been satisfied from what I’ve read that they are
not just adequate but are overly, in a good way, cautious to make sure
that we’re doing that, and I would note that these are the same rules
that we’re talking about for bonding or financial assurance – the same
rules that we apply to hazardous waste sighting and so forth. I mean
it’s identical requirements. If it’s good enough for hazardous waste
sighting, I would suggest to you that it should be good enough for our
natural gas operators. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One more follow-up, Mister
President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I have not read all 103 pages but would I be in the right
ballpark if it’s the case that the rates are in the range of 5,000
dollars for a one foot well or some range of that nature? I was just
concerned about that small amount. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, Senator. That’s
a drilling bond; that’s not a reclamation bond. It would take some time
to try and drill into this, pardon the pun, and find it, but the MEC
standards are going to be much different than that. That’s simply a
drilling bond. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate on
Amendment 7?</p>

Speaker changes:Senate ?? for what purpose you are?
Speaker changes:To speak briefly on the bill,
Speaker changes:Hear you have the floor,
Speaker changes:Thank you,Mr. president ladies and gentleman senate i
said and listened at the debate on the bill last couple of days several
things come to mind first i want to command the floor sponsor and those
who on the ?? making the thing some progress some improvement to this
bill,but is always reflecting on this particular bill i thought about
senate McLean's comments yesterday and this consideration of the bill or
to be about ensuring to be about we have clean drinking water in the
state and there is no precautions that we can take there are are reasons
when it comes to make me sure we do have clean drinking water in the
state what was going to be a major issue in the state and in the country
during this entry just as in the south west and the western part of the
country so we have to be very careful that we don't do any thing that's
going to harm the water supply ,now it took tens and millions of years
for this gas to built up  for below this surface of North Carolina on
the other places i have the benefit of talking to the geologist
overtime about the formations in North Carolina or ?? but in each of
those conversations that we always get big for the question of can you
beat two cautious and how you try to extract that something from the
earth it's been below the surface of hundred million years or any else
before the dinosaurs and i think it's not unreasonable ,when we look at
that to understand some of the state of geologist ourselves bout twenty
years ago there was a debate on whee we have to spend some nuclear waste
and North Carolina popped up his one of the states that would be a god
candidate that spent put nuclear waste North Carolina place out of
Nevada i think the yelp river valley some where the north eastern part
of the north western part of the state an surprisingly a strip of rock
rate through here and northern whack county on in the Franklin county.</p>

<p id="35:00">
And as we thought about it more and more I think that people realized
that the processes that nature had created over billions of years have
to be studied very, very carefully. And so I’m not really bothered that
much that the mining commission or what was the mining commission will
be a new name, was sort of moving slowly and figuring out how we do
this. Because I as well as all of you want to create good high paying
jobs in North Carolina. And I want those decisions in creating those
jobs to be sure that they’re balanced for things that are in the best
interest of our citizens. And if it takes the commission all of these
knowledgeable people, whether they’re geologists or chemists or
biologists or various others, if it takes them an extra six months, a
year, two years, to figure out how we ought to attack something that’s
taken tens of million years to develop, that doesn’t seem unreasonable
to me. And so while I think there are some great things in this bill,
the issue that Senator McLaurin raised yesterday, with the fault line
down in Anson County. You know, it seems that the commission has a look
at the potential impact of earthquakes and other things of that nature.
And so if this is where we ought to go, we ought to let the experts take
us there in a cautious way. And so we ought to be willing to let them
formulate and ?? of all these regulations. The kind of amendment that
Senator Jenkins sent forth. So they can determine how you figure out
whether somebody is putting poison that’s been banned because we already
learned that it has the ability to migrate through the ground and get
into the ground water. That’s the kind of decision that the commission
ought to make before we plow head-long into this. And so after our last
session, I got pretty comfortable that we all wanted to take all of
these precautions and the commission would come along and do what they
wanted to do, and as most things in the scientific community, you test
it. And people react to it. And there’s a degree of certainty once
you’ve done all of that. And so our rush head-long into this I think
without letting the expert process go its full measure is less than what
I would hope. Our fast-tracking, doing it without looking at what the
real risk to the water of this state might be, bothers me. And so for
that reason, Mr. President, I’m going to vote against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate. Hearing none, question
before the senate is the passage on third reading of senate bill of the
committee substitute to Senate bill 786. All in favor will vote Aye. All
opposed will vote No. 5 seconds will be allowed for the voting. Clerk
will record the vote. Senator Jackson, 35 having voted in the
affirmative and 11 in the negative. 36, I’m sorry. 36 in the
affirmative, 11 in the negative. Senate bill 786 has passed its third
reading. The amendments will be engrossed and the bill will be sent to
the house. Senate bill 734. Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate
bill 734. Regulatory reform act of 2014. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade
is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. This bill
basically continues to make state rulemaking more efficient and
increases needed protection for the environment and the public. The bill
also streamlines the environmental permitting process, and makes it
easier for citizens and businesses to obtain needed permits. It also
removes obsolete regulations and some of those I just want to mention a
few so we can lighten the meeting today. It’s going to scrap a ban on
burning logs larger than six inches in diameter, even though we can put
logs that size in a fireplace in</p>

My favorite one is it's going to get rid of a ?? ban on cruising on the
highway. Now, I know all of you will be glad about that on your way home
tonight. The other one is it's extremely interesting is that you no
longer have to relinquish a party telephone line in case of an
emergency. Some of you in here probably do not even know what the party
telephone line is. Like you, Senator Barefoot. But it also, at the same
time, increases the number of environmental and consumer protections and
creates helpful rules. It increases penalties for those who violate
endangered plants ?? increases the handicap fee from $100 for illegal
parking in a handicap parking space to $500, up to that amount. One of
the great things it does is it clarifies that off-duty emergency medical
professionals volunteering to give aid with no expectations of
compensation are protected under the good Samaritan law. It also allows
citizens or businesses to have ?? wave penalties. If you go and
self-identify yourselves as possibly doing something illegal in the
environment or something you really didn't realize you had done at the
time, you won't be charged with civil penalties if you go to the ?? and
basically beg forgiveness. Now, that does not mean that if you are
caught doing something that harms the environment by ?? that you won't
be fined. It also does a lot for proactive measures to protect the
agriculture and, of course, that's our state's largest industry. This
went through AGG and there were several questions, but it was moved out
unanimously by the vote. Next, it went to finance. There were several
questions, and it was also passed out unanimously by the vote. So, I've
asked for your support today on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forward your amendment. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock, you have the floor to explain amendment
one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Make sure it's on everybody's dashboard. And Senator
Barefoot, we do know what the party line is like. If somebody sends a
group message on Facebook, then you get constantly notified that the
people are on it. So, we still have our own form of party lines today.
But this amendment is a follow-up to the amendment I ran yesterday,
committee, which was the omnibus technical corrections. This is ?? this
omnibus technical corrections number two. Reading through the amendment
real quick, you'll see where certain lines were left out in the original
bill. Some sections and headings and things that were made right. And
also, probably the meat of the first amendment is the change that we
went in and took out too much yesterday when we were making some of the
changes in the reform of the onsite wastewater regulation to make sure
that what we moved a few years ago we're moving it back to make sure
that the rule-making process follows. So, we're just making a correction
to the correction to the bill. I ?? your support
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate on amendment one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hearing now the question for the senate is the passage
of amendment one to senate bill 734. All in favor will vote

one passes and the bill is back before you. Is there further discussion

.9 that's on, well in the version I have it's page 27, and what that
provision does has the effect of taking out more than half of all
ambient air monitors sites, or actual air monitor units, in the entire
state. Where there are 133 air quality monitors in North Carolina, only
73 of them according to Diener[?], as I understand it, are required by
EPA. So, essentially half of all air monitors would be forced to be
pulled down and taken away and all these things do is measure how dirty
our air is. Is our air polluted? Does it have too much NOx or too much
SOx or ozone or whatever air pollutant there is that causes respiratory
problems for our people. And I don't think we wanna be the camel that
sticks our head in the sand and, taking the monitors away does not take
the pollution away. It just takes away our knowledge of whether there is
pollution hurting our respiratory systems. So all this does is,
amendment, take the section out so that Diener[?] can keep the 133 air
monitors that we have so we can know whether our folks are liable to get
sick or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on amendment 2. Senator Wade, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, I appreciate your concern but I will let the Senate know
that the EPA is getting ready to enforce new laws that then make us put
in point-source monitors, these are regional, and we need to free up, of
course, all the resources we can to be able to do this and put them at
the point-source. So I would ask you to vote no on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on amendment 2. Senator Stein, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if the bill sponsor will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I know that we've had trouble with air pollution,
particularly around Charlotte, that's mainly generated by cars and
pollution so how does the point-source issue affect cars, whether it's
in Charlotte or anywhere else in the state, where there's not a point?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, we certainly need the resources free'd up in order to see
what the EPA recommends and that's more what this bill is intended to
do.

for your support.

Management commission and and section 3.33, which transfers the solid
waste rule-making authority from the Commission for Public Health to the
Environmental Management Commission. Will the Public Health, Commission
for Public Health have any rule-making authority in any area after you
make these transfers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, sir, they won't.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further question, Miss ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up? Senator Wade, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will the Public Health Commission still be in business or is it being
eliminated?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, sir. It's still gonna be in business but there's other law duties
that they have to perform.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And one further question Miss President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So they will not have any enforcement authority in either of these areas
but they will have authority left, in other words, relating to the
public health?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They have other public health responsibilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One final question I think, Miss President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So it will be the Environmental Management Commission's duty to enforce
these regulations that they promulgate as it relates to health issues
involving drinking water and solid waste?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Senator Blue, I wouldn't, first tell you to look at the makeup of
the two boards. On the Public Health board, they have a registered
engineer, a licensed veterinarian, a licensed optometrist, a licensed
dentist and a registered nurse, and the other four members are selected
by the North Carolina Medical Society. Now these will be making rules
based on water quality and the Environmental group, their members
include- Sorry, I have to take my glasses off to read. Their members
include a medical professional, agriculture, engineering, fish and
wildlife, ground water, air water, pollution control, municipal and
county government, and a public at large. They all have to represent
those areas. Now, I personally would prefer the Environment Management
Commission than having, no offense to optometrists and veterinarians as
myself, but I would rather have those looking after my water.

Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, I want to direct your attention to section 3.16. I know
this is a simple change of one word from the existing ?? law statute we
passed last year. Could you help me understand what the effect of that
change would be as proposed in this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold on just a minute, I have to find that.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
This particular amendment relates to section 2.2, which is on page 11 of
the bill. What this would do is safely allow, when there is a particular
group, that may challenge air quality permit. The way the provisions
work right now, if that contested case hearing was filed, there would be
an automatic stay until there was deliberations heard, to determine
whether in fact that permit should be moved forward. This is very
simple. I can remind you, these air quality permits fall underneath
provisions established by the Environmental Protection Agency,
established by President Nixon, to control air quality in our country.
And I would hope and trust, that with the tradition that he established,
in terms of protecting our air quality, that we would want to continue
to make sure that our air quality, as well as our streams, as we’ve
discussed earlier in connection with other matters, is in fact protected
to continue to have a wonderful quality of life in North Carolina. So I
hope and trust that we would continue the existing procedures,
longstanding and established, as opposed to omitting them in a way which
is likely to result in air quality in North Carolina being compromised.

you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, he yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Two
things, Senator Apodaca. What will be the substitute effect of this
change as it relates to the bill as opposed to date change? How does it
substitutely and materially change the bill in terms of its operation or
function? And then secondly, what’s the procedural effect? [SPEAKER

better bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate

<p id="65:00">
For the amendment as well. It deals with page 6 of the bill and it
basically says that when it comes to the actual innocence commission,
that we would like to see that particular commission abolished and
express a willingness to ask the chief justice of the supreme court of
North Carolina to consider the abolishment of that particular
commission. I might point out that it was the actual innocence
commission that was recently established by chief justice I. Beverly
Lake, which came forth for recommendation for establishing the innocence
inquiry commission. It’s my understanding that at this particular time,
Justice Mark Martin who is running for chief justice, would like to see
that particular - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Continue to exist - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of information, sir. Question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] State your
inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could Senator McKissick speak a little louder
so we could hear his debate? I’m not able to hear it very well. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator McKissick, we’ll get Senator Rucho a new set of hearing
aids, but if you’ll go ahead and make sure you hold the microphone a
little closer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As I was saying earlier. For Senator
Rucho’s benefit, and the benefit of any and all others that may have
hearing impairments, we want to make certain from this point forth that
this amendment is fully understood and appreciated for the purpose for
which it was intended and offered. And that is to make certain that the
actual innocence commission continues to exist, which was first proposed
by chief justice I. Beverly Lake. Justice Mark Martin would also like to
see it continue, and he’s by some people’s expectations may be the next
chief justice of the Supreme Court. I have a memo from here from Chris
Muma who was in fact involved in the actual innocence inquiry
commission, dated by yesterday’s date, saying there’s plenty of work to
be done, and in fact in 2011 it stated that as part of the forensic
science reform act, committee meetings, the AG, the state bureau,
director as well as others came together to say that there was an
absolute imperative need to continue this particular commission. That it
encourages productive dialogue of experienced invested individuals with
the common objective of justice, court efficient, proven effectiveness.
I think there’s a real reason to keep this entity around. There’ve
actually been 11 states that have gone out and modeled what we have done
in North Carolina. So I hope and trust that we can continue this
particular commission and not encourage the chief justice to abolish it.
So I ask for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there further discussion
or debate on amendment A? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Wade. For what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, I know you brought this up in ag
and Senator Hartsell was there to discuss it. He’s not here today due to
a family crisis. I know Senator Tillman also spoke on this. And Senator
Tillman may want to speak on this amendment. He did in ag, since Senator
Hartsell’s not here. But I would just ask after the discussion that
Senator Hartsell and Senator Tillman had on this particular issue in ag.
I would ask you to vote no, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion
or debate on the amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator McKissick, to what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak a second time on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick I indicated earlier that rule 14 would allow only one
speaking on an amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Well in that case
maybe I can ask Senator Wade a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade,
do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Were you aware of the fact that in fact there was a
continued need for this particular commission at the time this language
was proposed? And are you aware of whether Senator Hartsell or Senator
Tillman in fact were aware that it was continued need and desire for it
to continue to function, at the time this went into the regulatory
reform bill. It’s my understanding that in the past, when this bill came
forth, there were times when it was in it, and there were times when it
was deleted. It was possible that it was from the state that it got
included at this time. So I mean, were you aware of those things, or
have you had a chance to speak with anyone? I think yesterday I
expressed an interest in asking that someone go back and look into this
and perhaps reconsider this language. Because in my mind, if you’ve got
people who really feel that this needs to continue to exist. 11 other
states have modeled themselves after North Carolina. This is not an
effort that we could abandon. But do you know whether any of those
actions have in fact occurred? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor to answer. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, this was an APO committee.</p>

… recommendation, and I wasn’t in those committee meetings but I did
hear what Senator Hartsell had to say, and Senator Tillman, and I would
yield if the President would allow Senator Tillman to answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman can speak on the amendment or Senator
McKissick can redirect his question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, I was here when Justice
Beverley Lake came around and twisted arms to get us to start the
Innocence Commission and to put it into legislation. That’s been over
ten years ago, and I would ask you and your colleagues to tell me how
many cases they’ve reviewed, how much money we’ve put into that
Commission, and how many cases have been overturned because of their
work. You’ll find that they have done little or nothing and had no
effect on cases that they have heard. When you have a functioning body
that doesn’t have anything to do and doesn’t reverse any decisions and
you want to keep funding them, that’s your problem. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President, if I could just speaks as to relating to those
comments that were addressed to me. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick,
you can direct a question to another member of the body, you can… I mean
I think that’s basically what you can do at this point under the rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe he addressed contents within that particular
statement he made to me directly in terms of… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
McKissick, what I will do is I will on motion of the chair temporarily
suspend that rule if you want to speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister President. First I would like to
make a distinction between the Actual Innocence Commission and the
Innocence Inquiry Commission. They’re two separate, independent entities
which I believe Senator Tillman has confused. Well perhaps he has not.
He indicates he hasn’t. In any case, the Innocence Inquiry Commission,
which is a separate, independent group which is not affected by this
particular language in the bill, would continue to exist, and I would
like to point out that what they have done in my opinion is exceptional
work because if you find perhaps a half dozen people that were
wrongfully incarcerated or convicted because they were innocent, then
they deserve to be freed. They deserve not to serve a day longer in
jail. Not one single member of this body, nor any of their friends nor
relatives, would want to serve a day in jail for a crime they did not
commit. That’s the work that they do, which is indeed exceptional and
something we should be proud of in terms of establishing it in North
Carolina – not a waste of resources but indeed a commitment to our
Constitution and our laws that people should be treated equally in the
eyes of the law. So yes, they have done great work. This particular
matter at this time is related to the Actual Innocence Commission, which
is the body that came together that looked at perhaps problems with the
administration of criminal justice in our state and recommended the
establishment of the Innocence Inquiry Commission. They would still like
to continue to function and to operate and to address problems with the
criminal justice system. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mister President, send forth the substitute amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forward your amendment. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mister Apodaca has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mister President. Members, I’ve had time to read the bill a little
further and I’ve discovered something else. If we’ll go to page 60, line
47, we’re not going to be prepared by November 30th, so we need to
substitute and put in December 1st. I ask for your support so that extra
day will help us make this a much better bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion or debate on Amendment 9? Senator Tucker, for what purpose do
you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President, just to make a comment on
the Amendment, if I may. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I just want to thank Senator Apodaca for not fast-tracking
things here. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate
on Amendment 9? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the
passage of Amendment 9 to Senate Bill 734. All in favor will vote “Aye”,
all opposed will vote “No”. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting.
Clerk will record the vote.</p>

gallery today is Duane Best and his wife Gloria. Duane, if you and
Gloria would stand, I would appreciate it. Duane is a former resident of
the Eaton, North Carolina. Was a music teacher in the public schools of
North Carolina for probably more years than he would like to remember.
He was also the choir director at First Presbyterian Church in Eaton. He
and Gloria have been stellar citizens of North Carolina for a number of
years. And for the city of Eaton in Rockingham County. They now reside
in Wake County. And it’s a pleasure for them to be here today, and I
will be submitting the senatorial statement. The House has also passed a
resolution today honoring Mr. Best for his work. He was, in 2014,
inducted into the North Carolina Music Educator Association’s High
School Choral Hall of Fame. The high school auditorium in Eaton is named
after him. So, Duane, Gloria, thank you for being here today. [APPLAUSE]
