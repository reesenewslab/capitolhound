Good morning. If members will take their seats and guests will take
their seats, as well, we'll begin the appropriations meeting. I'd like
to start out by introducing our Committee Sergeant at Arms today, we
have Young ??, Bob ??, Doug Harris, Warren Hawkins, Bill Morris, Reggie
Sills, Marvin Lee, John Brandon, and Mike ??. Our pages with us this
morning are Caroline Schreiber, Catherine Schreiber, Michael ??, Alley
Parker, Ben Jones, Spencer Zachary, Noah McKay, Clay Harris, and Patrick
. . . How do you say your last name, Patrick? Sacky? All right at this
we'll move to the only item on the agenda today and that is House Bill
1181 and we have a PCS will be before us. Representative Dollar is
recognized to explain the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee and all of our guests
who are with us today. On behalf of the sponsors of House 1181 I am
pleased to present to the committee this morning, the North Carolina
Medicaid Moderation Act. Across this nation state after state has
struggled with managing their medicaid programs. States are challenged
to operate a federal health care entitlement program, especially in a
fee for service environment. North Carolina has had its challenges in
managing our program. But, a new day is dawning in North Carolina.
Systems are being modernized, budget have been trued up to address a
series of long standing problems, and payments systems across a range of
payers are rapidly and significantly changing in the healthcare
department. So, leaders are coming together across this nation, and here
in North Carolina. From government healthcare advocacy and together we
are going to chart a new course, this new course will end the
traditional fee for service payment system and establish the right
incentives for our healthcare delivery system to pay for value and not
simply volume. We want to move to a system the incentivizes better
healthcare outcomes for patients. We will not simply pay for quantity,
but what we will pay for is quality of outcomes. North Carolina has a
unique opportunity to build on the strengths and successes within our
current system at the patient level. Our state has tremendous
participation from our doctors, from our specialist, and other
providers. We have access to quality healthcare for our citizens that
many other states, frankly envy. We have a nationally award winning
initiative like community care of North Carolina. We have the deep
commitment of our hospitals, our family physicians, or dentists, our
clinics, specialist, therapist, nurses, and our long term care
facilities. We have already reformed our mental health system with our
public LM CMOs, who are working to ensure that our behavioral health
resources are properly managed with clients and families. Now is the
time, members of the committee, to take the next step in reform to
establish a doctor and patient driven system of care that will achieve
the following, and the following is in your bill, in the PCS. In section
one, it is the intent and the goal of the general assembly to provide
budget predictability, to slow the rate of cost grow to help bend that
health care cost curve, to achieve cost savings through efficient
reductions in programmatic costs, create more efficient administrative
structures, improve health outcomes for our medicaid population, and
require provider accountability for budget and program outcomes.</p>

?? and running. As they have moved along in the last three years, we
have passed two additional successive bills in support of their efforts
to address issues that we needed to address to help them along that
path. The key is the general assembly has stayed the course with those
LME-MCOs and, for that reason, I think they are showing success and that
they will be showing greater success and greater capability as we move
forward. The same is true for our commitment here to Medicaid reform on
the medical side. It is important that we make a commitment, we charter
direction, we move forward and we stay committed to that direction for
the long term in order to ensure the success that we want. One of the
things that we’re seeing out there in the private sector, as many of you
know, the number one payer for medical costs is Medicare. Medicare is
your top payer. The next payer in volume for your private insurance
companies, your third level payer in terms of volume, is Medicaid and
then the others come down from there. The other payers are moving and,
of course, as many of you know, Medicare is already moving in the
direction of accountable care organizations, which can be formed under
this structure and there are varieties of accountable care
organizations. We want to make sure that we’re moving in that, allow
ourselves to have reform that moves in that, same direction that moves
with the latest technology. It moves in that same direction so that our
providers can benefit from being able to, as they build their
ACOs--which many are already doing, well underway--and other ACO-like
organizations, that they can build those and we can help them with our
reform in Medicaid to go along with that. I think it will make it far
easier in the long run for payers, for their administration, and save
costs to the entire healthcare system. Section 10, I’ll move on. That’s
the final section. There was quite a bit of discussion in the health
committee with respect to section 10. What we have done here is to
establish an integrated care study. Rather than move to implementation
at this time, on a pilot level, we will study being able to put together
a pilot. We have a range of groups here that we want to be involved in
that and, of course, we want that to be coming back to the 2015 general
assembly for possible action based on the work that is done in
integrated care study. Mr. Chairman, with that well maybe brief or not
so brief, explanation of the bill I would be happy to answer any
questions. It’s my understanding that Representative Avila has an
amendment if you want to take that amendment first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. The amendment should have been passed out already so members
should have it so Representative Avila is recognized for her amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. What we’d like to do is to insert Benchmarks as
one of the named stakeholders in the discussion. They represent a broad
spectrum of providers and I would like to have them at the table for
discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on Representative Avila’s amendment? If
not, those in favor of Representative Avila’s amendment will say aye,
those opposed no. The ayes have it and the amendment is adopted.
Representative Brisson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just a comment, a brief comment, on section 10. On
behalf of the 86 rural counties in this great state and the County
Commissioner’s Association I’d like to say thank you for those changes
and for getting that study.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, this sounds like a pretty decent bill. Do we have anybody</p>

from the outside that really would like to speak to this bill. I’d like
to hear from some of these folks that are going to be involved, if you
don’t mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any group interested in addressing the proposed committee substitute at
this time step forward. Please state your name and who you’re with, for
the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. I’m Chip Baggett with the North Carolina Medical Society.
Many of you heard us express general support, but opposition to certain
pieces, of this bill in the House Health Committee and I want to tell
you today that we really appreciate the deliberation and the changes
that have gone into this proposed committee substitute. We are
supportive of Medicare reform. That is one of our top priorities. We are
supportive of taking care of the whole person in an integrated health
care that it’s a top priority for us. We think this bill, as it is
written now, addresses our concerns that we brought up last week. We
think it gives us a path to move forward in delivering not only great
patient outcomes to our patients, but delivering the cost savings and
the predictability that you’re looking for, so we are supportive of this
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. Cody Hand with the North Carolina Hospital Association.
Just want to thank you for considering this PCS. We, your North Carolina
hospitals, support this legislation. We think it’s a good step in the
right direction for Medicaid reform. We are, as Representative Dollar
said, doing this already with Medicare and we’ve already learned some
things with those accountable care organizations. We think that this
bill provides a mechanism for us to implement that in Medicaid and I
would say that, probably, we would achieve better cost savings because
we can do one integrated system instead of having to do multiple,
depending on our payer. This does address a nice glide path for us to
full-risk. It does address whole person care. I think it’s a very good
step in the right direction and I would thank you for that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Good morning. I’m Mary Hooper. I’m the executive director of
the NC Council of Community Programs. I represent the LME-MCOs in the
state. We would also like to extend our thanks to the members of the
general assembly for their work on behalf of the citizens of this state.
I would also like to note our appreciation, in particular, for the
recognition that the LME-MCOs are already capitated, they are managing
their Medicaid budgets, and we look very forward to our continued
efforts to work with our partners in this room on issues related to
integrated care. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like to just pick up on what the last
speaker said. I think one of the advantages to this version of the bill
is that we have our current physical health program in Medicaid is
really provider-driven, we call it. It doesn’t mean that the providers
do everything, but the providers are actively engaged in that program
and helping us save money through the CCNC networks and the medical home
model. The LME-MCOs have experience in capitated care which is what the
whole system is going to be going to. We don’t have a system currently
that is managed by the payer. Our mental health system is currently
managed by the payer. Our physical health program is more managed by the
providers and I think, as we study these two issues and learn from the
MCOs about how to do the capitated care and learn from the CCNC and our
physical health about how to work with provider-managed care, that
that’ll be a good integration. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tolson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for Representative Dollar. Was smart card considered as a way
of those that want to seek service and also the process of controlling
costs? Was that considered at all?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that that’s an issue that we need to continue to work on. I know
that Representative Burr and I, and I know you, have worked on it for a
number of years. That’s something that we’re going to continue to work
on. As you know, there’s a couple of different ways of doing that. No,
we have not given up on that yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, just to comment, and I agree. I know that we spent a lot of
time trying to develop that and I think it’s a good way to have a check
and balance on what you’re doing.</p>

Representative Farmer Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman. I wanted to echo some of the
things I have already have been said by representative Brisson and
representative Insko and say that I am truly proud and glad to be a part
of a committee in helping human services who looked at all the stake
holders had to say and consider all the inflict came out some good
legislation so I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Bumgardner
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I have a question for the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Dollar on page two your bill says that
it has a number 3 appear line for mechanisms to encourage personal
accountability and under that number four says strong performance
measures and matrix the whole providers accountable. Are we going to see
what those are before we vote on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well those need to be developed. Those are very complex
constructs at certainly, I am not qualified to deal into may be there
might be a couple of people in the room who can deal into those but
those need to be developed, they need to be developed with the stake
holders they need to make sense they need to be able to measure what it
is that we want to measure and I guess the short answer to your question
is those will be brought back by general assembly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman. The bill sponsor appreciate the
work thou done on this I am not expert in this area as many of you
probably can test I do have a lot of constituents very concerned to
Medicare Medicaid issues but ?? the days in here and just my concern
reading of this the ?? is a safe assumption that this is no impact on
the budget just we are doing for 14 15 is pre pretty safe assumption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Bryan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr chairman I' ll echo the sentiments that
everyone seems like great great work thou guys have done I do have a
question about the, on the first page the coming up with the plans by
20-20 in it talks about moving to fully capitated may be we don't have
any answer to this but I guess I just would be interested in getting
thoughts on how quickly we are actually moving to fully captivators that
are completely part of this process may be where are we with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]It will be part of the process as those provider with
organizations has all the parameters or put together as the matrix or
put together for measuring in the while it Weill take time in order for
those to come up there some who will be ready to to come forward and be
prepared to take significant risk fairly quickly there is others that
will take some time to be able to get there in order to be appropriately
capitalized in the light and we do have some provider examples people
talk about ?? there are others that provider lead physician lead ACOs
there are already hospital lead ACOs there are developed and are
developing around the state now and couple of variance of those in some
different hospitals systems there are already under why the
transformation much of the transformation is already under way. In the
health care system and we have a unique opportunity to be party of that
and help drive and lead that in our state and I would simply say just no
one other know, the secretary, secretary Vash Dr ?? of DMA as well as
the governor will be down that the Wilmington health ACO today as a
matter of fact. So these are the things that are out there moving
forward.
Representative Mitchell.</p>

<p id="25:00">
Mr. Chairman, it seems as though we’ve sort of reached the consensus
somewhere along the line in trying to get something done with the
program that has caused us a great deal of consternation over the years.
And I just hope that everybody in this body can be on board to accept
the program, will look into it and will give it some meaning and some
depth. We need it desperately. At the time I was in the situation that
Representative Dollar’s in, we were looking at 4 to 500 million dollars
a year in cost overruns. We were at least able to identify during that
period of time those cost overruns that we had. Mr. Chairman, I don’t
like beating a dead horse to death anyway. If you are amenable to it, I
would like to make a motion on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move Mr. Chairman, that House,
that the proposed Committee Substitute for House Bill 1181 be given a
favorable report. You need a serial referral on it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No
sir, it’s, we’re going to, I’ve got two more questions Representative
Michaux, ?? and I’ll come right back to your motion if that’s okay.
Representative Riddell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Dollar, one of my concerns as we’ve talked about Medicaid
reform has been for the smaller practices. And what do you see happening
to them with this framework that’s put in place? Will they still be able
to remain independent and provide Medicaid services or will they have to
be swallowed into something larger? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the
smaller ones may still be able to be independent. That is not prohibited
in here. Although what I really think will happen, frankly, is that a
number of those smaller ones and I know who you’re talking about, will
probably want to be part of an ACO that they control, that they control
part of, and that they partner with. And I think what you’re going to
see in the healthcare arena is on partnerships springing up all over the
place. And we’ve already seen a good deal of that already. We heard of
another strategic partnership this week between a couple of medical
centers. We’re seeing that almost on a monthly basis and I think you’ll
see more of that, and this will actually have an opportunity for some of
the smaller practices who want to be part of that and help control their
own destiny in that as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, this is a follow up, but in a
different perspective. On page 3, section 10, is there any way to
consider, I don’t know how to word it, the minority provider
participation meaning a lot of minority doctors provide these kinds of
services and can they be included as part of that study? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well they are already included. I mean many of the individuals
that I know and that I’ve met, and I can rattle off some names for you
but my mind is kind of going blank on that, but are involved in all of
these organizations. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. I want to commend you all for the hard work you’ve
all done on this and it looks like a very good plan. But I have just one
more question on the first page where it says the plan begins with
limited risk and I know this is a fluid situation but could you
elaborate on that limited risk? What exactly does that mean? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Limited risk, there are a number of ways to put that together
but that’s limited risk between the state and the providers. Right now,
the state basically has all of the risk in medical. So it’s shifting the
risk to the providers. The providers are actually going to take on what
you see there in that subsection B, providers will be taking on the full
risk. That’s capitation. And so we know that in order to do that we need
to have, there’ll have to be a glide path developed. Some people will be
able to go on a fairly quick ramp up on that. Others may take some
amount of time. We want to be able to provide for that window of time to
assume greater risk in a very logical way as we move it to the
providers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that going
to be done like on a percentage?</p>

<p id="30:00">
Base, is it, percentage base, does it start out with a certain
percentage and then it grows over the years, or how, what’s that going
to look like? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be a logical way to do it,
and that we’ve seen models that do it in that way. That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cunningham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chair. My question is, how many other states have already moved
to this model? And do we have some kind of way to look at a comparison
analysis as we move forward with our model? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, some
states are doing other things. I wouldn’t be able to give you all of the
details of what each state is doing these days, but we’ve seen reforms
for example up in Oregon. There are other states that are looking at
varieties of reforms, based on where their states currently are. Because
a number of states are in different situations. We have I think a very
unique opportunity that we have is extensive a medical home model
already in place, as anyone. I think on the ?? health side with the
expansion of the 1915B&amp;C waiver, I think we’re maybe the only state
that has moved in that direction. And other states are looking at us,
seeing what we are doing in that regard. In terms of ACOs, the ACOs are,
you’re seeing those in Medicare moving forward all over the country.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative
Dollar, thank you. I appreciate the legislation as well as the model
that CCNC has brought to North Carolina and are very, very glad to see
that they are still intact, and we will be moving forward with the ACO
model. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate on the
bill. If not, Representative Michaux moves to give an unfavorable report
to the House Bill, to House Bill 1181, the second edition and a
favorable report to the Committee Substitute for House Bill 1181 as
amended. I believe that’s what I heard you say a while ago,
Representative Michaux. So at this time, you’ve heard the motion. Those
in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those
opposed will say no. The ayes have it and the bill’s passed. At this
time, the committee stands adjourned. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
members of the committee.</p>
