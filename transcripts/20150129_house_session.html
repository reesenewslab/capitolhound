  The House will come to order, members will take their seats, visitors
will retire from the chamber. The Sergeant at Arms will close the doors,
members and visitors will please silence all electronic devices. The
prayer today will be offered by Representative Steinburg. Members and
visitors in the gallery are asked to please stand and also to remain
standing for the pledge of allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. Let us pray.
We pause to acknowledge Thee, our Father, before we undertake the
important duties to be considered. Great responsibilities rest upon the
members of this body. We present no merit, but plead the merits of Thy
son, our Redeemer, and ask for divine wisdom and guidance that all our
tasks may begin, continue, and end in Thee. Safeguard the families of
our members while they are separated one from another. May anyone who is
sick be restored to health, any who are bereaved be comforted, and any
who are exposed to temptation to do wrong be delivered from evil. We are
thankful for friends that believe in us and trust us and encircle in
their protecting love. Help us ever to be worthy of trust and love. Give
all the success we can bear, and still be humble, unselfish, and
faithful. Spread the knowledge of Thy word and make Thy church the
instrument of diffusing and upholding true religion, until Thy kingdom
shall come, and Thy will shall be done, on earth as it is in Heaven
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to
the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If I could get, possibly, the attention
of our members for a moment. [gavel bangs] A little girl hidden away in
a Dutch attic more than 70 years ago was inspired by the words and deeds
of one man. Although she did not live to see her 16th birthday, her
life, the strength of this little girl, has come to itself stand as an
example and a tribute to the indomitable spirit of mankind. As she faced
a daily routine of boredom and fear, she wrote in her diary quote,
&quot;I must mention one shining exception, a speech by our beloved
Winston Churchill is quite perfect.&quot; This passage is taken from the
Diary of Anne Frank. This past Saturday in Forton, MO, I had the great
pleasure and high honor to attend ceremonies honoring 50 years since the
death of Sir. Winston S. Churchill, along with the Ambassador from the
UK, the Governor of Missouri, members of the Churchill family and
others, we paid tribute to this great man and his legacy, 50 years ago
this past Saturday. Tomorrow, it&#39;ll be 50 years since his funeral,
the largest state funeral since Wellington. An incredible, incredible
event. John Lucas in his book, The Last European War, wrote that there
was one word that the people of Europe, conquered by the Nazis, would
whisper from one to another to raise their morale and express their
desire for freedom and the hope of

  That one word was Churcha. So in commemoration of the passing of one of
the giants of all time, I&#39;m going to quote his own words. Churcha
once said, &quot;The only shield to his memory is the rectitude and
sincerity of his actions. It is very imprudent to walk through life
without this shield because we are so often mocked by the failure of our
hopes and the upsetting of our calculations, but with this shield,
however the fates may play, we march always in the ranks of honor.&quot;
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that opportunity to commemorate the life and
the passing of a giant. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further notices and
announcements? If not, the gentleman from Harnett, hold just a moment,
