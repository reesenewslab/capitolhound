<p id="00:00">
Good afternoon, we'll go ahead and get started. Sergeant at arms helping
with the committee today as young ??, Bill Morris, Warren Hawkins and
Gage Powell. Thank you gentlemen for your help. We have one bill before
the committee, it's House Bill 1181. There's a PCS without objection.
The PCS is before us. Representative Dollar will present the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
We have had a very long and storied road moving to this point today and
today hopefully with the indulgence of this committee we will move past
another milestone in the reform of North Carolina's Medicaid program.
And what we hope to see in North Carolina is a model program for the
entire nation. North Carolina has had challenges with its Medicaid
program in recent years owing to a variety of factors, but what's often
missed, I think it's looked over is that North Carolina has had
tremendous strengths in its Medicaid program as well, North Carolina has
one of the best records with respect to access and participation by
physicians. It is a program that is strongly supported by hospitals, by
specialties. North Carolina's program does offer a number of optional
services along with some optional groups that are covered and I think
that that lends itself to a state that has operated a very
compassionate, a very forward thinking Medicaid program where care
actually meets the patient and where services meet those who are very
much in need. So with that, Mr. Chairman, we're also looking to the
future as everyone knows in the United States we have issues with rising
healthcare costs and we have all been struggling across the country to
deal with that. We are also dealing, of course, in an era with the
Affordable Care Act and the changes that that is bringing to our
healthcare system. But be not mistaken, everyone I believe is committed
and understands the importance of bending the healthcare cost curve, and
North Carolina I believe wants to be in the forefront of doing that,
doing our part to help bend that cost curve while we work to improve
quality of care as well. Mr. Chairman I would like to just take a brief
moment of privilege to thank Secretary Voss who is here. Thank you Madam
Secretary for being here. The Secretary helped lead with her team an
advisory group that contained a member from the House, myself, a member
from the Senate, Senator Pate, and three public members that spent the
earlier part of this year working on a proposal, a plan, and that was
introduced in the original bill. We believe that this Proposed Committee
Substitute today sets up a framework that works very well with most and
certainly all of the major provisions that were being contemplated in
the plan as it was proposed by the administration secretary and the
governor. To get to that plan, if you will look at section 1 sets out
the intent and goals, and of course what we are looking to do is to move
away from fee for service to provide greater budget predictability, to
slow the rate of cost growth, achieve cost savings through greater
efficiencies in our program, create a more efficient administrative
structure and of course improve health outcomes for our Medicaid
population and require provider accountability for budget and program</p>

... outcomes, so that is to say both from budgetary standpoint as well
as the actual outcomes for patients, and I might add that this is
happening in the context, and I started to speak on this a moment ago,
but let me just say an additional word; if you look at the proposal as
it came from the administration, they had accountable care organizations
as a backbone component. This plan allows for the continued development
of accountable care organizations in the state of North Carolina. Those
are already underway, as many of you know, with our Medicare program.
Medicare is reforming. That’s probably the single largest payer of
healthcare in the country. The second largest set of payers in the
country are private insurance. Private insurance is reforming as well,
and the third largest payer in healthcare is Medicaid, which involves us
here in the General Assembly as a partner with the federal government.
We are now moving toward greater reform as well. Section 2 provides the
building blocks. We do want to build on our primary care medical home
model. This is a model that a number of other states have been looking
at and trying to find ways to work it into their programs all across the
country. It is a model that has received numerous awards. Senator Burr
conferred an award I think, a national award, earlier this year. It’s a
system that I think the most important part of it is it engages our
primary care physicians, and that is so critical and important to have
primary care physicians linked up with our patients. That’s where you
have the best outcome, and I certainly can say that from a personal
perspective as well. Item 2 under section 2 is where we have
provider-lead – these can be physician provider, specialty provider,
hospital provider – provider-lead capitated health plans to manage and
coordinate the care of a majority of our Medicaid population by 2020. So
we are starting down… We know this transition will take time to make
sure that we do it right, to get it done right, and providing this
five-year period of time as we move toward 2020 we believe is the
appropriate amount of time to ensure that we get there. As we’re moving
along, the plan shall begin with limited risk but shall assume greater
amounts of risk over time, up to and including full capitation. Another
way you can say “full capitation” is “a global budget cap”, so this is a
substantial move and a substantial commitment on behalf of providers to
be able to say that giving them the opportunity to move away from
fee-for-service, to get the incentives right in the system, and to be
able to be a partner with the state in saving money in the Medicaid
system. You see the additional provisions there with respect to the
building blocks. The plan coverage areas, the regions as it might be,
would be based on the Community Care of North Carolina. I think they
currently have 14 regions. That is something that will need to be looked
at with the department and with CCNC to ensure that the number of
regions is adjusted appropriately and the disposition of those regions
are adjusted appropriately based on the needs of the Medicaid population
itself. Section 3 discusses the department’s role – the state’s role, as
it were, and the department as the lead agency. Section 4 talks about
what the General Assembly will be expecting in the detailed plan as we
move forward. We’re moving… We set forward the goals and the basic
structure…</p>

-sure in this bill, an department will put together, working with all of
the stakeholders the implementation plans, and how we answer all of the
myriad of questions that have to be answered, and in an extremely
detailed and complex industries, or really sets of industries, sets of
situations. This bill also provides in here, obviously a phase-in for
these provisions, if we go on to section five we talk about moving
forward with some reporting times, further in here we have the
opportunity, of course, for the department to- in section eight- to
develop various waivers and spas, including potential 11-15 waivers,
other state plan ammendments is maybe the department and providers
making necessary to implement a plan. We put forward in section nine
something I think is very important and this is as much a reminder to
ourselves as much to anyone, and that is the general assembly needs to
stay committed to the process long enough for it to be successful.
There's some areas of the budget, some areas of state policy that are
very important, but frankly if you get them wrong, you can always come
back the next year and fix them. You can make adjustments, and you can
easily correct the course, and we have had to do that from time to time.
Medicaid, I would argue, is quite a bit different. You want to make sure
that you have the ship, the institution's turned in the correct
direction and you want to make sure they are going in the correct
direction, because if you go off on the wrong direction sometimes it can
take you years and millions and millions of dollars to get yourself back
on course. So, it is important I believe, for the general assembly to
maintain its commitment to this medicaid transformation processes as we
move forward.
Section ten involves the [??] MCOs, as you are aware, behavioral health,
you have medical health, you have behavioral health, that are two big
groupings  although there are a number of patients and clients that move
between behavioral health and medical health. The local management
entitities  MCOs, these are publicly controlled, public managed care
organizations that this general assembly established in 2011, based on
an expansion of the PBH, Piedmont Behavioral Health pilot that had run,
at that time I believe five or six years.
This general assembly made a commitment in 2011 to expand what was
called a 19 15 &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; waivers statewide. The
state did that. Since that time, we passed major legislation in 2012,
and major legislation in 2013 to help facilitate and further that
transition, to make that transition successful and those public
organizations who deal with behavioral health, mental health,
intellectually and developmentally disabled, and substance abuse
successful. In doing so, this general assembly has had a strong
commitment. Again, what I think is imporant is you keep the commitment
going. You stay with the plan and allow it to work out the issues that
have to be worked out. I think that this general assembly is to be
commended for its working with and staying with and continuing to help
partner with the [??] MCOs to make them successful. I say that as just
sort of a bit of a background to section ten. Section ten is actually a
limited section, which involves the 19 15 &quot;c&quot; waiver, the
innovation waiver, and this involves individuals who are intellectually-

… and developmentally disabled, and so if you’re looking statewide, and
there’s probably some people in this room that can give me maybe closer
to the exact figure, but I believe it’s roughly 12 to 14 thousand out of
the 1.6 million give or take Medicaid population that fall into this
category of intellectually and developmentally disabled, and what we are
saying in this demonstration pilot is to give an opportunity – and at
the present time I believe Cardinal Innovations would be the one LME-MCO
that would qualify under these provisions – an opportunity with their
roughly four thousand or so IDDD population  to manage to have their
behavioral health come and to manage their full care for those
individuals, and we believe it’s important to take a look at this, to
see what capabilities of the LME-NCOs would be with this very limited,
very narrow and specialized population. This pilot will obviously take a
year or so to get up, and it will take probably another couple years
just to see how it operates, and we will learn from that and take those
lessons, and future General Assemblies will be able to evaluate that
information and to see how that works for those populations. This plan
is open in many respects. Occasionally you get questions about insurance
companies. We in this state have a strong history of provider-driven
reform. We’ve got tremendous providers in our state. This allows those
providers… while telling them that we have to move to capitation, it is
allowing them to help lead the way to get to where we need to be as far
as the General Assembly’s core interests are. Insurance companies will
be able to partner with these provider-lead organizations if those
provider-lead organizations so wish to employ their services. There’s
nothing that would in any way prohibit that from happening. We want to
be able to have a system that has a degree of diversity to it to meet
the varying needs of our state, but that covers the entire state as well
and meets the goals and objectives. And Mr. Chairman, I apologize for
speaking so long, but I’m trying to delve into Medicaid reform, as all
of us know, as Representative Burr and Representative Avila and
Representative Lambeth know, prime sponsors on this as well, it is a
difficult and deep subject. No one knows all of it. We’re always
learning and we’re always trying to improve, and Mr. Chairman, I would
be happy to answer any questions members might have, or if you want to
take comments from the public, it’s your direction. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Dollar. To the guests in the gallery who are
standing, if you would like to take a chair in that third row there,
you’re welcome to do so. May be a little more comfortable. Any questions
or comments from members of the committee? Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, and thank you Representative
Dollar for going through that because this is not one of my areas of
expertise. I can explain gravel to you, but not Medicaid. But on section
10, I do know as a former Mecklenburg County commissioner that that
whole changeover to Cardinal was really hotly contested, very complex;
only happened what I think was relatively recently. What confidence do
you have that they are stabilized enough yet to take on what you
yourself described as a sort of unique, complicated set of patients? I
was originally going to ask you how many qualified, and you answered
that question when you said Cardinal, but I’ll admit it makes me a
little nervous to… Just give me some comfort level that they’re ready to
take…</p>

<p id="20:00">
?? After all the conflict and stuff that's been going on. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well I would say that the situation with Mecklink really has to
do with Mecklink. It didn't have anything to do with Cardinal or their
capabilities. You know it's a whole long story, but the LMEMCR that did
not make it in that case was Mecklink. It wasn't the Cardinal
organization. So let's say those challenges are not related. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. While from an organizational standpoint, they were
two separate organizations. The patients and the providers are still the
ones that got moved or caught up. I'm still not even sure I understand
exactly what happened.  But, the ones who were under Mecklink are now
under Cardinal. And my understanding from some providers in my district,
has been there's still some awkwardness. There's still some, it isn't a
smooth process yet on all of those issues. So, just so while though, you
clarify. Those are two different operations. Help me have confidence
that that whole Mecklandburg piece of it has settled down enough that
they're ready to take on those patients and do something new and
complicated. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well it's our view that they that they
are. And this is this is a population with the intellectually and
developmentally disabled, this is a population that in some of these
individuals are in are currently in facilities as well. It's a
population that is very well known to LMEMCO's. They've been dealing
with this population since they were area authorities. I mean you go all
the way back. So it's not, it's not really a group as some additional
responsibility with regard to those particular individuals. But it is a,
is a group of clients and families with which the LMEMCO would be very
very familiar with all of their details. And another thing that I would
mention too is, this is not something where the bill passes and somebody
flips a switch. You have to have approval. There's development that has
to be done. There are agreements that have to be reached with other
providers. There's approvals that have to be obtained through centers
for Medicaid and Medicare services. So, it will be a very thorough
process before a demonstration of this nature would actually be up and
operational. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One last follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] On that the date question, alright it says
on page 3 line 39 that it should be up and going well enough that
they've got some sort of report a year and a half from now, if I'm
counting right. A year and a half from now is it possible to consider
bumping that out a little later and giving them time to make sure that
it's gonna work? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well that report would report to the
over-site committee about where they are at that time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well let me re-state my question then. Is it possible to bump out the
start date to give them time to make sure they're ready to do this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wouldn't see a particular need in that at this time.
But we can certainly, we can certainly take a look at that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] President Farmer-Butterfield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I
know you have the list of people in the order that they are, that they
raised their hands. I'm wondering if you have, if they are not going
speak on this issue that Representative Samuelson raised if could have a
conversation about that one topic. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, that that's
fine. I have no way of knowing what topic is on each member's mind. Did
you want to address what she was saying? If Representative
Farmer-Butterfield will yield to you that's fine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
was going to speak on that topic. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Representative
Farmer-Butterfield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A couple of other questions, but
that particular topic, and my question was, number 1, I was glad to see
that in the Section T in Number 3 you have people not only in CFMR but
also in other residential settings in their homes that will participate
correct? With IDD. On the pilot I was wondering was there any other.</p>

MCO, LNE, qualified besides copy. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Under this language,
that would not be the case at this time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did you give consideration to others, maybe in the
east. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I think we want to move into this water.
Maybe once they qualify, I believe, under the language, that is
something that could be considered. I think the feeling is to move into
the water very carefully, very gradually. When we first set up PBH as a
pilot as you recall, that was just one entity and one set of
circumstances and I think that we want to have just as much care as we
move in with this population as well, very small population. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Do you have a follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] On that topic, no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Representative Blackwell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman, although I'm going to change the subject. If you want
to go to Representative Insko I'll yield my place. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Insko. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I really want to make sure I understand exactly what's going
to happen. so now we have the cardinal innovations in LNE/MCO that
manages the money, doesn't deliver any services, they contract with
providers. The IDD population has been a contracted service for many,
many years, even under the area programs. The area programs contracted
out almost all their IDD services to private sector providers, so this
issue now as I understand it is to integrate the physical health
services with the behavioral health services. Am I right about that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. And there's been efforts already underway in a
variety of ways between all of the LNE/MCOs and Community Care of North
Carolina to do more of that, and we need to do more of that across the
board. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So the difference would be, so even now, so the
LNE/MCO's they are in some kind of cooperative relationship with CCNC
where they, do currently any of the LNE/MCO's actually pay private
sector providers Medicaid money for providing physical health? Or the
physical health services are all fee for service still under Medicaid?
For the intellectually/developmentally disabled people, say they live in
a group home and they break their arm, they don't go to the LNE/MCO for
that, they go to a private sector physical health. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, that's where the LNE/MCOs would have to work with providers in the
medical community and establish the appropriate contractual
relationships to address those issues. So you have partners, really
partnerships now between providers and the LNE/MCOs would have to reach
out to the medical community and partner in the same way, and of course
we would just be talking about those services that would be paid for by
Medicaid. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Right, but. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, follow up, sorry. Thank you. So it would be, so
now the difference would be that the LNE/MCOs would actually contract
with a private sector provider rather than working through CCNC?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I think they could worth through CCNC, it's not
restrictive in that regard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But they would have all of
the IDD population for both physical and, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It's all right. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Then would have the LNE/MCO,
they would have the IDD population for both physical health and
behavioral health? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. I asked for recognition because I had two, what I
believe are related questions, but I'll slip in a comment on the topic
that has been discussed by the last three speakers. I'm delighted with
section 10. I think for too long we've had this artificial division of
physical and mental healthcare services.</p>

.... then they need to be under one umbrella and I'm glad we're at least
going to pilot it. My questions however, are these, and I think I
understand that there's perhaps not a precise answer but I'm hoping that
you, or maybe since Secretary Wos is here, can give me at least a ball
park answer. How many plans do you anticipate will be available across
the state?
That's part one of my question or question one and secondly, within a
given area, let's say we're talking about my county of Burke [??], what
do you all anticipate in terms of the number of plans from which a
Medicaid beneficiary in my district would be able to choose? Are they
going to have only one plan or are they going to be potentially multiple
plan? What do you all anticipate in terms beneficiary choice of plans
and the number of plans that may be available?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I couldn't predict for your particular area. I
think in the urban areas you would, no doubt, have multiple plans. In
rural areas you may only have one plan, in a rural area but there would
be nothing that would be prohibitive to having more than one plan. We
would certainly, you always like having more than one plan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, [??]. If these are going to be provider-led
plans, if there were a provider group that met whatever requirements or
standards that the department comes up with they would e able to
organize and offer a plan within one of these, I guess, 14 regions based
on the CCNC regional model? Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right. It may not be 14. That's a number that can
potentially change as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I actually have another question on this
same issue. As I understand it, this is the IDD population again so as I
understand it CCNC has been discussing taking over the aged, blind and
disabled population which makes me ask the question of whether or not
there will be some CCNCs that will be, would it be possible for a CCNC
to, in their management of the aged, blind and disabled, to take on more
responsibility for the IDD population across the state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For CCNC to take on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Aren't they reaching more ABD, aged, blind and
disabled population? Is that only physical disabilities? It doesn't
reach into IDD population?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well they, I can't speak for CCNC but they are
currently working on, I believe a dual eligible program. There's
language in the budget on a dual eligibles program. There's language in
the budget on a dual eligibles program and those, when you say dual
eligible that means Medicaid, Medicare, and those individuals are aged,
blind and disabled. Those are the individuals who are the most expensive
individuals in the system so there are efforts well underway and we hope
more efforts working with the Department to better manage that care. All
of this is moving toward stronger ability to integrate the services,
integrate the care.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could I just make a brief statement? I'll try to keep
this short but I think, to me that is the question, that as we,
historically we've had really physical health care, we've had behavioral
health care and there really hasn't been much overlap and we've talked a
lot about integrating care so that people, I mean mental illness is not
a disease of the spirit. It's a disease of the brain. It is a physical
illness so how do we integrate these two separate systems that have
grown up so that we have a more integrated care?
Where I thought we were was that the MCO, LEMCOs [sp], if a person had,
if a mental illness or developmental disability was their main
condition, that the MCOs would manage it ....</p>

<p id="35:00">
If it was a physical health, CCNC would manage it, so I guess I'm trying
to struggle to see how we move beyond that, where we are right now. But
I'm just listening. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I would make just a couple
quick observations. One, in the original language establishing the
LMENCOs, CCNC was part of that language, part of that coordination. The
LMENCOs as they have been coming up and getting organized and making
their transition from the LMEs to LMENCOs which was tremendous
transition that has been going on and it's not fully as someone
mentioned, it's not fully arrived at, at this point. They have been
reaching out to CCNC and there's a lot that's going on at the local
level, at the patient care level already, that just doesn't get seen by
it seems like those of us here in Raleigh. That is the effort that
everybody understands, everybody that I've talked to, whether it's
medical health, behavioral health agrees on, and everybody I think is
working toward those goals. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Breisin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Request the Senate ?? the
amendment forth to the [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Sergeant at arms, would

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm curious why would you want to include only the
people in the ICFMR facilities and not others with intellectual
developmental disabilities. Is there a particular reason? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For this afternoon, it makes a lot of providers happy in here.
[LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
What about the people that need the services? [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is
not going to have anything to with services. I mean, you're still going
to receive the services. This is just about the pilot program. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So the pilot would only include people with placements in ICFMR
facilities and not other people with intellectual development
disabilities in the community? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar
can probably better answer that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Staff wants to comment on that. Miss Johnson? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Yes, the language the only recipients would follow for all
the folks in 3. So it does still include the individuals who reside in
private intermediate care facilities, as well as the rest of the folks
who are eligible for the 1915C so it doesn't change the population.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just
going to say that's the way I read it too. It doesn't really change the
population that we're going to serve. It would still be anybody who's
eligible for the innovations waiver and people who are in ICFMR
facilities. And that's the local ICFMRs, it doesn't include anybody in
the B waiver for example. Excuse me. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other
questions or comments on the amendment? All those in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those opposed? The ayes have
it. The amendment passes. Any other questions on the bill? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jackson. [SPEAKER

subject to approval? I see the feds, do they have to approve before we
can start that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr.

Following upon Representative Samuelson’s question about whether or not
we need to push this out further.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, the histories any judge of that it would be sometime.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One follow up, have there been any discussions with the Federal
Government about this potential type of change to see how they might
feel about this or how they ruled in other states, is other states try?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t know if somebody else may know the answer of that question but
it would be I would think subject to be in corrected that this type
would require lots and lots of paperwork, lots and lots of documentation
and questions being answered. So, others might be able to better predict
CMS than I can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ____[01:02].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Answering your questions first of all the in
terms of goals portion of the bill mentioned the six goals that is not
mentioned the goals that were indicated from advisory group goals
including the whole person goal and I assume that’s the purpose of the
bill in general perhaps I just wanna know why that didn’t mentioned in,
the second part of my comments is a question involving the permissive
nature or impressive nature of this bill for ACOs to develop which would
lead the broader LIT plans into a possibility being capitates
contracting I can’t see that can happen but otherwise because you have
information to begin to provide a LIT plan, I question what is a
provider LIT plan is to finding this bill because it doesn’t define that
and  my question is does that include the several accounting
organizations that are now in the kind of care consortiums growing up
around the state and the ones that blend medicate Medicare, commercial
care patients and their care overall which is a much more efficient way
of caring them out and that’s what the insurance companies share their
demographic, the disease prevalence data with the people actually
involved in the risk exposure. So, House Bill providers as well as the
insurance companies all get into same vertically integrated ACO model,
is that in anyway not permitted by the structure that you are
contemplating here or does it encourage them in anyway because I don’t
really see that fletched out here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I couldn’t answer for any specific plan without analyzing the
details of that plan but the ones that I’m familiar with in the state
are provider lit. So, that’s what we were looking at is provider lit, I
think the providers in the state have done an exceptional job I mean if
you look at, and you can look at today at the claims numbers, the claims
span that the challenges we have had in medicate really haven’t been
with claims per say, our providers have been doing an outstanding job
and have been point out the family physicians for example, the general
practitioners, the participation rate in North Carolina far exceeds some
of the other states that are out there. So, folks are participating and
engaged in the plan and I think the year of the advisory group that
studied this in great detail was that provider lit plans where they way
to go and if those ACOs as they develop want to contract with insurance
companies to help with their operations, help with their development
they will certainly be free to do that. The department and working
through the details of the plan will be developing and going through all
of the need of questions that is really impossible for the General
Assembly to sit here and answering. It’s like a 400, 500 page bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman any follow up? I’m just making observation that when you
are doing ___[04:43] building a structure which was a complicated matter
dealing all the providers to move the bill in one box.  Getting the
___[04:53], the disease problems and the claims ___ forward how to
handle it and going forward particularly as you are moving from that
transitioning to an ACO…

From a ?? model to a capitated model. It’s really be more ethically and
fiscally desirable to have all patients treated in the same manner.
Essentially using the ?? claims data and there may be a difference
obviously in how they stratify obviously with moving from medium and low
to medium to high risk patients as they all do eventually as you age.
But Medicare, shared subsidy plan, all these things come to plate the
same kind of structure but having  Medicare and Medicaid and commercial
essentially all treated under the same general ethical and fiscal
concept is ?? a much more desirable way to go and I hope that’s where
this is headed. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I want to go back to the very
popular section 10 and clarify date issue. As I understand it what we’re
saying is that they will report on the ?? been a problem getting
started. And then we’re going to have periodic status reports as the
pilot comes together and is finalized and put into operation. Am I
reading that correctly? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Farmer-Butterfield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chair. I have a couple of questions. One is I understand there’s a group
already in existence that’s working on medical home health and health
initiatives for people with intellectual development disabilities. Will
they be looked at in terms of bringing stakeholders to the table?
Because I know there’s a lot of work that’s being done in that area
already. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not familiar with that particular group
but would check into that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll get you some
information on it, okay? And my last question. This is along
Representative Jackson’s comments earlier.  And I was wondering if the
bill’s sponsors and the secretary thought it would be necessary to put
in some type of catch-all statement about CMS approvals, if that is
indeed necessary during the course of implementing this. What do you
think? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That part is covered under section 8. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Insko. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I think the original bill was 10 pages, and this is 3 pages.
So this is more conceptual than detailed and I guess I have some
concerns about that. About getting from these broad statements to steps
and a process that can actually be tracked and the reason I’m saying
that is because of our experience with mental health reform. When a lot
of it was in more conceptual and narrative form rather than more goals
and deadlines. And so I’m wondering how, what we would see as an example
from the first report that comes from the department. Would we see more
detail, or how do you anticipate that, working through? So when you, you
were here when we ran into problems and we didn’t really have a stop
loss way of saying let’s stop and see where we are. And it’s inevitable
that things are going to happen that you don’t anticipate. So I’m
curious about just how we will move from this more global conceptual to
more implementing actual on the ground. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Insko, I think what we’re doing here is we’re setting out the goals.
We’re setting out what we want the system to look like July 1 of 2020.
All of the details, they myriad of details to get there, I think it
would almost be impossible to write that bill. I think the General
Assembly is setting out the direction. Input has come in, most
particularly the recommendations from the administration after their
study. What we’re really wanting the department to do, in working with
providers, is to bring back the details of the plans. Get deep into the
weeds that you have to get into, and send the appropriate signal to the</p>

[0:00:00.0]
Providers and this gets back a little bit to Dr. ___[00:03] question and
that is we already have ACOs in Medicare of an operational they are more
coming online, we have physician LIT, ACO cornerstone is when the people
talk quite a bit about in the central part of the state that is doing a
fantastic job with what they are doing, there are several hospital
systems that are on the way, there are couple of different ways, there
are two or three different ways in which I’m not expert enough to
explain for how you do an ACO for example? There is care integrated
networks in, there is all sorts of acronyms there. So, what the General
Assembly needs to do is to setup what it is we want? What we want to see
how the system and empower the department and empower providers to give
us the details of the plan and what will need to be taken up with the
Federal Government and Federal Partners? And off course as you know, if
we move toward a large 1150 way where there is a variety of questions
that would have to be answered some of those or anticipate in this
legislation but the ___[01:23] would be have __ involved as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ___[01:28].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, if I could I would like to make a brief
statement. I think one of the things that is scary is this spending
quite sometime since we have seen direction of this complicated
translated on three pages of paper. However, I do think there is a
difference on the way it was done the first time, first time it was done
and then loose and there wasn’t sufficient collaboration and oversight
and involvement with the General Assembly and I don’t think that’s gonna
be the case here simply because we have got history to take into
account. What we have been doing in the past is to drill around hole and
then ask all those square pits and ___[02:17] and triangular pits to fit
the ___. That never works because they all are under different
circumstances and have different ways of going about things and this is
why the approach here has been one that I have whole heartedly
supported, the people on the ground know what works and when they get
together to talk they can figure out where the pieces need to be
reshaped and fitted and everything because everybody is working towards
the same goal with their own resources, their own experience and their
own abilities. So, I don’t think it should be scary to anybody simply
because it’s not very prescribed but it’s gonna be something where and
if it’s gonna have to be kept to the far because it does have the
potential for being a disaster if we don’t but I think with people
involved, the concerns that they have and the dedication that they have
got to their area in this medical healthcare facility if we get them all
to the table and understand that everybody has to contribute and when we
won’t listen to everybody’s concerns and nobody will be excluded maybe
because we don’t wanna hear what they have to say or they are not
fitting into the plan, I think we can come up with a phenomenal plan
that could really put North Carolina on the map as far as healthcare.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Wilson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman this is an appropriate time for motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ___[03:56]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I just have one question and sitting here listening. The
providers that we have been using NC tracks will they still be using
that for this system to well it be a different thing, the billings?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that probably be a question that will need to be answered, I
think that’s kind of depending on, if you move toward one sort of
captivate system that may handle that differently than it’s currently
being handled when it moves out from the long term as is probably
actually no I mean because we knew that to a true capitation then you
are receiving a block of money and you are working that block of money
with your patients.

Okay. Would anyone, any visitors in the audience out there like to speak
on this matter? Step up to the microphone, identify yourself for the
record, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm Chip Baggett, I'm director of Legislative
Relations with the North Carolina Medical Society and we just want to
take this opportunity, on behalf of the largest physician organization
in the state, to thank you for the work that you've done on this.  We
think that Medicaid reform is one of our top priority issues for our
members and it affects how we interact with our patients greatly so
we've been paying close attention to it. As Representative Dollar
pointed out, hundreds of people have come together to make
recommendations that the Governor has formulated and recommended a
Medicaid reform plan to this group that we think is tailored to meet the
needs of North Carolina. We think that the plan is one that our society
has enthusiastically supported and we believe that the budget adopted by
this House has encouraged and adopted that plan's direction. We applaud
you for that budget and we thank you for considering our concerns during
the deliberation that you had during that debate. The bill that you're
considering today is one that we generally support, while we still have
significant concerns about moving to full capitation. This plan sets a
glide path for physicians and other providers to systematically
transition to a new system of care delivery and gives us the time to
make something like that work. We think that there are strong reasons to
let the department have the opportunity to work with providers to figure
this out along the way and we appreciate the considerations that
Representative Dollar pointed out, especially in section 9, that
express the commitment of this body to allowing for that time to work.
However, we do have serious concerns about the inclusion of section 10.
We believe, in our opinion, that it is inconsistent with the Governor's
proposal and oppose that section at this time. We look forward to
continuing to work with this body to figure out what to do next with
Medicaid reform but we would like to support this bill without section
10 included. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good Afternoon. My name Julia Adams, I am the Assistant Director of
Government Relations for The Arc of North Carolina. I am also the
lobbyist for the North Carolina Association of Rehabilitation Facilities
and the lobbyist for Mark Inc. In total I represent three major
organizations that go through the mountains to the oceans. I represent
people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. I'd like to
make a few comments. The first comment is I would like to extend a deep
thank you to all of your work on the Health and Human Services budget
over this session. You have presented us with a very reasonable, a very
rational, and a very caring budget for people with intellectual and
developmental disabilities across this state as well as for our aged[?],
blind, and disabled population. We appreciate your hard work and
listening to families as the budget process was rolling out. We would
also like to extend a deep thanks to Secretary Wos for including The Arc
of North Carolina, North Carolina Association of Rehabilitation
Facilities, and Marc Inc in the incredibly intense and very deep work of
Medicaid reform in our state. We are present at every single Medicaid
Advisory Committee, we were listened to, our providers were there, our
families were there and we thank you very much for that. That said, we
do have a concern about section 10. The Arc of North Carolina, the North
Carolina Council on Developmental Disabilities, and multiple
organizations across the state very much want a very good and solid
integrated healthcare plan for people with intellectual and
developmental disabilities. We believe that that is critical to the
overall health of an individual with cerebral palsy, spina bifida,
autism, and all of the individuals we serve under the state definition
of IDD, including individuals with traumatic brain injury under the age
of 21. However, we had not seen this language until last evening. There
are several work groups of full stakeholders participating right now in
a council grant as well as in a federal grant called Health Me[??].
Specifically The Arc of North Carolina has been reaching out on a
regular</p>

sure that those appointments are made, and following up. We look forward

bill moves forward that all stakeholders are present to decide and to
contribute to whatever section 10 becomes. We appreciate your time and
we appreciate you letting us speak today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Would any other visitor like to speak?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Peyton Maynard, I represent the Developmental Disabilities
Facilities Association. I'm only speaking on their behalf. This is the
organization that operates the majority of the ICFMR community based
group homes and facilities in the state of North Carolina. I just wanted
to point out, first to tell you that I'm in a very difficult position
here and I hope you will appreciate the gravity of that position. We
have a bill before you which is probably one of the most important bills
that you will pass, hopefully, this session, the Medicaid Reform Bill.
There are people all over this state, from the medical world, the mental
health world, the Secretary's Office, Department of Health and Human
Services who have crawled over hot coals, who have lifted enormous
weight with the Chairman and the folks that have been working directly
on this subject to get to this point where you can advance this notion
of Medicaid reform and get North Carolina headed in the right direction.
We support that. That is the right direction. We're solid behind the
Chairman, solid behind the bill sponsor on that issue. I wanted to speak
for just a moment or two just to let you know about section 10 since it
is ICF, you say the words ICFMR facilities in here, I feel compelled to
speak. That's the majority of my clients in that area. The ICFMR
facilities are 24 hour facilities. They serve very involved folks with
intellectual developmental disabilities. We run a nurses, doctors,
meals, transportation, clothing, habilitation, training the full
complement of services 24 hours a day. We have a lesser intense service
called the DDA group home. Those folks in there participate in the CAT
waiver often and they are supported 24 hours a day. We have, were
introduced to this concept a few days ago, which is fine. If you ask us,
if you ask any one of my clients, &quot;do you want better coordinated
healthcare?&quot; The answer would be yes. We all strive for that. We
all have, we want to do the best that we possibly can do to get good
healthcare for our clients but this is just a concept. We haven't seen
very many of the details and that gives me a bit of concern. I will
explain to you that in ICF every one of those has a doctor now. We have
those all under contract. The majority of those are already enrolled in
Community Care of North Carolina. I believe the number was 4,000
clients, probably means they are close to 4,000 physicians, if not more,
because often times these individuals see a lot of specialists, a lot of
nephrologists, a lot of orthopedic surgeons, a lot of heart folks,
endocrinologists, there's a lot of co-attendant type conditions that are
associated with this. We would have concerned that we would want to work
through the details of this particular proposal before we launch off. It
occurred to me, as I was standing there, glancing through the bill that
if you read the bill, if you read the first part of the bill where it
says we're going to have an integrated, folks are going to get together,
folks are going to come together, you wouldn't need section 10. You
wouldn't need to carve that out separately because the mental health
world would be automatically included into all of the planning, all of
the hard work that these folks over here on this side of the room are
going to go through in the next few years. I would encourage you to make
us do that. Make us get together. Don't separate us. Dont separate us
from our physicians, don't separate us</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hello, I’m Pam Shipman and I am the CEO of Cardinal Innovations. Want to
just address two things. One is that the concern that we have that in
the overall Bill does not include the ?? of the 1915 b c waiver that was
in the original department Bill that was preferred and, yeah, that’s the
concern for us and other ?? because of all the work and money and time
that has been invested in the development of that system. So I just want
to point that out as an area of concern. And Section 10 the idea of an
??. You know, one of the things about our system that’s really special
and really important is that we really look at the culture. It is a
consumer driven culture, person first thinking and while medical care is
very, very important to the people we serve, it’s a support. It helps to
support them to live as normal a life as they could. And so, being able
to work with medical, medical systems or closely as part of the
integrated plan for the person, you know, is really a great opportunity
to put something forward that could be really a, a cutting-edge model.
You know, it’s a very, a very small model. Therefore, you know, we would
want to make sure it works before it was expanded or move forward. We
would intend to use measures to make sure that, you know, we have pre
and post measures so that we know what the consumer outcomes, what the
cost outcomes are but it’s really a chance to do something very
exciting, very neat for a very special population that has high cost but
it also fits in the culture that we have for the people that we serve
which is really around how they live their lives. And so, we really
think that just having a chance to see if this could work would be an
important experiment for North Carolina. It may or may not work. We
believe it will and we believe that we have providers that are
interested in doing this with us that absolutely are capable of making
it work but if you have, you know, a specially health home for that
consumer, a lot of their care is going to come there, sort of like a
one-stop shopping where you have a lot of things together instead of
split up. And, I really think that this could be so neat and so exciting
for people with disabilities. Obviously the Bill doesn’t have a lot of
detail in it because there has to be, the model has to be figured out,
we need to look at financial models, we need to look at service models,
we need to talk to the consumers, we need to talk to the providers that
would be involved and none of that is, has been done. And that is part
of the process of developing the waiver or the waiver amendment. So, you
know, I would hate to see us not have this chance to try something on a
very small scale that could be very effective and very good for people
with very complex disabilities. So that, you know, I think that’s
important for you guys to consider as you look at that Bill. Thank you.

department like to speak?

want to take this opportunity to, to thank you for your efforts and your
leadership and working with us. We are very pleased with the House Bill
that it closely aligns with Governor McCory’s Medicaid Reform Plan. We
are all interested in the same goals and with this Bill; it offers us
the flexibility to achieve those goals. It, as you have mentioned
Representative Dollar, it does not box someone into a ready-made
product. It allows the flexibility. It allows the creativity. It allows
everyone, all our stakeholders, the General Assembly and the department
to continue to work together so we do ultimately provide the best
possible service and have the best possible out</p>
