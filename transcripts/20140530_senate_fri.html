strange land? If I forget you O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her.
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.
So Lord today and tonight as senators struggle to weigh and to discern
what we shall do as a state, help them to know that you're with them.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Harry Brown is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. President. Before I begin with my remarks, I just think
need to first thank my sub-committee chairs Senator Hunt, Harrington,
and Jackson for the hard work that they put in putting this budget
together. And most of all thank the staff. I know the staff works some
long hours and I'm just amazed at how talented they are in what they do.
They expertise is just amazing I think to most of us. Also the
sub-committed chairs, I know they spend a lot of time putting their
pieces together and I just want to thank them as well.
The total senate budget for fiscal year 14-15 is a 21.16 billion dollar
budget which is a 2.6% increase over the fiscal year 13-14 enacted
budget and is .8% more than what the Governor proposed. Additionally the
senate budget does not use any non-recurring funds to pay for recurring
items. Again no non-recurring funds to pay for recurring items. This is
the first time in many many years this has happened. The unappropriated
balance for the prior year of 323.7 million plus reversions of 371.6
million which total 695.3 million more than offset the 445 million
revenue shortfall.</p>

<p id="005:00">
That we had to deal with in this budget. The Senate budget provides for
an average, I’ll start with salaries and benefits,  the Senate budget
allows for an average 11% raise for teachers. This is an average $5,800
pay raise and moves the state of North Carolina from 47th to 27th
nationally and from ninth to third regionally, ahead of Virginia,
Tennessee, and South Carolina. This budget also provides a one thousand
dollar salary and benefit increase for most other state employees which
is a 1.9% increase. It also provides a step increase for those that are
eligible and those include the highway patrol, deputy and assistant
clerks, and magistrates. It provides for noncertified salary personnel
an increase of a $618 per month and this is at a cost of 32.6 million
dollars, and it also provides for a 0.8% ??? adjustment for retired
state employees and teachers.  It also fulfills the commitment state
leaders made earlier this year by setting aside an additional 18.7
million to extend supplemental pay to teachers with masters degrees, to
those who have completed at least one course in a graduate program as of
July 1, 2013. On the education side it includes an additional six
million to fully fund the read to achieve program which provides focused
reading camps, special literacy, intensive classrooms, and other
resources to ensure students can read proficiently by the fourth grade.
It funds the North Carolina Center for the Advancement of Teaching, but
requires the Senate to report on its programs and outcomes in providing
professional development and training to teachers in the areas of
digital learning and early grade literacy. It establishes the North
Carolina education endowment fund, championed by our lieutenant
governor, which empowers North Carolinians to contribute to a fund for
teacher compensation that supports better academic outcomes for students
in public schools. It creates a new small school formula, one that the
superintendents of those schools have embraced and gives them certainty
on that funding. It gives our university system close to five million
dollars and our community college one million dollars to expand the
yellow ribbon program which will also be matched by federal dollars to
allow eligible veterans and dependents to have in-state tuition at our
campuses. In health and human services it sets aside 4.9 million to
create an organization that will ultimately house the division of
medical assistance and focus on meeting critical objectives for Medicaid
including improving quality, moving to the whole person care, and
achieving budget predictability. The Senate budget addresses the full
cost of anticipated fiscal year ’13-’14 Medicaid liabilities and the
’14-’15 rebates. The cost of roughly two hundred million additional tax
dollars for Medicaid brings the total to over two billion, two billion
dollars in extra state funding since 2011. It takes steps to bring
Medicaid in line with federal eligibility standards that other
southeastern states use. It provides funding for an additional one
thousand pre-K slots. It focuses resources for child care subsidy
program on families with the greatest need thereby reducing the waiting
list for subsidy funds. It significantly expands child protective
services and provides 8.3 million to reduce the average case load to ten
families per worker, the level recommended by the division of social
services. It also follows Governor McCrory’s lead in allocating an
additional one million to the state medical examiners office. In
environment and energy it allocates 1.75 million and creates twenty-five
new positions to support the long term requirements associated with the
cleanup and management of Coal Ash. It provides over one million for
natural gas exploration in marketing the state’s gas resources. In
transportation it focuses resources on critical highway needs by
creating a new pavement preservation program to emphasize maintaining
our roadways before they need more exhaustive and costly repairs, an
investment expected to extend the lives..</p>

6000 lane miles across the state by an average of 7 years. It reduces
administrative spending within the department of transportation and
apply those savings to needed roadway maintenance activities and capital
projects. It supports the governor’s budget by including his plans to
allow for online driver’s license renewals and makes critical
investments in the division of motor vehicles to modernize its business
processes and improve customer service. Other areas of the budget
continue the Senate's efforts to modernize the state's outdated IT
infrastructure. A move that will strengthen protection for our citizen’s
personal data and enable North Carolinians to have more customer
friendly interactions with state government. It tightens the state's
oversight and expertise in dealing with IT by requiring all contracts to
include detailed performance schedules and penalties for failure to meet
benchmarks. The budget deep below the size of the state bureau of
investigation by structuring here as an independent agency under the
department of public safety. The governor would nominate an SBI director
for confirmation by the general assembly to an 8 year term. The SBI is
the only law enforcement division housed outside of DPS. And the vast
majority of states locate their investigative arm under the executive
branches. And it addresses long standing budgetary backlog and
accountability problems within the state crime lab by placing that under
a new oversight at department of public safety. Several important
capital projects are included in this budget. I will just mention a few,
one is that provides 3 million dollars to repair the USS North Carolina
battleship's home. A landmark in Wilmington that we been to protect. It
provides 1 million of general fund challenge grant to the department of
cultural resources to plan for the expansion of the North Carolina
museum of history. Again this is a dollar for dollar match requirement
for those funds. It authorizes 206 million in general obligation 2/3
bonds to refinance the existing authorized but unissued special
indebtedness certificates of participation. This will enable the state
to receive savings from higher rated debt and approve the state’s
existing bond portfolio. It authorizes 15.4 million in general
obligation 2/3 bond to construct the western crime lab in Abbeville. The
crime lab received full planning funds in last year's budget, if you
remember. And then just a test on the lottery quickly. 56 million in
additional project in net lottery revenues or budgets over the previous
appropriated by annual totals where 19 million is reallocated to this
fiscal year to complete the shift of forward funding for UN ?? based aid
and for fiscal year 15-16, 56 million is redirected into the classrooms
teachers allotment. I think that is all that I’ll touch on. I think the
key plan again for this budget is it does not use any non-recurring
funds to pay for recurring items. I think that's important, again the
1st time in many many years that this has happened. For that, Mr.
Chairman, I would like, if you would recognize Senator Soucek to discuss
the case through 12 budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Soucek is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. I will be given by stating
the big picture when we look at k12 public schools. Another year what we
doing is we are spending more money on public schools than we have in
the previous year. 2013-2014 we had an authorized budget of 7.9 billion
and this budget is 8.1 billion that's a 2.4% increase. I would repeat
when Senator Brown talked about the teacher pay raise how important that
is, that's the biggest most significant thing we’re doing in the
education budget. He talked about the details, but I will summarize it
by saying it is simply a reasonable and necessary to serve an important
public purpose. It's reasonable because the cost and benefits between
keeping 10 year and the professional track is a choice entirely up to
the teachers. It's necessary because local school boards need the
flexibility to keep the best teachers in the classrooms and have the
authority to do that. That's important for our students, it's an
important public purpose because this general assembly is legally and
morally bounded to create high quality.</p>

Speaker: Vocation system for our states children and this plan firmly
puts us on the right path,
Speaker Changes: Some of the details on how we got to this budget and
the nearly half going our teacher is the important cause that we had was
we adjusted to the budget re analyzed of over projections of the 80M for
37.4 million and also the cost over projection of 64.9 million for sort
of five personal salaries the reeves to achieve was touched by senator
brown but these also eliminates the ?? adjustment of class and size and
stage 2 and 3 it was ?? to be decreased what happen to be will have
saving to be exactly that it is today so we know the impact on the way
?? into next year,the master degree was touch on by senator brown and
important announce ?? as well as the governor,
Speaker Changes: We realize through point 3 million savings from the
school bus replacement a lot ?? due to lower than ?? bus prizes in
department proficiencies.Changes to the teacher allotment provides a ??
for the basis of ?? for grades k1 rather than k3,that save 233 million
recurring bases reduces the state allotment by la central office by 5
percent .The states provide 91.1 million for general office allotment in
the 2014-2105 school year ,we revise more county settlements and funding
to have the funding that was much more fair and based on the data that
is a  savings of 3.5 million.For LA have less than 3200 students.We
adjusted the funding to be reflected over projected participation by LA
's to receive the state matching funds for the panic allowance system
saves almost a million dollars.We do reduce the state funding for G PI
by 30 percent and we end the general fund appropriation as we faced out
teaching fellows the most money that was left over not necessary to
finish the last classes going through over using that for general
fund.And one special provision is we direct the G PI to notify the
general assembly in riding required to ??.That is the summary of the
going of K12 and i ask the chair to recognize senator ?? to continue the
community college portion of the budget,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? you have the floor,
Speaker Changes: Thank Mr.President ?? over last year.All education
spending i up over last year .About 12 billion dollar or 21 billion
dollars budget goes to the public schools in the community college the
one significant thing is that there is a size and a million dollar
appropriation for closing the skills this is the money that they have
earned over last year by ?? of some courses and gain students to quick
up and out ever before .And we have told them you do this now i think we
all have amazed that they could save 17 18 million dollars but they be
it they are getting that money back to put into dozens of skills and job
they have a plan and ?? for for a very well defined plan of doing that
we were able to put additional 330 dollars in to the manufacturing
solutions center and house of our senators at 2 or 3 community colleges
??.There are the small changes in community college budget but those are
the most significant times and after all presentation i 'm sure you'll
take questions but i would like to Mr.President you that might ??
Speaker Changes:??  you have the floor
Speaker Changes:The members are brief about my comments about the
university systems but o m happy to tel you today that for the first
time in few years that i could remember we are actually putting more
money into university systems then we did to year before.As we did all
the other branches of education i think we shows we are serious about
funding educations in north Carolina and specially in ?? i hope the
college got the hall filled the same way and ?? we are increasing
salaries for the permanent ?? employees,</p>

The university system, one of the programs we're very excited about and
forward funding is our Yellow Ribbon Reserve to reduce tuition costs for
non-resident veterans who have served us so proudly and returned back to
North Carolina with the hope that they stay in North Carolina after
their education. And I think it's the least we can do.
We've given extra latitude to the Board of Governors in many areas. The
Senators and institutes were closing out, as we said earlier,the
teaching fellows. This is a, just a brief overview. I think we'll be
happy to get into more detail afterwards. But I think that this is a
good budget for the University Systems. And I definitely appreciate the
kind comments that President Ross issued today talking about this
budget. So, that's all I have to say about that.  And I'd like to turn
it over to Senator Pate, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I'll open up remarks on the HHS section of the
budget and it's a delight to be here today. First of all, I'd like to
thank our team, our team of people from the Fiscal Research who, and
Bill Drafting who have worked so hard with us to bring us to where we
are, as far as these discussions are concerned. I've been in the Senate
now for four years and I think I've been chair of the HHS Appropriations
Committee for about 25 of those four years. I was 20 years old when I
walked in here four years ago.
But this is very intricate work. It's very hard work. And it,I believe,
it is important because we address the healthcare of our citizens around
the state, which is very important to me and I'm sure it is to all of
you. I'm going to be briefing the Medicaid reorganization activities
that we have been thinking about and that we have been successful in
getting them into this budget. It is the intent of the General Assembly
to transfer the Medicaid and North Carolina Health Choice Programs to a
new state entity that will define a new more successful direction for
the programs and that will be able to focus more clearly on the
operation of the programs.
Now in those four years that I've been in the Senate, every year it
seems like we have to come up here and find about 400 million dollars or
more to make up for over runs in the budget of Medicaid. It is not doing
the job as it should right now. We are, we have no predictability of
what our budget is going to be. We are not treating the whole person
when they go in for treatment. And we are in a fee for service, a mode
that is not contributing at all to the predictibility of our budget.
This provision will change all of that so that we have a independent
agency that will be running Medicaid filled with people of national
stature who will be able to see to this program.
Mr.  President, I hope that this explains this particular provision I
believe we'll have some further discussions we have had putting in about
5 million dollars to set up this program on the first time we're looking
it and it is a progress that we will be  looking at as we go along. At
this time Mr. President I would like have you recognize Senator Hise for
other discussions on the HHS program
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, Members of the Senate. We begin this Medicaid
budget with an estimated 93 million dollar shortfall coming in previous
year. By the time we carry over delayed payments, those type of things,
we move forward about 50 billion dollars and come to about in total 140
we'll need to pay out from obligations for this year. We also have some
significant expected growth in the Medicaid budget to the tune of 206
million dollars that we had to come up with as a change in the rebase
for this year.  The rebase is a very important num- [RECORDING ENDS]</p>

<p id="025:00">
when moving forward. This accounts for population growth and expected
increases in the expenditures for each individual within that. We try to
move the re-base number down, as can be done artificially, for any of
these, you're creating a larger whole for next year. Something important
to consider as we move foward and individuals try to put in different
changes to that rebase number. Our goal overall was that we would spend
within the amount previously allotted for Medicaid this year. We think
that's the step we can take to make so many other things possible within
the budget. As we move through, there's some changes that we had to put
into Medicaid explicitly. We begin with an LMEMCO assessment: 3.5%.
Those funds are actually matched with federal funds and while it is a 60
million dollar additional availability to the state, there are no
changes to the amount of money being spent on mental health as a result
of that assessment. They will receive the same amount of funds. They
will pay 60, they will get 60 back, that's coming in, that's the state
sheriff keeping those funds. I know that's been reported a little
incorrectly in several other areas. We look at some drug costs, how we
change the payments for drugs, how we assess which drugs are going out,
making sure that they meet the standards that are available for those
drugs. We change from paying for drugs and dispensing fees, to just
paying for the dispensing fees and moving to an average acquisition cost
to those drugs. We reduce the population that we serve in Medicaid. We
are looking at a new reality. Individuals that are over 100% of poverty
now have the option under the exchange of receiving an insurance plan
that is almost fully subsidized by the federal government. The need to
cover those individuals in Medicaid has gone away. We've also, for many
years, covered individuals who don't meet the standards for qualifying
for Medicaid, simply because they received county special assistance, a
program that's half funded by the state, half by the counties. We have
now decoupled those. Those individuals will qualify for Medicaid on the
same standards as everyone not receiving those payments. As I move
through, some other areas of the department to look at. We took
significant cuts to personnel within the department. Mostly in vacant
positions, which are spent elsewhere. This concept of vacant positions
and moving money is one of the more difficult things to deal with in the
HHS budget. The department currently holds about 21 million dollars in
positions that have been vacant for more than 6 months. We reduced those
funds and some savings in contracts. We made up, 13 million coming from
the reduced positions, 3 millions from contracts, we combined that into
one 16 million dollar figure and allowed them to achieve it in either
direction. There are some other positive things we also did. Early
childhood education. We expanded the number of students eligible for
pre-k by more than 1000 with additional funds. We transfer from block
grants as we do nearly every year, that's an available use for the block
grants, in additional funds, we've put another 1000 slots into pre-k. In
child subsidy, in the grants for individuals to go into, to be taken
care of during the day and to learn and be educated from ages birth
through 5, 6 through 12, we have changes the eligibility in those, kept
all that money in available childcare subsidy and we will reduce the
rating list by somewhere in the neighborhood of about 5000 in that
operation, this coming forward. Child protective services. Something
that's been overlooked, but when we saw what happened in Union County
this year, this is an area we've got a lot of work left to do, we've got
a lot of changes left to come. We have provided the funds for the
counties to move to a case load of 10 cases per case worker. We have
also enhanced oversight at the state level of the child welfare program,
adding 9 additional positions in the state to monitor what's going on in
out counties. We've also expanded in home services under child welfare
so we can work</p>

To move through so that we’re not having to move through foster care
situations and we expended in the assistance payments for foster care an
additional five million dollars to deal with the situations that are
coming forward. The division of public health, many of you have seen
several articles in the office of the medical examiner and the problems
that are going on there. We funded the governor’s recommendation to
place an additional million dollars in the office of the medical
examiner so that they can begin to straighten out those issues and move
forward so they can serve both their communities and law enforcement
needs. As we move forward with the Medicaid budget you’re also dealing
with the children’s health plan, most of the changes that you’ve seen in
the Medicaid budget are reflected in some manner for the same policies
affecting both Medicaid and the children’s health plan. I’m sure there
will be a lot in this area, but having said that Mr. President I think
it’s time to recognize Senator Brock for the NER budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Brock is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. President. First I’d like to thank our
staff that did a wonderful job for us this year. I’d say they’re the
best staff but all of our staff here at the general assembly they do a
wonderful job for us and I’ll handle the presentation if you have
questions today please ask Senator Bingham. I’d like to thank also on
the ?? staff Doctor Warren in ??? that helped us as well. If you want to
take a look at some of the highlights of the NER budget, some of this
you heard yesterday is the forest service which we implement a new cost
share method for county specific forest personnel. This match will be
based on county wealth to make sure that low wealth counties, their
match is much less than the high wealth counties. In the forest service
we also implement a new fee on the forestry management plans. We
currently have a very long backlog and this will help us to assess
forest land at present use value for tax purposes and this will give two
million dollars to the state. We also put into farmland preservation an
additional 1.2 million dollars to support the preservation and an
additional million dollars to provide to federal match funds for
military buffers. One thing that we took the initiative as through North
Carolina state in our budget is $350,000 for a plant science imitative
and $250,000 for food processing initiative. Currently in North Carolina
80% of the produce that we grow is shipped outside of our state for
processing. As agriculture is the number industry in our state at now
$78 billion we’d like to keep some of that in North Carolina and that
will help bring jobs to rural North Carolina. Also in agriculture we
provide two million dollars in additional ??? funding which helps
impound water so that our farmers will be better protected during
droughts. Through the department of labor they got a 2% flex cut. In the
department of environment and natural resources, if you’re following
along in your money report, on page eight, Shell gas provided us up to
1.1 million for drilling, testing, and analysis of Shell gas wells. With
that will be $100,000 for marketing about our state’s gas resources.
This is an exciting time for North Carolina to go through and a great
economic opportunity for North Carolinians. Also through the budget you
will see that we have various provisions for Coal Ash and will provide a
total of $1.75 million and twenty-five positions to support the long
term requirements associated with the Coal Ash management and cleanup in
the state. We’ll have legislation on that soon but we’ll have the money
provided to help us in that endeavor. Also in our budget with Oregon
Inlet we create a new outer banks land management fund that will provide
a total of $15 million that will be used toward the purchase of Oregon
Inlet. Of that, $5 million will be general funds, $7 million special
funds, and $3 million in capital. Also in our budget with noncommercial
trust funds which are leaking in underground storage tanks we provide
2.5 million in recurring funding and a million in recurring funding to
this fund. Every year we tapped out, we tap out the money almost on day
one because we have so many tanks here in North Carolina that we need to

...leave onsite waste water to fund the HHS back to Deener, back home to
where it belongs. One thing that we do, we have an issue, was in the
governor's budget but I know it's very important to our lakes in North
Carolina, is the aquatic weed control. And we transfer the aquatic weed
control from Deener to Wildlife. And we've provided about five thousand
dollars from the shallow graft treasury fund that we set up last year,
and proivde about an additional four thousand dollars to combat Hydrilla
at Lake Waccamaw so we put more money into this process because these
lakes have become a part of the life-blood in those communities, as well
as a place where a lot of people like to make their homes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Department of Commerce?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They have a flexibility cut of 2 percent or 1 million dollars and also
with access North Carolina, and D4 which is our demand driven data
delivery system. We provide half a million dollars of non-recurrent
funding to merge these two IT programs that provide state-wide
businesses science and economic data to the public. If we're competing
against other states and other countries in the world, we need to make
sure that we can be responsive in real-time and not in government time
which is about two weeks late. We eliminated a [??] resource community
grant which is 2.5 million dollars to the state, and a community
development block grant, we provide the department with 637 thousand
recurrent funding to drive down federal CDBG funds which will be all set
by reduction positions in the like amount. Also, part of the governor's
budget that we think is very necessary is the apprentice program which
we provide a 300 thousand receipt from the community college and they'll
waive the fees associated with this for this year. A small example of
this is Caterpillar in Sanford, 16 students who have just graduated this
month will be starting a new job with Caterpillar in Sanford, working
and having an education at the same time at the community college,
transferring them to a four-year school if needed. But it's a worthwhile
program. Also we..[??]. That's a good idea. Later, Mr. President, JPS is
next up on deck and Senator Randleman will handle that part of the
budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Randleman, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. And let me begin by expressing my appreciation
to our staff. They have really worked long hours to produce the budget
that you have before you today and I sincerely appreciate them. I will
begin the presentation for the Judicial Department on page I9, Indigent
Defense. Items 37 and 38 allocate salary increases for state employees
within the Indigent Defense. Item 39 is an administrative reduction to
IDS of 233 thousand dollars. Items 40 through 44 allocate salary
increases for judicial employees. I'll call your attention to Items 41
and 42; these are pay plan step increases for deputy and assistant
clerks of superior court and magistrates. These plans have been frozen
for the last five years. Item 45 is a 24 percent reduction to the
administrative office of the court's technology service division. Item
46 is a 5 percent administrative reduction to the AOC and Item 47
eliminates the access to civil justice grant. Mr. President, I would ask
you to now call on Senator Goolsby.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be addressing the front pages of the
Justice and Public Safety budget dealing with the Department of Public
Safety and what I would first do is, I'm just going to give you some of
the highlights that I did the other day when we briefed our budget
before committee. We [??] step increases for the state highway patrol,
we also restore 11 positions to the ALE and we're looking at savings of
about 231 thousand dollars a year for co-locating the ALE along with the
SBI. Senator Newton will address when he talks about justice in just a
minute as far as the transfer of the SBI and the crime lab. When asked
to remove all the misdemeanors from the state prison system, currently
offenders with sentences between 91 and 180 days serve their sentences
in county jails there was a question yesterday about as we do that and
we send those...</p>

<p id="040:00">
County Jails, are the counties gonna have to pick up this cost ? No the
counties are asking for this. There's a number of counties that have
extra prison space and we actually pay them to take these offenders. And
by doing that under the ospeses of the bill we passed several years ago
dealing with the Justice reinvestment act we are able to close
additional prisons we will be closing down the Fountain correctional
center for women and the North Piedmont correctional center for women
and converting a third that is the Eastern correction institute to a low
custody level saving fifteen million dollars in the first year of
implantation. We also dedicate Senate funds for facilities. And again
this falls under Justice Reinvestment for offenders who violate the
technical conditions of their probation and they are put back in jail.
Then lastly we have some other funds we allocate to probation and parole
officers for vehicles and also providing additional funds for the state
highway patrol for uniforms and additional vehicles. And at this time
Mr. President Id ask if senator Newton could be called upon to brief us
on Justice.
Senator Newton has the floor
Thank you Mr. President Thank you collegues, So dealing with Justice
beginning on page seven we have increases in items thirty one and thirty
two for the compensation reserve and the state retirement system. We
have a management flex cut of a million dollars in item thirty three.
Item thirty four is the transfer of the SVI to the department of the
public safety and thirty five is we are reducing some of the toxicology
out sourcing funds that haven't been spent to the tune of two hundred
fifty thousand reduction. And then item thirty six is the transfer of
the state crime laboratory to the department of public safety. The items
dealing with the transfer of the SVI and the crime lab, I think it
important to note the manor in which this is being done. The way that we
are change the SVI director and the leadership of the SVI which is
sorely needed. Is to require the governor to nominate an SVI director
and for this body and the house to approve by conformation that director
for a period of eight years. This term of eight years would be
independent and would straddle govenitourial terms. We are doing this
for two reasons, one we want professional leadership and two we want to
take politics out of the SVI and we think that it is very important that
we do this. I would also note that a vast majority of state in this
country  do not have their SVI or state police if they have a state
police directed by the attorney general office or Justice if you will.
There's about nine or so states that do that but the vast majority
overwhelmingly are in a department that is administered by the executive
branch. However we will be unique, not alone but in the small minority
of states by having a very much independent director over the SVI. We
believe we can save alot of money as well as have better leadership at
the SVI by doing this. We also think that its the right time to transfer
the crime lab at this time. The head of the crime lab will report
directly to the DPS secretary instead of any law enforcement agency, and
we really hope that by installing new leadership at the crime lab it
will correct many of the mistakes and budgeting problems that have
accured over the years. We have quite a back log there and its time to
take some very significant
steps to address that. So at this time that is the end of my
presentation not wanting to incur the ox meter from Senator Apodaca and
I believe that I would ask at this time hapy to answer questions after
all the presentations but at this time Mr. President Id ask you to
recognize Senator Davis to talk about the general government.
Senator Davis you have the floor
Thank you Mr. President Id like to acknowledge that my capable co chair
Senator Tucker and we each are very grateful for our capable staff. The
general government budget represents an overall increase by the general
government agencies by two percent or eight point seven million dollars
for a total spending level or four twenty seven point five million we
recommend many efficiencies and position eliminations and operations

51 total positions, 33 of those were vacant and 18 were filled. In the
department of cultural resources, we have eliminated vacant and filled
positions for a savings of $694,000. We closed the house and the
horseshoe historic site in Sanford, effective July 1. That eliminates 3
positions for a savings of $128,000. We reduced both the museum of art
and history by 2%. Each of those entities has a very strong foundation
and significant assets. We reduced grants to libraries by 2% for a
savings of $284,000 and we capped those grants to a total of $400,000.
No more than $400,000. Roanoke Island Commission is reduced by 2% or
$9,000, leaving the park with 441,000 in appropriations and a special
fund for about $3,000,000. In the department of insurance, we eliminated
vacant and filled positions and we reduced operations for a savings of
$654,000. It budgets receipts not previously budgeted for license fees
paid by collection agencies. Once netted with old accounts no longer
receiving revenues, the amount budgeted is $200,000. We also have a
reduction to operations in anticipation of these additional receipts. We
have special appropriation here to assist local programs with building a
domestic violence shelter and rebuilding outdoor facilities for a total
of 175,000. In the department of revenue, we eliminated positions vacant
for more than one year, totaling $627,000 and moved expenses to receipt
support for about 2.3 million. We’ve provided 2.5 million to the
department to purchase new scanners. The old scanners that they have
will be vulnerable to viruses and other problems because Microsoft will
no longer support Windows XP. We authorize the expenditure of 1.4
million from the collection assistance fee for technology upgrades to
the taxpayer assistance call center. We allow the departments to spend
up to 7.5 million per year to contract with a third party to collect
overdue tax receipts or debts. Authorize the expenditure of 11 million
from the ?? benefit stream account for the maintenance of the
functioning portions of the system and 5 million dollars from the
account for the implementation of a collections case management system.
We authorized the expenditure of 7.5 million from the collection
assistance fee to provide more e-service and move away from paper. We
revised the budget to reflect changes in the IT section of the budget
and changes due to ending the contract with CGI. In the secretary of
state, eliminated two vacant positions from the corporations division,
and we eliminated three positions from the publications division,
leaving two positions. The division is responsible for the North
Carolina manual, the directory of state and county officials, the North
Carolina state constitution and the North Carolina government
organizational chart. State comptroller’s office. We’ve provided funds
for contract increases for IBM and Oracle products and ongoing
maintenance of the cash management system. We provided 2.1 million
non-recurring to upgrade the hardware for ??, which is the state’s human
resources and payroll system. We reduced operating line items for
communication and data processing for a savings about a little over
$500,000. Eliminated three and 3/4  filled and one vacant position for a
savings of 531,000. In the department of administration, we eliminated
ten vacant positions. We reduced the certified utility budget by 1.2
million dollars. Reduced the janitorial services contract by 300,000. We
eliminated the county aid to veteran service offices. In the department
of administration, we correctly budgets the veterans trust fund, parking
fund, motor fleet management fund, and temporary solutions fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you done? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have 18 departments.
I’m getting the hook, I guess. So at this point, Mr. President, I’ll
pass off to my colleague, Senator Meredith, who will discuss the
transportation budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, before we do that,
we do have an excused absence for the remainder of the day for Senator
Hartsell. Senator Meredith, you are recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. President. I want to go over the transportation budget summary,
but first I want to thank my co-chair Senator Rabin and my staff. Major
highway fund budget changes, department staffing efficiencies. We
eliminated 300 positions in DOT. 296 of those positions have been vacant
for more than 180 days. Pavement preservation, we established a 80.8
billion dollar reoccurring pavement preservation program.</p>

The department of motor vehicles realign existing funds to support the
production cost for the new format driver’s license and allocate
additional funds to reduce backlog and the medical review and ignition
interlock programs. The intermodal reduced funding across the intermodal
division by 6.7 Million to maximize the available funds to the pavement
preservation program and capture the cost efficiencies resulting from
the sale of the division of aviation’s Sikorsky helicopter. Transfers
will make the driver’s education transfer non-recurring with the intent
of reducing future transfers of transportation revenues from the highway
fund. Major trust fund budget changes, strategic party program to run
expected revenues, tax cap changes and administrative reductions. This
budget increased funding to our landmark strategic transportation and
investment program and by 73.6 million this year. Over 10 years, funding
for STI will increase by 822 million. Statewide portion would be 329
million, regional and division areas of the budget will receive 246
million each. I’m going to the Senate budget provision, section 34.6 the
highway use tax caps and excise tax changes. We’re gonna raise the
highway use tax cap on commercial vehicles currently set at 1000 and for
recreational vehicles currently set at 1500. These caps will increase to
2000 for January 1st 2015. And they’ll raise to 3000 on July 1st 2015.
We’ll raise the highway use tax cap on out of state vehicles from 150 to
250 effective October 1st 2014. By changing these caps, an additional
142 million can be programmed into DOT’s 10 year work plan for projects
prioritized under the strategic transportation investment act. Section
34.8, remote driver’s license renewal, authorizes the DMV to renew the
driver’s license online enabling DMVs to address and anticipate its
surge in transactions while maintaining and reducing wait times across
offices. Section 34.11, pavement preservation program. Create a
reoccurring funding focus on maintaining North Carolina’s deteriorating
roads while encouraging pavement contractors to expand their business to
include ?? preservation treatments. DOT is directed to hold workshops
and training sessions with goal of outsourcing 90% of pavement
preservation activities in 5 years. These funds dedicated in this budget
would treat 6000 lane miles across the state for 5% of our secondary
road system and extend the life of these treated pavement areas by an
average of 7 years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, if you will please recognize Senator
Brock to go for Information Technology.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You. Senator Apodaca if you thought my one page
speech on NER was so great, wait to hear 3 pages of IT. The IT budget is
one which actually touches every budget. One thing that we’re doing is
looking as further as the consolidation and efficiencies that we can
attain through IT in our state or that is moving the GIS functions that
are consolidated into the office this year. I heard that way more
agencies can reach into it and use the shared data from the mapping
service with additional 5 million dollars into the GDAC which would help
develop an enterprise business intelligence capability and also in our
budget we increased funding to CJLEADS. There’s not a single person in
law enforcement that doesn’t love this program. We’re able to put an
additional 1.1 million dollars into that system. Also, we’re continuing
refresh of our computers as we know that many of our operating systems
are out of date and we’ll be vulnerable. So we’ll continue our refresh
rate of it. You have to have a special exemption from the State CIO to
move your backup capabilities to outside the state. Currently we have
the Eastern data center and Western data center, they’re not used to
full capability and why should we go out and rent something that we
already own. Also we’re requiring detail schedules and deliverables from
all state IT contracts which would look at our IT contracts over the
years and when over by the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

And also require a development of clear path for government IT
professionals. One thing we have a problem with doing is that our IT
people that we train here in the state soon leave for other positions
and it’s tough for us to keep a required workforce year after year after
year. Also, in our budget we extend the State CIA’s authority to prove
unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). It requires establishment of a
governance board for UAS, otherwise known as the drones in office of the
State CIA. And with that, if he’s ready, Senator Apodaca, we’ll wrap up
with pensions and retirements, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. President. Members, three things I
would like to mention with pensions and retirements. The first is, for
about the third year in a row, fourth year in a row, we fully funded the
pension plan. So, we’re proud of that. Second thing, we gave a 0.8%
collar increase in our retirees and the third thing is, we allow the
treasury to hire two new employees to help manage the portfolio in the
treasury’s office and that should pay dividends back to the State. So
those three major things in pension and retirement and I’ll turn it over
to you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You Senator. Senator Cook, for what purpose you

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. President. Members, this amendment simply
amends the section regarding state employees reassignment if they are in
an exempt position and reassigned as a result of that and we deleted the
thirty-five mile radius which I agree is a narrower radius within which
they would have be reassigned. So this amendment just extends that
radius to a hundred miles. I feel like this is a family friendly
amendment and that particularly women are disproportionately affected by
this amendment and parents who would have to pick up and move hundreds
of miles away to keep a similar type job that they were reassigned, it
at least gives a reasonable radius and a broader options for the
appointing authority. I would ask your consideration and support for
this amendment, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Brown what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Brown has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Bryant I appreciate this amendment. There’s
been some concerns though as we’ve tried to reorganize some of our
departments that they need more allowance than a hundred miles so I will
have to ask that we vote against this amendment. I know what you’re
trying to do, it’s just because of reorganization that we need more
flexibility than that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Any further discussion or debate? Senator Bryant what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’d like to ask  Senator Brown a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Brown do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Brown is there some sense of what range would
give the appointing authorities enough flexibility but yet some
protection for people with families who were needing to maintain their
employment, particularly in this tough economic environment we’re in?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Brown I’ve been assured that they’re going to
try to keep it as close as possible. It’s just there’s some positions
that they need more flexibility on. I think we’re talking about very
very few issues where we’re probably going to be outside the thirty-five
mile range to be quite honest, it’s just they needed some flexibility
just in case, and there should be very few positions.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Senators, is there any further discussion or
debate? Hearing none the question before the Senate is the passage of
amendment eight. All in favor will vote aye, opposed with vote no. Five
seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote.
Barringer, no. Sixteen having voted in the affirmative and thirty-one in
the negative, amendment eight fails. The bill as amended is back before
the body. Senator Stein what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Stein you have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. President. Members of the Senate, last
year you all made a fundamental choice that dramatically affects this
budget. You chose to create a half a billion dollar hole in this budget
through tax giveaways to benefit large, out of state corporations and
wealthy folks who do not need that extra money, and you filled that hole
by cutting public education to the tune of again half a billion dollars
over the biennium. Two thirds of your giveaways goes to people whose
average annual earnings are one million dollars or more so I’m talking
about people in a year who earn a million dollars, not a millionaire,
but a person who in a year earns a million dollars. Ninety percent goes
to the wealthiest five percent..</p>

<p id="070:00">
Senator Stein: …these are people on average who earn half a million
dollars or more, people who did well, unlike the middle class, even
during the recession. Instead of trickle down, we should be building our
economy from the middle out – that is when we are strongest as a state,
that is when we are strongest as a nation. And having a strong
educational system is as essential as having a strong economy, yet, to
finance this tax plan, you all froze teacher pay, dropping NC to 46th in
the nation in teacher compensation, you eliminated thousands of
teacher’s positions, and fired thousands more teacher assistants, you
eliminated compensation for teachers who earn masters degrees, and this
bill today does nothing to fix that on a going forward basis. You
slashed the amount going to textbooks and other school resources. Not
surprisingly, teacher morale is at the lowest point any of us can ever
remember. They are fleeing the classrooms at unprecedented rates. You
spent months trying to argue that you did not actually cut public
education, that teachers are actually adequately paid, but people of NC
were not buying what you are selling. So, today, you offer this shell
game of a budget. When we look at your shiny proposal for teacher’s pay,
we realize it is fool’s gold, not the real thing.
Speaker 2: Mr. President?
Speaker 3: Go ahead Senator Stein.
Speaker 2: Mr. President, we are talking about Senate Bill 744 and our
current budget. If Senator Stein would confine his comments to this
year’s, and not last year’s budget, I believe would we be better served.
Speaker 3: Senator Stein please keep your comments to this year’s budget
please.
Senator Stein: Point of inquiry to the chair.
Speaker 3: Go ahead Senator.
Senator Stein: Is this year’s budget not affected by last year’s budget?
Speaker 3: It is Senator, but please keep your comments directly related
to this budget and the content within this budget, and not last year’s
please.
Senator Stein: Well the timing is perfect because, how are you paying
for this teacher pay proposal in your budget? Unbelievably, by cutting
public education to the tune of $380 million, and by taking 15,000
blind, disabled, and elderly people off their health insurance. This
budget is not about paying teachers a salary that reflects the
importance of their work. This budget is about trying to cloak your
public vulnerability at the expense of our school kids. If you don’t
believe me, maybe you will listen to the people whose jobs it is to run
and administer our public schools. The state association of school
administrators wrote to us last night, “the budge released by the NC
Senate includes devastating cuts that will harm the learning experience
for public school students across the state: it could lead to a loss of
10,000 or more school jobs, and negatively impact county budgets and tax
payers.” Proposed cuts to teachers and teacher assistants in grades 2
and 3 hinder progress on the important goal of insuring all 3rd graders
are reading sufficient as called for under recent law changes. Students
will also have fewer nurses, longer bus routes, and inadequate funding
for textbooks. You all fired thousands of TA’s last year, and of those
you didn’t fire, you are firing half of the remaining ones this year:
7400 TA’s are going to be out of there jobs, kids suffering as a result.
At the same time you are taking thousands of adults out of our K1
classrooms, you are adding more kids. You all remember, I assume, the
promise in last year’s budget that you were going to reduce class size
for the lower grades. That promise and the nearly 3800, excuse me, 800
kindergarten and 1st grade teachers are evaporated at the stroke of a
pen with this budget. So now we have young students in classes with more
kids and fewer adults, making harder for teachers to teach, and kids to
learn. We just passed, yesterday, legislation for the read to achieve
law. Are we serious about helping young kids to read? Because this
budget is not. North Carolina has many dedicated professionals trying
their utmost to make our schools the best they possibly can. One of
those is Dr. Mark Edwards, a superintendent of the Morrisville School
System, President Elect of the Superintendent School Association, and
last year’s national Superintendent of the Year – whole country. Dr.
Edwards pleads that you sit down with him and other superintendents…</p>

<p id="075:00">
Senator Stein: .. superintendents and come up with a right approach that
does not cut the personnel and other resources that our students across
the state need in order to learn. I mean, my gosh, even the teachers,
who you are trying to induce to stay in the classroom, criticized this
budget for what it is: “a political game,” and “the biggest bait and
switch scheme in state history.” I mentioned earlier that your proposal
will end in 15,000 blind, disabled and elderly recipients of Medicaid.
Your response is that these folks can apply to the health and insurance
exchange of the affordable care act, which is as ironic as it is
unrealistic. These folks do not have sufficient income to benefit from
the subsidies – you all know that just as well as we do. We can only
conclude that you are indifferent to the blind, disabled and elderly you
are turning your back on. One of those 15,000 is a gentleman named Rick
Kenworth, an elderly man with dementia living in an assisted facility
here in Raleigh. All three of his daughters work more than full time,
but even with that, they simply could not afford to put their dad in the
facility he currently resides in if they did not have Medicaid, nor
could Mr. Kenworth afford the medications he purchases with Medicaid.
His daughter, Ann, is quoted in today’s paper, “this budget just sends a
bad message that the legislators don’t care about the elderly and their
access to healthcare.” I have more faith in NC than that. Members let’s
justify that faith. Let us draft a budget that has public input. Let us
have a real process where subcommittees actually meet to discuss the
budget. Where the budget is delivered and we have time to review that
budget. Where the public has opportunity has to provide input to that
budget. Where the process takes more than 48 hours to stream itself
through this Chamber. Let’s eliminate the breath taking changes and
substances of law that you have put in the special provisions of this
budget: items like moving the SBI and crime lab, like creating a new
court system in the judiciary that violates separation of powers, like
ending community of care in NC – a nationally recognized program for
saving Medicaid dollars and for providing important improvements in
quality of care, that Senator Richard Burr recently came down hear and
praised. Let’s craft a budget that respects our teacher, that creates a
strong public school, a budget that positions our kids in NC to succeed,
and a budget that does not throw our fellow citizens, who are blind,
disabled, and elderly, to the curb. Dr. Edwards, the superintendent, and
Mr. Kenworth’s daughter, they deserve better, and they are right: we can
do better.
Speaker 2: Senator, for what purpose do you rise?
Speaker 3 :  Mr. President, to speak  on the bill.
Speaker 2: Senator has the floor, speak to the bill.
Speaker 3: Before we get carried away with the talking points, Senator
Stein you are a good orator, and I suppose you are a pretty good lawyer,
let’s get back to the basics of where we came from just for a moment,
for a recollection, and for some truth. You had a chance, and your party
has had a chance for many years to raise teacher’s salaries and give lip
service to it. And you know since I have been here you have cut well
over $1 billion out of, first, teacher’s salaries forever and ever. The
only raise they got was two years ago and we gave them above 1.2%, and
now we are putting more money in education than has been put into
education in all your time. Record number of dollars spent: we are not
reducing any classroom size – we are just leaving it the way it was last
year, rather than reducing it, and nobody’s gone: no teacher loss, not a
single one, and ADM is funded just like it was last year. It is so
ironic that all the times that you had to do these grandiose things, and
we give a historic teacher raise – more dollars than ever put into
teachers salaries, and I am getting hundreds of emails of thank you’s
from teachers I am hearing from stating we are respecting and
recognizing them, that we are giving them 11% , $5800 a year.  Nobody
has ever done that before – not even close. I think we just need to let
reality sit in, see what you all do with budgets, and see how much you
cut, and look at what we are doing. We got a chance to do something, and
I don’t expect a lot  of you to praise it, but I certainly do expect you
all to realize and recognize that we have set historic records.</p>

That’s all you need to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Will Senator Tillman yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, I’m looking at a publication put out
at the department of public instruction that is the department run by
Democrat June Atkinson and it looks to me like, the last time the
Democrats were in control and they set a budget, was in 2009-10. Did
they not, Sir, cut education spending, 840 million dollars?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Sir. You have [made] my point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Second question, if the Senator will yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, can you explain how Senator Stein talks about
reductions of teachers and you made a mention of ADM like we should all
know what that is. Explain the misconception that he is putting out when
you talk about ADM and the number of students we have in the system and
how that affects the number of teachers that are in the system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We project ADM, Average Data Membership every year for
the coming year. At the end of every year and we update it four times a
year and we put the teachers in there according to the student hit count
like ADM and we’re gonna find every single one based on the class size
that’s on the books. We didn’t reduce it like hope to, this year but not
reducing it don’t mean we’re losing anybody. We’re having the same as it
was last year. You can say we’re cutting teachers Senator Stein, but
that’s not the truth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. President. Ladies and
Gentlemen of the Senate, my family and I, we’re currently living the
reality of public education. I am of the opinion that a quality public
education is the single most effective tool for creating opportunities
across gender, racial and social economic lines which leads to good
jobs. Good public schools ensure that regular working people, younger
children get the same opportunity for success as anyone else in this
state. One of the proudest titles that I have is that of a husband and a
father of a 9 year old girl who attends public school in the 3rd grade.
So when you all debate and talk about testing and what’s good for public
education, my wife and I and daughter, we go through it on a daily basis
without complaint. Now I understand that the ultimate responsibility for
my child’s education rests with me and my wife. We give to the PTA and
we both volunteer on a regular basis in our local school. Ladies and
Gentlemen of the Senate, the 380 million dollar cut to public education
is a dramatic shift and one that I cannot support. You see, when I go to
schools and I walk the halls, people don’t know me as Senator Ford, they
know me as Trinity’s Dad. And so, I see how hard the teachers work, and
I see how difficult it is for first year teachers to teach and then try
to pay back student loans and happen to work part time jobs when they
get out of school. That affects the classroom. So, I applaud you for
your efforts to try to raise teacher pay, but at the expense of teacher
tenure and security for a job that is just not fair. You add further
stress on to the public school systems when you cut the teacher’s
assistance. And you cut teacher’s supplies. We need to create a
comprehensive environment for teachers to be able to be effective in the
classroom. And Ladies and Gentlemen of the Senate, I just ask you to
pause for a minute and think about the dramatic impact that you’re gonna
have on our public schools with the most precious resources I think we
have in our state which are teacher. It’s ironic that all of us have
these ?? ideas about public education and no one in this chamber has
asked me what my public school experience has been. Ladies and Gentlemen
of the Senate, I apologize to you but I cannot support this budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator ?? for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Soucek, yield a question please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Soucek, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Soucek, I’m not like Senator Hise, I didn’t
major in Math and Statistic..</p>

But, could you tell me if the K12 budget we’re proposing is more or less
than the year we’re in now?

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniel, for what purpose you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniel, you can send forward your amendment.
Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniel moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniel is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. President. In 2013 budget, director DPI
and UNC systems to conduct a feasibility study of establishing a school
of Science and Math in Western North Carolina. The study found that each
year, because of capacity limitations, only about 50% of qualified
applicants were able to attend the school of Science and Math. This
means that each year, on an average more than 300 qualified students are
not afforded this opportunity. Our own senator Hise, in order to attend
the school of Science and Math had to ride a bus 210 miles to Durham,
North Carolina because there was no alternative location in Western
North Carolina. While there are currently not available capital funds to
break ground on this project, this amendment, which is consistent with
the governor’s budget language expresses the state’s commitment to
affording students in Western North Carolina the same opportunity as the
students in East of ?? I hope that this school will become a reality by
the time Senator Hise’s boys have aged to attend and I ask your support
for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Any further discussions or debate.
Hearing none, the question before the senate is the passage of amendment
9. All in favor, vote Aye. All oppose, vote No. 5 seconds will be
allowed for voting. The clerk will record the vote. Senator Jackson?
(Aye). 46 having voted in the affirmative and 1 in the negative,
amendment 9 passes. The bill as amended, is back before the body.
Senator Robinson, for what purpose you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chair. Ladies and Gentlemen, one of
those populations that Senator Stein talked about is one that I’m very
familiar with. I’m not a lawyer. I’m a human services person. And so, I
have worked with elderly, blind; still work with disabled and work with
children. And so, I also know that a lot of those individuals who are
most vulnerable in this state would not be able to receive medically
needy and other kinds of services if it were not for the provisions we
provide in North Carolina. So, I too am very concerned that you will be
denying services to 15000 elderly, blind and disabled people. A United
Services for adults which is a single resource in Guilford County. If
you haven’t visited, you’d be surprised how many people are being served
daily, who otherwise wouldn’t have resources. And as you go around to
nursing homes and go to other facilities, these folks wouldn’t be able
to get services, based on the cuts in this budget which puts them out of
the eligibility range. They are ?? issues. Some statistics and I wanna
share those with you. This budget cuts 969,549 dollars from home and
community care block grant funds and these funds support key services
that help older people to stay in their homes and it supports
caregivers. Otherwise, these folks will be in nursing homes and it would
cost us more. This is a 3% reduction, our funding which already has
16000 people on the waiting list. Allow these folks also awaiting for
home delivery meals in in-home services. As Senator Stein says, there’s
15000 of them in total. In addition, the budget, as proposed eliminates
Medicaid eligibility for 11886 older and disabled adults who receive
State County special assistance as of January 1. Of course, this saves
our state 28 million dollars. But what does it do to these vulnerable</p>

<p id="090:00">
A lot of them will end up in nursing homes, at emergency rooms, and
probably deceased. Effective January 1, 2015 the budget eliminates
Medicaid coverage for those who qualify for Medicaid as medically needy
except those categories that are prohibited by the federal requirements.
In addition I am concerned about the children. Senator Stein talked
about children in daycare and childcare. You and I know that as Senator
Berger has proposed his ready to achieve program, your children,
certainly my grandchildren, would not be able to even be ready to go to
kindergarten if they don’t receive some child care where they can get
prepared with developmental skills and other kinds of skills so they’ll
be ready to get ready to learn so this budget cuts 9100 children out of
those services. In addition it requires all the parents to pay 10%
subsidy and that subsidy for some parents is $150-$180 a month. Now if
you can barely afford to pay the rent, and these aren’t people on public
assistance so don’t try that with me, but with your job that pays what
our state has as minimum wage. If you can barely pay the rent, feed your
family, pay the utilities, etc., it’s very difficult for you to pay
$150-$180 a month, that’s a lot of money for me and I work. So what
we’re doing in this budget is attacking, certainly I applaud you for the
teacher salary, I’ve told all of you. First I’m an educator, I believe
in education because it is access to a better quality of life, but as
we’re increasing teachers we should not be taking that money away from
our children, our elderly, our disabled, our blind. They cannot provide
for themselves, you can, we can, but those folks cannot do it and some
day some of you will be at that point too and I hope you have sufficient
income to take care of yourselves or some good children or else you’ll
end up in the same situation, but this is something we should not be
doing in our state, it’s unconscionable that we would not take care of
the least of these. This is an obligation that we have as public
servants and I cannot support a budget that does that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Goolsby what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] See if Senator Hise would yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Hise do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Senator Hise. Having listened to Senator
Robinson talk about Medicaid, can you tell us sir how the Medicaid
benefits compare now and how they will compare under this budget with
what President Obama and the federal government deem as necessary
benefits? Can you explain that to us?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Well I’ll say first of all when you’re comparing to all
other states, we exceed and in several areas continue to exceed what the
federal government requires us to provide in Medicaid services. All of
these cuts still keep us above those standards. There’s some
miscalculations on the medically needy. For those who understand that
those are individuals who are above the 100% poverty level this policy
allowed them to spend down due to medical costs to a point that they
qualified for Medicaid. The changes that now under the exchange,
everyone over 100% of federal poverty is eligible for a subsidy on the
exchange and is now mandated by federal law to have insurance coverage
so therefore the ability o build those costs up for the individuals over
100% of federal poverty no longer exist, that’s why we’re able to take
this cut and move it down. The second is for special assistance which
was a special qualification we gave to individuals who generally were in
adult care facilities and received county and state money for room and
board in those. We said that that would automatically qualify them for
Medicaid.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Hise do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Can you tell this chamber how much additional money in
Medicaid cost overruns that we have come up with in this Republican
controlled senate to pay the freight in these tough budget times over
the last several years?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you and I will. Over the time we’ve been here,
this fourth budget that we’re going in both overruns and growth..</p>

<p id="095:00">
Senator Hise: in rebase, in the Medcaid budget, we have now added an
additional $2 billion in state money, to the Medicaid budget.
Speaker 2: Last question. Senator Hise, do you yield?
Senator Hise: Senator you are probably the most knowledgeable man in
that area but can you tell somebody who went to law school, instead of
the kind of degree you have, is that an increase in spending in medical
costs over the last many years, a substantial one?
Senator Hise: Most substantial and significant. I think you would be
hard pressed to find any provider under the Medicaid system who is not
receiving more funds under Medicaid than they currently receive because
that $2 billion in state money is generally matched by a 2 to 1 on
federal money.
Senator Robinson: Mr. Chair?
Speaker 2: Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
Senator Robinson: To ask Senator Hise a question.
Speaker 2: Senator Hise do you yield?
Senator Robinson: Senator Hise, I want to make clear that people
understand what you are saying. Those people, even though they qualify
for the federal eligibility, NC’s subsidy was beyond that which included
other people, and these people who only qualify for the federal subsidy,
therefore, will you explain that again so they understand whether 15,000
people are? In addition to that, I want to know, can I do both
questions?
Speaker 2: Let’s just do one question now, and then Senator I will give
you time to do another one.
Senator Hise: The subsidies that exist are solely federal subsidies that
are paid for individuals on the exchange. Any one between 100 and 400%
of federal poverty can receive a subsidy to purchase insurance. I have
talked to several individuals who now get private insurance somewhere in
the range of $8-10 a month, for a full coverage plan, on the exchange.
Everyone that is over 100% is the population we are talking about, in
line 55, which is the medically needy process. We had previously allowed
them to use medical expenses to spend down and say their income is
lower, but now their medical expenses should be covered by the insurance
policy.
Senator Robinson: Second question?
Speaker 2: Senator Hise, do you yield?
Senator Hise: I yield
Senator Robinson: Would you also share with the Chamber what that income
range, you are talking about – the 400%, and also, if any of this
information was vented at a public hearing with any of the entities that
represent these individuals?
Senator Hise: I am pulling this off the website from the 2014 federal
poverty guidelines, for a family of two, the 100% of federal poverty is
$15,730 – that would go up to 400% of poverty, for a family of 2, would
be $62,920, for a family of two. For a family of one, it is
$11,670-$46,678.
Speaker 2: Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
Robinson: Follow up Mr. Chair.
Speaker 2 : Senator Hise do you yield?
Robinson: My other question was did you vent this with any of the
entities that represent the populations who are being affected. You kind
of skipped between the 100% and 400%, which kind of leaves the 20/30,000
– that’s alright, did you vent it with any of the AARP or social
services people either, in terms of coming up with these
recommendations: were they invited to these public hearings?
Senator Hise:  As you are aware, there were not public hearings about
the specific proposal coming up. We have been prohibited by the federal
government, since the passage of the Affordable Act, for changing any
eligibility standards to the Medicaid, even though we exceeded the
federal minimums for multiple years, and this has been the first year
since that, that we have been able to do so.
Senator McKissick: Mr. President?
Speaker 2: Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
McKissick: To speak on the Bill.
Speaker 2: Senator McKissick has the floor to speak on the bill.
McKissick: Heard a lot of discussion over the last 15-20 minutes about
Medicaid. It is appropriate that we have that kind of conversation, that
kind of discussion: it is a major, important issue. In this state, a lot
of people depend on it, they rely on it: it is their safety net. It is
unfortunate that we did not  have our subcommittee meetings where we
could have hear from SHS, the agency itself, to hear its perspective. To
hear from many of the stakeholders that could have come forward, to hear
their thoughts, because what we are moving to now, in terms of Medicaid

<p id="100:00">
Senator McKissick: …this budget is an entirely new model - we are
battering even everything the Secretary wants, and that her team has
spent the last year working upon. I think many of those involved in HHS
know his consultant was higher. Sole source contract would competitively
bid, worth $300,000 with Bob Atlas – what did he do? He came in and went
out to meet with the Medicaid providers all across this state. He met
with many of the stakeholders. He crafted a plan that included
accountable care organizations: a new innovative type of model that had
the possibility to implement contained costs and risks. The Medicaid
providers in this state got behind that plan, they bought into that
plan. Then we went out and spent another $3 million over HHS for another
sole source contract, actually, I think it was $3,250,000. We brought in
Alvarez, and Marshall, to do additional work on how to reform, reshape,
Medicaid with cost containment policies, details, and analysis that
could help reshape, reform this agency. And we have just thrown the baby
out with the bath water. I guess they must have been twins because we
threw Bob Atma’s, and all his work, and we threw out everything of
Alvarez and Marshall, and all their work. And we spent an awful lot of
money on that: $3,250,000 – my gosh, $473 an hour for the principles on
that job, $354 an hour for the consultants, $254 for the analysts, and
$84 an hour for interns – wish our insurers made that kind of money
around here. A lot of money, a lot of time, a lot of resources, over a
year of work, and the Senate, based upon fiat, without even listening to
HHS, any of the stakeholders, providers, hospitals, any of those
individuals, for whom an outcome has been decided. We don’t like it. We
don’t want it. We don’t ??? better than the consultants, experts – all
of those collective people who have given this some time, thought,
assistance. And we have actually created a directive within our special
provisions to say – well, here in NC, we have gone above and beyond
Medicaid in terms of providing services to people, we have gone above
and beyond what the federal law requires us to do. But, in many
instances, NC has served as a sterling model and example of what you can
do for people. And we have given them directions to go back and rethink,
reshape, to come up with the minimum that we can provide to the truly
needy. We are putting gaping holes in that safety net, and in the
process 15,000 people stand to lose these services: the blind, the
needy, those that are disadvantaged that need the help that Medicaid can
provide. We do not need gaping holes in that safety net. We need to
short it up. This is not a time to cast away those we chose to cover in
the past, and do the minimum that we can do – we are better than that:
we should have empathy, we should have compassion, we should extend a
helping hand to those who do not…
Speaker 2: Senator I ask you to keep your comments directed to the Bill
please.
Senator McKissick: This is related to the Bill, Mr. President. We are
dealing specifically with Medicaid. It is a significant discussion on
Medicaid, and this relates directly to what is proposed in this Bill,
dealing with Medicaid, Mr. President.
Speaker 2: Senator McKissick, I will ask you again to keep your comments
directly related to the Bill please.
Senator McKissick: With that in mind, and with the Medicaid coverage
that is being proposed here, the 15,000 folks that are going to lose
their benefits: with the patients G8 in the budget, about 9,100 there,
with the patients G9 in the budget, about another 3,200 people
specifically related to the budget. Any way we go beyond Medicaid, we
look at childcare, these childcare subsidies, there may be a few extra
people added to the wait list, but there are 47,000 people that will
have to pay more based upon this budget. I think it is time that we give
some deep thought and reflection to the direction that we are taking.
And of course we are doing it, in many respects, to try to find money to
pay for teachers’ salaries. And that is something we need to do in terms
of increasing our teachers’ pay, but we don’t need it to…</p>

<p id="105:00">
in a two tier system for doing it. That's wrong. Yeah we need to help
our teachers out, yeah we need to get them to the median in this
country, but cutting HHS, Heath and Human Services, opportunities for
the truly needy, that's the wrong way of doing it. So yeah, we need to
rethink what we can do. Now one of the things we can do many of the
things we can do which has been done in many states is that they've
expanded medicaid. They've expanded medicaid to increase that safety
net. What do we know here in North Carolina? Here in North Carolina
between ages eighteen and roughly sixty four, we've got about one point
six million people that don't have coverage. One point six million. We
expand Medicaid in this state it will increase that capacity to serve
that population by about five hundred thousand. That's something we can
do, and if we chose to do that, it could have a significant positive
impact upon our upon our economy and upon that population that we serve.
And with that in mind I send forth an amendment. [speaker changes] Clerk
will read. ?? [speaker changes] Senator McKissick moves to amend the
bill. [speaker changes]This particular provision will allow us to pick
up that fifty thousand, excuse me, that fifteen thousand people we're
ready to cast away. That we've been traditionally providing service to
in this state. Those that are blind, those that are disabled, those that
are medically needed. We can't cast them away. I can't do that in good
conscious. So what this amendment does, it doesn't allow that gaping
hole in our safety net to be created, it provides them with coverage,
but also goes further and expands Medicaid in this state. Say, what will
that do, well it will reduce our dependency in our budget by about eight
point one million dollars when it comes that those that require
assistance in a variety of areas in terms of mental health. In terms of
AIDS and drug assistance about another fourteen million dollars. And
even for those in our department of corrections in our prisons, as I
recall there, the numbers are also quite impressive because they will
qualify for about eight and a half million dollars. It's a significant
population that we can cover in this state that do not have services
today, and its time that we as a state took that courageous effort
that's needed to move forward and expand Medicaid to cover that
population. We need to do so. Are there things we can do to improve
management efficiency? Absolutely. I think we are all committed to doing
that. Are we committed to getting the highest utilization rate for our
resources, our biggest bang for the buck? Undoubtedly. But we also know
that we can capture two billion dollars a year coming into this state
and into this economy if Medicaid is expanded. We know that that
population that needs to be served that's unserved today doesn't have to
show up in emergency rooms at hospitals seeking care. We know that
likewise the hospitals that are in small and rural areas that are
suffering, that may pay more money underneath these hospital assessments
that are being proposed in this budget. We know won't be closing their
doors because disproportional impacts payments that might be distributed
to them might be tailored, cutback in years to come. So yes, we can make
a positive courageous effort. We can do what is the morally right thing
to do. We can cover a population that needs to be served. And medicaid
in North Carolina can symbolically and more importantly in a real
significant way improve the quality of life of those that are unserved
with healthcare today. We need to provide that safety net. We don't need
to create new holes and we don't need to provide a new directive to go
forth and come up with a new plan that provides the minimum level of
service that the law allows. So I appreciate your support. [speaker

speak to the amendment. [change speakers] you have the floor. Thank you
Mr. President. Senator Mickissick I don't think there is anyone in this
chamber who does not feel for people that are in need. I'm sure, I know
I do, I don't think anyone else is any different than I. It gets to a
point that when you talk about Medicaid expansion for what since two
thousand and eleven, this state has spent two billion dollars more in
Medicaid</p>

<p id="110:00">
Two billion, not million, billion, and it gets to a point where you say
let’s expand Medicaid more and your argument is that there’s no cost
associated with that, and maybe short term that is the case because the
federal government promises for what, three years that they’ll pay it
off, and then all of a sudden it becomes a 9010 proposition and then I
would argue probably it would roll eventually into what we have today as
far as Medicaid goes with the state paying a third of that cost
eventually. When you look at that cost you’re talking about that 9010
proposition which will come in a short period of time you’re probably
talking about a billion dollar hit to the state, another billion. Since
2011 we’ve spent two billion more and you’re proposing for us to spend
in three years another billion on top of the 5.6% growth that we’re
experiencing now in Medicaid which I would argue would probably be an
additional two billion dollars in about three years. I don’t know where
you think we can pay for it as a state but I’m not sure that I can
figure that out as appropriations chair. It gets to a point in this
state that you do have to look at priorities and I would argue for the
last five or six years, Medicaid has been the priority. There’s where we
have spent all the extra dollars in this state is on Medicaid. We’ve had
to cut every program in this state except for K-12 education to pay for
Medicaid expansion. When is enough enough? When do you finally say let’s
put some priorities in another area in this sate? And I think that’s
where we’re finally at in this state because you can’t afford it
anymore. We’ve finally gotten to that point I would argue. Again, two
billion dollars since 2011 and you’re asking us to spend what I think
would equate to about two billion more in the next three years on top of
that. That makes no sense, budget wise. Now we can argue what we do with
education and other things, I think what we’re doing in education is
great. We’re spending 8.1 billion dollars in K-12 education in this
budget compared to four years ago of 7.1 billion, a billion more dollars
in K-12 education in four years and that’s on top of having to deal with
this two billion dollar problem we’ve had in Medicaid. I just think
there’ s priorities that you have to make and those are tough decisions
in this state. We all want to take care of people in need, all of us do,
but sooner or later you have to look at dollars and what makes sense as
a state in what you fund, and so far in the past several years Medicaid
has been that priority. I think it’s time we start taking care of
teachers and start taking care of other areas in this budget moving
forward and let’s just take a break from Medicaid a little bit, and when
I say a little bit this budget spends two hundred million more in
Medicaid, it’s not much of a break, but sooner or later you’ve just got
to say no. You can’t spend anymore, you’ve got to slow it down. I think
5.6% increase every single year which is a track record is a pretty dang
good investment in Medicaid spending. I think it’s time we slow that
thing down. I don’t know how you think we can pay for this expansion, I
just don’t understand those numbers so I’ve got to ask that we vote
against this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Van Duyn for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. President, hospitals today right now in our
mountains and in rural hospitals throughout North Carolina deal with
very challenging pair mixes and what I mean by that, for example in my
hospital 70% of our patients are Medicaid, Medicare, or uninsured. What
that means is the ability for those hospitals to pay for the care that
they give to indigent, to the uninsured. The ability for them to spread
their cost is very very limited, in fact not existent. Without the
Medicaid expansion their very existence is threatened and that will
affect the health outcomes, not just of the poor, not just of the
uninsured, not just for Medicaid and Medicare recipients, but for all of
us and for that reason this is a priority that we cannot ignore and we
must deal with and that’s why I urge you to support this amendment.</p>

Further discussion or debate on amendment 10.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Brown a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, I know you’re a good man with a good heart. We’ve known
each other for many years, and I respect you enormously. But, at the
same time, within this budget we’re, we’re curtailing those services to
15,000 people. And we’re sending a directive asking that we reduce
services to the minimum level required under federal law. Do you believe
that that’s really the direction we should be taking in dealing with
Medicaid and providing for those that truly need these types of services
in our state who have nowhere else to go. No other safety net to capture
them. No funds to go out there and buy plans on the Affordable Care Act.
If you could help me with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will. I will try to help you with that. Senator McKissick, for many
years this state has been very, very generous. There’s no question. I’d
say, one of the most generous states in this nation. And what that has
done over the past few years is created a situation for us budget-wise
where we’ve had to spend those 2 billion dollars since 2011 to pay for
that. And where I would love to continue on that path, when you look at
the amount of growth that we’re having to spend in Medicaid moving
forward, I see no way that this state can pay for it, unless you want to
do some things that are pretty harsh to other areas of this budget. I
honestly don’t think you would want to do those things, moving forward,
to be quite honest. And I think it’s a time, even though they’re tough
decisions, and decisions none of us want to make, it gets to a point
that you have to make some of those tough decisions. Do you continue
spending 4, 5, 6 billion dollars a year to pay for Medicaid, or do you
try to fund other areas in state government? And we all love education.
I know I do as much as anybody. But, to do those things we’d like to do
in education, you, you’ve got to finally say let’s slow down somewhere
else, and that somewhere else just happens to be Medicaid, because it’s
been the absolute driver of this budget. And, as you know, when we had
that two and a half billion shortfall several years ago, part of that
problem was Medicaid. It put us in a severe hole that it took a while to
dig out of. And we’re continuously trying to figure that piece out.
Another 2 billion again this year over budget. Think about it. We
budgeted last year, and the best numbers we can come up with. Here we
come again, 200 more million dollars to balance in Medicaid because of
that growth. You’ve somehow got to figure out a way to slow that growth
down to take care of other things in state government. And it’s just
time that somebody makes some hard decisions. Do I want to make them? I
don’t. But it’s time we have to do some of those things to pay for other
things in, in our budget, including education, which is key to all of
us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Could I ask one question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just ask one final question to Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know this budget anticipates throwing out all the work that AK ?? has
done over the last year. By my calculations, they’ve spent probably
close to $4 million in a year’s time trying to come up with a way to do
cost containment, come up with affordable care organizations. I want to
know if you received a copy of this letter I got from the North Carolina
Medical Society. It’s dated today’s date which states that prohibiting
any work to be done regarding accountable care organizations and
Medicare reform that is very clear. In simple terms, the Senate states
the Department of Health and Human Services cease any activities related
to implementing Medicaid reform based on its proposed accountable care
organization model that the budget rejects the positive quality-centered
solutions proposed for Medicaid reform wasting over a year’s worth of
work and state resources dedicated to that goal. Did you receive a copy
of this? And what would your response be?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Work hard on that effort over the last year and
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, is there a question there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I did not receive that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

Mm-mm.

purpose do you rise?

Thank you, Mr. President. We’ve talked a lot about opening up a Medicaid
hole. I would propose to you that there is nothing you can do to open a

<p id="120:00">
Speaker 1: …as we move forward, we will even take this year, one of the
things I always talk about – it is 100% fully funded, sort of – that’s
kind of true. It is 100% fully funded for services, unless the patient
was previously eligible, at which point we drop back to 65%, and the
administration for those services is only funded at a 50/50 match. So it
is not - the federal definition of “100% fully funded” is a little odd
to me, i.e. what they mean by that. But if we go out to 2021, for
example, this amendment alone, in its expansion will cost the Dept. of
Health and Human Services $352 million. Now there will be some offset
savings in public safety and others for inmate healthcare, so the net
impact to the state budget will be $253 million annually – that is when
we are at a 90% match. That is as far as the federal legislation goes.
They could add another year, drop it back down to 65%, and watch those
numbers triple, which coming in. We serve, right now, nearly a fifth of
the state’s population is on Medicaid. Are you ready to see that exceed
a quarter of the state’s population when we add 6/700,000 addition
people to Medicaid as a result of this operation? So we can become the
largest insurer in the state - the state will be its largest insurer:
this is where we are going in this direction. This is a mistake. It was
a mistake on the federal level and I hope, once again, as we debated
this many times, we are not going to jump head long into this pool.
Speaker 2: Further discussion or debate on Amendment 10? Hearing none.
Question before the Senate is the passage of amendment 10 to Senate Bill

Speaker 2: Senator Graham, for what purpose do you rise?
Senator Graham: To speak on the bill.
Speaker 2: You have the floor.
Senator Graham: Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and gentleman, last week
I had the opportunity to visit a ??? school, and one of the student’s
asked me the difference between being a member of the Charlotte City
Council and its State Senator, and I paused and thought for a while, and
told him that the major difference to me was transparency and openness.
That as a member of the City council, we did everything in public – you
can even have five council members sit together or meet in a private
home without involving the press that you are doing that. There were
public meetings and hearings in which the public was always encouraged
to participate and provide feedback. Today, we are getting ready to pass
a $21 billion budget that many of us and the public got 48 hours ago. No
public input at all. The representatives, the people here that represent
the public, that serve on subcommittees, would not even afford the
opportunity to hear what is on the budget in their particular
subcommittees. That is why we are having this two hour debate today on
the floor because we did not have any openness in subcommittee meetings
where the public is could have been there, members of both parties could
have debated some of these issues there, instead of here. Forty-eight
hour window to study the budget, comprehend the budget, interpret the
budget, and explain the budget to people who are calling, writing,
emailing about what they are reading in their local newspaper, or local
political blogs. And it is not just that we are approving a budget in a
short period of time, with no public input, or subcommittee meetings, we
are making substantial changes to how state government operates,
particularly with Medicaid. You may be absolutely right that Medicaid
needs to stand alone. But this has some other voices involved in that
discussion.</p>

<p id="125:00">
One of the things that I told the young men at that ?? school is the
worst thing that I absorbed in ten years of being up here, on both
sides, the majority side and the minority side, is the caucus. Because
you get this equichamber where you go in there, ?? on both sides, and
you talk among yourselves, and you pat yourselves on the back for doing
a good job, presenting a good budget. But you’re talking to yourself!
You’re not talking to the public. You’re not talking to constituents.
You’re not talking to people who will be impacted by the decisions that
you are making. You’re talking to the equichamber. So it is a good
budget to you. It does solve problems, to you. And it may be a good
budget for me too, and for the public. If they were involved in the
discussion. If they had an opportunity to say I think you’re right but
you might want to do it this way, to make a good budget a great budget.
If there was some kind of public input. Even if there was public input
from the representatives of the people who sit among you today. So the
process again is flawed. The presentation is questioned. And so I stand
before you today, voicing my displeasure with this budget, based on the
number of emails I have received and we’ve been here long enough you
don’t want to hear me go on about what it does to healthcare. Or how it
impacts law enforcement and the FBI. My mailbox for teachers and the
teacher pay scheme runs over. ?? increase that we all agree that our
teachers, and I even go beyond teachers, is how we fund our educational
system in North Carolina. That’s the issue for me. How do we fund the
system? And how does teachers play a role in that process? They deliver
the service for us and they deserve and require an honest day’s pay for
an honest day’s work. But no teacher in North Carolina should have to
choose between giving up tenure, something they have earned, and legally
obligated to have, versus getting a pay increase. No teacher in North
Carolina should have to decide between getting a pay increase and losing
their teacher assistant. Because ?? service that helps, enables and
embodies the educational system. The school nurses, the teacher
assistants, the guidance counselors. All of that plays a role. And so
while this budget, and specifically the portion related to teachers, on
the surface sounds good, smells good, it is all style and no substance
because it undercuts the educational system as a whole. And therefore I
cannot support this budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further question or
debate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Goolsby, to what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to ask
a question to Senator Apodaca. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, do you
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator, you’ve been here a lot longer than me. In fact, you’ve
been here back when the Democrats were in the majority. And I’ve heard
Senator Stein to begin with, I’ve just heard from Senator ?? and I think
that I heard Senator McKissick also talk about the speedy budget process
and how quickly we’ve run this through. Can you enlighten the members
like me and the new folks as to how it worked and how warm the Senate
budget was from the printers before it was voted on. Could you let us
know? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. Thank you Senator Goolsby. When
you’d walk in the chamber and the budget would be laying on your desk,
you couldn’t touch it for a good 20 minutes, so it would cool. It was
just off the printer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have the floor. I do not yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of order. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] State your point. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Earlier on, we got some
straying away from the matter before us. And I think rightfully so, the
president confined the discussion to the bill in front of us. What
happened 5, 10, 15 years ago seems to be relevant to the bill that’s
before us now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, I think you’re right.</p>

Speaker1:  ...it is irrelevant to the bill, but it is relevant to the
previous discussion, so I will allow it.
Speaker 2: Thank you Mr. President. If you walked in the Chamber, the
Bill would be so hot you could not read it til it cooled. I will share
another experience with you: we never had 48 hours once - the most we
ever had was 24. I wandered in, by invitation, to a budget committee
meeting in room 612, was removed from the room, because I was not part
of that team, so, it is just a fallacy to hear the transparency. You
meet with your constituents, I met with my constituents last week, with
all my superintendents to discuss the budget with them. also, last week,
I met with 8 school teachers and discussed it with them. So, I just
cannot buy that argument.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Anymore discussion or debate? Senator Jackson for
what purpose do you rise?
Senator Jackson: To speak to the bill.
Speaker 1: You have the floor.
Senator Jackson: Our State Bureau of Investigation performs several
functions: one is investigating state corruption. In the last 10 years,
our SBI has investigated two governors, several cabinet secretaries, the
Dept. of Public Correction, the Division of Motor Vehicles, the State
Hwy. Patrol, and several members of this esteemed body. In fact, over
the last 10 years, the SBI has conducted over 500 investigations into
public officials. This Bill moves the SBI from the Dept. of Justice,
where it is a truly independent investigator of authority, and moves it
to the Dept. of Safety, where it reports to a cabinet secretary, who
reports to the governor. The concern is that this will compromise the
independence of the SBI and make it more susceptible to political
influence. The concern is also the public appearance that will be caused
when our elected officials are being investigated by the same cops that
they employ. Here is a hypothetical example: let’s say there is a mayor,
and let’s say that people become suspicious that he may be taking
bribes. Who do you send to investigate? Do you send the local police,
who work for the mayor? No, because that creates a potential conflict of
interest, and it undermines faith in the underlying investigatory
process at the precise moment when you want to show people that the
system works. To show people that there is a firewall between the
people, and corrupt politicians. Way back, in the early part of this
moth, about three weeks ago, I was the Assistant District Attorney. And
the best part about that job is that you never have to make an argument
about which you do not personally believe: if you think he is guilty,
you bring the case; if you think he is not guilty, you dismiss the case.
You let your conscience be your guide in the pursuit of justice. If you
put this agency in a position where it has to report to a director, who
is appointed by the governor, and approved by the General Assembly, you
are putting that type of independence at risk. Now I already mentioned
that in the last decade that the SBI has investigated governors and some
of us, but what I didn’t mention is that now, and at any given time, the
SBI has a dozen investigations going on into the Dept. of Public Safety.
There are people that this bill puts them underneath. That is why, Mr.
President, I am sending forth this Amendment.
Speaker 1: Set forth your Amendment, the clerk will read.
Speaker 3: Senator Jackson moves to amend the bill.
Speaker 1: Senator Jackson has the floor to explain the amendment.
Senator Jackson: It is a very simple amendment: no transfer of the SBI.
I urge your support.
Speaker 1: Any further discussion or debate on Amendment 20?
Senator Goolsby: Mr. President?
Speaker 1: Senator Goolsby for what purpose do you rise?
Senator Goolsby: I would like to discuss the amendment.
Speaker 1: You have the floor.
Senator Goolsby: Thank you Mr. President. I appreciate Senator Jackson’s
views. I do oppose them. What we are trying to do, in transferring the
SBI, and actually have Senator Newton, when he made his remarks,
actually I have a list I will be happy to share with anyone, and it
shows you how many states have a department or SBI type of agency...</p>

<p id="135:00">
The attorney general under the governor. That is only eight states
including us that has it under the attorney general, who I would point
out to the good Senator, is an elected official. He appoints the SBI
director with no oversight by the elected representatives in these
chambers in the general assembly. What we have proposed is this, Mr.
President, is that the SBI be transferred with all the rest of state law
enforcement, under the department of public safety, and that the SBI
director be nominated by our governor and approved by both houses. He
will then have the authority not to be removed by the governor, as the
attorney general can now remove the SBI director, but he will actually
serve for a term of eight years. As Senator Newton said earlier,
spanning various administrations. He will answer to no one, unless he
steps out of line and would be impeached. But when he’s making decisions
about political corruption, or any other difficult decision, he makes
those based upon the top law enforcement officer that he is. And I have
no doubt that our governor will appoint someone who is worthy of that
position and high honor. That these chambers will approve someone, and
that non-political person will then take over the agency and will see to
it that our state bureau of investigation is run properly and
appropriately, and makes the right decisions. The way it’s done at the
federal level. I would also point out that at the local level, our
district attorney’s offices, the sheriff’s department and deputies, the
police departments don’t work under our local prosecutors. And there is
no reason at least 42 other states believe, that the attorney general
should be in charge of the state’s top law enforcement investigative
branch. This is a most reasonable plan. This is a plan that will see to
it that we take any taint out of the state bureau of investigation. We
have a lot of fine agents over there. If you’re like me, you’ve received
lots of calls from agents, welcoming this type of change and this
ability. That fine agency has had many black eyes in the past. I was
reading the news and observer articles as I was sitting here. Those
agents deserve better. They deserve a non-political director. They
deserve to be removed from politics. They deserve to be able to carry
out their functions without any impediment and that is exactly what
we’re doing here. And I would ask you to oppose this amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, to what purpose
do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. To debate the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks so much. I very much appreciate Senator Goolsby recalling to us
the importance of our local sheriffs, and I have here a position paper
from the North Carolina Sheriff’s Association. And let me just read a
couple sentences from that. North Carolina Sheriffs Association has a
long-standing position against the establishment of a state police with
state-wide policing powers. So you all are trying to create a state
police force. Big government. And you’re doing it with an executive who
once is confirmed, is not removable. I think the FBI went through that
with J. Edgar Hoover and it didn’t turn out great for our civil
liberties. The Sheriff’s Association concludes there is no good public
policy for this transfer. Moving the SBI to DEPS will hinder, not help,
local law enforcement. North Carolina does not need a state police
agency. I’m all about public safety. And if the sheriffs think this is a
bad idea, and you all think it’s a good idea, why don’t we actually have
a hearing and a judiciary committee meeting where somebody other than
you people in your closed caucus get to debate it? I have never seen
this bill. I have never had a chance to debate this bill. I’ve never had
a chance to hear a sheriff come and talk to you and try to convince you
of the errors of your ways. Have confidence in yourselves and the
quality of your ideas. And if you have confidence, you’ll let the people
weigh in, then we can debate it. This is a good amendment and you all
should vote for it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate.
Senator Apodaca, to what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak
on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I’ve enjoyed the debate on this

...active SBI agent, or retired SBI agent, that did not want to be
transferred to Justice and Public Safety. Not one. I've had groups come
by my office in the District to talk about that, so they could be
treated fairly. They feel like red-headed step children. Senator Stein
brought up some very good points about the ultimate authority of who can
discipline the Director of the SBI. So, with that being said, I'd like
to send forth a substitute amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Send forward your amendment. Clerk will read (?)
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Apodaca moves to amend the Bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Apodaca has the floor to explain the substitute amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you Mr President. Members, if you'll look on the dashboard, I
believe, is it up now? Okay, we're inserting language in paragraph b,
'the Director may be removed from office by the Governor for any of the
grounds set forth in GS143b-13b or c'. This just lays out the reasons,
if the Director violates the law, how he can be relieved of his duties
by the Governor.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr President.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I think this is a great amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Newton for what purpose do you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
To speak to the amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
The substitute amendment?
SPEAKER CHANGES
The substitute amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
You have the floor.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you Mr President. Thank you Senator Apodaca for bringing forth
this substitute amendment. I think this is a very wise thing to do. It
would be appropriate to remove the SBI Director if he was convicted of a
felony, or if he moved out of State, which are some of the provisions in
the statute. I think that was a very strong and important addition to
this provision. It strikes me very, very deeply to hear some of the
debate on this point. Senator Jackson hasn't had the benefit of having
been here for a while, so he wouldn't remember that this provision has
come up before and has been debated before. I believe it was in our
budget last time. I believe it was debated before I got here and I'm
certain Senator Stein and others in this Chamber that have been here a
while have had this debate, and have heard from the SBI agents that want
to get moved. Because, I mean, I've probably spent a couple of hours
talking to several dozen of them, who have been chomping at the bit for
years because of the poor leadership that they're under at the AG's
office. It's time that we recognised that our law enforcement community,
you know, if we wanted to have a state police department we would call
it the North Carolina State Police. We wouldn't have a separate ALE. We
wouldn't have a separate Highway Patrol. We have uniquely set up a
situation where the SBI is independent, and under an independent
Director that can only be removed under this amendment, and for obvious
reasons that everybody in this Chamber would agree to. But to stay in
there and posit as if this is some sort of secret conspiracy to slip the
SBI out from underneath the grasp of our current AG is ludicrous. It's
been going on for a long time that this effort has been under way. This
move is going to bring great efficiencies to our State. We're going to
save money on IT. Right now we have IT in law enforcement in different
silos, we're going to save money with different training schools that
we're going to be able to consolidate. We'll be able to send SBI agents
and ALE agents and highway patrolmen and the other law enforcement
agencies to one school instead of having different schools for all the
different agencies. It'll also be great for the career path of our law
enforcement personnel. When they get tired of riding in a patrol car on
the long nights on the interstate, when it's really time for them to do
something else, they don't have to get promoted to a desk job in Raleigh
in order to have a career path in the Highway Patrol. They're going to
be more easily able to move into something else like, maybe qualify to
be an SBI agent, maybe become a top notch investigator. This is going to
create great efficiencies in our State. There has been a lot of thought
put into this and a lot of debate put into this and a lot of
conversation, mostly with SBI agents. I commend the amendment to you.

can show your sheriff whether you support him or whether you don't

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, what purpose [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the substitute amendment briefly, Senator--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Senator Blue now and Senator Stein both talked about
there being no debate on this issue. I would concur with Senator Newton
who has been with me on the Justice and Public Safety; he's now moved up
of course last time to a full chair. We have debated this issue over the
last three years that I've been here! And it was actually in the budget,
as Senator Newton said last time. And as far as our good sheriffs go, I
know that to a man or woman if you ask them, whether or not they would
like to give up their independence and work directly for the district
attorney, of their county, they would tell you no. Now, when we talk
about where SBI should be, it should be under an independent director,
not under a council of state elected politician, to whom the director
serves at his or her will. I ask you to vote for this substitute
amendment. Let's make this happen. It is past time. It will only be,
after we get this done, seven states in the Union that still put theirs
under the attorney general and we'll be with the large majority of other
states because we've done the right thing here, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As Senator Blue said, we [??] you guys up-and-down vote. Separation of
powers is a really good idea. To avoid manipulation, to avoid undue
influence, to avoid control in an inappropriate way. We've had an
independent SBI functioning and operating, investigating Republicans,
Democrats, anybody who was involved in corruption in this state. It
might have been public officials. The record is clear. SBI has
functioned well. We might be only one of eight states that does it this
way, but maybe that's the model we want to stand by, and stick by. I
really have to ask rhetorically, but I think I know the answer to it
already. Are we doing this because Ray Cooper happens to be a Democrat
attorney general? Is that why we're doing it? Because that would appear
to be the case. Same as [??] mother cuts in this bucket, with the
auditor's office? [??] Insurance. No other places where there are
Democrats are there particular agencies. So I ask that we look at this
amendment for what it is. It kills the original amendment that was put
forth by Senator Jackson, which deserves an up-and-down vote, and yes,
this does deserve a public debate, public scrutiny. I'm not aware that
this year [??] in public safety ever meeting, in a scheduled meeting to
debate this issue or discuss this issue at all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate? Hearing none. Question for the Senate, is
the passage of Amendment 12 to Senate bill 744. All in favor will vote
aye, all opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting. Clerk will record the vote. 31 having voted in the affirmative
and 16 in the negative. Amendment 12 passes, and by rule Amendment 11 is
defeated. The bill is back to for [??]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. My colleagues, three thoughts come to mind as
I review this bill and as I reflect over the arguments that you've heard
so far this afternoon and now evening. First one is an old lesson that I
was taught long time ago that he who does not learn the lessons of
history is bound to repeat its mistakes. This bill offers us a good
opportunity to observe that rule. You know the term we're cleaning up
the process so the budget bill really became the budget bill...</p>

Speaker: What we just got to be debating is not nearly to the budget
relates subsistence law where agents are to be the many other provision
in this bill that relates all of the subsistence that you read it of the
?? creating three judge course accord what we doing like rolling some
judges what we doing as constitution i many places the issues that we do
worth in this budgets should be dealt with the substance of committee so
we don't continue this doing on the floor no so we bound to beat the
mistakes because we follow this process before and it is taken the
better part of 25 years to ?? up those practices this budget leads us
further down the road putting substance of material in budget bills
because we don't wanna go through this process that has proven to be the
past legislation ,the second point that i wanna raise it reminded me of
the passage and loop for team says when we ?? the lane and the ?? and
you will be blessed ?? think about what this budget does and we think
about and it all the last couple f years we have a feast and ?? to come
,the plan the lane the poor and everybody but rather than ?? and passage
tend basically we gonna tell them out are gonna cut them shear in the
bounty of the feast what we are talking about those we are cutting about
disabled ?? and other who come to rely on what we do as a state ?? the
third thing that cursed me about the budget is i have been wrestling and
trying to figure out that some of your first or secondly teachers must
have done to you because what we have done to the teachers of the state
was this budget or with the earliest of budgets is gotta take some and
probably add on them who know how they angered you or ??  you but it
must should be every young age because is is deeply embarrasses in the
way that we are training teachers,you all know that even the governor
said that the approach to the senator have taken ?? it's not the point
that he get ?? because it is  the point that is not comprehensive enough
and it doesn't deal with the whole of the idea that we are ??  and how
we are should be teaching ,the people that we see among the most
important in this free democratic society of hours or teachers the
governors quite got it right ,you need to look at the whole experience
you need text book you need technology,you need to know that these  kids
are getting an opportunity to develop all they are capable of developing
them to and we need to know what kind of comprehensive plan we gonna
have to teach all teachers fairly and bring them to national level all
of it and all of it again on the floor to my colleagues in the majority
party and to the governor to work closely with all of you to
comprehensive bring our teachers salaries to national average not play
this sure game this played in the budget bill ,i got an email that i
looked at it very closely because it tells a lot of what our teacher
beginning to experience ,from the young man teacher i think in ??
county,he had written that to of this morning i m very upset and
offended by current senator proposal for teacher pay for this budget
cycle and several reasons for it but one of the thing he prompts of is
you are going to cut ten thousand more teachers assistant possession OK
our k3 cant even take a bathroom break right now because on teaching
assistant has assigned a five rooms in this busy running for moving to
room.Have you ever tried to teach 20 students aged5-7 with only one
teacher.These students are not allowed to leave the students on ?? for
any reasons.</p>

I cannot slip out to the restroom, meanwhile the poor teaching assistant
is running room to room when they called him just so that they could
take a bathroom break. Then he goes on to say that hes going through all
kinds of trouble with his home mortgage trying to get it modified, and
sort of leaves the impression that hes very disappointed in what were
trying to. This is one of the people that you say your aiming this raise
at. Abe Lincoln I think is the one that said you can fool some of the
people some of the time, fool all of the people some of the time, but
you cant fool all of the people all of the time. and if we think that we
are fooling these teachers, who are demoralized already by these tricks
and these shenanigans and this budget then the only ones we are fooling
are ourselves. I hope that at some point  you will take up the offer,
now that we constantly extend it to you and that is let us sit together
and reason and figure how were gonna deal with this crisis that
threatens to undermine what we were busy building this state into
because if we dont deal with this teacher crisis systems all over the
state and especially on the borders are going to continue to lose good
teachers. we are loosing nine hundred teachers from the wake county
public school system this year experienced teachers maybe you can we
cant afford to keep that up and so these teachers will be even more
dissuaded to stay in the classrooms when they start figuring out these
games that we are playing and if you truly do believe that we are to
give them an eleven percent increase this year if you truly do believe
that lets set eleven percent as the baseline and lets guarantee that
this raise is going to continue beyond this year and lets take some of
this language out of this budget bill that makes reasonable people know
that its just a game you're playing youre not raising a salary in a way
that it will be sustained as the governor said it has to be something

for what purpose do you rise?
Senator Stein: To debate the amendment.
Speaker 1: You have the floor.
Senator Stein: Thank you Mr. President, and thank you for giving us time
to review it. By my count there were 7 or 8 changes to the provision
dealing with the three judge panel which, frankly, just proves the
point: we should have had this go through a committee, let a committee
review it, and actually have the Bill fixed – who knows what else is
wrong with this language. I am going to be voting against this
amendment. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Further discussion or debate on Amendment 17? Senator
McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
Senator McKissick: To speak on the amendment.
Speaker 1: You have the floor.
Senator McKissick: Like Senator Stein, I have some grave concerns about
the language here dealing with the three judge panel. I see no reason
for these cases that may involve constitutional issues of policies not
to be continued to be considered by traditional superior court judges,
single judge, whether they may be…</p>

?? County, whether it's in Gilford County to establish a new process to
have these three judge panels, where the Chief Justice of the North
Carolina Supreme Court appoints them.  Only the Chief Justice, three
judges doing it, it seems purposefully established to circumvent a
process that has been tried and true for years, proven to be successful
simply because some of the decisions that have been made relating to
policies that have been adopted by this body were challenged on
Constitutional grounds.  And when they were challenged, they were
determined to be unconstitutional.  Most recent being the ?? Provisions.
 So to really structurally reestablish our court system, our Judicial
system, to escape the type of scrutiny that these cases would have.
Cases are only decided, goes to the Court of Appeals.  We don't need a
new process.  So I'm voting against this.
[President] Further discussion or debate, Senator Newton, what purpose
do you rise?
[Senator Newton] Speak to the amendment.
[President] You have the floor.
[Senator Newton] Thank you Mr. President.  I just find it interesting to
hear the comments from the minority on this provision about the panel
and this amendment that would improve it.  There's a history here, I'm
sure Senator McKissick and Senator Stein and some of the others are
familiar with some of the past history of the three judge panels in the
state.  Redistricting back in 2003, I believe you might remember Senator
Ran[?] talked about it and he said it would improve the quality of
justice.  I believe I'm quoting from November 25, 2003 the redistricting
committee “I think that by doing that we materially improve the quality
of the justice.  And we do a better job.  And we say to our people that
this is a process that can be done without fear of favoritism and
without fear of political influence.”  And as to three judge panels, as
far as protecting the Judicial Branch in regards to federal three judge
panels for constitutional challenges Nathaniel Jones, who at the time in
1974 was NAACP General Counsel explained that a single judge confronted
by such controversial issues or statutes is  less likely than a two or
three judge to find the facts and make the judgments which would make
him subject to hostile public opinion.  It's a simple fact of human
nature that in numbers there is strength and judges, despite the
protection of the judicial robe, are no less human than rest of us.
This provision is actually going to do a lot to protect our judicial
branch.  It's certainly going to do a lot to protect our democratic
process.  As you gentlemen know the law is pretty clear that the acts of
the general assembly are presumed to be constitutional, unless it's
pretty clear that they're not.  The people elect us from all over the
state and what we want to do here is make sure that were not having the
will of the people thwarted by venue shopping.  So with this three judge
panel being selected from three different regions of the state and being
independent, we believe we can avoid that.  I urge our members to
support the amendment.
[President] Is there further discussion or debate on Amendment 17?
Hearing none, the question for the Senate is the passage of Amendment
17.  All in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no.  Five seconds

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, for what purpose you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just committed to my constituents to make three
brief points on this bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. one is that medicate is not considered just
a program it’s all about human beings basic needs and more importantly
jobs in our area all of these cuts not only will affect the human beings
but it would affect the mini jobs in eastern north Carolina and
particularly my district where healthcare is a major employment sector.
Adding to that by eliminating optional services for example when a
person with a stroke can’t have physical speech therapy or person with
an amputation not a prosthesis is basically dooming them to permanent
disability and lack of economic viability. the second point is that our
hospitals are taking a big hit in Halifax county for example my hospital
was taking a couple of 100 thousand dollars hit in the budget on top of
a struggle that they’re already having with the 700 thousand dollar loss
due to the lack of expansion of Medicaid and mediocre changes and this
is happening throughout my district and these hospitals are major
economic drivers taking 50000 dollars as sort of accumulative hit are
more on this budget and thirdly founding correctional centers for women
is closing in our area 150 jobs almost which is sort of a kick in the
gut to us where we are having some of the highest job losses in the
state and we just feel like this budget in terms of a job respected for
our region is not helping us and as my constituents want you all to know
that as a body and for that reason I’ll be voting no on the budget.
Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate senator Apodaca, for what
purpose you rise
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President I think I have got the last amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forward your amendment. The clerk will read
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca moves to amend the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. president members, senator Blue, your
comments about teacher assistants you know we gonna loose some and I
think it’s appropriate that we set up a scholarship fund for some of
those displaced teacher assistant so this amendment sets up a 5 million
dollar scholarship fund for teacher assistants who are displaced from
their jobs in the classroom and I ask your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate on amendment 20
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, for what purpose you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask Senator Apodaca A question
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How would this ?? program operate, senator Apodaca? Is
it eligible for any and all teaching assistants that are about to be
laid off, I guess that’s 7500 or so or how will it function, how will it
operate, who will be eligible?

Speaker 2: Any further discussion or debate on Senate Bill 744? Senator
Berger is recognized: for what purpose do you rise?
Senator Berger: Speak to the bill.
Speaker 2: Senator has the floor
Senator Berger: Thank you Mr. President. Members of the Senate, we have
heard a lot of discussion and we have seen a lot of amendments. We
started a little after four and it is now a little after seven, and a
lot has been said about this budget, and a lot will be said as we go
forward. As you know, this is just one step in the process: this has to
go over to the House; the House will do whatever they are going to do:
and then we will end up with, more than likely, will a conference
committee who will work things out. But there are several things I would
like to say about this. The key thing is: what are the priorities in
this budget? I think first and foremost, the priority in this budget is
the priority that every member of this body has said the priority for
them is to raise teacher pay. You know NC, for a number of years, has
dealt with something that has become a continuing embarrassment around
the country. You all have the cited the statistics; we have cited the
statistics. We are picking a number: are we 44th, 45th, 46th? It really
does not matter if we are that far down on average teacher pay: it is
not good for our state, for our ability to recruit and maintain our
teaching profession, for our ability to recruit jobs to this state, and
it is not good for our teachers, or for our kids. And so, the priority
in this budget is to address this problem. And it is a problem that has
festered for years. I was first elected to the NC Senate in 2000. I do
not remember what the number was in 2000, 20001, but I will dare to say
that we were in the 40’s then, and in 2002, 2203,2004,2005,2006, and
Democratic and Republican administrations. And so, what this budget does
is it looks at that as the number one priority, as far as adopting a
budget. And how does this budget address that? Well, it addresses it in
a way that moves us from you pick your number in the 40’s – 46th, 47th,
whatever, into you can pick your number in the 20’s – 27th in the
nation, maybe a little better than that, maybe a little worse – that’s
not accounting for all the things people like to use as excuses for
where we are, i.e. such as cost of living, other benefits – that sort of
thing. It moves us to 27th, and it does that by giving teachers, on
average, a raise of 11%, on average, a raise of more than $5,800. Make
no mistake about it, you vote against this budget, you vote against
giving a raise to teachers. There is no question about it. You can dodge
the issue, you can talk about other things…</p>

<p id="180:00">
but the centerpiece of this budget is that raise. And it's funded, it is
fully funded with recurring dollars. And it is something that will
transform the state of North Carolina in terms of the image of the state
of North Carolina in connection with how we pay teachers. And it will do
something else, the single most important thing we can do to improve
student achievement in our schools is to have a high quality, highly
qualified teacher at the head of the classroom. And what this will do is
it will not only enable the teachers we have to stay there. Those
teachers that are worried about paying the mortgage. Those teachers that
are worried whether not they can pay to buy a new car. Those teachers
that are worried about whether or not they can put aside some money for
the kids to go to college. It'll attract more qualified teachers to the
classroom. We've had people read letters. Well i'll give you an example:
We got a call from a teacher who used to teach in North Carolina in the
public schools. She went to one of the private schools in Charlotte, and
she went there for a couple of reasons. One of them was the pay another
had to do with the students she'd be working with, but it was primarily
the pay. I got a call from her. She said &quot;If this goes
through&quot;, this is a teacher with a masters degree, &quot;if this
goes through I'm coming back to the public system. I'm gonna apply for a
job in the public system.&quot; That's the kind of thing that this sort
of raise will do. Now, question is, why can't we do everything? Why
can't we not reduce the teacher assistance and give this raise? Why
can't we not make some reductions in medicade? Which are really not
reductions, it's only reductions in government talk, because to me if
you're spending more this year than you spent last year, I don't see how
you can make that out as a reduction but I've heard that over and over
again over the last 15 years but that's the arguments that we have here.
Well, you have to make choices and those choices are within the
parameters of what you have. So Here are the choices that we have: We
can either leave teacher pay like it is, do nothing, continue to get
pounded by folks all over the nation that we're 47th or maybe 48th or
maybe we'll move up to 45th. It really doesn't matter cause none of
those are good enough. Or we can raise taxes to fund some of these
things. Well, the interesting thing is, hardly ever us News Observer as
a source and every once in a while I have to get my glasses out, but
News Observer wrote an article actually The Reporter wrote an article
May 13,2014, Democrats Try to Up the Ante on Teacher Pay. And this was a
press conference that Senator Blue and Representative Hall had, I don't
know if any other members of the democratic caukis were there but it
indicates that Hall and Blue took a stance against, talking about the
tax increases against rolling them back or increasing taxes to pay for
teacher salary hikes. So, folks you can't have it both ways. You're
either for raising pay for teachers and you're going to find a way to do
it, and that's what we've done in this budget or you're not for it.
You're just talking about it. And so here you have a budget that raises
the pay significantly. Vote against it you're voting against teacher pay
raises. Vote for it, you're voting to put North Carolina on the map in
terms of recruiting and retaining high quality teachers in our public
schools. I urge you to vote for the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further
discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the senate is
the passage of senate bill 744 on its second reading. All in favor will
vote aye all opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting and the clerk will record the vote. 32 having voted in the
favorable, 15 in the negative. Senate bill 744 remains on the calender.</p>

Notices and announcements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chair. Ladies and gentlemen all of us
are aware that 2 days ago we lost a very famous and dedicated person in
the state of North Carolina and the world, Dr. Maya Angelou. And I take
this opportunity this evening to remember her, I personally met her
several times, talk with her. She came to ?? college, she was an
emeritus board trusties member there and she was very special to all of
us and she did North Carolina proud. She was really a product of who we
really are as a state. So I wanna read just a few pieces on her. Dr.
Maya Angelou was one of the most renowned and influential voices of our
time. He hold us a global renaissance woman, Dr. Angelou. Is a
celebrated poet, memoirist, novelist, educator, dramatist producer,
actress, historian film maker and silver rise activist. Born on April
4th 1928 in Saint Louis, Missouri. Dr. Angelou was raised in Saint Louis
in ?? Arkansas. Dr. Angelou experienced the brutality of racism and
discrimination. But she also absorbed the unshakable faith and values of
traditional African-American families, communities and culture. As a
teenage Dr. Angelou's love for the arts won her scholarship to study
dance and drama at St. Francisco’s labor school. At 14 however she
dropped out to become St. Francisco's first African-American female
cable car conductor. She later finished high school, given birth to her
son - guy a few weeks after graduation. As a young single mother, she
supported her son by working as a waitress and cook. However her passion
for music, dance, and performance in poetry would soon take center
stage. In 1954 and 55, Dr. Angelou toured Europe with the production of
the opera Porgy and Bess. She later studied modern dance with Martha
Graham, dance with [Alben alley] and many others. We all remember her
first album – Calypso Lady and we also note her performances in many
other dramas. In 1960 she moved to Cairo, Egypt where she served as an
editor of the English language we read weekly, The Arab Observer. During
her years abroad she read and studied veraciously, mastering French,
Spanish, Italian, Arabic and the West African language [Funty]. While in
Ghana, she met Malcolm X. With a guy that support friend the novelist
James Baldwin, she began work on the book that would become - I know why
the cage bird sings. Published in 1970, that book that book was
published to international claim and enormous popular success. The list
of her public works, nonfiction and fiction now includes more than 30
bestselling titles. A trailblazer of film and television, Dr. Angelou
wrote the screenplay and composed a score for Georgia. And I will stop
right there because hopefully you all know and have read and have had
the experiences that Dr. Angelou brought to our state, our nation and
our world. Because having grown up herself from poverty, a single mother
like many of those we talk about today and then an educator as well and
a famous poet.</p>
