  ...I wish we could have put that in our prayer, but anyway, also I see
the reverend is gone.  I was going to talk to him about his demon
deacons last night, but he’s already left the building, so he left them
out of the prayer also.  And then I had something I wanted to say to the
Girl Scouts about the handsome young man doctor, but I’m gonna leave
that alone also.
Mr. President, Senate Bill 181, Wake County Commissioner’s district is
listed second on our calendar.  Today I move that it be put on first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Senate Bill 125, Jim Folgen?, Teen Skin

re-referred to the committee on healthcare.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Senate Resolution 232 honoring the Girl
Scouts, the bill was filed yesterday.  I move to suspend the rules and
have it introduced today and placed on the calendar for immediate
consideration now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Resolution, we’re gonna move right into the calendar, Senator, so
starting with Senate Resolution 232, ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Resolution 232, resolution honoring the Girl Scouts of the USA by
Senator Barringer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Resolution 232, clerk will read again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Resolution 232, honoring Girl Scouts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ladies and gentlemen, I’m here to rise on
behalf of the Girl Scouts.  For 46 years, I have been a member of this
wonderful organization.  It has shaped my life and the lives of many,
many girls.  In NC, there are at least 60,000 Girl Scout members and
there are tens of thousands of adult Girl Scout leaders and volunteers.
Today, we bring forth this resolution in honor of you, in honor of that
wonderful institution that was founded in 1912 by Juliette Gordon Low,
and so ladies and gentlemen, I commend the Girl Scouts to you and their
wonderful, wonderful organization.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any discussion or debate?  Sen. Robinson, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I rise to thank Sen. Barringer for that.  I too am so very proud of the
work of the Girl Scouts.  It happens that as I grew up in GA, we
couldn’t afford, you all think I’m ancient, but we couldn’t afford to be
a part of the Girl Scouts, but I’m proud of the fact that my own
daughter was the first teenager to serve on the board of the Tar Heel
Triangle Girl Scout Council in our area...and to win the Gold Award, and
we’ve seen a lot of girls have the opportunity to learn leadership
skills, to learn how to work together on different community projects,
the importance of recognizing differences and sameness, and really
getting to know each other and to promote community.
So we’re very proud of the work that the Girl Scouts in NC do.  And
they’re well known across the country.  I’ve even traveled to national
conferences with them, so we’re extremely proud of the work they do,
their parents who support them, the different churches, the different
organizations in our communities that give them a place to meet as well
too.  So we’re proud of that.  Sen. Barringer, I thank you for that and
I join you in commending this resolution and thank you, Girl Scouts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Smith-Ingram, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I rise to support the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, would you like to speak to the resolution?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to thank Girl Scouts USA.  Growing up in TX and NC, I was so
privileged to be a part of this wonderful organization.  This wonderful
organization taught me leadership skills that I carry today on the
senate floor.  I’m especially excited about all of the Girl Scout
cookies, the Do-si-dos, the Samoas, the Lemon Cremes are all among my
favorite.  Trefoils will always be close in my heart.  I am especially
excited sincerely about the new initiative of Girl Scouts, and that is
pushing the STEM fills and STEM programs.  We need more women in science
technology, engineering and mathematics.  So thank you, Senator and...

  Thank you Girl Scouts for what you’re doing today to increase the
involvement of women in the STEM and Science fields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Senator Bingham, for what purpose you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ladies and gentlemen of the Senate. I know you’re probably
wondering why I have risen. I was not a Girl Scout, but I had 4
daughters who were and my wife was a scoutmaster. And actually, I served
on the Tar Heel Girl Scout Board with some pretty cantankerous ladies
and I’ve eaten thousands of Girl Scout cookies and recently bought some
from some girl scouts here in Raleigh. It’s a wonderful organization and
my girls enjoyed Girl Scouts, with except to the camping part, which
they didn’t know how to pitch a tent without being in a mud hole or
something, so they’d always come home sick. But, they had a good
experience and it was very rewarding for them. And, thank all of you for
being here. Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McInnis, what purpose you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I rise to support this motion, if I might say a word or
two.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can speak to the resolution, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. I’m very proud of the Girl Scouts and all they have
done, especially here in rural North Carolina. In my job as a real
estate agent for the last 43 years, I’ve had many, many defining
moments. But, one of the most defining moments was our opportunity to
sell a beautiful piece of property in Richmond County, North Carolina,
that has become one of the premiere Girl Scout camps in America. And, we
are very proud of that Girl Scout camp in Richmond County. It’s in the
Derby area close to Pinehurst and it fulfills a great need of girls
being able to get out into the wilds, if you will, into the rural areas
of North Carolina and see the great things that we have in that area.
And, I rise to support this motion. Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Any other discussion or debate? Senator Tarte, for
what purpose your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? has the floor, speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, since everybody’s talking, I thought this would be pretty
important. I don’t want to be remised in recognizing both my wife and my
daughter, who both have their Gold Award and for the gentlemen in the
room, the Eagle Scouts, I believe we have 12, but the Gold Award is the
most recognized as the equivalent of the Eagle Scout Award. What I want
to share and this is to speak to the girls, the scouts themselves.
Having worked for both IBM and having been a former partner at Ernst
&amp; Young, great big companies that recruit at campuses all over this
country and I will tell you when you get out of college that all these
recruiters look at are the things you did in college. They will not care
if you were the star on the basketball team in high school. They won’t
care if you had the lead role in a play. They’re probably not even going
to care that much if you were your high school valedictorian. The one
thing that they all want to know though and the only thing that carries
forward from high school, were you a Gold Award winner. Because what it
does is speaks to who you are as a person. It demonstrates that you have
discipline and commitment. It demonstrates the type of character and
ethics that you have as a person. There’s nothing that will stay with
you like being a Gold Award winner for the rest of your life. So,
commend to you to continue to pursue that goal. It is a worthy goal and
it’s one that people will recognize who you are for the rest of your
life. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator. Any other discussion or debate? Hearing now the
question for the Senate is the motion to adopt Senate Resolution 232. We
will have one electronic vote. All in favor will vote aye, opposed will
vote no. 5 seconds will be allowed for the voting and the clerk will
record the vote. Senator Jackson, Jackson, aye. 37 having voted in the
affirmative, 0 in the negative. Senate Resolution 232 is adopted.
Senator Barringer has the floor for a point of personal privilege out of
order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. President. I rise today for a very, very
special recognition. The Girl Scout has for girls from the age 5 to 15 a
National Lifesaving Medal of Honor Award and it’s awarded to a Girl
Scout in that age range that has saved a life, actually saved a life.
And, I would like right now for Erin Elmo, who should be here on the
floor with us wave there Erin, and Grace Therington, who should be in
the gallery. Grace, where are you? There she is. These two ladies and
not together have been awarded this award. Let me tell you just a little
bit about it. Erin of Holly Springs, one of my constituents, while.

  In a fast food restaurant saved a customer’s life who was choking. She
did what we used to call the Heimlich maneuver, and imagine if any of us
were in a fast food restaurant wouldn’t we love to have someone like
Erin there to save our lives. Thank you. And then we have Grace up in
the gallery and she rescued here 3 year old cousin from the swift
currents of the Pawmonkey River in Virginia and I’m sure she used all of
the appropriate and very, very hard earned lifesaving skills to be able
to do this. Ladies and gentlemen, I commend these two to you for their
courage and heroism and I’m sure that a great deal of that came from
their experiences before from their Girl Scout leaders and Girl Scouts.
Ladies, I’m humbled to be here before you. Thank you. [applause]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And at this time the chair is also very pleased to
extend courtesies of the gallery to all of our Girl Scouts and Girl
Scout leaders. If all of you up there would please stand and be
recognized. Thank you all for being here as well. [applause] And Senator
Barringer, I think you wanted to send forward a Senatorial Statement as
well. You can send that forward at this time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, sir. Absolutely I will. I was so excited about the award. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If we could have a page get the Senatorial Statement and send
it forward. Thank you Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And while I have the
floor, sir, if I might mention that Miss Tharingtion is from Bunn so her
Senator might want to know that as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But she’s a Girl Scout sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. President. Real quick. I was reflecting earlier and thank God

little girl could’ve reached around us. That being said, we need to take
about a, oh, I don’t know, 20 minute recess if we could and we’d like to
take this recess subject to the standard stipulations. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

  ?? of Congress.  Now the politicians will argue that running at-large is
fair and gives everyone a voice.  But both, I might point out both
Republican- and Democrat-controlled boards have lacked the political
strength to fix this problem.  The most recent election proves that the
current system we have in Wake County ignores our small towns and, most
importantly, it ignores the will of the people.  It does so by denying
communities the power to choose their local officials.  For example,
Fuquay-Varina Commissioner Matt Calabria now represents a district that
voted to elect his opponent in the 2014 election.  His race was boosted
by heavy turnout, voter turnout inside the Raleigh city limits.
Calabria won his race countywide by a wide margin.  But he lost his own
district by nearly five points, or twenty-four hundred votes, and so
lost the people of Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, and Garner, which
I also represent part of.  The bill ensures that this justice will no
longer occur.  Under my bill, if a county commissioner candidate
receives the most votes in the district in which they run, then they
will represent that district.  In fact, those that are opposed to
increasing representation for Wake County citizens have heralded their
districts as proof that everyone in the county has a real voice.  But
how can that be true if communities such as Apex, Holly Springs,
Fuquay-Varina, and Garner don&#39;t have the power to elect their local
officials?  The fact that local districts are represented by a person
the majority of citizens in their district rejected proves just how
flawed the current system has become, and proves furthermore that the
deck is stacked against most of Wake County&#39;s small towns and
communities.  This is why we don&#39;t elect the legislature by popular
statewide vote, as some opponents have argued that we do.  I also
represent another county, Franklin County.  Franklin&#39;s population is
roughly sixty thousand people.  It&#39;s about nine-hundred and forty
thousand less than Wake.  They have seven county commissioners, five who
are in residential districts, and two that run at-large, similar to what
I am proposing.  Wake County has one million people and seven members on
their board.  Our county commissioners run to represent more people than
the governor of the state of Delaware.  Meanwhile, citizens get lost in
the numbers.  The current election process is unjust, and we need to fix
it.  This bill does that.  Representation is strongest when it is
closest to the people.  We feel the most disconnect between presidents,
U.S. senators, and governors because they are elected at-large.  The
county commission is a local office, but there is nothing local about
running to represent one million people.  I urge you to support this
bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To debate the bill and then offer an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Stein has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The amendment I will be offering is to give the one
million residents of Wake County the right to determine whether this
redistricting plan is in fact in the public&#39;s interest, as opposed
to a particular political party&#39;s interest.  The current map
that&#39;s governed Wake County for the last two elections is a
legitimate map.  It was drawn by a Republican county commission in 2011,
granted that authority by a Republican-controlled general assembly.
County commissioners ran on those maps in 2012, and the Republicans
maintained the majority at that point.  Republican county commissioners
then ran on those maps in 2014, and they lost every single seat.  They
didn&#39;t lose because the map was unfair.  Every single person in the
county of Wake got to vote.  They lost because they lost touch with the
voters, and frankly, treated their fellow commissioners disrespectfully
and in a manner unfitting of the office.  The current representatives of
the people of Wake County, those who were properly and democratically
elected, have spoken.  They issued a resolution two days ago, telling
this body to keep their hands off the local government of Wake County.
So we have a county commission that drew the district map four years
ago.  Today&#39;s county commission opposes this effort.  The fact,
really, that one was Republican and one

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] One is Democratic is immaterial. What&#39;s relevant
is that they are the proper representatives of the people of Wake
County. Not this body. For this body to interject itself into the manner
in which the people of Wake County organizes its own government is
frankly illegitimate. The head of the John Locke Foundation,
conservative organization recently wrote the following,
&quot;Conservatives believe that fiscal and policy decisions ought to be
made as close to local communities as necessary. The local communities
ought to decide the policy decisions that affect their lives.&quot; Do
you believe that? I do. That&#39;s why I will shortly offer an amendment
to allow the people of Wake County to have the ultimate word by allowing
them to ratify this bill, this proposal with a referendum. Let the
people of Wake County vote. If you refuse to respect the duly elected
representatives of the people of Wake County, as this bill does, surely
you will not disrespect the one million residents of this county by
denying them the opportunity to vote yes or no. To the 45 of you who do
not live in or represent Wake County, this amendment gives you what you
need to vote for this bill in good conscience because you will let the
affected residents have the final word. To the five of us who live in
and represent Wake County, if you honestly believe this plan is
brilliant and in the public interest as opposed to your own party&#39;s
interest, you have nothing to fear. Do you have something to fear by
letting the people vote? Have confidence in yourself and faith in the
people. Let the voters ratify this plan with the referendum. A bedrock
American value is self-determination. It&#39;s why our ancestors
abandoned the crown to declare their independence. Self-determination.
If you share this value, you can&#39;t pick and choose when it is
applied, particularly depending on which political party is in control
of a particular political body. If you share this value, then you allow
this body to vote on this amendment, which is purely about
self-determination. If you share this value, you will not offer up some
procedural trick to keep this amendment from being voted on. You will
vote this amendment and you will give the people of Wake County the
opportunity to have final word, and in the process you will demonstrate
a basic, fundamental American value--that of self-determination. Mr.
President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You&#39;re right to send forward an amendment. I&#39;m
sorry I forgot to send it up earlier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You can send forward your amendment. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein&#39;s recognized to speak to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ve already explained what the amendment does. It
doesn&#39;t change the plan in any way. You have the same map, the same
proposal for super districts, partisan districts. It just lets the
people of Wake County, the one million residents, the people whose lives
will be affected by this decision to have the final word. I welcome your
vote for this bill, for this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, a motion please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca has the floor for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President I move that Amendment 1 to Senate Bill
181 do lay upon the table.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I second the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have the motion that lay upon the table, it&#39;s
been seconded, it&#39;s non-debatable. We&#39;ll have one electronic
vote. The question before the Senate is the motion to table Amendment 1.
All in favor will vote aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for the voting. Clerk will record the vote. 30 having voted in
the affirmative and 17 in the negative, Amendment 1 lays upon the table.
The bill unamended is back before the body. Senator Stein, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER [CHANGES] To debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein has the floor to debate the bill a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Members, we&#39;ve heard a
number of justifications for this legislation. I want to examine them in
turn.

  <p id="035:00">
  First we heard that the people of Wake County will get to vote for more
representatives under this bill. That is not true. If this bill becomes
law yes, there will be more county commissioners, 9 instead of 7, but
under the current law every member of Wake County gets to elect all 7
commissioners. Under this proposal you get to vote for your one district
member and one superdistrict member. That’s 2 commissioners. 2 is less
than 7. This bill will disenfranchise the people of Wake County. Second,
we heard that the people of Wake County get to vote for 2 at large
representatives. This too is untrue. Under current law all commissioners
are at large which means they’re elected by the entire jurisdiction
which in this case is the county. Running at large ensures that the
commissioners have the interest of the entire county, the whole county,
when carrying out their duties. Running countywide serves to moderate
the commissioners of both parties. If the republicans get too extreme,
the voters will kick them out. If the democrats get too extreme, the
voters will kick them out and that’s exactly what the people of Wake
County have done. Over the last 20 years republicans have held the
majority for 12 years, democrats for 8. Under this bill not a single
member of the 9 will be elected countywide. Instead we’ll have 2
superdistricts, one a donut and the other the ugliest munchkin I’ve ever
seen. That’s what the black line is. These are purely partisan
districts. It is guaranteed that one will be a democrat the other will
be a republican. Why is that a problem? Because those members will not
have the interest of the entire county in mind, they will only have the
interest of their electoral base. They will not seek compromise. They
will not seek common ground. They will seek to pursue partisan agendas.
Third, we were assured that under this new plan, we heard it again
today, that the people of Eastern Wake County and the suburban parts of
the county will get more representation. This is untrue. Districts
cannot guarantee that any town has the representative on the commission
unless the district is drawn exclusively from that town. This map
doesn’t do that. You can’t do that. There are 12 jurisdictions but
there’s only 7 districts. In fact, it makes the situation potentially
worse. Under this plan all but 1 of the 9 districts overlays the city of
Raleigh, so we can have a situation where 8 of the 9 members of this new
County Commission hail from the city of Raleigh. Is that what you want?
Look at this map. Look at this pink monstrosity. It goes from the far
left which is Briar Creek, that’s Angus Barn and the airport for those
of you that need a little grounding, it goes up by Fallsway, circles to
the right, to the east, picks up Rollsville, then it goes down, picks up
Wendell and Zebulon before ending up down here in Garner. There is
nothing in this map that guarantees the people of Wendell or Zebulon
will have any representation. They may be represented by somebody who
lives right beside the airport on the entire other side of the county.
At least have your map achieve the objectives you state you care about.
That’s how districts work. Every resident in a district has an equal
right to run for that seat. That’s why Franklin County does not have a
single Senator representing Franklin County here in this chamber.
They’re represented by a senator that lives in Wake County. He’s one of
five wake county residents. Surely you all do not believe that the
people of Franklin County are disenfranchised and not well represented
by Senator Chad Barefoot. Fourth and finally, we were told this new map
will result in cheaper elections, less expensive. Maybe. Maybe. But
there’s no direct correlation between the size of the election and its
expense. In 2014 the county commissions ran county wide, jurisdiction 1
million people, they spent on average $110,000. Senator Barefoot ran in
the district of 200,000 people and spent $1.2 million. He spent 10 times
as much on average as the average county commissioner

…Any district that is one-fifth the population, smaller does not
necessarily mean cheaper, if these justifications don’t hold up then
what’s going on with this bill? The Bill Sponsor was quoted in the
newspaper and saying the discussion or something going on among members
of the Wake delegation for quite sometime. And they were all working on
the details together that’s rich, very rich, a Wake delegation meets
every week, we have been discussing local bills for last month not once
was this local bill put forward in front of our delegation, he may have
consulted with Senator Barringer and Senator Alexander, they may have
their but he didn’t have the respect for either Senator Blue or me to
talk to us about this bill, the first we heard about it was when it was
introduced I mean one or two hours before it had it’s first committee
meeting. Senator Blue is the only delegate members that have been
elected both county wide and then the same and then the district.
Senator Blue has served in this institution for 32 years; he knows more
about redistricting than any person, Senator ?? maybe now stand then any
other member in this illustrious body. Meanwhile the Bill Sponsor, he
just completed his first term that’s not to say his idea was with value
or our ideas was with value, every member served the same number of
constituents, all our ideas are worthy…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein let’s keep your march to the bill specifically please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is entirely on point now I will continue to do Sir. It is to say that
there is value and deliberation and consultation because none of us has
a monopoly on the truth or wisdom. This legislation is been developed
through a table process and as a result is a bad bill. Had the Bill
Sponsors engaged either Senator Blue or me, we could have potentially
come up with the said solution that we all agreed upon to achieve his
stated objectives if they are in fact sincere. One possible solution
would be to keep the current districts for district based elections and
lay on top of them for at large Representatives. The current districts
are superior to these districts because they have legitimacy as I stated
earlier, they both been creative endorse by the County Commission, they
are substantially more compact which means that they will meet more
commonality of interest by the residents in those districts, I ask staff
to compare these districts with the current districts, and you can put
that analysis on the dashboard it’s up there for your consideration.
What it shows is that by every measure of compactness the current map is
superior, substantially superior than this proposed map. Furthermore,
the current map doesn’t split a single precinct to the entire county,
this proposal splits 21, splitting precincts creates confusion among
voters and has cost to the county. Look at the proposed map, look at
the…Actually put forward on the dashboard if you would please the
current map, I don’t know what that looks like, this is the current map.
If you look at it…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein one second for refresh, okay map is up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you very much Mr. President, I appreciate that. So this is
the current map it’s all entirely rational, irrelatively compact you see
guys one in North-West, we got one in North-East, South-East, Central
and a couple on the western side of the county. You compare it to this
map which frankly looks like a map that I would have drawn in
kindergarten with a crown too many girls scout cookies, Senator
Barringer. If add four at large, those four members will consider the
interest of the whole county and this is important every member, every
citizen in Wake County elect five Representatives, their district
Representative and four at large under the current map as we have
already said, you only get to vote for two of course under current law
you get to vote for seven. Now, this proposal I just said may or may not
be a good one, may not be the best one but if we had a conversation
perhaps we could have come up with a decent idea that all of us could
have gone behind and we wouldn’t have return this into a partisan battle
but the Bill Sponsor didn’t do this and that he did not I think is
telling and troubling. This bill has the potential through exact real
cost on Wake County, it insults the one million residents of Wake County
whose votes in the last election are being nullified by legislative…

In his opinions of being ignored because of the last vote you all passed
because you deny the opportunity to way in with the referendum to
determine whether this gentleman has a good idea or not. They result in
worst more divisive, narrow minded, more partisan governance overtime
that is not in the long-term interest of our county both politically and
economically. But if your goal is purely instrumental if you only care
about the income and outcomes, yeah it’s true, this will result in more
republican county commissioners. You can’t do this, you have the votes,
you have the power, and we all know it. The question is whether you have
the wisdom, the restraint, the respect for the people of Wake County,
the statesmanship to not do it even though you can; I surely hope we
vote down this bill, thank you Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot for what purpose you raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Many of the very arguments the Senator Stein is making against this plan
apply to our districts that apply to this body, the very criticisms that
he’s leveling against the way I’m proposing to organize Wake County’s
elections are the very ones that we use to come here. So if you think
it’s a good idea that someone in Ashville has a vote in your ways, from
your area. Well, then listen to Senator Stein, our small towns do not
have a voice I mean understand why Senator Stein is passionately arguing
this bill and quite frankly attacking me personally. Five of the County
Commissioners live in his town; none of them live in my Senate district.
The maps that have been shown to you, the reason why we didn’t use them
because they are illegal, the geographic districts they are not election
districts, they would violate the standards of one person one vote.
Surely, you are not suggesting that Senator Stein. What we did was we
put in place and we did not draw the maps in this building, we are still
leaving that up to the County Commissioners which by the way I would add
in Wake County, I have only had that power for a few years. So from
nearly 1920s it’s been this body that is decided how elections have been
run in Wake County. So we are leaving that to them but we have to go, we
have to put them in election districts and this body voted on these maps
two years ago and they have been upheld by the courts, this is saving us
time, this saving us money, and it’s putting the Wake County Commission
on a path towards being fair and legal, thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue for what purpose you raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot you yell for question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot, you are trying to analyze these two super districts, I
noticed that the super district that has Raleigh, a good question of ??
parts of Knightdale, parts of Wendell and I think maybe even parts of
Lakefest and last bill in it has a population deviation of 4.98 from the
ideal population, is that correct if you would look at this…?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What day gentleman ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m looking at the top page it’s says District and 2010 population,
ideal population and then it shows the deviation for the super district.
There are two packs one is showing for the ?? districts and another one
showing for the two super districts. Page 109 is what I’m looking at,
it’s the material that was speculate to me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have got it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You see what I’m talking about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It says that district one which is a district that encompasses not all
but a push in the valley and these are their five towns that I just
mentioned that it has a deviation of plus 4.90%, you see where I’m now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.

happening is that this body
has already voted on these maps the purpose of this bill is not to open
up the line drawing process we do not have this is the all these are the
only goal
action districts that are currently on the books 49 members of a county
body of right now (SPEAKER CHANGES) it&#39;s a rather than go to the
process we just what this bill Dallas
is a boat speed increases the county commission from 7 to 10 in the
posters nine people in the existing collector and election districts all
this trouble
or these maps the stats are all that comes from the school board build
it was past two years ago about this body and has been upheld by the
courts no question
that as a center of gravity oh yes I have as defense and that the
commission-cents a day each session of the legislature passes to find
legislation and have
the capability to fix it so they can have this as 10% of the nation in
the population is present but the best sense is that the county
commissioners are gonna
have the ability of to fix what ever them not to after the next census
we don&#39;t have the correct numbers are misleading the new senses
center 1 to 5 and quick
fix it if you&#39;re trying to do affects right now we are five yourself
in the last since it&#39;s our staff does not have the numbers you could
not get a fair fix
this is as close as we can get to that as (SPEAKER CHANGES) I would

facts and after the next sentence never
questioned the spurs server video notes and Scott and doesn&#39;t run

purposes of a time, some districts outside the district will have the

actions that have
population that was closer to the idea and 10% of the nation in this
plan on the cost of fixing the system have the ability and talent fixed
spurs and the
promise of this bill is to put away county commission on the path to
increasing their representation which might have neither republicans nor
democrats control

  Of course that reminds us of all that this is legislation that we are
voting on electively. It needs to be good public policy. It needs to be
thought through, because what we are doing now in Granville county and
what we need to do later today in Greensboro would be the same type of
maneuvers that could be done in a town or a community throughout the
state, in any county whatsoever. And what we are doing in ?? county is
changing the fundamental political landscape. Rather than letting the
entire population that’s eligible to vote, cast vote upon the candidate
of choice, whoever that may happen to be. democrat or republican. We are
basically telling them now that rather than voting on seven, we are
increasing the district to nine but you can only vote for two. The only
purpose and reason for changing it to basically assure that the
political landscape will predictably reliably and consistently elect
equivalently of five republicans and four democrats based on the
characteristics and performances of these districts. If you look at the
performance and characteristics, we find that district 3, district 4,
district 5 predictably reliable democratic districts. We look at
district 1, 2, 6 and 7. They will perform as republican districts. That
changes the fundamental political landscape of this county. Why not let
everybody cast their vote democratically based upon a candidate of
choice. As I mentioned earlier, ?? Brian, he was the mayor of Nightdel,
count on the ?? of this county. He went on and he got elected to the
county commissioners, having served as the mayor of nightdel. And he
served as the security men of the county board of elections.  Excuse me,
county board of commissioners. We know that there will be republicans
elected from small towns and communities. We know that people like Paul
Kobo, who served on the rally city council, who likewise to went on
served as the mayor or Rally, served as commissioner.  [change of
speaker] Mr President, sir [??]. [Change of speaker] I will. [Change of
speaker]. Mr ??, I’m just sitting here on the Granville county board of
commissioners of North Carolina, and I see that they have each board
members selected five districts, and the individual candidate must live
in their district. Are you opposed to this? Are you gonna be running a
bill to make them running at large? [Change of speaker] I’ve not had
anyone from Gramble county approach about changing their districts.
There’s not been a member of county commissioners, nor any member of the
town councils that I served, ??, Butner, Creedmoor, Oxford, no member of
the chamber of commerce, no member of any local political group that has
come to me asking me to reconsider changing the voting district in
Granville county. Would they to do so, I would’ve listened attentively
to their request. I would not try to impose my own judgement out of a
sense of superiority upon what they should look like and try to change
their political landscape at a manner of resulting jury mandarin a
county which has voting districts that perform as they should perform.
In Dorum, I served as city council there, half the members were voted on
at large. The other half had to live within the district that they were
voted on by the entire population. Admit that there was geographic
representation but more importantly every person serving on that town
council was accountable of the entire population that voted for them
throughout the entire city. And Dorum county has worked in that way, in
terms of there being at large for voting for those commissioners. So I
do believe that unless there is a compelling reason to sit back and
rethink what’s going on in Wayne County, a compelling reason to try to
change the political landscape to create an impression upon them with
voting districts that were predictably and consistently reliably always
predict to believe to vote people of certain party. That’s the wrong
thing to do. There is no reason to create this political imbalance. What
if they were to be able to cast their votes of their candidates of
choice, you might see a consistently different outcome. We have people
that would be triple bumped in Wayne County. The cost of the way that
these districts have gone. I simply say to you, that if it’s not vote,
we don’t need to fix it. We don’t need to temper in these communities
when they are not calling upon us to.

…Come up with a solution and when we do try to grab solutions we can
work reasonably, cooperatively across party lines to try to read some
type of consensus that everybody can by into if that myth creating two
extra districts that wouldn’t cover a periphery in this county and
perhaps that might have been a solution to the problem but certainly the
democratic thing to do if you believe this plan is what the people of
Wake County want is to allow a referendum and to allow them to speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate, Senator Barefoot for what purpose you
raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak at second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot has the floor to speak second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members I would think that the reason why Senator McKissick is not heard
from Granville County is because they really enjoy their seven single
member districts they have there. And I remember last session partnering
with the Senator to override the will of the Durham City Council on a
good bill that was for you. Mr. President at the appropriate time I want
to object the third reading because I wanna make sure we have enough
time as we can debate this bill, we have had two public forums and a
great opportunity for the citizens who come to our Wake delegation
meeting and voice their opinions on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator, any further discussion or debate? Senator Blue, for
what purpose you raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. President and ladies and gentleman and the
Senate, I learned when I was in the second grade that just because you
can do something it doesn’t mean you ought to do it. I had 10 to 12
first cousin boys who are older than I’m and I knew I can pick on
anybody and I would have somebody who would cover me when somebody
wanted to beat me out. So that tends to make you a little aggressive but
the fundamental lesson that my mother taught me is just because you can
do something it doesn’t mean you ought to do it. And I tell you what you
have to think about this bill, sometimes it might be right, sometimes it
might be wrong but you ought to think about what it does to you and then
think about what it does to the people that you are doing it to because
it has to do something to you if that negatively affects any other human
being. So I would ask you to think about it later, I remember a quote
from the famous Irish political philosopher Edmund Burke who is the
Founder at least he is the founder philosophically of the Modern
Conservative Movement and one of the things that I like genuine
conservatives and I like the ideas because I’m not conservative on that
level, and I try to choose the best ideas regardless of what the source
is, and I found that if it’s an engaging idea I move further down the
road to a truth if incorporated in to what my beliefs are. But Burke
said, “I believe this to the marrow of my bones that the only thing
necessary for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing.” Sort of
not take a stand and do something when you see something bad really
happening. Now, I think that this bill does evil to Wake County but not
just Wake County to North Carolina because what it does in the first
place it chips away this idea that so many of us awaited to, this total
idea of what democracy is, what representative democracy is, it is
choice of the people within and whatever the political unit is, if you
are in ancient Greece it was every citizen of Greece who come to ask
this vote. If you are in Wake County it would be every citizen of Wake
County, if you are in North Carolina it would be every citizen of North
Carolina. And we have people smart enough to devise a system so that you
had some checks and balances on all of these decisions, you can have
direct democracy almost at the county level even if you have a million
people. But for thing that you got to understand is no checks and
balances built in the local government…

North Carolina, the commissioners are elected by the people, there is no
Governor to preside, and there is no separate judiciary to keep them
straight. So the people or the ones who have all the power and when you
believe that government closest to the people is the best government, a
pretty good conservative principle then you understand that the people
of Wake County ought to be able to determine what kind government they
want and what it’s make a part of be. Now, we as a legislature ought to
give them broad direction and that’s traditionally what we have done in
this area. We move to your cities, you can organize this way, you pick
the way that you can organize to this way and we will put it in your
chart. And we tell your counties you can do certain things, you pick
which ones but this is how we are limiting you, we don’t come down and
make the individual decisions for the counties and citizens at least
historically we haven’t. What we have here? And this is what disturbing
because it really offense basic concepts of democracy is one person
thinks that he has a better idea than the million people in Wake County
and the five to seven people that those million people elected to
determine how they ought to government their face. So another ?? as you
represent 140,000 people in Wake County were these commissioners each of
them represents a million people and that means every person in this
county and it happened to me can call either one of these commissioners
don’t have to find out where do you live, when you get call these
legislators you wanna know whose district you live in sometimes before
you do constituent service, these folk have to appeal to everybody. Now,
let me tell you this I have been around for a while and I was one of
those who insisted that the power to govern themselves be given to the
Wake County Commission because when I got you the legislature was
appointing, it was rather basically re-districting the Wake County
Commissioners. And I will tell you there were republicans on the Wake
County Board, I think Jerry ?? may have been Chair or Republican House
Member now. There were republicans on the board and democrats on the
board, and my position was if we were smart enough to redistrict
ourselves than then ought to be smart enough to redistrict themselves.
And we gave them the power to redistrict themselves, thinking that they
go about to do it in a way that would make everybody satisfied and over
the 20 years they have done it, 15 to 20 years as Senator Stein pointed
out there have been republican majorities, democratic majorities, we
have even had a county board that would have a republican chair and a
democrat chair or vice-versa. Now, we are not like a lot of other
counties and you might wonder what—the reason that Wake County didn’t
break down into individual districts is because the overwhelming
majority of the people in this county appreciated the system that we
had, we are not like some of the counties, we did not have to create a
black district as many of the other counties so that’s why Barnwell
County elects in specific districts now and that’s why some of your
counties do. So Wake County is resolving its problem internally, didn’t
have to create a majority-minority district, it never has, Wake County
had continues minority representation on it’s board since 1972, 1972,
had multiple African-American chairs of the board, at times it had more
than one African-American on the seven member board, it does now, it did
in the 90s, in that way the republican majorities, democratic majorities
because the county is the cumulative wisdom that it is developed over
the years. Now, I tell you there have been some hard choices in this
county that could not have been made and we had people elected from
districts. We had a prepared food and ?? tax, ?? got the both of their
tax after we build the, now the PNC used to be the RBC the arena and
after we did the improvements to memorial auditorium, by the way under
republican administration for the city and the county at the same time
who agreed how to spend the proceeds but you know by the same token
decided that it was only fair to bill facilities throughout the county
and in fact just made a special grant to Holly Springs outside their
rules because they think at that…

  The county needed greater funds and resources. This county has worked
very well. This county is one of the fastest growing in the country, has
two of the fastest growing cities, Raleigh and Carey. Each has had
unaffiliated or independent mayors. The mayor of Raleigh is not a
democrat and not a republican, she’s unaffiliated. And I want to point
out one other thing because when you’re overturning the results of this
election, again, it reminds me of Mr. Putin or better still, I was in
Zimbabwe 10-15 years ago and I was reminded so much of Mr. Mcarthy, the
president who lost the election and then decided well, I don’t like the
results of this. I’ll just overturn the election. Folks, we’re much more
mature and much more sophistocated and much more democratically grounded
than that, so I would say that if you look at the results of this
election, let me tell you something republicans, the result of the 2014
election that elected all of these folk you see from Raleigh. The result
before them elected people from these other areas because that’s what
the people of this county wanted. The people of this county turned the
county commissioners out for two prime reasons. They didn’t feel that
they were investing sufficiently in the education of the kids of this
county and they didn’t feel that they were wrestling with the
transportation issues that this rapidly growing county was experiencing
and they turned them out and voted for people who had promised them that
they would address those issues, but let me tell you what they did at
the same time. The sheriff of Wake County is a republican. Got the
highest vote of any other vote getter in the county, the highest vote of
any other vote getter. The Clerk of Court is a republican. Won the at
large race that you’re hearing complained about with these county
commissioners. The Register of Deeds is a republican in Wake County, so
three out of the four constitutional offices with the District Attorney
being the other are held by republicans in this county and you’re coming
to store into this and introduce this element of politics and
partisanship into the way this county operates. It’s unfair if the folk
of this county, again, 12 years republican leadership, 8 years
democratic leadership on the board addressing all the issues in front of
us, if the people of this county have decided how best to do it, it’s
unfair. Now, I’ll tell you two other points and I want to sit down. This
does reduce this county’s ability, a very vibrant, rapidly growing,
rapidly near sophisticated county’s ability to address these needs that
many of us even understand what they’ll be to deal with the issues. And
we have no way of forcing a broad view. Again, we don’t have a mirror of
Wake County. You’re electing people in districts that are designed to
take into account these two superdistricts, the issues within the
superdistricts and not care about what happens in the other part of the
county and I think we end up putting false hope into the way that we
change this because Senator Stine indicated that I represent these rural
towns too. I represent Nightdale, a piece of Wendell, I used to have
Wake Forest and Rosedale in my senate district and I think I gave them
pretty good service. They always voted for me pretty heavily in those
precincts, but what I will tell you, the thing that offends me about
this map more than anything else my friends is the fact that we
introduce the element of race into redistricting in this county in 2015.
You know, we started out the 20th century with WD Dubois saying it could
be the issue that defined the 20th century and I spent half of the 20th
century growing up and being an adult and the thing that I was hoping
that we would get away from in the 21st century is having to use race to
define anything. So what do we do in this map? We draw a black district.
53-54% majority minority. Haven’t been forced to do that. We did it with
the school board. I voted against it and I pointed out the very same
thing and, you know, we didn’t have to do that and we ought not do it in
2015. Hopefully at some point we

  <p id="075:00">
  Get away from considering race in any of the deliberations that we have
to make. Note, these young people in this room have a different attitude
then some of us then some of the folks we grew up with. But hopefully we
can mature enough to say okay if we&#39;re going to split Wake county
let&#39;s just fair it up and split it into seven districts and
let&#39;s not regard race. There&#39;s nothing in the case law that
requires you do that for Wake county there is nothing that I see
anywhere. Now contrary to how senator Barefoot said there was a lawsuit
brought against the board districts the judge dismissed it the first
circuit court of appeals has reviewed it has heard all arguments they
have not ruled on it on narrow issues. The issue of whether or not you
have to draw minority districts in this county has not been litigated.
And we ought not give the court it&#39;s first responsibility to do that
when it&#39;s not necessary. So that&#39;s why I think that Mr. ?? had
the right idea because he knew that evil things happen when people who
know better don&#39;t step forward and do something about it. And I hope
you&#39;ll step forward and help us do something about this I told
senator Barefoot and I&#39;ll tell you as members I will work diligently
day and night even miss the ACC tournament to come up with a plan that
makes sense geographically that ensures that the people of Wake county
feel as if they have some input. Democrats, Republicans or any other
description you want to put on them. And that they&#39;re not having
something shoved down their throats. You know this bill was introduced
last Thursday Wednesday or Thursday and people ?? some folk to come
speak. But the county has not had a chance to digest it, have hearings
on it, talk about it and really come up with the kind of plan that&#39;s
good for Wake county. I would hope that you would give us the benefit
and courtesy of letting our people have a say in what kind of districts
they want. Some of the witnesses that I listen to JT Knight was a good
friend of mine I read an article, he&#39;s a republican, I supported him
when he ran for county commissioner he&#39;s chair of our board of
county commissioners. Helped elect the first black person to the board
of county commissioners. And I want to see why he thinks that being in
Windale he can be represented better by someone from the airport.
Because he&#39;s pretty satisfied when I represented him. And so I ask
you to give us a chance to come up with a map that makes sense for this
county your not just doing it for political reasons this map will have
serious effects on how Wake county is able to move forward in the future
whether it&#39;s the kind of industries we have to recruit, whether
it&#39;s the kind of training we have to do, whether it&#39;s
transportation we have to put in place. So I would ask you to vote
against this map and Mr. President I&#39;d like at the appropriate time
to call for the aye&#39;s and no&#39;s by recorded vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you senator and I think we are going to object to third reading
today anyway so we&#39;ll get to that in just a second. But any further
discussion or debate? Senator Apodaca for what reason do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President speak on the bill please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, members. Times like this I&#39;m struck again
by the loss of our dear friend from Buncombe county senator Nesbith. But
I&#39;m also reminded when we had the Buncombe county maps up I heard
many of the same arguments I&#39;m hearing today about dividing an area
into districts how unfair it was how this and that. Well in Buncombe
county what it did was give a voice to the county or give the citizens
of the county a voice in districts. But I was struck today and senator
Stein was quoting that newspaper I want to read something to ya from the
Ashville Citizen Times now I don&#39;t recommend to children that you
all read this paper but I just happened to this time. I think in some
ways the redistricting in Buncombe county has worked out well. But it
doesn&#39;t change the fact that it was imposed on the county that
wasn&#39;t asking for it, Turner said. Turner&#39;s a newly elected
freshman Democrat representative. And he thought these districts worked
out well for Buncombe. And he&#39;s exactly right it&#39;s given the
folks in the county a voice in their county government. Now what
we&#39;re really talkin about here, let&#39;s get back down to it,
we&#39;re talking about rural versus city. And as we grow we see what
the cities do. They take over everything. And senator Blue brought out

…Ask you about communities of interest and I don’t think you are able to
address it but I assume you have an opportunity by now to research those
questions. So here we go, do you agree that recognizing and preserving
communities of interest is an important traditional criteria in
redistrict and just add to that you live in James Town and communities
of interest were important in preserving redistrict in there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, first of all Senator I don’t live in James Town, I live in
Greensboro and I think you are missing the point here this will give a
100% of people that live in Greensboro representation of someone in a
district who knows their needs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator do you yell for follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you agree that in your map specifically communities of interest
around Bennett College, around North Carolina State University, around
Guildford College, and around UNCG have been split up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator I agree it establish districts with smaller populations that
will bring representation closer to the people and make their council
members more accountable to them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that a yes or no?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s Senator there are smaller districts which make them more
accountable to the people regardless of where they live, they are on the
district they can reach their council first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade do you yell for the third question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry, you are President not Chair. I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, she yells Senator, you are up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question, the districts in Senate Bill 36 are less compact than
the single districts and the current system therefore split precincts I
believe where as a current district, current plan has no split
precincts. So what interest coming up with the redistrict and plan that
splits precincts and where you are not able to design a plan that would
not have split precincts?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator when you go from five districts to seven the population is the
smaller amount of people in one district. Therefore, there are going to
have to be some split districts when you comply with Federal and State
norms.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A follow up question Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade do you yell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, we know that the city council is non-partisan. However, in
your plan council members who are democrats are treated differently than
council members who are republicans I note that no two incumbents, no
incumbents who are republicans pair it. So can you give me a reason why
so many incumbents who are register democrats are doubled or tripled?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator when the districts were drawn for an equal representation I
can’t control where the council members live and the fact that five of
them are living the same lady as the two miles, I really control that
and that’s the way it falls on the map.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President I would like to continue and opt for an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson you can send forward your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And while that’s going…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One second Senator we have to read the amendment, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson is recognized to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Senate Bill 36 is a proposed plan by one member
of the Guildford County delegation to take away their authority to the
City Council and the citizen. Senate Bill 36 means that the current
council composed of nine members, three elected at large, five in
districts in the Mayor, we all in fact be changed to seven district
election with one Mayor. We have heard from the citizens who were here
that this take away opportunities but them to decide their own form of
government. So this amendment simply does that…

situation across North Carolina. The citizens have said very strongly
and the hearings we&#39;ve had here in Greensboro and everywhere, if
you&#39;re going to do it, allow us a referendum. And that has been
their plea. Greensboro is an open and a fair and a representative
government and all they want is the opportunity to voice what they want

That&#39;s all this amendment does. Gives the citizens an opportunity.

purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Robinson has the floor to speak to the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Colleagues, Senate Bill 36 was dropped on the doorsteps of
Greensborians. And in the mindset of, with the mindset of taking away
the rights of citizens to vote. Those of you in the redistricting and
those of you who attended the meeting heard them say, “We had no voice.
We had no idea this was happening. Even those of us in the Guilford
Delegation never had discussion.” Never had discussion about this bill
being a possibility. And I think in respect, all of us, regardless of
parties, actually respect each other. We ought to respect differences of
opinion and be willing to listen to that. And so it should have been the
right thing to do for Senator Wade to share this with us at least, and
share it with the members of Greensboro. I have here hundreds of
signatures, five or six hundred signatures of people in Greensboro.
I&#39;ve received phone calls. A lot of you&#39;ve received emails. And
what they&#39;re basically saying is at least let us have a referendum.
Who asked the legislation? We didn&#39;t. And if you remember, some of
you who&#39;ve been here, you remember a few years ago, this happened
with County Commissioners, that we thought were going to have a
referendum and I thought I had some kind of agreement going there.
Fooled me. And then again with the school board. Well, this legislation
means, and it may mean for some of you, that the citizens of Greensboro
will not have an opportunity to determine their form of government for
the next few years. So, why we ask, is Greensboro being singled out? Of
course we learn we aren&#39;t singled. [LAUGHTER] It&#39;s not really
funny. But we heard at a town hall meeting on February 19 from hundreds
of citizens, even about a hundred stood outside of the city council hall
and couldn&#39;t get in. But everyone except for about four said, “We
don&#39;t want this. We didn&#39;t ask for it.” Why is Raleigh
interfering in local government? And I think we heard that from the
Governor the other day. All they were asking for was an opportunity to
decide their form of government. Now we&#39;re elected by the people.
But the people have the right to speak. And we don&#39;t have the right
to take that from them. No matter who elects us, we do not have the
right to take the people&#39;s voice away. Now Senator Wade said to me,
“Senator Robinson, you like this because it&#39;s going to help the
Black community!” Well, colleagues, the reason I&#39;m in the district

  Is Senator Rucho in here to hear this cause he says Senator Robinson,
that district needs to be about 75% to make sure you all have a
representative, so I’m that person and I think I do a pretty good job of
representing 75% of the people who are African-American in my district.
Now Senator Wade just mentioned to you that the NACP voted to support.
Well, that’s another kind of trickery because yesterday if you were in
redistricting committee you heard from [??] Vice President of the state
NACP, called the North Carolina Conference of NACP. That local group,
and let me tell you this was a small group because I’m a life member, an
active member of the NACP in Greensboro, but a small group decided that
they would do that and so the state president has said that the
constitution says that no local group can support or authorize any kind
of legislation. It has to go before a team, their legal team. You don’t
have that kind of authority, so what they did was invalid, and you
cannot consider that as information for this purpose. A small group of
people who came to say or who were corralled to say they support it came
down. Instead what you saw was a large group of citizens. You saw
ministers, you saw leaders, people from the League of Women Voters,
people from the Greensboro Poll [??] black and white, you saw students
at colleges. You saw everybody who came down and only four out of
hundreds of people said we want that. Now, Senator Wade also said at one
of the meetings that she had heard from local businessmen. Now you’ve
heard her say that today. The only businessman she mentioned was Roy
Carroll. What’s strangely enough today in the media Mr. Carroll who is a
well-respected businessman was said he doesn’t support this legislation.
I didn’t say that, he did. So Senator Wade, we ask again, who’s asking
for this? If the business folks aren’t asking for it now, the citizens
don’t want it, why are we doing this? What is it going to benefit? We’re
taking away the opportunity for people across Greensboro who now can
vote for five elected officials, three at large, their district and the
mayor, which means they have a large percentage chance of having an
influence in the vote and you go on to decrease that down to one
district per city and a mayor who has no vote and an at large person.
This makes no sense. Martin Luther King said the measure of a man is not
where he stands in times of comfort and convenience, but when he stands
in times of challenge and controversy. Looks like we always in
controversy down here and I said to Senator Brown the other day it sure
would be nice to get to a point where we could work on something
together but we keep on knocking our local governments, knocking folk
around for no sense. We have plenty of work to do. I challenge you to
step to the plate and allow the citizens of my community to have a voice
in their formal government. I challenge you not to vote for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER

those famous words there we go again. We have brought everything into
this but the true facts. The true facts is this is giving what, 7
districts of Guilford County representation in their government. It is
not allowing the central part of Greensboro to control everything else
for Guilford County. I daresay if Dr. King were alive today he would
like to see these 7 districts have a say so in their government since we
brought that up, but you know, we can have Vulcans, we can have
Martians, we can have whatever in these districts, but this is fair,
people. This gives everybody in the county a say so, so as I said
earlier

  Let’s give the people some representation. Please vote for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to ask Senator Wade
a question since we’ve talked about the voice of the people. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Wade do you yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Was
there not a referendum where the voice of the people was spoken on the
vote city council districts in the recent past or in the past, I know
it’s been a few years ago, was there a referendum? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, Mr President, Senator Tillman there were several
referendums. The referendum, only one that passed for the city of
Greensboro was to have a mayor at large and 6 council members elected at
large. There was a referendum I believe in 1981 to go to a district
system. It failed but the next year the city council voted to put the
citizens in a district system. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me ask you this
again so I’m clear. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator would you like to ask a
second question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, another question
please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In that referendum, the voice of the
people spoke and now we have districts. How are those districts
constituted now and what relationship do they have to the failed
referendum? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think they’re very similar to the failed
referendum. It was a compromise. The citizens at that time wanted 7
districts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Wade. Speak briefly on
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman has the floor to speak on
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. The voice of the people was heard
and it was rejected in the referendum and now lo and behold we’ve got
districts just like that failed referendum. I think the people spoke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to ask Senator Tillman a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, sir, and I don’t live there but I live I live in a stone’s
throw but I know what you’re gonna ask me. I can read your mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good job, Senator Tillman. I just wanna be sure where
you live. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Smith-Ingram for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Smith-Ingram has the floor to speak
to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was the committee member yesterday who
asked about communities of interest. When we look at what the current
bill does versus the proposed bill we have the following communities
that are broken up. In the current plan UNCG which is precinct 45 and
the neighborhood in which many of its students and professors live,
precinct 14, are both in district 4. In the proposed SB 36, UNCG
students are moved to district 7, I’m sorry, UNCG the school is moved to
district 7 while the students and professor neighborhood are assigned to
district 6. North Carolina A&amp;T of which Senator Wade and I both
attended and received the earlier foundation of our education, in the
current composition represents precincts G167 and G168, but in the
proposed SB 36 it breaks up the North Carolina A&amp;T community into 3
different precincts, are split among districts 1, 2 and 7. How then are
we continuing or preserving communities of interest? Senator Wade you
stated earlier that you understand that’s an important traditional
criteria to consider in redistricting. It was also said that the people
are given a voice and that this is smaller representation. Along with
that smaller representation comes a smaller voice. Under the current
plan I get to vote, if I were a Greensboro resident, I will get to vote
for 55% of the council members. Under the proposed SB 36 I only get to
vote for 14%. Do I have a larger voice or a smaller voice? I don’t care
how you do the math, 14% is much less than 55% any day of the week
regardless of what aisle you’re sitting on. In the current plan Bennett
College in its surrounding neighborhood, precincts G69 and G70 are
assigned to district 2, along with North Carolina A&amp;T, it’s fellow
historically HBCU of which we shared a statement on Monday evening. In
SB 36 Bennett College community is split between districts 7 and 1.
Finally in the current plan, NE Greensboro MON 1 and MON 2 is assigned
to district 2. In SB 36

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca does not yield. Senator for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I speak to the bill for a second time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator you can speak to the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Lest there be any confusion, it seemed that
there&#39;s no lip reading expert in the room who can designate the
members of the chamber who can-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, are we going to speak to the bill-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am speaking, Senator and not be able to hear her
because freshmen should be seen and not heard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As was said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Smith-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And this freshman, who will speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Smith-Ingram, please keep your comments to the
bill. Let&#39;s keep order in the chamber please. Order in the chamber.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You can continue Senator, but please keep your focus
on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And germane to the bill as a freshman senator who is
speaking, and oh I believe you recognized me, thank you Mr. President,
who is speaking to this bill as you are seeing me, don&#39;t confuse
what I said. I know I compared a Wake County Board of Commissioners with
the Greensboro City Council, and I&#39;ve heard it said that this has
happened on local school boards of education. No matter what level or
what governing body we are intruding in, the fact of the matter remains.
We are imparting our will as an assembly into the will of local
government. It is best to allow the people to establish the governance
and how they want the composition of their town council, of their
commissioner boards, of their school boards to look like. Now we would
be very offended, and I&#39;ve heard people say they have been offended,
if this were to happen to us as a general assembly. The overwhelming
majority of the people in Greensboro do not want SB36. It breaks up
communities of interest, it breaks up students from the faculty. It
breaks up universities from the communities that they serve. When we
look at how the communities of interest are not preserved, we should
vote this down. It is a bad bill. We need to send it back and work on
it. There needs to be bi-partisan participation. I&#39;m not calling
names, but seriously and transparency, what this looks like is that
we&#39;re being big bullies. Now I have been bullied on this floor, and
we are bullying the towns of Greensboro, the city of Greensboro, and I
don&#39;t think that makes us look good being bullies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One thing that gets me concerned about this bill, and
I&#39;ve heard a lot of people from Greensboro who&#39;ve called, a lot
of people who are opposed to it, as well as those that are in favor of
this bill. At the same time, one of the things that gives me deep
concern is that I&#39;ve heard the argument that Greensboro is growing,
that it&#39;s thriving, that its downtown has really taken off. And at a
time where a community is growing, it&#39;s thriving, and there&#39;s
that special nucleus and energy that&#39;s there, I don&#39;t know why
we would reduce the size of the city council from nine to seven. I also
don&#39;t why we would want a mayor who, as the chief elected officer
and official, not to have a vote as a stakeholder. I think that mayor
ought to be able to cast a vote. I think that a community like
Greensboro should have control over its own destiny. In this bill we see
a decrease in the number of elected representatives. Likewise we see the
mayor being denied a vote, and those things deeply, deeply concern me,
and due to those reasons, I cannot support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Senator McKissick, a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, I have a question for you. On this
last bill that we just passed, the Wake County bill, and you spoke so
fervently on it, how&#39;d you vote?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At that point in time I was outside of the chamber in
a meeting. So I didn&#39;t.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let the record show you didn&#39;t even vote on that
one you were so passionate about, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wish I had been in the chamber to have vote, and if
it were possible to do so, I would have voted in opposition and I will
state that for the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick you can continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Simply saying this. I am in the chamber at this time,
I wish I had been in the chamber then, I would have voted in opposition.
I&#39;ll state that for the record and I regret that I walked in about a
minute too late. But our Lieutenant Governor made the rules very clear
and I did not intend

  for a second question.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I would.
SPEAKER CHANGES
The answer to that question was that at the present time, you could not
only go to the at-large people, but you can also go to a district
representative at this time, because there&#39;s five districts.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. President?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Wade, not only can I call any of them, I&#39;ll call Republicans
Zach Matheney and Tony Wilkins, and I have done that. And they&#39;re
not in my districts.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Robinson, do you yield for a third time?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes.
SPEAKER CHANGES
So if there were seven districts, could you go to every other district
and talk to them and that would be seven different people?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Wade--
SPEAKER CHANGES
Your floor, Senator.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. President.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Wade, if there are seven different districts, and they only
represent their persons, they would not listen to me the way, currently,
my district person plus the three at-large and the mayor. Because I have
a vote in terms of whether they get elected.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Will she yield to another question?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Robinson, do you yield for a fourth question?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Robinson, would the district representatives represent everyone
in Greensboro at the present time?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Wade--Mr. President, don&#39;t want to skip you. Senator Wade,
the district representatives currently represent their district in
addition to their five-- three other at-large people, which gives them
more opportunity to speak to more people.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Robinson, do you yield?
SPEAKER CHANGES
My question is, when they cast their vote, are they casting for
everybody in Greensboro and everything that influences anybody in
Greensboro when they vote? They have the same vote as the at-large
members when they vote?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Wade, you and I know that even when you were on the city
council, it depends on how you&#39;re communicating with the other
members of the council, if you&#39;re doing it together, and I think you
were a dissenting vote.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I&#39;m trying to understand the answer. So are you telling me that ??
district--
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator, ??, hold on Senator Wade. Senator Robinson, do you yield?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes.
SPEAKER CHANGES
So you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s the same vote, whether you&#39;re in a
district or at-large and it affects the city just the same way?
SPEAKER CHANGES
I&#39;m telling you, Senator Wade, that it depends on the collaboration
and working together, which I don&#39;t see down here. But you know as
well that on the City Council what happens now, the issues that affect,
for instance, northeast Greensboro, are discussed. Now they can be voted
down like when you were on the city council, and the landfill in
northeast Greensboro was going to go back--be open in northeast
Greensboro--half the citizens not spoken. So no, all the time the other
folk don&#39;t represent the interests of some individuals.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Do we have any further discussion or debate?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. President?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Van Duyn, for what purpose do you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
To ask Senator Apodaca a question.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Apodaca, do you yield?
SPEAKER CHANGES
I do.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Apodaca, it is with great trepidation that I ask you a question
that I know both you and Senator Nesbitt would be disappointed if I
didn&#39;t. So here goes. You have twice today referenced Representative
Turner as an expert on how Buncombe County feels about what happened to
them a few years ago. So I am wondering--he was speaking with respect to
a bill that he introduced in the House that would give the people who
are--who we&#39;re messing with here--the ability to vote on what we do
before we change how they elect their local people. Would you support my
bringing this bill to the Senate?
SPEAKER CHANGES
What--Mr. President. Number one, if you read the article, Mr. Turner was
referring to the bills that were passed previously. Number two, I never
once said Brian Turner&#39;s an expert on anything. And the third thing
is that I haven&#39;t read your bill, Senator, so I can&#39;t tell you
yea or nay.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. President?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Smith-Ingram, for what purpose do you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
To see if Senator Robinson will yield for a question.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Robinson, do you yield?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes, Mr. President.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Robinson, in representing Guilford County and Greensboro, North
Carolina, and being in touch and in pulse with the people of the city,
in your opinion, with the breaking up of the communities of interest, do
you feel

  That the African American representation or voice is increased or is it
diluted? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. Senator Smith-Ingram, thank
you for that. It is diluted. The specific areas in my opinion that
around North Carolina A&amp;T and Bennett College are strong as voting
districts together, and have had increased outreach, getting people in
to vote, helping people with transportation, all of those, some of those
are low income neighborhoods around Bennett College, where I went to
school. And it is important that that community remains whole, so that
they can support each other. So interests of the people there will be
disenfranchised and we don&#39;t know what will happen. It can be, to me
the voting strength might be diluted. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca has the floor for a motion. [SPEAKER

For, to reconsider my vote. I sincerely made a mistake. [SPEAKER

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senators Krawiec is recognized to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, colleagues this is simply a boring bill, not as
exciting as what we have been doing. This bill would simply change the
requirements for the annual notice to chronic violators of our municipal
overgrown vegetation and by authorizing the sending of notice by regular
mail currently to notify those chronic violators you must send certified
or registered. If it is unclaimed this new bill will allow regular mail
if it’s not returned within 10 days to the city the notice is deemed
haven’t been served. So it’s just a simple change to current ordinance
of overgrown vegetation. I appreciate your support and I will be happy
to answer any question.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, I would like to speak on the bill and send
forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senator has the floor to speak to the bill and send forward the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 78 will allow State Correctional Officers to carry a
concealed weapon when off duty. Adding them to general stat report
10-269B which list several classes of persons that are exam from general
probation against carrying concealed weapons, they cannot consume
alcohol or an unlawfully controlled substance in their bodies. The
effective date is December 1, 2015, when this bill was in J2 there was
some questions added ask about the training and certification of these
officers. So Mr. President I would like to send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator you can send forward your amendment, if we can have a page of
amendment up here already, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Randleman moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Randleman is recognized to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. So what this amendment does on line 9, it will
add an additional Senate that says the concealed weapon is a handgun but
?? power understanding standards of the division of adult correction of
the Department of Public Safety. So what the amendment does it clarifies
which Correctional Officers are given authority under the bill, when
Correctional Officers are hired they have probationary certification
status and less within 12 months to complete the trainings for the North
Carolina Criminal Justice Education in Training Standards Division which
includes 26 hours of firearms training. Once this training has completed
then they have general certification, this legislation applies to those
officers who have completed their 160 hours of training and I ask for
your support on the amendment.

adopted the bill augmented is back before the body, Senator Randleman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. And I would like to read something from the
department because there are some concerns or enquiry about why this is
needed and there is a recent trend which replaces an increase in
frequency of threats and assaults on staff in their population both
inside and outside of the prison facilities. So this legislation will
attempt to address some of those security issues and it’s the something
that the Correctional Officers really need. So I appreciate your
support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 89, Disqualification Notice/Pistol Sale Permit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Randall is recognized to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you msiter president. And for those of you who were here last year
in the short session, you will remmeber that we made some changes in the
language regarding pistol purchase permits and in that language, we said
that the clerks of superior court shall determine which information can
be transmitted to NICS. So we tried to fix this last year during the
short session but we run out of time, so what we have now, we have 100
counties, we have 100 respective courts of clerk, so with all of them
trying to determine, and they might not all be like minded we have the
potential of a lot of inconsistency. So what this legislation does, it
is intended to limit the clerk&#39;s obligation to judicial findings and
determinations and to make it clear that the clerk does not need to make
any independent judgments regarding the existence of the disqualifying
factors. NICS prescribes the format required for the dated transmission,
and also, this bill does require a follow up report by the
administrative office of the course in conjunction with the SBI and NICS
by March 1, 2016. It does become, it is effective when it becomes law
and I appreciate your support.

  and the lake and I think it was last month it was I think people are
using the word two hundred and seventy two hundred and seventeen million
dollars but the good news is ladies and gentleman of the senate the
month of January excuse me the month of February we actually closed the
gap and rather than two hundred and seventeen million dollars it is now
one fifty eight point six million total general fund revenues. And
actually the total tax revenue went from one ninety eight to one thirty
eight it&#39;s moving in the right direction this general assembly who
has worked hard to have economic growth and job creation is seeing some
great results and I hope at the time when there turns out to be eight
hundred million dollars of new tax revenue coming into the general fund
at the same time we lower taxes in corporate and personal income taxes
the antagonists will come up and say they were wrong. Thank you very
much.
