  I&#39;m joined today by Senator Bob Rucho, Senator Bill Raymond and
Representative John Torbit, who is chairman of the House Transportation
Appropriations committee to present Senate bill 20, this is a
combination bill of the IRC update internal revenue code and then motor
fuel tax changes. I&#39;d like to have staff explain the bill, then
we&#39;ll discuss it further. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The internal revenue
code update piece, you&#39;re probably familiar with by now, since we
start with federal adjusted gross income to do our corporate returns
also. The general assembly has to review federal tax changes each year,
and update this reference to the internal revenue code. Whenever we do
that as staff, we identify specific provisions in the federal tax law
changes that would have a material impact on North Carolina revenues if
you conform to all of the federal changes. This year we identified
several, and if you take a look at the physical note in your packet
regarding this bill, and go to page 2, I have a bulletin list there of
the items that this bill decouples from. The first one is the enhanced
section 179: expensing limits for businesses. The general assembly has
decoupled from this one in the past, but instead of allowing the
business to deduct the full amount, it allows the business to take that
deduction over a 5 year period, which sort of softens the physical
impact. By decoupling from this provision, there would be no physical
impact on the budget. This bill also decouples from a tuition deduction,
and from a deduction for mortgage  premiums as interest, and it
decouples from a income exclusion for IRA distributions to ?? by a
person who has reached 70 and a half years old. This PCS actually
conforms to two provisions. It conforms to a deduction for classroom
supply expenses of up to $250, and it conforms to an exclusion from
income for the cancellation of mortgage indebtedness. The cost of the
general fund in 1415 of conformity through the teacher supply expense
deduction and to the exclusion of income for mortgage debt forgiveness
is $15,000,000. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Part two of this PCS sets the motor
field tax rate at $.36 per gallon, beginning in April 1st of this year,
and continuing to the end of this calendar year. On January 1st 2016,
the current gas tags formula is re-established, the one change to the
formula, is currently the formula resets twice a year, on January 1st
and July 1st. This bill mimics Senate bill 20, and it eliminates the
July reset so that the tax changes annually on January 1st. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ms. Cameron, if we did not have this bill, what would the gas
tax fall-- (audio ends)

…Without this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, it is forecast that the motor field rate on July 1 would fall to
29.9 cent per gallon. In January, it would fall to 29.6 cent per gallon
and then you can see in the fiscal note to the end of it, we actually
list out for you a comparison of the average tax rates over that fiscal
year. So that would be Table 4 the very bottom of the fiscal notes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is this again then is it initially I thought you are saying it was the
gas tax increase of six cents over what it would be and if I look at
your fiscal note, am I reading it right that it would be five cents?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, let me say first that the amounts in the chart are the averages.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Of course from one…So it would include the six months in one calendar
and the second in that sense. So that’s a little bit of the change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right and then if I’m…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So if we go to the basics it is the fact that this bill brings the gas
tax up to 36 cents and if we did not have this bill rounded, rounding up
to 30 cents we would have a 30 cent gas tax. So in other words, there is
a six cent I know you can’t speak to this in terms of the exact
situation except to say that there is a 36 cents minus 30 cents means
that there is a six cent increase in the gas tax as a result of this
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, for this fiscal year the rate will reduce from 37.5 to 36 from the
period of July to December of this year the rate would have been 29.9
and this bill establishes a rate of 36.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. So can I ask this real quick to Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, what I would like to address that issue and then take your
question because you are pointing out that without absent this bill the
gas tax will drop and that is true. Absent this bill, the power bill
money to the city of Durham will also drop 1.2 million. The maintenance
money from the state for Durham County will drop 8 million 134,000. At
the same time two million and 100,000 power bill money will drop from
Rally, the Wake County maintenance budget for DOT will drop 31 million,
for the city of Charlotte four million $50,000 in power bill money will
be lost and the maintenance budget from Mecklenburg County will drop by
37 million, the city of Fayetteville will loose one million 100,000 in
power bill money, Cumberland County will loose 13 million 70,000 in
state maintenance money. The city of Greensboro will loose 1 million
400,000 in power bill money and Gilford County will loose 20 million
527,000 in state maintenance money. I mean the unique position being
supported by both the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce and the North
Carolina legal municipalities to stop the bleeding on transportation
funding. This fix dispatch of a 36 cent gas tax for the reminder of
2015, it’s simply to allow this body time to come up and fully debate a
more comprehensive fact or to fix to the problem of transportation
funding. Now, the sources of the numbers that I have just given you, the
county numbers came from the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce, the
power bill losses were give to me by Rose, ?? Williams of the legal
municipality. So they are both asking that this body joining with the
Senate take action to prevent a catastrophic…

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Loss of road funding at a time when we already
recognize our funding system is broke. We can debate and score points as
much as we want on whether we&#39;re cutting taxes, raising taxes, or
anything else. What we are actually trying to do is address a critical
situation in funding as two years ago we addressed a critical situation
in how funding was allocated. We have a major problem here that we need
to fix and this will give us the time to fully debate more permanent
changes and we&#39;ll certainly give you the opportunity for us to share
a great many debates on this topic in the coming weeks. So that&#39;s
what we&#39;re trying to do today sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I now address the-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you&#39;ll suspend for just a moment, so I&#39;m
not an expert on chairing, but I&#39;m in a roomful of experts. So
everyone&#39;s quick to point out that, while we had a motion and a
second that we did not take a vote to have the bill properly before us,
so all those in favor please signify by saying aye. Those opposed like
sign. Thank you. Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I hear what you&#39;re saying
Representative Brawley, but for the middle class consumer, at the pump,
those consumers will pay six cents more a gallon because-for
gasoline-than they would otherwise without this bill. There&#39;s a six
cent increase, tax increase for the consumer at the pump.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, it would drop by seven-and-a-half cents. We are
reducing that drop to one-and-a-half cents. We are not raising the tax,
but we are not allowing it to decrease as much as it would have absent
this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam. I&#39;m sorry, do you have a
follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley, just briefly. Still with
everything said, people will pay six cents more at the pump than they
otherwise would. This bill means that people will pay six cents more at
the pump.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There would be six cents more gas tax absent this
bill, you are correct. As to what they will actually pay at the pump, if
you know the answer to that, you should be a millionaire in trading
commodities. I have no idea what the prices are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Very good. I&#39;ll come back to you. Representative
Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you look at page seven?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you&#39;ll suspend. Representative Lewis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If the chair would indulge. I don&#39;t know if
Representative Stam&#39;s inquiries are on the same line as the
gentleman from Durham, but if they&#39;re not I&#39;d like to just ask a
clarifying point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis if you&#39;ll ask your question
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. If staff could tell me what
the current tax is per gallon of gas? I&#39;ve been told its 37.5 cents.
Is that right or is that wrong?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Amna Cameron, sir you are correct. The current tax is
37.5 cents per gallon and that is because there is a cap in place that
does not allow that tax to go higher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And could I just follow up, Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to be clear, under this bill, the gas tax would
become 36 cents, which is less than 37.5 I believe. Notwithstanding the
point about the importance of stabilizing the road funding that the
gentleman from Mecklenburg has made. Thank you for that clarification
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Lewis. Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Representative Brawley, on page seven, Section
2.4H, am I reading that right? That we&#39;re asking DOT to eliminate
500 filled full-time positions? Is that supposed to be in here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No Representative Stam, it is not supposed to be in
here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d offer an amendment at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett I think can address, or also
Amna can address the actual numbers that we were-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Cameron if you would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, he&#39;s right it says 500 but it&#39;s not
supposed to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would that be all of Subsection H? I know I is still
supposed to be in there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ll suspend for just a moment.

  <p id="015:00">
  Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stam, that was in the original bill. That
effective date has been pushed back to September 1 and it is not an
immediate cut of any positions. The funding for the 36 cent cut would
require the elimination of 40 unfilled positions this spring. Absent
action by this body, there would be a reduction of 500 on September 1,
as there will be a reduction of the gas tax to a forecast 26.1 on
January of 2016, absent action by this body, and both of these are
deliberate. It basically puts… I’m not sure what analogy I want to use,
but it puts a great deal of pressure on the House and the Senate to
solve this problem this long session, and that’s the intent, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So I’m missing it. Is 2.48 supposed to be in this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well may I speak to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m hoping, Mr.
Chairman, that we’re going to start building highways and filling
potholes, etcetera, and I just can’t imagine that those 500 people are
sitting there twiddling their thumbs and not doing anything. I hope
they’re getting projects ready, and here we’re telling them to fire 500
people, and Secretary Tata, whatever you think of him, is a great
manager, and… [SPEAKER CHANGES] You want to take it out? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] … I would move… [SPEAKER CHANGES] If the gentleman wants to
send forth an amendment… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, if you
will prepare an amendment, send it forth please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
others wishing to speak while Representative Brawley’s in front of us?
Representative Brawley, back to you if you will continue explaining the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well the cuts that would take place immediately
need to raise 9.2 million. That was worked out by the Appropriations
chairs. There will be 40 unfilled positions eliminated immediately in
DOT, but there will be no layoffs of actual filled positions. There are
some other cuts that are detailed in the bill. John, would you like to
address those in greater detail, or are there questions? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any questions? Representative Collins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
Representative Brawley, I know I’ve talked about this with you, and the
reason for a lot of the dates in this thing is to put pressure on us to
actually solve the situation long-term, which I’ve been in favor of ever
since I’ve been here, so I want to make sure I’m understanding you
right. Are you saying that 2.4H, that September 1st, 2015 date is in
there, again, to force us to solve this problem, and if we do get a
permanent fix for this problem, then we would repeal what’s in section
2.4H? Is that correct or not? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well the intent of the
PCS is to give us a stabilized transportation revenue for the rest of
the year, with the expectation that all of this, the transportation
section of this, would be replaced by comprehensive legislation to deal
with transportation funding, and it’s for that reason that I think it
would be okay for us to take it out. If we solve the problem, we don’t
need the 500 layoff. If we don’t solve the problem, the layoff is going
to be significantly more than 500 because we will lose significantly
more than was intended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I agree with that,
and I agree with anything that will force us to solve this problem this
session. I’m still not sure how I’m going to vote on this issue because
I’m not sure if this temporary patch with the default bad things that
will happen after it is sufficient to get us moving or if maybe it may
take a four month crisis where we can’t do anything to the highways to
get us to move, but movement to comprehensively solve the problem is
what I’m for. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins, I would ask that
you indulge us and vote for this, and I will express that I have more
confidence in the wisdom of this body to come together and solve that
problem. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Brawley, I’m right here. I’m following
you, and I understand what it is that you’re trying to accomplish. I
understand, but I’m contemplating an amendment, and I want to ask your
opinion. I understand that we’re trying to but some time so that we can
come up with a long-term six, which I am totally

[0:00:00.0]
I think you and the other Chairs know that I have a proposal that I
think merits some consideration and I think that this would give us time
to look at that and other good ideas. My question is, I think a lot of
folks were troubled and we have already heard both sides, we understand
for three months there is going to be a reduction in the gas tax and
then we understand from this that over the next six months there is
gonna be reduction from what it is now but it’s gonna be higher than it
would be if we do nothing with this bill. So my question is—could we
push that January 1st day back to October 1st which does make us have to
make our decision a little bit sooner but it still gives us a few
months? So I know that in looking at my issue for instance I was told
that they probably needed three months in order to make a transition to
do what I wanted to do. So my question is would it be a little bit, give
us a little bit more comfort to say that let’s have three months where
we are decreasing it and then three months where it would be higher than
it would otherwise be? So I want to amend that would simply be to move
that January 1st day back to October 1st and let’s try to solve the
problem just a little bit sooner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your question Representative Jones. There was originally
discussion at an earlier termination date and essentially the decision
was made that we would be messing with the normal reset dates on the
existing gas tax legislation to pick a date other than July 1 or January
1. So the decision to go to the end of this calendar year is that the
formula would normally operate to reset the gas tax on January 1
regardless. So that put the additional pressure, the October 1 date
would, if were voted back what not to what number we would we revert? So
that it would require additional load on the administration of the gas
tax so that was the reason that why an earlier date was originally
chosen for the reasons that you have mentioned, the January 1 date was
finally put in because of the most corresponded to the existing
mechanisms for administering and collecting gas tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I move my amendment and speak on it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t have copies but if you could read it, it’s very simple.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, the amendment reads. To amend the bill on page 7, line 5 to 16…I’m
sorry, lines 16 through 31 which changes the title by deleting the lines
and re-lettering the remaining subsections, Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I’m all in favor to put pressure on ourselves to get something done
but since we hope and expect that this won’t happen, there is no reason
to put a couple of thousand employees in the position of wondering for
the next six months or so whether they have a job when we want them to
be preparing plans to get roads bill. So I move the adoption of the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have an amendment? Is there second? No, second, another discussion,
Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A question, didn’t someone say not in this meeting but earlier that
these 500 positions were also in the budget to be eliminated at one
point? And I’m just wondering what happen to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct, it wasn’t the budget to be eliminated, this was an
additional pressure point but the point being made to have this hanging
with the question, with the macro question not being answered, it’s a
reasonable adjustment we are still going to be pushing for the
outsourcing of some positions but we are taking that out of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And maybe this would be a question for Representative Torbett but if
that was in the budget how come it was never accomplished?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett, do you like to address that please?
Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It might actually be more appropriately address to Transpiration
Administration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions for the bill sponsors, Representative Harry Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, actually I wonder someone or staff could tell me
if the gas tax drops by 1 cent effectively prefers and hopes if that
going through July 1st, I believe…

[0:00:00.0]
Well, the 15 week period what does that represents that 1 cent in the
last revenue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss. Kelly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This current bill has that cut from 37.5 to 36 so a penny and a half,
and in that rate cuts the revenues to the highway fund by 10 million
$50,000 into the Highway Trust Fund by three million $350,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So for those sponsors can you tell why we are doing a reduction when you
consider the price of gas per gallon was about a dollar so less than was
a year ago this time and it’s really an incidental amount, I look back
on page 4 of the bill, I’m seeing 11 million deducted from the current
Highway Program Administration, is that an offset the loss, the
reduction of the penny and can you explain me why we are initiating one
cent sales tax temporarily?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The 36 number came about re-consultation of Finance Chairs,
Transportation Chairs, leadership, some members of the minority party
and roughly about 25 people kicking this around to decide what number
made sense from both transportation funding and political point of view?
So this is not a purely technical answer there was a lot of arguments
that said, “Let’s set it at 37.5 and leave it.” There are some people
that say, “Let’s let it fall and count on all the additional people that
were drive to North Carolina to buy additional gas to make up the short
fall.” We had to pick a number that had support and that’s what we
choose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to clarify staff had some clarification on the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Emily Cameron, Sir I think what you are looking at is page 4 in the
bill, what that represents is the budget that was adopted in 2004 and so
that is actual law what changes is line 36 to show that this bill
reduces revenues by 3.3 million dollars in the Highway Trust Fund so
that cut was made to the 2004 budget, 2014 budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want the clarification on the year, Representative I appreciate
your explanation you have told me how but I’m still not clear on why we
want to voluntarily suffer a lost of that much money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, actually I think that’s a good answer that Representative Stam
says it’s called a compromise, if the gentleman wants to send forward an
amendment to change to 37.5 we will see if the committee will support
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Louis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With all due respect are we debating the bill or we debating the
amendment from Representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The point has made we are doing amendment, are there any other comments
on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Louis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sir, I have the fiscal analysis memorandum that was passed out
in our packet this morning, I would like to ask about some members if I
could as I look at this bill or at this memorandum it appears that there
is a cut of 40 million in savings for the fiscal year 2014, 2015; not a
cut, yes that cut would produce a misstate impact of 15…Well, my
question would be am I reading that right, my next would be would the
gentleman from Wake, amendment not change that radically?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss. Kelly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Louis I’m not seeing the 15 million numbers but I will
walk you through what the cuts are, if you look at page three of the
fiscal memo, you have a Table 1 and the Table 2, the bill balances, the
adjustments to the current fiscal year and six ways, first it makes no…

  the board cut, with several exceptions, including to the ferry division.
Number two, is it reduces three maintenance accounts by a half a
percent. It makes three statutory adjustments of items that receive
motor fuel tax revenue, that&#39;s the Powell Bill, Wildlife Resources,
and dredging, and lastly it eliminates 40 vacant positions and gives the
department the authority to use lap salary in addition to make up that
cut of $683,000. In the Highway Trust Fund, it follows the statutory
formulas for the strategic transportation investments program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis, does that clarify for you better, or a follow-up
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, Mr. Chairman. I apologize. Let me try to restate it. On the
first page of the fiscal analysis memo, in the box column that&#39;s
labeled &quot;fiscal impact, dollars in millions,&quot; under the column
entitled &quot;fiscal year 2015-16&quot; there&#39;s a minus 540 and
that&#39;s beside the line that says &quot;state position.&quot; So
I&#39;m just trying to understand if the amendment that&#39;s being
considered by the committee passes, would this minus 540 become a minus
40, and if so would that not have significant fiscal impact to the
transportation budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Cameron?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. I understand what you&#39;re saying and you are correct.
The state positions that are cut, you would include the 40,000, I&#39;m
sorry, the 40 positions for each of those five years listed and you
would remove the 500 positions beginning in the next fiscal year. In
terms of an impact, of course there is none to the current fiscal year
budget but any adjustments would be handled through the budget process
if those 500 positions were taken in a future fiscal year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis, is your statement on the amendment? Okay. Okay,
thank you. Any other commentary or questions on the  amendment? Seeing
none, all those in favor of the amendment as presented by Representative
Stam, please signify by saying aye. Those opposed? Appearing to the
chair the aye&#39;s do have it. The amendment it adopted. Representative
Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We are back on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I think you-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis has a question. Representative Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If this bill was to pass, can someone please
explain to me what would be the effect on the shallow draft navigational
channel dredging fund? I know there&#39;s a reduction, but how much?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As much as I&#39;d like to answer that for you I think I&#39;ll let
staff do that. Ms. Cameron?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the current fiscal year you have a reduction of $16,750. In the
future fiscal years, this would be a cut of, again it&#39;s on table
three, $357,375 positive in fiscal year 15/16, and a reduction of
$25,750 in fiscal year 2016/17.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you. If I could ask staff a follow-up up question, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, please, Representative Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the top of page six, thank you, Mr Chairman, on the top of page six I
noticed it says &quot;motor fuel tax ?? shallow draft navigation and
channel dredging fund&quot; and to the right of that in parentheses is
$1,677,134. Could you please tell me what that represents.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Cameron?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis, could you repeat the question? It was a little
hard to hear you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m sorry, on the top of page six of the bill it states that motor
fuel tax ?? shallow draft navigation channel dredging fund and to the
right of that in parentheses is $1,677,134, my question was what does
that represent?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, it represents what was in the 2014 budget. What you should be
looking at is page seven, line 13, and that gives the amount that is
being changed from the current year budget of $16,750.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Jones, I think I had you first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Representative Brawley, you answered my
question well a few minutes ago. Sometimes it takes me a few minutes to
jest and reflect and contemplate so let me ask my question this way. If
we were to pass this plan, there would be no change of the gas tax on
July 1st. There would be a change effective April 1st and there would be
not further change until January 1st. So I guess my question is if we
are deferring that change for three months, if there is going to be no
change on July 1st but we were to implement a change on October 1st, why
would that be a problem? I understand that the tradition is that
it&#39;s January 1st and July 1st but if we&#39;re not going to have a
change on July 1st, and I don&#39;t know if you can answer this or maybe
staff can answer it, but try to explain to me why the department would
have a lot of difficulty in deferring that change for three months?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, my understanding is that the people that would
actually collect and submit the gas tax are on a July 1, January 1
reset. It would be if we changed our tax filing date this year from
April 15th to July 15th, how much of a problem would that be for
CPA&#39;s and all the accounting, and I think it&#39;s just that is the
problem. It&#39;s just what people are accustomed to do, the way their
computers are programmed, the way they generate their reports. Would
staff-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff concur with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, could staff come in on that? Ms. Cameron.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Department of Revenue does, its IT system is based on more of a
quarterly system. So in terms of an administrative burden, it would be
better to have a tax change on October 1st or January 1st, March 1st, so
in terms of that it wouldn&#39;t be an issue. The issue is really what
tax, if you choose to file an amendment, what tax do you want to be in
effect on October, right now, the annual reset would be October so
you&#39;re amendment would need to say something in terms of the effect
of how the tax should be determined from October to January.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then it sounds like, from that answer, since they&#39;re on a quarterly
system that technically the computer, whatever, it shouldn&#39;t be a
problem if we started at the first of the quarter which would be October
1st.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Cameron.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, she&#39;s confirming that would be the case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If that&#39;s the case, Mr. Chair, I believe I would like for staff to
prepare that amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, if you&#39;ll work on that. Representative Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, a question for staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead with your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
37.5c and 36c, can you tell us what the current numbers are for
Virginia, South Carolina, and Tennessee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Cameron? I don&#39;t believe we have that. Hold on just a moment.
Ms. Griffin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe the bill summary has some reference to the other state rates.
If you look on page five of the summary, down where it says
&quot;current law&quot; and there&#39;s a subheading &quot;rate,&quot;
the second paragraph says what the current rates are in the surrounding
states. You&#39;ve got South Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee listed
there. South Carolina, 16c per gallon, Virginia 19.88c, and Tennessee
20c per gallon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan, was that what you needed? Thank you. Any other
questions on the bill?

  We&#39;re waiting on an amendment. Representative Hall.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and I want to go back I guess there seems to
still be some confusion about whether or not this is going to increase
the tax we&#39;re going to charge on these fuels and so I know, versus
what it would otherwise be without this bill coming forward. And so I
wanna make sure this is clear without this bill what the rate would be
and what this does to increase the rate by passing this bill.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Brawley.
[Speaker Change]
Sir, today the rate is thirty seven and a half cents. If this bill
passes the rate will drop to thirty six cents. If this bill does not
pass the rate will drop to approximately thirty cents. There will be a
reduction but I&#39;m not selling this as a tax decrease or anything
else. This is simply an attempt to stabilize the revenues on
transportation. We have essentially two choices, we can drop the gas tax
by seven and a half cents or we can fill the pot holes and pave the
roads. Pick one.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up.
[Speaker Change]
For follow up.
[Speaker Change]
So, without this bill it goes to thirty cents.
[Speaker Change]
That is correct.
[Speaker Change]
And your saying you want to increase it to thirty seven and maintain it.
[Speaker Change]
No sir, I do not want increase
[Speaker Change]
To thirty six.
[Speaker Change]
I want to drop it less than to thirty cents. I want to drop it only to
thirty six.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Jeter.
[Speaker Change]
Against my better judgement I&#39;m going to make a comment if I could
Mr. Chair.
[Speaker Change]
You may, we may not be able to save you after you make that comment but
you may.
[Speaker Change]
Yeah, to me, been married fifteen years tomorrow so now you know how my
wife feels. You know, it is I don&#39;t want to get into the semantical
argument of whether or not this is a tax increase or a tax cut, it is
what it is. Everybody can see it for what it is and I&#39;m not going to
go down that rat hole of us trying to get away from the larger scope of
what we&#39;re trying to accomplish by trying to dictate whether this is
or isn&#39;t what may or may not happen on July first. The premise I
think we all have understand and respect here is we are trying to come
up with a permanent fix to a problem that no other state has adequately
fixed. And admittedly we are trying to do so with a bill here today that
puts some emphasis on us to get it done by July first. It&#39;s on us
once we pass this bill which I believe is the right thing to do to make
sure that we sit down and come up with a permanent long term fix for
transportation funding in this state. The gas tax as it is currently
written will work. For lack of a better reason and I&#39;ve been in this
building for only two and a half years, just over two and a half years,
it feels like a lot longer sometimes. This bill gives us the incentives
for lack of a better term, to do the right thing and actually come up
with a permanent solution so we can go back to being the good road state
that we are. I cannot stress as much how much is important this bill is
to getting us on the track to coming up with a permanent solution
working together across aisles across urban and rural across all these
little pockets we like to put ourselves in. Let&#39;s fix this for North
Carolina, let&#39;s pass this bill and let&#39;s fix it before we get
outta here hopefully in July.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you representative Jeter, representative Hall
[Speaker Change]
Just a comment on the bill. Thank you Mr. Chairman and I can appreciate
the comments about what&#39;s been happening for the last two and a half
years that representative Jeter talked about, I&#39;ve had a lot of
objections about what&#39;s happening the last two and a half years as
well but on this particular matter it doesn&#39;t seem that this is a
permanent fix. This is not a permanent fix, I think he indicated this on
the road to talking about trying to do something later on. So we&#39;re
kicking the can down the road we shouldn&#39;t put this forward as a
permanent fix and then my question is if we don&#39;t do something in
the time allotted what happens to the tax? And so does this actually
move us somewhere are we doing anything regarding a permanent fix today?
[Speaker Change]
Representative Brawley.
[Speaker Change]
This is I would say part of a plan to do a permanent fix this does buy
us some time this is not the permanent fix.

  <p id="045:00">
  As for the need to solve this problem, I certainly look forward to your
support and involvement in us coming up with a good answer,
Representative Hall. And the last question, should we not take action
and come without us having replaced this bill, the gas tax will go, I
believe, it&#39;s been forecast at 26.1, which would be about $500
million a year reduction in the transportation funding. So there
definitely be pressure under us to move forward. So there would be a
substantial reduction in the gas tax on January 1, even with this bill
passing, if we do not replace it with a more permanent solution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Big problem, great solution, and I&#39;d like
people to go out of here rejoicing because this big problem is caused by
three really good thing. Much lower gas prices. Is that good or bad?
Good. Second, improved of gasoline mileage, which is what&#39;s [?? tape
fades out] Is that a good or bad thing? It&#39;s good. And then the
third thing is, of course, you got more vehicles that are going out
there using up the roads without using gas. Is that good or bad? Good.
So my point is this is not your typical...like what we had four or five,
six years ago when we were faced with the financial disaster where we
had to make hard choices. Here we have a hard choice because of good
things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And there was much rejoicing. We&#39;re waiting on the
amendment. We&#39;re close on the amendment. Any one else wishing...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, unless someone has a question...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ...if I may just make use of the time while the
amendment&#39;s being prepared, I think people filing in...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We need some filler, Representative Jones, so
that&#39;d be great.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I promise not to do any singing and
dancing. Why am I going to offer this amendment to basically reset the
date to October 1st? This is my purpose. Basically, it&#39;s two-fold.
Number one, we don&#39;t need to buy enough time for the legislature to
be here until October 1st for this session so that we can solve a
problem with the January 1st date if they need three months notice. I
don&#39;t really want to incentivize us being here until the fall to
solve the problem. So that&#39;s number one. People use the time you
give them and if we have an October 1st date, I believe we can solve
this problem by July 1st, which is when a lot of us would like to be out
of here anyway. We all know that when the summer comes that we&#39;re
going to have a budget to deal with. There&#39;s going to be other
things on the table. So I think October 1st, that reset date, would give
us adequate time to be able to solve the problem. Number two, let&#39;s
take out some of the political posturing here. Quite frankly, I
don&#39;t want to see one side trying to sell this as a tax cut and the
other side trying to say, &quot;Well, it&#39;s a reduction for three
months, but you&#39;re actually going to increase it for the next six
months over what it would have been.&quot; So I think it makes sense.
Staff has just told us their on a quarterly system. It&#39;s not going
to change the world if we have a reset date of October 1st instead of
January 1st. I think it makes sense. For that reason I think it&#39;s a
good amendment and I ask people to support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Very good. Anyone else wishing to speak?
Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It gives me...it&#39;s not
often I find myself opposed to my good friend. The reason this committee
is being asked to consider this bill today is to provide stability to
the road funding system. To be able to pave the roads that we need to
pave and fix the potholes we need to fix, replace the bridges that we
need to fix. I have great hope in the goals of Representative Brawley
and Torbett and Iler and Senator Rabin. All the folks that are really
committed to trying to fix this transportation issue, but it looks like
to me we would be wise if, like me, your vote today is on trying to
stabilize the funding in the transportation system to go ahead and allow
it to be stable for those six months instead of the three months that
the gentleman&#39;s amendment would create.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, can I...

You can, Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate Representative Louis’s comments, I would just say this—I
think it should be all about stability and that’s what it’s all about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me sign on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This does stabilize from April 1st and to October 1st to six months I
believe. So we have got a stable rate for six months and I’m not gonna
repeat the reasons I just gave but I don’t see moving from January 1st
to an October 1st reset day, it hurts our stability, I think this bill,
this effort needs to be all about stabilizing the rate, it doesn’t need
to be about the political posturing, it doesn’t need to about three
months increase, six months of decrease, how you wanna put that? So I
agree completely with the comments that my colleague from Harnett just
said except for I don’t understand how it’s changing from January 1st to
October 1st reset date hurts that stability. It does give us a six month
rate from April 1st to October 1st, and so I still think it’s a good
amendment, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Jones. Representative Hall?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and I know we have discussed both the amendment
and the bill back &amp; forth so just to clarify the discussion going
forward for the vote; I like to call for the ayes or no’s on the actual
bill, the ayes and no’s on the actual bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is sustained. Alright thank you. Representative Steinberg?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One moment Representative Steinberg.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, I don’t know whether this comment would be more
appropriate for the bill or for the amendment but anybody here had
kidney stones? I’m telling this is absolutely unbelievable, when we are
trying to compare the challenges that are facing us in terms of funding
transportation with, the challenges which the other states has
surrounded we mentioned the South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, and
for political posturing purposes among other reasons we are stating that
our gas taxes are so much higher than the states that surround us. I
think we need to keep in mind that just like an education and
transportation North Carolina does thinks a lot differently than these
states surround us and that is, and that is funding transportation, we
are talking care of secondary roads in this state, the other states are
not responsible for doing that, and that is one of the reasons why our
gas tax is higher. Now, we can drop at 16 cents, we can drop at 20
cents, we can drop at 25 cents, and we can bring it down to 0 but the
problem is going to be those real estate taxes and all of the counties
are gonna fall upon the counties to pick up the nut and I can tell you
there are a lot of unhappy folks back home if that were the case and
probably none of us would become back here for another session. So let’s
keep in mind that we are, when we are trying to politically posture we
are not talking about apples versus apples at all, this is completely
different here in North Carolina than those three states and borders. So
I just wanna to make that comment Mr. Chairman and I appreciate it,
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Steinberg, Representative Luke and
Representative Jordan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, Representative Brawley a moment ago reference to
rule that one-fifth of the membership of the committee has to support
Representative Hall’s request for the ayes and no’s, I don’t believe
most members of the committee understand that, if that’s what it means.
So if you like to have an ayes and no’s on the vote you would just, you
would have to raise your hand, and I understand the rule and you
understand the rule but I’m not sure the membership does and so I would
just ask if we could request that again, if we don’t have we don’t have
it but at least the membership needs to understand what that rule means,
it’s an obscure rule and so I’m asking if we could…

Representative Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you. I guess this is a question for
Representative Brawley, something that I don’t understand here we are
talking about reaching a long-term solution to fix the problem of
funding transportation because the gas tax is not working and we want to
put this plan into place now to force us to get that done this session
but if we get a long-term solution done by July 1 why do need this
stabilizing plant in first place, why we are even doing this now, why
aren’t we focusing on a long-term solution to get that in place before
the July 1 day, I guess that’s my confusion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thank to gentleman for his question, a long-term plan or we would need
some stability during the budget process to have some idea of what the
minimum number which we must deal. Also, there is a question—would we
come to a complete agreement by July 1? Decisions had to be made these
were the dates that we were picked, we could argue over what date we cut
if off, or what date we go in, these are all choices, a lot of people
say, “Why can’t we do this?” There is lot of reasons why, we had to make
a decision and move forward to it and to some extent I think we are
arguing over the arrangement of the deck chairs instead of just keeping
the ship of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Louis and then Representative Hager did you want to
speak?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Louis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to make a quick inquiry to staff
if I could in partial as a follow up. Representative Jordon, it’s my
understanding that by statue what the gas tax is effective July 1st is
actually set March 31st because it takes three months to get it done
which is the reason there is an urgency to pass this bill. Could staff
speak to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m Amina Cameron, before I enter Representative Louis’s questions, I
did want to acknowledge there is an error in the fiscal note in terms of
Representative Stam’s amendment, and those 500 positions that were
eliminated should be shown as a negative, should be shown as a negative
number for the expenditures for next year if that amount should be a
negative 18.75 million and then in the last three fiscal years that
should be shown as a negative 25 million, and to indicate the loss of
those positions, to answer Representative Louis’s question the way the
gas tax formula works right now is it’s based on a six month figure, the
July rate would be based on from October 1 to March 31st but we don’t
have those figures on March 31st, the preliminary figures for the
current month will come in May but they won’t we finalized until June.
So we actually don’t know what the tax rate will officially be until the
Department of Revenue releases those figures and that happens by law on
June 15th or December 15th each year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, I just want to voice my support for this
amendment, I think Representative Jones has a right, we need to fix this
issue, don’t let it linger, let’s get this amendment pass so we can get
a permanent fix of this problem so we are not hash this thing out again
next year and the next year, and the next year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones I think we have your limit ready and we will think
as a motion…Representative Collins, Miss. Griffin if you read the
amendment to us please we don’t have the copies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So the amendment next changes in two places in the bill if you are in
the PCS on page 4, the paragraph at the top, line 2 it’s going to change
September 30th to June 30th. And then online five, it removes the word
calendar…

January 1st, 2016 and both of those on lines 44 and 46 would be changed

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions for staff on that reading of the amendment? Seeing not,
recognizing Representative Jones for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted, if I understood what the staff just
told us, it seems to me that that&#39;s one more good reason why it
would be good to go to the October 1st effective date. Because if I
understood what she said, we don&#39;t really have those numbers in
place by March the 31st and by changing the effective date we would
actually know what the numbers were beforehand. So that may be one more
good reason, if it&#39;s not then okay but I&#39;m not going to repeat
all the things I&#39;ve already said. I think this does help us. I
don&#39;t think it does any harm and I hope that we&#39;ll support the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the amendment, I&#39;ve got Representative Jeter and then
Representative Stam. Representative Jeter?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of clarification and if I could, maybe for staff, assuming for a
second that Representative Jones&#39;s amendment passes, the effect on
October 1st, what would the gas tax be in North Carolina on October 1st?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff? Ms. Cameron.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter, we would have to do a quick analysis but it should
be very close, still, to the 29.9 rate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just an observation, very similar to the one I made on my amendment,
it&#39;s fine to put ourselves in a box where we have to work but what
the amendment does is to put mayors and city councils and road planners
in a state of uncertainty as to what will be happening in the fall and
what roads can be built and be planned for, so I&#39;m not going to vote
for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Stam. Seeing no others, there&#39;s a motion
with a proper second on the amendment, all those in favor please signify
by saying aye. Those opposed. Appearing to the chair the no&#39;s have
it, the no&#39;s do have it. The amendment is adopted. I&#39;m sorry,
the amendment fails. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don&#39;t do early mornings, by the way. Seeing not, Representative
Brawley for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move that the PCS to Senate Bill 20 as
amended be engrossed into a new PCS, that we report favorable to the new
PCS with serial referral to appropriations, unfavorable to the original
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a motion, do we have a second? We have a proper second. Any
other discussion? Seeing none, all those in favor, signify by saying
aye. Those opposed? The bill passes and I think moves on to
appropriations next. Up next we will have House Bill 117 as we discussed
last night, if the sponsors of that bill would come forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A request while she&#39;s coming forward?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead with your request.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could my amendment be, being passed out, and the reason I say that is,
under House rules you can argue against an amendment by telling about
the merits of your amendment and the amendment is in the packet that I
would argue against because another amendments coming. If I could just
have it passed out I&#39;d appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can have that passed out for you, certainly. We have a motion that
House Bill 117 be before us by Representative Martin, do we have a
proper second? We have a second. All those in favor signify by saying
aye, those opposed? The bill is before us. Representative Martin, you
are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, first I want to apologize for the length of the committee and
please don&#39;t hold it against me that you&#39;ve had all this long
debate. I will try to net this out as simply as possible. I was going to
have staff go over the bill but I might just start by trying to give you
the high level components. There&#39;s a lot in it but it really nets
out pretty simply. Can you all hear me okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we could have a little order please? Thank you.

Thank you. Okay, there&#39;s a lot of

  <p id="065:00">
  greater debate about the programs, but let&#39;s just talk about what
this legislation does. It expands the ability to grant JDIG awards until
2020. So currently, this program is set to expire in 2016. It gives us
additional financial availability of funds. The current program, we have
$25,000 of availability if we have a project that commerce has a
positive return on investment and wants to make a grant, we are not in a
position to award any grants at this time. We do have $7.5M in the
budget that&#39;s already been allocated made available from July until
December. So what this bill does is it collapses that time period and
makes that immediately available if the right project comes along now,
we could reach forward and take that $7.5M for somebody making a
decision today who&#39;s not waiting until July and we also authorize
$50M for this calendar year of additional funds to made available. And
we&#39;ll talk more about the program overall. There is a re-branding in
here of some of our incentive tools of the job, the JDIG, and the One NC
to job growth reinvestment capital for One NC and people for JDIG.
There&#39;s the marrying of funds that were put in the budget last year,
appropriated, they are currently out there, $20M dollars were set aside
for the job catalyst fund provided that passed. That did not get enacted
last year so we have $20M dollars sitting there that does not have a
program around it. We also have a program that was effectively used to
recruit Merck and has been depleted of funds so does not have funds
available but it has all of the requirements of the committee reviewing
it, a return on investment, and it&#39;s been successfully utilized so
it&#39;s not as much of a walking-around money, people were very
uncomfortable last year just putting money in there and essentially a
closing fund. So this is much more controlled. So it&#39;s marrying
funds that are already available with a program that&#39;s already out
there that doesn&#39;t have funds. That is the site infrastructure
development fund and is re-named. There&#39;s a slight modification to
the single sales factor, I might let staff go over that and we are
looking at extending the sales tax refund for passenger air carriers
exactly the same way that we&#39;re doing it today. We&#39;re asked to
completely eliminate that, we&#39;re not able to do that financially,
and then there&#39;s a slight modification to the data infrastructure
act. I&#39;m going to see if there&#39;s, I guess what maybe I&#39;ll
start with is ask Commerce to come forward, there&#39;s a handout that
I&#39;ve asked to go out that Commerce has put together that further
explains these programs and I want to make one really important point. A
lot of us don&#39;t care of incentives and we want to just be a
competitive state, we don&#39;t want to have to play these games. The
way that recruitment works these days, a lot of things get done on the
computer based on software and they check a box and determine if you
wind up in the top three and the incentives box needs to be checked and
then you get to come to the table and once we get to the table in North
Carolina, we want to have the best business environment from a tax
standpoint, regulatory environment, infrastructure, education, of any
state. So that when they look at what it takes to do business in North
Carolina, what you need from an incentive is going to be really, really
a small part of the package and eventually none. But if we don&#39;t
check the box, we don&#39;t get to come and prove that to other folks
and it&#39;s our job, as we go forward, to create that better
environment, but we&#39;re not in a position where we can just say,
&quot;We&#39;re not going to play that game, period. We just don&#39;t
want to be, that&#39;s not going to be where we lead. So we need to be
out there, there&#39;s been a lot of reports about, &quot;Oh, these are
not successful, you see the percentages,&quot; the reason that is true
is that by design of the program, where we don&#39;t pay out unless the
jobs are actually there. So when the economy is not performing and
there&#39;s a recession and we&#39;re not creating jobs, automatically
that gets reduced. That&#39;s good news, folks. That is not bad news.
And we&#39;ll get more in to that. Now that the economy is growing is
when we do want to have the availability because people are looking at
expanding and we can&#39;t just say, &quot;Well, we don&#39;t want to
take them right now.&quot; If people are looking at relocating, this is
the time that we need to be leveraging that and folks are saying,
&quot;Well, we&#39;re doing well so maybe we don&#39;t need these
programs.&quot; Well folks, we have had these programs. This is part of
the package that is helping us to compete. So some of those points,
I&#39;d like to have Commerce to make a few comments and then we could
have staff go over some of the financial impacts. I know there&#39;s
some amendments, and then we&#39;ll get to questions and hopefully we
can facilitate moving the conversation along.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Martin. We&#39;ll recognize someone from
Commerce. I believe I see Secretary Skvarla, if you would press the
button, hold that button, state your name and who you&#39;re with for
the committee.

  Mr. Skvarla, we cannot hear you. Let&#39;s see if we can try that again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Still not working. Is that working?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That works, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m John Skvarla. I&#39;m the Secretary for the
Department of Commerce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Welcome to the Finance Committee, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for having me this morning. And I&#39;d like
to begin by thanking Representative Martin. She has dug into this issue
and truly understands the attendant ramifications of what we&#39;re
talking about here. And your work and your knowledge and your
understanding of this has been superlative, and we can&#39;t thank you
enough for the job that you&#39;ve done on this, Representative Martin.
Thank you. I&#39;m going to say the one thing that we all are going to
agree on. Everybody in this room. Nobody likes incentives. The practical
reality is that our competitive pool is not only just the United States,
but foreign countries. And if you look out at our immediate competitive
pool, it&#39;s probably ten southeastern states, nine of which are
controlled by Republican governors and generals assembly. They all have
incentive programs. The reality is we must be competitive, as
Representative Martin just said. There&#39;s no question that incentives
are the first box that is checked by anyone looking at North Carolina.
We need these tools. I believe you have a fairly comprehensive package
that was just handed out that the Department of Commerce has prepared
late into last night. And it talks about the various programs, so
I&#39;m not going to get into the detail. We have a plethora of staff
here that can answer questions on the detail, but the reality is these
tools are discretionary. They create a return on investment to the state
of North Carolina. The money is only spent after economic vitality has
been created. They&#39;re targeted. They address big companies and small
companies. They range from Murphy to Manteo, from Nash County to
McDowell County. Everyone benefits. Whether it&#39;s the JDIG program,
or the utility fund that&#39;s part of the JDIG program, or the One
North Carolina program, which is specifically targeted to infrastructure
in smaller areas. We need these tools. We have a pipeline full of
projects and at least as to the JDIG program, as the governor says, the
emperor has no clothes. We have no ability to compete. And I&#39;m going
to close by reading you something that I just received from the state of
South Carolina dated February 27, 2015. And I&#39;m going to read you
two sentences from their eNewsletter: &quot;There&#39;s no question that
the auto industry has played a significant role in evaluating, in
elevating our economy to its current status as beast of the
southeast.&quot; It&#39;s our understanding that South Carolina paid
incentives to Boeing to move to Charleston for 2500 jobs. Boeing now has
10,000 workers in that plant. And South Carolina didn&#39;t pay anything
for the 7500 additional jobs. Since 1983, South Carolina has issued 459
bonds totaling more than $8.6 billion, which in turn resulted in the
retention and creation of more than 215,000 jobs. We have a program that
is discretionary, and we have a program that is targeted. And we have a
program that ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Secretary Skvarla, if you could. I think your finger
might have went off the mike there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a program that is targeted, discretionary, and
creates a positive return on the investment. We need the tools. Thank
you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Secretary Skvarla, can you or someone from your team
explain what these maps are in the handout, so that we can draw
members&#39; attention to the various maps, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Secretary Skvarla, you&#39;re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that still on? Make sure I get them in the right
order here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No problem. I know there&#39;s a lot of

  ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The first one... Is this on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You&#39;re on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The first one is a map that represents the investment
in the utility fund. And the utility fund is a program that is part of
the J-DIG program, or better, the Job Grow People program, where money
invested in J-DIG also is allocated to utility fund, an infrastructure
fund that can only be used in 80 counties. It can not be used in the top
20 economically more viable counties. And if you look at the data, since
the inception in 2003 there have been 70 utility fund projects. If all
the J-DIG awards are in fact made... Or I&#39;m sorry, today,
there&#39;s 37.2 million out of the 193.4 million in J-DIG awards made
that&#39;s on the left side. And there was another $11 million from that
fund that was diverted last year by the general assembly for other uses.
So the reality is almost $50 million has gone into the utility fund that
benefits only 80 counties. MetLife has been a topic of discussion of
recent days, and that was a tier 3 project. MetLife potentially could
receive $116 million in J-DIG award, of which 29 million alone would go
into the utility fund. So every time a J-DIG award is made, the entire
state of North Carolina benefits. It does not just necessarily go to
tier 3 counties if the award is made there. The second map you should
have... is where the J-DIG awards have been made. And very clearly, the
disproportionate number has been to tier 3 counties. But remember
there&#39;s a salient feature in J-DIG, and that is the determination of
the award is a function of the estimated withholding. It&#39;s capped at
$6,500 per person. And it&#39;s also capped at 75% of that estimate. And
to make a long story short, what that means is that where jobs pay more,
which is generally in the tier 3 counties, there is excess income tax
created that will not be used for the program, to use for other purposes
in the state. It&#39;s harder to achieve that in the more rural areas
where the jobs don&#39;t pay as well. So even though there&#39;s been a
disproportionate percentage in the tier 3&#39;s, the tier 3&#39;s are
contributing to the overall economic well-being of the entire state, and
that&#39;s your choice as to how to use those funds. The third map talks
about the one North Carolina. And that&#39;s a program that requires a
local match, and if you look at the map, it is spread all over the
state. 407 projects, almost 15,000 direct jobs, an investment of $4.4
billion in private capital along with the one North Carolina program. So
I think these three maps represent a good explanation of how the
programs work in tandem, and the fact that the programs are working for
the entire state of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you miss secretary. Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. There&#39;s been a lot of information about
this bill out there, so I&#39;m kinda torn if we want to have staff go
through in detail or if we just want to go to member questions. So,
gonna throw it out there, if there&#39;s a recommendation...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m hearing staff. Staff, if you would, walk us
through the bill please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, good morning. Looking at part one of the bill
that deals primarily with J-DIG, section 1A, well under current law, the
maximum J-DIG commitment for 2013-15 biennium is 22.5 million, and the
maximum J-DIG commitment for the perion for 7/1/15 through the end of
the calendar year is ??

  .5 million dollars. Section 1A collapses these two caps on these two
time periods into one time period from 7/1/13 through 12/31/15. It makes
the 7.5 million that would come online as of 7/1/15 immediately
available, and it also provides an additional 15 million dollars for the
program. Section 1B of the bill rebrands the program to the Job Growth
Reimbursement Opportunities Program. Section 1C of the bill eliminates
prioritization of JDIG funds for eco-industrial park projects. Section
1D of the bill eliminates reference to the minimum health coverage, as
recommended by the Small Employer Carrier Committee, pursuant to
58-5125, as the applicable provisions of that statute were eliminated
with conforming the statute with the Affordable Care Act. Section 1E
modifies the relevant time period against which increases in employment
are measured. Under current law, the business must maintain employment
levels at the level of the year immediately preceding the base period.
The base period is the period of the time… it’s the ramp-up period in
which new hires are made to fill the created eligible positions. The
bill would change the relevant comparison point for employment levels
from immediately preceding the base period to the greater of the
employment levels at the date of application or the date of award.
Section 1F. Under current law, the authority to make new JDIG
commitments expires as of 12/31/15. The bill would extend the authority
to make new JDIG commitments until 12/31/19, or it will expire 1/1/20.
Part 2 of the bill rebrands the One NC Fund as the Job Growth
Reimbursement Opportunities Capital Program. Part 3 of the bill, as
Representative Martin indicated, would take the 20 million dollars that
was earmarked in last year’s budget for the Job Catalyst Fund, which did
not pass, and would reallocate that to the Site Infrastructure
Development Fund to reactivate it for site development functions. The
bill would also change the outmoded statutory reference about minimum
healthcare requirements, similar to what was done in JDIG in Part 1, and
it would rebrand the program to the Site Acceleration Fund. Part 4 of
the bill deals with single sales factor. Corporations that do business
in more than one state apportion income tax and franchise tax to each of
the states with which it has Nexus. North Carolina, generally speaking,
uses a double-weighted sales factor apportionment formula, but for
qualified capital intensive corporations, North Carolina uses a single
sales factor formula. The big requirement for a qualified capital
intensive corporation, or a QCIC, is that it invests at least 1 billion
dollars over nine years in a tier 1 or tier 2 area. There are also wage
and health insurance standards and job maintenance requirements that are
associated with that tax benefit. The bill eliminates the requirement
regarding corporations’ property factor. It eliminates the requirement
that the facility for the QCIC be located in a tier 1 or tier 2 area. It
converts… Currently if you have the single sales factor benefit and you
don’t make your investment over the nine years as required, then that
tax benefit expires and you lose the benefit moving forward, but there’s
no recapture of previous years, so the bill would convert the expiration
of the tax benefit into a recapture provision should the QCIC fail to
make the required investment or otherwise fail to meet the eligibility
requirements. The bill would set forth explicitly the wage standard
instead of incorporating it by reference. Regarding the healthcare
coverage requirement, you see a similar provision that we’ve seen twice
before in the bill; it eliminates an obsolete reference to the minimal
coverage recommendations by the Small employer Carrier Committee. And
finally in this part, it eliminates the sunset for the single sales
factor benefit for QCICs. This is set to expire in 2019 if no
corporation qualifies as a QCIC by that time. This would eliminate that
sunset. It also eliminates the prohibition against coupling the single
sales factor tax benefit with incentive funds from JDIG and/or One NC.
Part 5 of the bill. Under current law, businesses whose primary business
is scheduled passenger air transportation and interstate commerce or
passenger air carriers are allowed a sales tax benefit in the form of a
refund of sales tax paid on fuel in excess of 2.5 million. The refund
tax benefit is repealed for purchases made on or after 1/1/16, and this
draft would… the bill would extend the tax benefit for four years to
1/1/20. Finally, Part 6 of the bill. Under current law, data centers

  receive tax benefits for certain purchases under certain qualifying
conditions. Most similar to this bill, data centers receive a tax
exemption for sales of electricity and data center equipment if they
invest $250M dollars over a period of five years. This draft would
create an additional sales tax exemption for data center equipment and
electricity if a $75M dollar investment is made over five years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I also want to point out that in your packet, in addition to
the bill summary and the fiscal memo, there&#39;s a job growth program
overview that staff put together for me and that is because the bill
just talks about how it changes but if you&#39;re not as familiar with
the way that the current programs operate there&#39;s a lot more
information that&#39;s maintained that we&#39;re not discussing. So you
have that summary as well if there are questions and I&#39;ll open up
for discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams, I&#39;m sorry, Representative Stam, I had you
first, and then Representative Adams. I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could I ask Secretary Skvarla two questions, if he would?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Secretary Skvarla, if you would approach the podium. Representative
Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Secretary Skvarla, these are two questions I asked our non-partisan
staff a week ago and they properly declined to answer so they, I would
suggest that they ask you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I also properly decline?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
According to the fiscal note, the big part of this bill, of course, is
JDIG, somewhere between 281 and 900 million dollars. So this is about
JDIG. Suppose we had one large company, right, in Pittsboro say,
doesn&#39;t matter where it is, and they employ ten thousand people and
we refund to them a portion of the withholding, which is how JDIG
operates as I understand it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we refund a portion of the income tax paid buy the new employees,
the withholding is simply the methodology to calculate the, but the
withholding technically belongs to the employee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right, and that&#39;s my point, is you&#39;re actually refunding some of
the tax paid. The question is, and this is if it&#39;s all working
correctly, not if it doesn&#39;t work, but it&#39;s working correctly,
who pays the taxes to educate the children of those workers and who pays
for law enforcement to arrest the people who victimize them and who pays
for all the other services for these now people? Would it not be fair to
say that that&#39;s the people in other parts of the state who are
paying it? This is not a perpetual motion machine, it&#39;s actually
paid by the rest of us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, not necessarily. First of all the award is limited to a period of
years. The award is not a perpetual motion machine. Secondly, with the
75% limitation on the withholding calculation and a $6,500 limit on the
amount of the withholding that can count. The idea is that more taxes
than will be reimbursed to the company are created for general use
purposes, that was my point. So the idea is that there will be net
dollars to do all of those things. If the world works perfectly there
will be net dollars and we&#39;ll be getting net dollars from people
that were never North Carolina employees paying taxes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up for Secretary Skvarla.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. On the One North Carolina Fund, the testament we had of a week ago
was that the typical award for One North Carolina Fund was $2,000,
$3,000, $4,000 per job, and I assume there&#39;s-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Depending on the tier, it varies by tier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right, right. You&#39;ve been in business a long time. Do you think
$1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 is enough to, a one time pay, is enough
to induce anybody to hire anybody?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, remember, the One North Carolina Fund has a local match. So if
the-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Including the local match.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely. In tier one and tier two counties, 20 jobs, 25 jobs is huge,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very brief follow-up. The question&#39;s not how many jobs but per job,
if you&#39;re in business, whatever you&#39;re, engineering, would you
have induced to hire an additional employee by somebody agreeing to pay
you one time, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, because that fund is used for infrastructure and equipment,
absolutely. If it will defray the cost

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, if I may?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Comment on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I think this is the example of where once you get
around the table, you show that the incentive portion does not need to
be huge. You&#39;re trying to make the business case that this works for
this company to expand or relocate and grow jobs in this area, and the
amount of it that&#39;s in an incentive versus just a good business
environment should be low.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for sharing it. Representative Warren, did
you have a question for Secretary Skvarla?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, actually.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. You&#39;re recognized. Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On page one, lines 25 through 29, it refers to,
actually gives a definition of a full-time employee as someone whose
compensation is under $150,000, and it says it&#39;s relevant to that
subsection. So on page three, lines 2 through 6, in talking about the
acceleration fund, I guess, or the site infrastructure, that definition
isn&#39;t given for employee. So my question is, is it the same
criteria, or are we looking at a 40-hour workweek or a 30-hour workweek?
What classifies as a full-time employee under that section?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I get staff assistance with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff, could you assist?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don&#39;t know that answer off-hand. I don&#39;t
think the wage requirement is there. I think that it&#39;s something
along the lines of 1600 hours in the year, but I can get more
information and get back to you on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, yes. If we don&#39;t specify the
compensation as a criteria like we do on the first page, would those
positions then fall under ACA for a 30-hour workweek, or would we have
to mandate something is my question I guess?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And it could be in the statute, but we&#39;re not
changing it, so that&#39;s what we need to clarify, if what&#39;s
spelled out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Edify??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The only thing I would add is, so the requirements
that you&#39;re seeing in the bill are dealing with health insurance
requirements for employers to employees in order to qualify for the
program. It doesn&#39;t try to adjust what is the federal requirements
or anything like that. It&#39;s simply saying in order for you to be
eligible for site infrastructure or for JDIG you have to provide a
health benefit for your full-time employees. So I don&#39;t know exactly
the difference between the full-time employees for these two programs,
how they line up, but I&#39;ll get you that information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren, yes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to follow up on that point?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ll let you follow up and then Representative
Adams, Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Just to follow up on that. Is there a
definition of health coverage? What does it mean to have health care
coverage? I mean, do you have bare-bones or do you have a decent plan
such as the state health plan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Martin or staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Edify.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So currently the way the bill is drafted there is no
minimum standard for health care coverage that has been put in. We could
reference other statutory standards, but currently there is no minimum
health care coverage standard in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And in some of that discussion, what was taken out was
things that became obsolete because of the federal laws. And so because
it&#39;s a little bit in flux we felt that we should maybe not tackle
that right now, and if we see an issue we might want to come back and
specify it to North Carolina. But we do intend that these would be good,
high-paying jobs that would have health coverage and meet the OSHA
requirements, those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Adams, then Representative
Waddell, then Representative Jones. Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My question has to do with the utility account. It
says here the utility account provides funds to use for utility and
infrastructure improvement projects in tier one and tier two areas if
reasonably anticipated to create jobs. I come from an area that has
abundant conventional utilities: water, sewer, electricity, natural gas,
that are a legacy of our lost manufacturing base. My question is, what
other utilities might be eligible for economic development, and
specifically would or could these utility funds be used for, or applied
to, a fiber-optic broadband project?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Martin, or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me give that to Dan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Edify.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So the types of utilities that may be covered through
the utility account are water, sewer, gas, telecommunications,
high-speed broadband, electrical utility distribution lines or
equipment, transportation infrastructure for existing and new or
proposed buildings.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Waddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.

  <p id="095:00">
  Mr. Chair, my question is basically I guess for the bill sponsors on the
bill summary on page 4. It refers to the ?? requirements to the
corporation property factor and the requirement that the facility be
located in a tier 1 or tier 2 area. Does this mean that the single sales
tax could be used…? It wouldn’t be an enticement for those folks to be
moving into a rural area or depressed area? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, the
bill does remove the restriction on where a qualified capital investment
corporation that’s going to invest a billion dollars over nine years
would have to locate to anywhere in the state, and we believe we need
that flexibility. There’s other programs that we definitely want to
incent them to locate in a tier 1 or tier 2, but if the option is
somewhere in North Carolina or in Texas or South Carolina, we don’t want
to have that restriction on there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I understand the fact that you may need to draw those
corporations into other areas of the state, but in looking at rural
areas and how depressed some of the rural areas are, wouldn’t this be a
carrot that we could stick out there, really, to help convince those
folks? Because I really understand about single sales tax and what
possibilities it could have for increasing property values, which would
be property tax and also your payroll that you’re going to be putting
into these economies. We lost a lot of income in those rural areas, and
this looks like to me would be another panacea to try to moot it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Waddell, if I may, and Secretary Skvarla or one of our
staff, maybe you can correct me if I give incorrect information here,
but as I understand it, I think there’s only one corporation in North
Carolina that actually qualifies for this. Isn’t that correct? And that
if we pass this…well whether we pass that particular change or not, the
only other corporation that I’m aware of that could benefit from it is
one that’s already… or actually one of three that are looking at a tier
1 area already, so in practical terms, I don’t think it’s going to
affect anything currently possible that we’re looking at right now. I
guess the key is if a company this big, and what we’re talking about is
something like one of the auto manufacturers that’s looking in eastern
North Carolina… something this big comes around and they want to locate
in outside Charlotte or outside of Raleigh or whatever, we don’t want
them to go to another state just because we don’t want them to locate in
that particular area. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a follow-up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Last follow-up. Maybe the possibility might be you’ve got the
billion dollars in there… maybe the possibility might be to lower that
amount or something. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I think you’re going to see that. I think you’re going to see
that probably when this bill goes over to the Senate. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, you’re recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank the bill sponsors and everyone that’s
come forward with this. It’s very difficult for me to say that I’m going
to ask my colleagues to join me in voting against this bill. It’s
difficult because I know the administration wants it, and it’s I know
believe they’re doing the right thing for the right reasons. We all want
to see more jobs in this state. Jobs becomes a very emotional issue. I
represent two depressed tier 1 counties, and I’ve seen firsthand what it
means to live in a depressed area where unemployment is higher than the
state average – sometimes significantly higher, and I understand when a
legislator wants to do everything they feel like they possibly can to be
able to go back and tell their constituents that I did something to
create a job. I’m just going to make a few comments, and I’ll probably
have more to say later, and I know we’re somewhat time-limited, but just
some of the things that I’m hearing. We keep hearing we have to do this
– we have to do this to compete, and we’ve heard all about how South
Carolina’s kicking our rear end and Georgia’s kicking our rear end,
Tennessee’s kicking our rear end. I just looked at the latest
unemployment rate figures. North Carolina, 5.5%. South Carolina’s at
6.5%. Georgia’s at 6.9%; Tennessee, 6.6. So apparently we must be doing
something right. We must be doing something right in North Carolina.
Another thing: Let’s just think about… you never hear about the
opportunity cost. People say “Well it works. It works.” If you were to
go out and spend a half a million dollars on a car, I hope

  <p id="100:00">
  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would work?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I hope it would work really good.  But, the fact of it
is, if you’re a person like most of us are with limited resources and
choices to make on how to spend those resources. You have to tell
yourself that maybe I could have spent 25-times less money on that car,
and spend that money on something else. And we all know that North
Carolina has a lot of needs. You know the art of politics if you will,
is taking limited resources and making important decision on how those
limited resources are going to use. I will give you the works, if you
spend enough money you can create a job, it works. I would refer you
back to- and there are so many studies; we don’t have time to even go
there. From the left, from the right, from the so-called nonpartisan,
the independent, the universities, the journals, but just look at our
own UNC, Kennan Flagler, Kennan Flagler Study from 2009, look at the
previous decade of J- Dig and looked at the 3 billion dollars that state
had spent, and concluded that we had created 300 net, new jobs. It
worked, it created some jobs. But how much money did we spend per job?
You know, as I said, my county is deeply depressed. And I was a county
commissioner, and knew what it was to try and fight for a few crumbs
from the table, when the state was putting this money out there, and to
try to go up against the giants, and to try to get a few crumbs to come
back to our county. What makes me sick, when I look at my county is,
when I look at the 3 billion dollars spend and I do the math, and I
recognize that my county’s proportional share of that money would have
been 30 million dollars. I can’t imagine what 30 million dollars, right
now would mean to my county, because of the needs that we have. You
know, we that oppose this type, are often dismissed, and we’re
marginalized as ideologues, we’re either right-wing or left-wing
ideologues, we’re close mined, we’re riding on our high horse, I’ve herd
it all.  You know, there are not too many things out there where you see
The Conservative John Locke Foundation and Civatas agreeing with The
Liberal and North Carolina Justice Center and Policy Watch, but this is
one of them. It’s kind of interesting, they are all looking at the same
factual data, that’s coming from the universities, that’s coming out of
the nonpartisan think-tanks, that’s coming from the left leaning groups,
that’s coming from the right leaning groups, and their all interpreting
through their own lenses, whether it be from the right or the left, and
they all despise it. They say that it’s not good; they say it’s a bad
deal.
The other thing we hear, that it’s always the right time, we heard, this
is the right time, the economy is good.
You know, when I came here in 2011, North Carolina was looking at
unemployment rates of 10 to 11%. We had the fifth worse unemployment
rate in the nation. We heard the ox is is in the ditch, we’ve go to do
this; this is the time. We’ve got to increase our incentives; we’ve got
to do something we’re in trouble. So, now we’ve cut the unemployment
rate in half. North Carolina is around the nation average, I think, this
particular month, ahead of the national average. So it’s the right time,
It’s always the right time to spend more to do this.
You know, we’ve heard it’s bad for everybody, but it’s especially bad
for the rural counties. And since 2002, the reports were in, 59% of
these J-Dig awards, went to only 3 counties. So if you’re one of those
3, I guess you brought home the bacon, I don’t know, I would vote
against it, even if I were there. 91% of the awards went to urban
counties, so I can go back to my 2 rural counties, and you know; we’ve
got 9%, whoop-de-do, that’s great.
[???], I can’t support this, and you know, you can say its ideological,
I don’t know.
Frankly, I don’t know if I despise this more because I’m a conservative
on the right or if I would despise it more if I were a liberal on the
left. Because I can stand here today, as a conservative who believes in
a limited government and I could spend the rest of the day making a list
of things, where North Carolina needs resources. You know, you could
start, and probably make a really long list, regardless if you sit with
the left or the right today. So I would just say, when you hear that it
works, of course it works. We’re going to spend money we are going to
create something. But, I just cannot accept the fact, that we take money
from the many and give to the privileged few, less than 1 tenth of 1%,
of all the businesses in North Carolina. I want for North Carolina to be
a leader, I want for us to work for a better way. I, actually believe, I
actually believe in a free market and fair competition, an equal playing
field. And I believe, with all my heart, that North Carolina could be
the leader. You know, the final…

can&#39;t have unilateral disarmament, I don&#39;t want to disarm, I
want to go out there with a better weapon and a better weapon is a
better tax climate for everybody. So that those 800,000 small businesses
in North Carolina can  create jobs. So we&#39;re not taking from them to
give to a few. I beleive we can do better than this. So I&#39;m not
against jobs and I&#39;m certainly not against the people who are trying
to promote this today and I&#39;m not against my governor. I asked some
of the people on my side of the aisle, would you be jumping up behind
this if Governor Perdue were still governor? I&#39;m just trying to look
at the facts. I&#39;m just trying to look at the facts. So, members, I
can&#39;t support this. I hope that many of you will join me in not
supporting this, and let&#39;s make North Carolina a leader, let&#39;s
do something better and support jobs in a better way, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Jones. You mentioned your good friends up
front here and I kind of liken it when your sponsoring a bill,
you&#39;re kind of like Ricky Bobby and you don&#39;t know what to do
with your hands when you stand up here. So I appreciate you all
suffering through what we need to do. Representative Collins, you have a
comment, and then Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I&#39;d just like to say I agree with my good friend,
Representative Jones, that we&#39;re on the right track and we&#39;ve
been doing the right thing for the last four years in making our state
much more business friendly and it is paying dividends when you look at
the statewide numbers. I like Representative Jones too, though,
represent tier one counties and I haven&#39;t seen that improvement in
my county yet. Maybe he has, I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m living in one
of those counties. It seems like all the decrease in unemployment so far
is centered around Mecklenburg and Wake and a few other counties. It
hasn&#39;t reached my area yet to the extent that I&#39;d like to see it
reach. I would like to comment on a few, because like him I like facts,
and so I&#39;d like to comment on a few things he said. Number one, that
his county missed out on $30M dollars because of what&#39;s been
allocated to JDIG, that&#39;s really not true. That money wouldn&#39;t
have been there if those companies hadn&#39;t of come and paid those
payroll taxes in. So it&#39;s not like we&#39;ve got, we&#39;re
snatching money away from people, that money wouldn&#39;t have been
there to begin with. So there would have been no $30M dollars to
disperse because that&#39;s just a part of the taxes they paid in. Plus
I&#39;m sure his county&#39;s like mine have benefited from the utility
fund that JDIG pays into. So there actually are some benefits there that
would not have been there had we not awarded those grants. Number two,
well I want to talk about unemployment being down but it&#39;s not down
across the state. Number three, as far as, and I was concerned about
this too, it is true that most of the JDIG grants go to tier three
counties but JDIG is not the only incentive program we have. We&#39;ve
also got a One North Carolina fund and that one goes primarily to the
rural counties, to the the tier two and tier three counties. In fact, I
think the most recent numbers we heard were 65% of the grants and 55% of
the money goes to to tier two and tier three counties, which obviously,
that&#39;s probably a great over representation by population because my
counties don&#39;t have the population that Wake and Guilford and
Mecklenburg and these other counties have. So you have to look at them
in balance. It is true, JDIG primarily works for large metropolitan
areas because it works primarily for large companies that invest a lot
of money and pay high salaries because those three things have to come
in play in order for the JDIG formula to work. So, unfortunately, if a
company can create 1,000 paying $80,000 in Charlotte and my county can
create 1,000 jobs paying $40,000 in Nash County, it&#39;s not going to
work under JDIG. It might work under the One North Carolina Fund, but
that&#39;s a different part of the mix. But you have to take those two
together to understand how we attract businesses to the different areas.
But anyway, I agree with him, we&#39;re on the right track and I&#39;d
love for us to get to the point where we&#39;re so good we don&#39;t
need any of this stuff. But as I&#39;ve said before, we&#39;re just not
quite there yet. I think we&#39;re headed there, I just don&#39;t think
we&#39;re there yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the members, I&#39;m referring to the sponsors of the bill then
I&#39;ll get to Representative Stam and then Representative Szoka.
Representative Martin and then Representative Steinburg.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that and I just want to thank my fellow members, even
those who are arguing against it. These are all really important
conversations to have and I don&#39;t disagree with a lot of the
comments that you&#39;re making and as Jeff commented, that we are
making progress in unemployment, we have had these tools and the fact
that we&#39;ve been utilizing these as companies are growing is evidence
that our current JDIG amount that we&#39;re able to commit has been
committed because companies are coming and that is just one part of the
package. I want to point out again this job grow program summary
that&#39;s in your folder. This highlights some of the research

  about incentives and some of the progress we&#39;ve made that talk about
that incentives, under incentives were tax credits and discretionary
programs that have defined metrics and defined criteria, performance
criteria, and can be more strategic. And the recommendations were move
away from tax credits, the discretionary programs are more effective in
really growing jobs. We have made great progress in here because we had
the really hard job of tax reform, which we&#39;re not done with, to
move away from as many tax credits and still having some discretionary
programs. So I want to point that out. A lot of people are talking about
that study and this is staff&#39;s analysis of the summary of the key
points there. And also in there goes over all of the protections and the
process for turn on investment that are required for these programs. So
I want to make sure people fully understand that piece.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Steinburg.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, everyone. I would like to start out by saying that in the
last three campaigns I bashed my opponents over the head repeatedly for
embracing economic incentives and Representative Jones had mentioned
Governor Perdue and some of the efforts she had and I can honestly say
that I was absolutely, without question, opposed to that. Well it&#39;s
funny how folks can change and especially once you get in office and you
start actually dealing with constituents on a day-in day-out basis and
not just your friendly, familiar circle of people that you see every
day. And in doing that, what I have come to the conclusion of is that
we, in both Eastern and Western North Carolina have been depressed, that
wasn&#39;t a revelation, but have been economically depressed for a
significant number of years. This bill is an opportunity to change the
board in a very, very big way. If you look at, and there are several
automobile manufacturer&#39;s, for example, that are looking at North
Carolina right now, most of you know we lost Mercedes-Benz to Georgia
because the Senate and the House were unable to cobble a deal together
last year to make that happen. We are the only state in the southeast
that we compete with that does not have an automobile manufacturer. Now
let me get back to those folks back home, and not just in my district
but those folks back home throughout the east and the west and other
depressed areas of the state. Some of these people have been hoping for
change for about ten years now. Now, I agree that the best way to create
jobs is to eliminate the state income tax and to eliminate or lower
significantly the corporate tax, and that in itself, if we could do that
tomorrow, I believe that is the best way to create jobs and bring these
folks to North Carolina. Sadly, that&#39;s not going to happen. It may
not happen for two years, it many not happen for five years. So now
we&#39;re talking about folks back home who have been looking for a good
job, any job, for ten years and now we&#39;re asking them just to hang
on another five years and that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen if we
don&#39;t do anything. They&#39;ll be having to hang on another five
years. That&#39;s fifteen years. What is the average number of years
somebody is employed before they retire? Thirty years, thirty-five
years, forty years? Well certainly that fifteen years is a very, very
significant part of their working opportunity. We are one North
Carolina, and I&#39;m not talking about the fund, we are, and I believe
a lot of my friends here int he legislature who are metropolitan, they
represent metropolitan areas and urban areas, I believe they understand
the crisis we face and I believe they understand that the only way we
can turn this state around is that everybody needs to share in the
prosperity. Things are getting better over our way, things are getting a
little better in many parts of the west, but we still got a long way to
go and for us, for us to turn our nose up at an opportunity like this
and say, &quot;Folks, we&#39;re just going to ask you to hang on a bit
longer, we&#39;re working on getting it right,

exasperation and the frustration. I don&#39;t know of any legislature
anywhere, unless it was because of maleficence, has never been
re-elected by a or failed to been re-elected by a resounding margin if
that&#39;s what we&#39;re thinking about just the politics of it because
the created jobs. I&#39;m not voting for him, my god he created nine
hundred jobs over here. That&#39;s not the candidate I want. This,
we&#39;re talking about human lives, we&#39;re talking about people that
have been hurting for a very long time. I came to Raleigh with one
specific purpose in mind and I believe a lot of my colleagues did as
well. And that is to bring opportunity not just to parts of North
Carolina but to bring opportunities to every single corner of North
Carolina. And it&#39;s about time we started thinking as one in this
chamber and we started thinking as one in the other chamber and we unite
to do what we&#39;ve been called to do. And that is to bring economic
opportunity to each and every one of the people that have entrusted us
to come to Raleigh to do exactly that. So I commend each and every one
of you to please, please, for god sake, support this legislation,
let&#39;s make let&#39;s turn hope into reality. Thank you.
[Change Speaker]
Thank you representative Steinburg. Representative Stam I believe your
next on my list.
[Change Speaker]
Yes, I offer an amendment which is at the desk and has been passed out.
And if I might be recognized.
[Change Speaker]
Your recognized for a motion.
[Change Speaker]
OK, and after my explanation the Chair of the committee may decide to
break this into three sections or take it as a whole. But I&#39;d like
to explain it first. The first
[Change Speaker]
Representative Stam, my I interrupt you are the copies of this amendment
at each desk do we know?
[Change Speaker]
Yes. It was passed out early.
[Change Speaker]
If you&#39;ll suspend for just a moment. Everyone&#39;s nodding they do
have it? Yes? OK, alright. Just want to make sure we&#39;re all on the
same page. Thank you sir. Go ahead, proceed.
[Change Speaker]
It&#39;s four version two.
[Change Speaker]
Representative Stam.
[Change Speaker]
Well first of all I&#39;m not going to make a speech against the bill
it&#39;s no secret I&#39;m going to vote against it but this is not a
catfish amendment. I stopped doing that many years ago. If you adopt and
your in favor of the bill this will make it easier to justify your vote.
Some votes for it. What I&#39;m trying to do here is to coordinate the
feelings about what the bill should be with the actual text. Now the
first section you hear a lot about we&#39;ve got to help the rural areas
and you also know that ninety percent of JDIG stuff went to tier three
counties I believe last year even though some money went to the grants
went to tier three although some money went to the infrastructure. This
amendment was inspired by a conversation I had heard between the
governor and the by far the most successful business person in North
Carolina. Was a public conversation, I heard it in which this fella said
I really don&#39;t mind if you want to have some incentives for rural
areas but it really irritates me when your paying my competitors here in
the triangle to, you know, to compete against me. And he&#39;s right, I
am from one of the most prosperous districts in the state and believe it
or not I&#39;ll get away with proposing that we have a limit of sixty
percent of JDIG grants to tier three counties. Probably should be twenty
percent but I&#39;d ask you to vote for sixty percent limit on tier
three counties. Section two, well part of section one also addresses a
phenomena we heard in finance, you know we have this claw back where the
economic investment committee may require part of the money to come back
and this just says they shall require it to all come back. That&#39;s
matching the rhetoric with the bill. Section two addresses the one North
Carolina fund. I don&#39;t, we paid a million dollars per job I believe
it was for Apple or Google and that really did induce jobs I&#39;m sure.
We probably over paid but never the less it induced jobs. And typically
when it&#39;s about somewhere around twenty thirty

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] 40,000 it&#39;s right on the tipping point of whether
it actually induces a job. But when we&#39;re paying out three, four,
five thousand I don&#39;t believe that that&#39;s enough for a
businessperson to actually make that decision on that basis. So, but
they have to say it to us. So all we&#39;re doing in Section 2 is
letting them say it under oath so they&#39;ll at least think about it
twice rather than it just being a box they check on a form. Section 3
deals with clawback, and we hear about, you know we always claw it back,
but it&#39;s a slippery glove. It&#39;s not a true clawback and the
example of course is Dell. I offered this similar amendment to the Dell
deal eleven years ago, they didn&#39;t adopt it and Dell didn&#39;t pay
all the money back because it wasn&#39;t a real clawback. What this
requires is that there be security for the clawback and it needs to be
real security. Now the very last sentence of the provision on page three
allows the Department of Commerce to subordinate that security to ?? try
to interfere with things. But if you don&#39;t have security, either a
bond or a letter of credit, or a lien on the property, then if you go,
if that company goes into bankruptcy, the state of North Carolina is a
general creditor and it&#39;s not going to get anything. So that&#39;s
what&#39;s there in Section 3 and I hope-I&#39;m still not going to vote
for the bill, but you&#39;ll take-my speech will be 80% less than if you
don&#39;t because you have taken away half my talking points.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Fascinating, that is a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A bargaining chip there, I don&#39;t know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe, I think we have a proper second for the
amendment. We have a second from Representative Setzer. Any discussion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes we wanted to ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, we&#39;ll get you. Representative Goodman
I&#39;m going to go to you first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I was fascinated by that
presentation there and the thing that really bothers me about that
amendment. If you assume that 60% of ?? grants have been spent already,
and the state of North Carolina gets an opportunity to land another
company that wants to come to the triangle, then we&#39;re going to say
we&#39;re sorry, but we have this money, but we can&#39;t use it because
it&#39;s been designated for Tier 1 counties. To me it ties one arm
behind the backs of the Department of Commerce. The other thing is I
really don&#39;t believe that saying that 40% of the money has to go to
Tier 1 counties is going to guarantee that Tier 1 counties get any other
jobs, because companies locate where it serves their best interests, so
I just don&#39;t see that as being a practical provision. The second
thing is if I were a company that we were negotiating with and you told
me I had to say under oath that I was going to do something it would
really be like spitting in my face. I would consider it-I just don&#39;t
think that is a good way to negotiate anything, so I&#39;m going to vote
against the amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Goodman. Representative
Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, just to note that the bill sponsors are opposed
to this amendment, and not to some of the ideas that he&#39;s going
after. I do have another amendment that I will send forth that I will
try to address some of these concerns about the money and the tiers and
some of the clawbacks that I think will accomplish it in a more
reasonable approach that doesn&#39;t have some of the issues that
Representative Goodman brought forward. So we ask you to vote against
the amendment and a few other comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Representative Goodman hit the nail on the
head, which is we run the risk of losing the big fish with the 60% cap,
because there&#39;s other ways to incentive or solve the problem to
ensure that Tier 1 and Tier 2 counties are included. But if you get a
Boeing, if you get a MetLife, if you get whomever it is, that is the
biggest whale in the ocean, the numbers are going to exceed 60% and then
we just killed the bill. I would argue that this is a unintentional
catfish amendment, because what you&#39;re saying is no big companies
are going to be eligible if they desire to be in a Tier 3 county.
That&#39;s what the effect of this amendment does. We&#39;d ask you
strongly to defeat the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins and Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah I&#39;d like to speak to what seems like the most
probably innocuous part and that&#39;s

  Part two and I agree with what representative Jeter just said but I have
the biggest problem with the second change because I actually have a
large employer in my district which just opened a new plant for a new
type of business this year and hired a lot more people. And the
president of that business told me one of the things, that they actually
turned down state money I don&#39;t know if it was JDIG or something
else. But it was one of those where you had to check this box that says
I would not have done this expansion in their case if I hadn&#39;t
received state money. He said, I couldn&#39;t tell them that cause I was
going to do it anyway. And I think that&#39;s well to me to make
somebody say that I would not have done this project without the money,
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the deal. If we&#39;re creatin if new jobs
are going to be there and maybe this guy, these folks have been a good
employer for a long time and they were expanding their business and so
forth. I wouldn&#39;t have been opposed to helping them with that but
anyway to make them say it under oath I think is even worse. I would
like, I would be for eliminating that check box in the application to
start with would be my personal opinion on that not to make it more
binding than it is now.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Dollar.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, I think it&#39;s worthy noting and I don&#39;t
know if representative Martin mentioned it but representative Martin
does have a an amendment that assume will be taken up that&#39;s sittin
here on the desk that is better than the far preferred than the Stam
amendment but certainly addresses some of the concerns you know in one
sense the percentage is irrelevant because we can always make the
program bigger. But why go through all the trouble, why limit yourself
to sixty percent when we know we can always come back at some point in
time and make the thing bigger in order to accommodate something that we
need to do. All we&#39;re doing by putting in this sixty percent figure
on this is ensuring that we have to raise to cap on JDIG bigger in the
future if we&#39;re trying to accommodate some major projects that may
come our way. It&#39;s kind of self defeating it seems to me.
Representative Goodman I just can&#39;t improve on his comments they are
exactly correct and the comments have been made by him as well as
representative Collins on section two that&#39;s, your not going to sell
the state that way that&#39;s not a rationally way to sell this state.
And the other thing I&#39;ll just mention very briefly, is that so HCL
they came to an area not far from where I live, they&#39;ve grown
they&#39;ve got some incentives, they invested they&#39;re a world wide
company they&#39;re an international company based in India. They could
have gone anywhere I mean literally anywhere in the globe and
they&#39;ve gone a lot of places in the globe. But they wanted to be
here, to have a presence here and to take advantage of the markets here
as well as to take advantage of the quality of people here. They had an
opportunity to expand, the state stepped in the county stepped in the
local government stepped in and enticed them to bring a thousand more
jobs to our area. Well, all those people don&#39;t live in one
particular legislative district or one particular county. They come up
US one from Lee county, from Harnett county, they come over from
Johnston county, they come from Chatham county to take those jobs and
those are areas that are looking for jobs. And you know when we have
those jobs there is a multiplier effect, somebody gets a job they are
able to spend money in the grocery store and get their hair cut, and go
to the dentist and everything else that you want to have done. So your
either going to, gonna, we should either do this the right way or not do
it at all. And, but the amendment offered by the gentleman and while I
respect him greatly put you in sort of the nether world that you
shouldn&#39;t really be in. We should do it right or not do it at all.
And I would recommend the defeat of this amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you representative Nelson.
[Speaker Change]
President Stam.
[Speaker Change]
Yeah, speak the second time very briefly. If you look at your fiscal
note the maximum potential liability is nine hundred.

  hundred million dollars over the course of this long grant. So suppose
you get this big fish this year – the really big fish. You could offer
that company over $500,000,000. Well you’ve got to take out the
percentage for the infrastructure, so it’s more like 400,000,000, or in
that area. That’s a lot of money, but I think the very best argument
made for this amendment and for the defeat of the bill was made by
Representative Collins, and I’ll take you back to his discussion of
Section 2 where this company didn’t take the money, didn’t want to sign
the form because they were coming there anyway, and that’s what we know.
That’s what we know, is almost all of these companies are coming anyway,
and I’ll take you back – I’ll send it; I’ll pass it out by email, but
there’s an article in Journal of World Business where the company’s put
these incentives down at item number 10 on their list, and the top three
things of course are transportation, labor and energy costs, and this
is, like, number 10 on the list, and they’re coming anyway. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Let’s see. I have… Representatives Szoka and Bradford, I’ve not
forgotten you, but you were on my list prior to the amendment, so next
on the amendment, Representative Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. If you’ve been listening carefully, I’ve been kind of
astounded at the schizophrenic argument that’s been going on here. The
last three supporters of this bill have basically said companies come
because they want to. It has nothing to do with incentives, and that’s
this whole debate we’re having here. I was originally going to ask
Representative Stam why he’s got this 60%. You’re granting that most of
this stuff is already going to the wealthy counties, and I’ve got two
that are not the wealthy counties, so why would I support 60%? Why
wouldn’t I support none of this going to the wealthy counties? Because
global companies want to come to the triangle because of everything
that’s already here. Well they’re not coming to my area because of
what’s already there because we don’t have the same things, so doesn’t
it make sense that that kind of incentive would need to be for my kind
of county and not the big counties? I think the fact that all of these
incentives have gone historically to the wealthy counties shows you
exactly what this is, which is corporate entitlements. This is welfare
for corporations, and it forces them to say they’re coming somewhere
because of the but-for clause. Of course they’re not going to take that
box off because if they say they didn’t come but-for, then they don’t
get the money, so of course they’re going to say “Well yeah, we came
because of incentives.” How do we know that that’s true? It’s probably
not true, so I like the idea that Representative Stam has put in here of
making them actually sign a certification. That’s great. At least that
will get them for something, but when we get back to the bill, I’ve got
a lot more to say, so I’ll stop right there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Representative Jordan. I think just for the folks at the back of
the room, we’ll put you down as a maybe. Representative Alexander.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This has been an interesting
debate. I find myself somewhat confused in that people who I would have
anticipated would have been on one side tend to be on the other, and
having listened to all of this and read through all of this material, I
was greatly tempted by the position that Representative Stam brought
forward. I was tempted because much of the discussion that I’ve heard
has centered around a sense that too much has gone to tier 3 counties –
a position that I vigorously oppose, quite frankly. I do believe that at
the end of the day, corporations are going to come to North Carolina for
business reasons. It’s nice to have incentives, but if there is no
business reason to be here, they’re going to go somewhere else, and
because of that, at the end of the day, I cannot support the amendment
as presented. I’m sorry, Representative Stam. You almost got me.
