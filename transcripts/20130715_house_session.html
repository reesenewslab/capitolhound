To Speak on the Bill

The gentlemen is asking for a motion and an abatement on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I would make a motion that we concur
with the city's substitute for House Bill 418.  The senate did make some
changes for parole violator would allow Buncombe County to go forward.
The county is asking for this authority to and they have delayed
adopting their budget because of this.  If our local governments could
agree at some point time in the future they could come back to this body
and request that other local governments be able to join.  I ask you to
support this Motion to Concur.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and Gentlemen of the House I don't know
if you recall but this bill was with us before it went over to the
senate included the City of Asheville after two years they would be
included in this parks and cultural authority.  The bill came back from
the senate and Representative Ramsey is asking us to concur with
Asheville now not included in this authority at all.  I have to say that
I would have likely, more likely voted for the earlier version that
created a joint authority and it's my hope that at some point the county
will have a true joint authority and include Asheville and other towns
within the county and what they might have to offer.  But it seems as if
we are adding another layer of government in the county to oversee
entities that already oversees.  Buncombe County is creating an
authority for entities that Buncombe County already oversees.  So
without knowing the real purpose of this, I will have to vote against
the Motion to Concur and I hope you would join with me on that.  Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the Motion.  If not, the question
before the house is the Motion to Concur and the Senate Committee

[SPEAKER] ?? county, North Carolina, was instrumental in the development
of the community and the only church to serve the community for
the first 100 years of its existence, and whereas in 1756 the ?? of
Philadelphia sent the reverend James Campbell, a Gaelic preacher, to
serve the Highland Scots, who have settled in the area of the lower Cape
Fear basin, beginning a tradition of establishing different
preaching points throughout the region and whereas the first settlers
gathered under Brush Harbors at the head of Rockfish Creek and a
regular community of worshipers was established, and whereas in 1788 the
first solid structure was built on property that had been dated to
James Patterson by king George of England in 1766, and whereas in 1832 a
second building was built adjacent to the Petie road, a major
roadway for the areas commercial trade in the community now known as
Blue's Crossing, and whereas in 1862 a third building was built on the
same property with a gallery for slaves and a separate entrances for men
and women, even in the mist of the hardships and strive of the
Civil War, and whereas in 1907 a fourth building was built in the town
proper, by now renamed Aberdeen, so that the worshipers could have
access to electricity and to be in a location more centrally located to
its parishoners, and whereas in 1923 the members decided to
institute a tradition of an annual homecoming at the previous location
in order to preserve the history and structure of the old church
building, and whereas in 1972 a fifth building was built on US highway
1, allowing the church to continue serving the community in the best
way possible, and whereas in 2013 Bethesda Presbyterian church has
survived and served for 225 years and deserves recognition. Now,
therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives:
Section 1 - The House of Representatives honors the founders of Bethesda
Presbyterian church for their dedication and contributions to the
rich cultural heritage and support to the community.
Section 2 - The House of Representatives applauds the congregation of
Bethesda Presbyterian church for its continuous service to the
community and contributions to the cultural and religious heritage of
the state of North Carolina.
Section 3 - The principle clerk shall try and submit a certified copy of
this resolution to the reverend Jonathan Wallace, pastor of
Bethesda Presbyterian church.
Section 4 - This resolution is effective upon adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Boles is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. My Family moved to Aberdeen in
September of 1970 and we started attending Bethesda Presbyterian
church at that time. I became a member of Bethesda in April 7th, 1974,
and I served as a deacon there, and all four of my children are
baptyzed there at the church. The church is my home church and it was a
very good church to grow up with a good supporting community.
Bethesda has a real rich history in the area of More County, that became
part of ?? Cumberland and surrounding counties.  The old church
stands at the cemetery, at Bethesda cemetery, where we also have Walter
?? Page which was buried there also. Bethesda is also the home
church of one of our Speakers here in the House, in 1963 the very first
Speaker in this particular building H Cliffton Blue was a member of
Bethesda Presbyterian church and I can always remember attending church
and seeing him and local politics was always an issue there. I
commend the resolution and thank you for your support and your time.

before the House is the adoption of House Resolution 1019. All in
favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.</p>

unanimously in the House. It is really in the nature of a regulatory
reform bill striking a required planning process within ??. To my
knowledge, it's no conflict there. On the Senate side they added a
provision related to one landfill in one county and the legislators in
the House who represent that one county have a difference of opinion.
And I think we can get this resolved Mister Speaker but we need to
establish a conference committee.

that requirement was removed.

does the gentleman wish to record? The clerk will lock the machine and
record the vote. 109 having voted in the affirmative and none in the

Representative Collins, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
briefly debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized
to debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, I’m trying
to get to the document I need to get to. This bill does what it says. It
makes several changes to the Nursing Home Administrator Act that had
been requested. Primarily what it does is change some of the
requirements for training for nursing home administrator. It also allows
the board to raise some fees. Now some of these fee raises which haven’t
been done I understand in ten years, since 2004, look pretty steep but
I’m told by Senator Tucker, at least we were told in Finance Committee
by Senator Tucker, these were maximums. Some of them say you can raise
the fee from 100 to 200 and he said the expectation they were told was
they would be raised immediately to 125. So these are maximums that are
allowed. They’re not necessarily going to those amounts right now. Other
than that, it also does some reciprocity requirement updates. It also
allows for criminal background checks of people that are going to
operate nursing homes, and make some other technical and miscellaneous
changes. I ask you to support Senator Tucker’s bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
