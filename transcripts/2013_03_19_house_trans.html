45-55 miles an hour. Now I handed out a handout it's got 4 pages on it.
Basically a lot of this we went through before but on page 1 which I
circled was primarily saying that the DOT in particular warns us that
slow moving buses are a hazard. And also, the buses that you generally
see on the express way the DOT prohibits school buses from being on the
express way when they're in their routes in other words when they're
carrying children. The only time you see those on the express way is
either they're going in between routes or they are going to a
maintenance shop or going home or coming to. But that's why you've seen
them on the express way with the lights on going 40-45 miles an hour.
They are unoccupied. The second and the third pages are, I'm trying to
emphasize that, the school bus driver is a professional driver. And even
more so that a person who's driving a car or a truck that goes beyond
that and it says that they're required a lot more education and training
and testing and then on the final page I wanted to give you a overview
of what other states are doing. And that's probably the significant one
because we asked two questions when we did these interviews and we
actually called the folks up we didn't rely on the internet for this
information, is that North Carolina currently our maximum speed limit is
45 other than I want to say activity buses can go 55 but 45 miles an
hour generally and of course you'll see South Carolina, Georgia and
Virginia.  Georgia and Virginia are 55, Virginia is 60, and then
Tennessee and Florida are they don't have a governor set and they
strictly go with the current speed limit on their buses. So we are the
only ones, in fact Virginia just changed their law 3 years ago from 45
and the primary reason was complaints from bus drivers themselves that
they said it's just plain dangerous to go 45 miles and hour on the
express way especially when they are ongoing in traffic that even though
the speed limit may say 55, they're going 60, 65 sometimes even higher.
So the other thing I wanted to add just real quickly to end this up is
the reason why I actually brought this up is it's one of those bills,
it's one of those situations where you experience it personally. I don't
know how many of you have ever said years ago &quot;There ought to be a
law against this.&quot; You see something, &quot;There ought to be a law
against this.&quot; And you see it everyday and you say &quot;If I was
ever in the legislature I would change this.&quot; And mine is no
different but oddly enough 10 years ago I never thought I'd be in the
legislature but here I am. So I would get on the express way, I'm a
contractor. Not like many of you I drive a truck sometimes I pull a
trailer behind the truck with equipment on it and I would get on the
express way every morning probably from the south end of Charlotte to go
Gastonia and I'm just satisfied when I can get on safely, and this is a
pretty busy road in the morning, and I'll park myself or keep myself in
the right lane and go 55-60 and I have no problem and I'll do that all
the way to Gastonia but what I would counter is on a minimum of 3 buses
and sometimes 4 sometimes 5, I would have to veer around them and go
around them and try and get back and the problem was if you're on a
highway not many people are on it and it's not a big deal but when
you're on the express way it's really busy it's really difficult,
acceleration is at great and basically it's a personal issue for me,
I've observed it and if you've done it before you know. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions from the committee? Representative
Faircloth. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Forgive me Mr. Chairman and it's taking so
long. I understand</p>

<p id="10:00">
?? concerned about this issue and you only have to go out here on
interstate 40 through raghleigh and see what a problem this is with the
school buses having to drive 10 or 15 miles, 20 miles slower than
passing traffic. I think a lot of this has been created by the fact that
we have by having children going to school all over these school areas
the buses have terrible patterns they have to run to catch up and get
around to all the kids and if they dont take these shortcuts down the
interstates or the busier highways they just cant make those routes and
the kids end up staying another hour on the buses. I think this is a
good move. I think it's unsafe right now when you're on a 65 mile an
hour highway and you come up behind a 45 mile an hour school bus. It can
cause some real safety problems so I'm in favor of this bill ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay Representative Blackwell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Chairman. Reppresentative Brody, clarify for me if you will. In
the listing the you got about what's going on in the other states where
it says issues regarding safety where you've got none in all those
columns. What exactly does that mean? is that related to the provision
that is in the PCS about not required to use hazard light or what do you
about safety when it is refered to in your chart? Where you've got none.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes that's correct, we, Representative Blackwell, we
asked a specific question. In order to get consistency amongst all the
states we have to ask the same question to everybody. And what we asked
is do you have any safety issues regarding the maximum speed limits that
you allow your buses to run on. And that was generally the answer. We
put none some say no we didn't have any. We kinda condensed it down ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Mr. Chairman [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brody, do we know what the other states
practice is as to requiring the use of hazard lights by school buses
under any circumstances? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No I'm sorry I can't give you
that answer. This also gets referred to the education committee between
now and then I could get you that answer. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jader [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, I am
along with Representative Brody, one of the two primary sponsers of the
bill and a firm supporter. And I did have and I thought this was an
important anecdote to share with the committee. I did speak to Tim
Morgan who is the vice chairman of the CMS board of education who spoke
to Ms Standford who heads transportation for CMS school district. One of
the issues I said when will this bill be relevent? And the majority of
the time  that our school buses are actually on the interstate except
the activity buses and the athletic buses is at 6:15 in the morning when
they're running the buses from one school to another to basically locate
them to run their routes. So at 6:15 in the morning during a lot of
times when it's dark outside no students trying to get from one school
to the next. To allow this is truly a safety measure. And one that I
think is well heeded and well served for this committee to support. And
i would certainly ask for you alls support of the legislation. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] President McManus [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? but I am curious why ??
what was the thinking behind that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] There the hazard
lights were from the original bill when they were going 45. It was real
important if you're going to go 45 even if you're towing a car or normal
everybody flips on their hazard lights because it's just plain
dangerous. I just basically carried that forward. 55 now is pretty much
the posted speed limit around most of the main expressways and limited
control highways anyways. So I felt the people go 55 but they really
don;t need it. It's just that simple. [SPEAKER CHANGES] President ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] President Brody, the way I
understand this bill is that</p>

[speaker]
its not going to be un lawful to operate a school bus at a speed greater
than 55, if its unoccupied
but i think whats going to happen is that the govenor is going to be set
to 55, is that the correct in the state
[speaker changes]
well thats interesting the ??? is very clositation to the shells and
???, and this program is basically, is optional to the districts so they
dont even have to go 55 if they want to go back to the old 45 with the
lights on, they can do that but a lot of governors are set to 45 and
inorder to change that they would have to change the govenor itself,
most of those are electronic so its reletivity easy project to do, for
??? question
[speaker changes]
so what we're saying then , my original thought was, well why didnt we
just say its unlawful to drive occupied or unoccupied school bus greater
then, but the way i the intricuricies of the way its described here is
that the moving the bus from one place to the other,
would just be subject to the rules of the road, up to 55 miles per hour,
is that correct,
[speaker changes]
i dont quite follow what you are saying
[speaker changes]
its not unlawful
[speaker changes]
its not unlawful to , we distinguish between occupied and unoccupied bus
in there, and basically its the same speed limit, but we distinguish
between the two,because my experience with them is unoccupied bus, the
problem is with unoccupied buses, i hope that helps
[speaker changes]
ok representative Brian Brown
[Speaker changes to 9 Rep Brian Brown]
for a motion more appropiate , thank you, representative Brisson
[speaker changes to Dem 22 William D. Brisson]
thank you mr. chair , mr. Brody its all about child safety , with school
buses and right now the state of North Caralina says again to not exceed
45 mph with children on the buses transporting kids back and forth to
school,
if you move the govenor up to 55 miles an hour , that eliminates that
opportunity and chances, and i know that your saying that these are
professional drivers, these drivers are payed by the hour their not on a
time schedule other thrn tryig to get the kids to school, for instance
the only time their on time schedule is when they have transporting the
kids to school ,
its still governed , school buses are identified, the big yellow bus,
all over the state, everybody recognizes rather you driving from out of
state from instate driving, and the only way you going guarantee that
these kids bus doesnt exceed  45 mile an hour,
is have that school bus govern that 45 mile an hour, thats the purpose
of the governorship to start with, if you change that then, how , who is
going to inforce , how is it going to be inforce, when you exceeding,
theres no way,
i mean these are human beings thats drivers , and i know about being a
human being, its hard to hold when a vehicle actually run faster, its
hard to sit there and hold it, and not to exceed 45 mile an hour, these
govenors will cut down, going down hill, and not let the bus exceed 45
mile an hour, but it wont do that if you move it up to 55,
so i just think we're, introducing something here and i know and
understand , i see them on the interstates, not many of them, no more
get on there, then have to, but we got to recognize that these are still
north carolina state's school buses,
we got to observe and we got to respect them so i slow down, every slows
down, when they see these school buses but, i just dont see the benefit
and the chances chances we're taking to exceed that speed.
because its not going to happen when you dont have buses traveling over
45 miles an hour with students on the buses, and we all know that, we
got to know it, so you just lose that</p>

control and has taken a big, big step.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You wanna respond to that, Representative Brody?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess just briefly. Fortunately the federal
government left us a few rights, and one of them is that we are a nation
of 50 laboratories of experimentation. And the reason I took the-- when
I did the chart I took their surrounding states so nobody could say that
I cherry picked any particular states to get my results. So I would say
that there are some issues with it, but I think a number of states have
increased it. In fact, I'm really surprised at the ones that don't even
have governors on that can go the speed limit, and they have said that
there's no safety issues that they've experienced with ?? at those
speeds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. 2 points if I may. First,
touching on what Representative Arp was talking about, I think part of
his point may have been - and correct me if I'm wrong - that the law
might allow for a bus that's only got a drive on it to go 65 on an
interstate, but if you have a governor at 55 it's not going to get to do
that anyway. Second thing that I would say is that I also spent some
time driving a truck professionally, and have seen some of these people
I say got their license at Sears and Roebuck take just stupid chances
trying to get around these slow buses on the interstate and that sort of
thing. And so I'm in favor of allowing them to go a little faster on
those highways, because of the safety hazard that is created by people
who don't have the patience in trying to get around them and that sort
of thing. Not just interstates, but even on the 4-lane highways I've
seen that. I just feel like it is a safety hazard when they have to go
so slow in some of those situations. Not so much because of the buses
themselves, but because of some of the people who I say take those
unnecessary chances trying to get around them. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you going to respond to that, Representative
Brody, or not? Okay. All right, Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I have a question for the
bill's sponsor. Representative Brody as I understand it the current law
is that a school bus has a maximum speed of 45 miles per hour. And the
original intent of the bill was to allow school buses to travel at 55
when they were not carrying students. But if I read the way the bill's
written now, it will allow school buses to travel at 55 mph both with
and without students. Is that correct, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley, not quite. The original bill
went a little bit farther. It said that you can go the speed limit,
which can be much higher than 55 mph. What we did was - because of
objection and people I've spoken too - we need to just stop that
confusion and just make it a straight 55 mph for everyone. And also this
chart is for buses that either carry or don't carry kids. It doesn't
matter. The chart represents both of those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask a follow-up, Mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Currently, under current laws, school buses with
students on board have a maximum speed of what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's 45 unless it's an activity bus, which is 55.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So what we're actually talking, with this bill we're
just raising the speed of buses carrying children to 55 maximum. And we
are not allowing buses with out children to go the speed limit, but just
to have that same speed of 55. Is that correct, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, that's correct. It's going to be the same for
everyone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Now, Mister Chairman my last question. Really the
different is if a school bus has children on board - is travelling 55
miles an hour on an interstate highway - it is required to use it's
hazard flashers. But a bus without children on board may, but is not
required, to use hazard flashers and that's primarily the different,
sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] When buses are carrying their children they don't have
to use hazard lights. It's just the hazard lights were for the
unoccupied buses that were going 45 miles an hour on high-speed
highways.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One last follow-up.</p>

<p id="30:00">
And if I could find a good reason, a safety reason which is the only
reason we should be concerned about with kids on a bus I might would
support the bill but currently the safety is saying 45 and I will remind
you that's a 70 mile an hour zone I travel in every morning. And as I
veer left to go around on the slow down so does everybody else it's just
a general rule after so many years but I thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do
you want to respond to that Representative Blust. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Stone. One of the things that I may have said
before but I wanted to emphasize again is that this is voluntary. Nobody
has to do it, I think even if it got passed and actually signed in by
the governor it's going to be a process. The local will find out about
it and they'll discuss it and then they'll make an evaluation of their
bus drivers and their system and the roads they go on and then they
decide from there which way to go. I know the road because that's how I
get here, highway one and run into the same situations but there are a
lot of counties here that don't have expressways or limited access and I
would like to have them make their own decisions on if they want to go
faster or not. It is a voluntary program. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Rodney Moore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair.
Representative Stone basically gave my schpeel. I understand both sides
of the argument. I understand of the hindrance that it can possibly be
to high ?? like trucks on the highway, I understand that it's a safety
issue and I understand that it's a time issue as well because I
understand the industry. But at the same time I think that we being
Representatives our primary concern should be the overall safety and
enhancement of our future which is our children. I have yet to see where
and you said it's voluntary and I understand that but I have yet to see
where the present system has become such a hindrance to motorists that
we need to make a change right now. So I understand that we have talked
extensively but just based upon my gut feeling and what I choose as a
priority but I'm going to have to vote against it. It has nothing to do
with the way you presented it but that's just how I'm going to vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Goodman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Chair and Representative Brody I appreciate all the work you've done
on this bill but I have a question relative to something that you said
earlier. You mentioned the safety on the interstate highways and how
dangerous school buses were going 45 miles an hour. Do you have any data
to support that or do you know of any incidence where a school bus going
45 on an interstate caused an accident? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We tried to
look for that and it's quite odd. It's the ....if someone is going
around a school bus and causes an accident with another car or
themselves the school bus just continues on the road. It's that argument
of the man who pulls out in the middle of the street and everybody stops
and hits everybody and then they just keep on going like it's never
happened so that's the problem with identifying that type of thing. We
had a hard time finding it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So there is no data to
support that idea that they do cause accidents on interstate highways.
There is no data to support that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ?? do
you want to respond to that question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We don't have
any actual data because the data just isn't available. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have one more follow up [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Finally a little different subject. Do you know how much school bus
drivers are paid per hour? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I don't. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] One last follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One last follow up. So, I
think it's fairly low ten dollars an hour or less and most school bus
drivers do a tremendous job and really take care of our children but
it's hard to be that selective and to expect school bus drivers to be
highly trained when the pay scale is so low. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The only thing I have to say to that is they are probably paid
more than we are. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Most people are. Representative
Boles. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you</p>

<p id="35:00">
This weekend I was watching . . .  Iâ€™d just to make a comment on the
Bill Mr. Chair. This weekend one of our local TV stations, channel 11,
they did a story on this particular school bus issue and they singled
out Cummberland County. What caught my attention was, that the schools
in Cumberland County, the administration, were going to kind of mandate
that the cafeteria workers train, get their CDLâ€™s to drive buses or they
would lose their jobs. Because, they had like 530 buses and they needed
1100 drivers certified, so if there was an absentee or rotation out, and
the lady they interviewed told them that she would be the worst driver
possible but she was going to have to do it in order to keep her job. I
donâ€™t think speed, this goes back to my commentary, speed is not the
problem here, I think itâ€™s a bigger issue of qualified school bus
drivers and the pay is one of them, but it concerns me that were going
to force someone to do a job that theyâ€™re not comfortable with, in order
to keep their job. So, I have a problem with it, there is no disrespect,
but I can not vote for the Bill. I think there is a much bigger issue
than the speed of the bus. When I have an employee telling theyâ€™re not
comfortable but yet the school system is forcing them to get their
CDLâ€™s. The commentary was that most of them couldnâ€™t pass the CDL, but
they had until August of this year of they would be hired back next
year. So, just as a commentary I have a problem with it that were going
to people in uncomfortable positions, if you take a governor off of it,
then thereâ€™s no control, and she may be late for work and in fear of
getting tardy or late again, that she . . . . were all humans. With
thatâ€™s just a comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hypotheticals are really hard to deal with. Number 1,
you mentioned governors are off, the governors arenâ€™t off, theyâ€™re just
going to be changed or they can voluntarily be changed. I really come
back with a reason of response other than if someone makes you do
something that you donâ€™t want to do and threatens you with youâ€™re job, I
think there some other agencies of this government that they need to
speak to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I just wanted to make a comment.
Thank you Mr. Brody for your work and your passion on this Bill. I just
need to speak from a rural countyâ€™s perspective, I live in rural county,
1700 mile of rural roads throughout Robertson County. Many of these
roads are narrow, even though theyâ€™re state maintained roads. We have a
lot of buses in our county with very well qualified drivers, they are
doing great job. My concern is the rush to do this, I know you have good
data supporting your intention here, but Iâ€™m really concerned from rural
countyâ€™s perspective putting buses on the road traveling 55 mph with
children. Our bus drivers do good job, theyâ€™re on a schedule, they run
that schedule, they arrive on time, they get their students on time
running at 45mph, they get to class on time. Iâ€™m just really concerned
from that perspective, of the safety and getting on a rural road in
Robertson County on a bus moving a 55mph. Iâ€™m really concerned about
that, I do respect the Bill, but I do have some reservations.</p>

Representative Arp. Let's move along quickly, we're going to have to
adjourn in just a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaking of the second time, I think what's missing
is, I just ran some quick numbers, we're actually making it safer by,
one of the things, by looking at how the buses move, the difference
between 70 miles an hour and 45 and 70 miles an hour vs 55, what we're
talking about is creating a hazard on the road from a rate of closure
and we make this by moving the minimum speed up to 55. We actually make
it safer by 40%. In terms of the rate of closure to avoid the accident
and so, I can appreciate the comments. I think what ccan happen is we
could set up the governors at 55. We actually make the rate of closure
better in terms of rear end accidents which is what we're trying to
avoid on the high speed, and we can reduce that by 40% just in terms of
moving this up. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman. I too want to commend the bill
sponsor. You've been very patience twice in ?? For me, I'm not going to
be able to support it. I have 11 grandchildren and of those 11, 6 are in
school and on school buses. I can tell you I've already heard from some
parents this bill is just getting out there. There's a commercial on TV,
I don't know if any of you've seen it, I myself have actually done this
with my children when they first went off on a school bus, where the
father puts his little girl on the school bus and he jumps in the car, I
won't advertise for a car but, and he follows it to make sure she's
okay. I've had several parents reference that commercial to me and said,
do not let these school buses go the speed limit. Now, they have not
heard your PCS, I can only imagine what they're gonna be saying. In the
past, Mr. Chairman and to the bill sponsors, when the bill has drawn a
lot of attention, and people have lots of input and there are different
ideas that have been brought up in here, we have appointed subcommittees
around that issue and it sounds like to me there's an opportunity here
for a subcommittee with the bill sponsor, I'm just suggesting that,
where these other issues of the drivers training all of those issues
where this does seem to be centering more the conversation both meetings
have been around the drivers themselves. What is the fine for a school
bus driver going over the speed limit when his governor will let him go
55 and yet it's supposed to be going 45 with kids. There's a seat belt
issue that over my 10 years here and many years before that it's always
been talked about. So I'm just suggesting there are other options here
today rather than voting and moving forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, all due respect to everyone who was asked to
speak, we are past time. By house rules we must adjourn a quarter til
before session so meeting is adjourned.</p>
