[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Members, this is a local bill that affects 1
community, deals with zoning in a single family neighborhood around
vacation rentals. Has a sunset provision, and passed without opposition
out of the finance commission yesterday. I'd ask for your support, thank
you.

House bill 1151, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 1151, ?? bill red light changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Meredith is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.
Members of the Senate, this is a bill that would allow Fayetteville to
erect red light cameras. They had this ability 5 years ago, this is a
local bill, Fayetteville currently has statutory authority to erect the
red light cameras, what this bill would do would allow Fayetteville to
enter into a inter-local agreement with the school board so that they
could follow the constitution out. The constitution, and allow the
proceeds to be transferred to the school board. In the past, I was on
the city council, we did not have the authority to enter into a
inter-local agreement with the school board so we had to end the red
light program. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there further discussion or  debate?
Sen. Clark, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to reiterate what Sen. Meredith has said, this is a local bill,
it has 100% support across our delegation, that's the Senate and House,
within our city and within the county commissioners. Now I also want to
emphasize that this particular bill is not breaking new ground, and that
it is opening up the door to use red light cameras. We already have
statutory authority to do that. And I do understand that there's some
concern among some individuals or some members maybe that we're trying
to-  we're going to put in place a system that will essentially game the
system against our constituents. In other words, now the duration of the
yellow lights. Well we cannot do that. There are already provisions and
statutes that dictate the duration of the yellow light. So again we
emphasize that this is a local bill, allowing Fayetteville to enter that
inter-local agreement mentioned by Sen. Meredith so that we can put this
system back into place in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate?
Sen. Jackson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr.President.
As I mentioned  ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, excuse me. I'm sorry.
As I mentioned yesterday in the rules committee, I feel like this is a
bad idea. I know our dear friend Don East fought these things for a long
time, and with good reason. I think it's a speed trap waiting to happen.
There is a study, as I mentioned yesterday in rules, out of Florida that
shows that the yellow lights have been decreased, and from what I
understand also they've been decreased in some areas here in the state
as well, and there's also been a concern raised as far as the fines
going to the city council from the school department that I'm not</p>

<p id="010:00">
...unconstitutional, so I just ask that you do not support this bill.
Thank you, and I think it’s bad policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? Senator Hise, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate, I understand that this
is a local bill. Ultimately, may support Senator Meredith in this local
bill, but I didn’t want to do so without a little bit of ??, without a
little bit of a warning. It has been clear that the Senate position as
we have voted before, the previous session is that we’re going to
eliminate red-light cameras in the state of North Carolina. We have not
yet been successful in convincing our House colleagues to go along, but
I don’t think that effort’s going to end. While I support this because
we’ve not yet been successful, any local governments or any local areas
looking to expend money on a red-light camera system at this point need
to be aware that I continue to fight and members of this body will
continue to fight to eliminate red light cameras in the state of North
Carolina because they do not increase safety and they’re quite a
constitutional privilege so thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there and further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for Senator Meredith.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith, like Senator Hise, I, too, hate red light cameras and
have...they don’t do anything, it seems, but place another tax on the
people and I wanted to make sure that I understood, for myself, because
I want to support your bill, I want to support you and your local bill.
This doesn’t expand red light cameras, it simply says that the money,
since they’re still legal and we hadn’t gotten rid of yet, which
hopefully you guys will do when I’m gone, that the money that comes in
will go to the schools instead of into the city budget and that’s all
you’re doing here. Is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct. We’re asking for the authority, the city of Fayetteville
to enter into an inter-local agreement with the school board so that
they will receive all the proceeds. In the past, the money went to the
city, so that’s what we’re asking for. Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. To speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby is recognized to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With that answer, Senator Meredith, I will support your bill, your local
bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a question for Senator Meredith if he’ll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith, since you have statutory authority, why don't’ you go
ahead and put these cameras in. I’m trying to support your bill, but I
feel like in this vote for you to be able to transfer money to the
schools, I’m endorsing red light cameras and Fayetteville. Help me
differentiate that, and why hadn’t you done it before now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would be against...we had...we did that as a city, prior, and it was
a constitutional issue, so that’s why we need the inter-local agreement.
We tried to do it without the inter-local agreement six years ago and it
was against the constitution that all the proceeds go directly to the
school board and they were coming to the city. That’s why we’re asking
for this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Meredith a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith, my understanding is that it allows for the fee to be
increased. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am and the...yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate on House Bill 1151?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, Senator Barringer, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like that think Senator Hise and Senator Goolsby for their
commentary and questions. I do not support red light cameras, but I
certainly support public education and for that reason I will be support
this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will Senator Rabin yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now that you have my attention.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Rabin is it state law dictating the time period of a
yellow light?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are those...yellow light times vary with the intersections, but
the Department of Transportation does have statutes that cover that. Yes
sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You say it does vary with intersections?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It can vary with the size of the intersection and the number...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. This is a bill to authorize Stanly Community
College to enter into agreements with Stanley County government to
construct buildings on their campus. This will actually save the
community college some money. They’re leasing some space off site. I’ve

your support.

Senator Hartsell moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, this is a technical
amendment. I submit it’s that because it conforms our existing law to
generally accepted accounting principles. That is to say, when a sale
occurs and when it is reported, I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Rucho, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President. To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Senate, we did discuss this issue in Finance the other
day. Our staff had some provision dealing with admissions in there that
we felt was not a technical amendment and that’s why we withdrew that
from the technical amendments bill because it wasn’t appropriately in
there and therefore a decision was made by the chair that there would be
no inclusion of another amendment, so there may be a disagreement as to
whether technical or not, but it was our decision that it wasn’t. More
importantly, this issue of admissions, which we’re working with
regarding sales tax collection, was discussed with Senator Hartsell and
others, then Senator Rabin and I. Representative Howard said that there
would be additional review of this issue in revenue laws during the
interim to come up with some suitable answer. Mr. Wayne in the
Department of Revenue was very clear in knowing that there is a
difference between gross receipts and when time to pay, and when
sales...</p>

Switch is a cost that is paid upon receipt of the circumstances of this
review, reviewed one.  And Irish members of the Senate not to move that
to vote against this amendment on this bill, thank you for further
discussion about this present their burger or procure raw.  I think they
can do either amendments are doubtful this minute is very important.  I
also concur with us and our parcel that this is technical in nature is
not this technicality is very important, not it affects not just the
largely needs the sale admissions.  They also affects our community
theaters on the Carolina ballet, symphony, for example I'm a season
subscriber to the Carolina ballet, which by the way, works on a
shoestring shoestring is very important for our economic development.
He has a season subscriber, I get tickets and I have some options with
those tickets I can go in and actually sit and watch the performance as
purchased before I can trade them in for a lesser tickler ticket or
greater ticket for that performance or yet another one will I can
actually get before the performance of cars I can turn the ticket agent
and converted into a charitable deduction for that charity without this
amendment that would be a tremendous bookkeeping and accounting burden
on all of those those organizations.  All the arts, greets all of the an
error of sports greats to keep up with the winners supposed to be making
visits efficient, not creating more bookkeeping hassles for the HMI sit
in that seat and enjoy the ballet or until I give up. ` and make a
charitable contribution.  I have that deal was not done until the deal
is done.  The I do not believe that the sales tax is added.  I
appreciate your support for this amendment further discussion or debate
the president me that run him question in America.  The deal I guess I
feel so we're not sent to you actually teach something over at the
University 's son at the back decision.  Thank you, sir, I'm a clinical
professor which means I am not saying I am a full-time clinical
professor at monastic accounting program at the University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill Kenan Flagler business school.  Thank you for your
expert advice on one another just like speak on the amendment certainly
is recognized to speak on the amount just likes and remembers talking
about… we have a family and how which provides performances.  We have a
lot of small theater venues, as I understand it, the way this would work
is that he would have to literally pay the tax programmer show that
might be canceled, they could have a fire, they could have water damage.
 The artist might not show up and everybody had to pay the tax before
the services even been delivered in support of the same Consumer
Reports.  It was great if I'm wrong, but if that is the case, I'm in
support of this amendment.  Think the early yesterday and right was
never brought up to debate the amendment was helpful magic numbers that
we were supposed pretty hard in an committee and out of committee and we
don't need to put up wet that I will tell you that the event this
amendment have placed in the technical corrections bill.  I think they
could do and what effect the revenues of the state and we haven't done
that we have arrived and what that epoch that amount might be, but
having having said that you know Rob Souza group, muscles often him at
the time, but I don't I don't read them until the next General assembly
convened.  So maybe I should not have to pay that the facts on massive
drugs that I was not a lot of difference if and when you have done best
in Texas( the land where it will try to simplify things and we've tried
to make everything the same for every body know that the high thing to
do what you know, this is the beginning of Caldwell and if we if we go
along with this sort of thing.  In particular, in this venue, rather
than letting it in committee, which is the way our process works in
growing back down the same road that we work so hard to stop.  As of
June, when not to vote for this letter will pass about it</p>

Speaker: And will ride that who us little further and we have to put it
up again but i would urge you not to support this amendment thank you,

Speaker Changes: Mr president,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? for what purpose do you ask,
Speaker Changes: To speak to the amendment the second time,
Speaker Changes: you have the floor to speak to the amendment,
Speaker Changes: this is actually the first time you stood to explain
the amendment,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.President,
Speaker Changes: There is no way to carve out this is consistency with
existing law that we have with regard to trust access if you look at the
statute 154.7 it task about taxes due and payable then the sale occurs
when the sale occurs when the sale occurs n this contacts and committee
the other day at least we have the opportunity to ask i think Erick
Wayne ?? director of sales tax what happens if you buy a pay  if cordon
he pays sales tax in no he pays sales tax for his team what happens when
you for instance lay away something do you pay a tax when you make a
first parcel on it when you pay the tax when you pick it up i would
content from the economic perspective the attendance of a venue for
whatever purpose isn't exactly the same thing ?? clarifies that and says
in the contacts and that type of sale in that type of situation it's the
same thing now with regard to the funds of the state there is no way to
supply the funds of the state the reason it does is the states still
took it's taxes it gets the taxes when the sale occurs
Speaker Changes:??
Speaker Changes: senator ?? for what purpose do you sk
Speaker Changes: to speak the second time
Speaker Changes: our rules do not allow you to speak the second time on
the amendment the sponsor of the amendment can speak to explain the
amendment and can speak one time to debate the amendment so all the
members an speak onetime on the Speaker Changes:amendment
Speaker Changes: Mr.President,
Speaker Changes: senator ?? for what purpose do you ask,
Speaker Changes: senator ?? to yell for a question,
Speaker Changes: senator ?? do you yell,
Speaker Changes: i yell,
Speaker Changes: certainly
Speaker Changes: senator ?? I'm trying to figure this out that affects
the university of North Carolina of the 17 institutions i thin 16 of
them would sell tickets in advance of their athletic tickets tens and
million of dollars is well as performance by the schools of the arts if
this amendment doesn't passe will it change the way that they have to do
a counting for their sales and stuff as well
Speaker Changes: if the amendment does not pass it will change the way
yes,
Speaker Changes: senator ?? for what purpose do you ask,
Speaker Changes: to accent and reach up a question,
Speaker Changes: senator Richard do he yell,
Speaker Changes: he yell,
Speaker Changes: Senator Richard if i buy that ticket i purchase the
ticket as a consumer I'm i expecting that sales tax revenue will be send
to the government at the time that,
Speaker Changes: i pay it,
Speaker Changes: thank you senator ??,
Speaker Changes: as a consumer you buy something id you go to ?? or
someplace to but a new shirt at the ?? senator ?? i go elsewhere in
doing on the sales tax is a trust tax and it is required to me remitted
at appropriate time on the existing law that trust tax is not the same
as what was before a tax on gross to seat so it's totally different on
there is a requirement that need to be paid in a response to send that
to ?? if he pays a sales tax for something he purchases and he returns
it he repay it and the ?? repay here go back to the ?? person that
collected it or the person that paid it so that happens day and day out
what does the debate here talk about more than anything how complicated
this is and why a revenue law is taken in and study and to see a
question completely is really needs further study and you writing your
assessment,
Speaker Changes: follow up ??
Speaker Changes: yes,
Speaker Changes: i do,

If the money is not turned in as in say my business either monthly or
quarterly. Then if I am not turning it in the business is using it for
their cashflow
Yes Mama there is a huge float on that especially in these large
corporation that senator ??? is alluding too they sit on millions of
dollars they sit on this money for operating costs instead of fufilling
their obligation under the trust tax when its received
I paid for my panthers tickets 4000 dollars I wont use them until but I
paid 278 dollar sin sales tax. I submitted it I expect that money to go
back as the law is clearly stated on receipt.
MR president one more follow up
He will continue to yield.
Senator ??? is in essence as a taxpayer I am furnishing cash flow for
some businesses is that correct?
I say yes mama everyoen is using the term GAAP. Its different GAAP and
tax tax is due upon receipt a GAAP is when youre doing accrual and all
that stuff its two different worlds. Mr ?? from the dept of revenue was
very clear about this. My staff is very clear on this and we urge you to
vote down the amendment.
Mr President
Speak on the amendment. You know the govt cant wait to get your tax
money, they like it quick and up front. And this issue has been debated
ad infinitum during the committee meetings and I dont think it needs
debating further and I think we should vote on it. But the issue is
clear I understand it. IF you want the govt to get your money asap thats
fine with me.
Further discussion and debate on amendment 1
Senator why do you rise
TO ask senator ?? a question
Senator rucho how is it being done now? The collection of taxes on event
tickets.
Well, prior to our transfer over from gross receipts where it was kept
and differnt businesses can use that money as a float.We the effective
date on that..cindy...is it..effective date was on Jan 1st thats when we
went from gross receipts to sales tax and the sales tax is the trust tax
and thats why we are treating all retail sales the same way and that
means upon receipt of the person receiving that money. Follow up mr
president?
2014 or 2015 mr rucho?
further discussion or debate?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. McKissick moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. McKissick is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a pretty straightforward amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. McKissick, hold on just a sec. Okay. Now go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright.
This is a pretty straightforward amendment, you heard a lot of debate
and discussion yesterday when it came to this provision of the bill
dealing with the limitation of counties, cities, to impose more than
2.5% sales tax. And of course, what it meant to the counties. Now what
this amendment would do and it's very very straightforward and it's very
very simple. And it tries to address the issues that are out there right
now when it comes to Wake county, and when it comes to Mecklinburg
county. What would allow them to do, is to hold a referendum no later
than November of basically 2015, I think the actual date in the bill is
December 31st of '15, but the election cycle would be in November. That
if they have something out there pending now, if they have something out
there that's on the drawing boards, since they did not have great notice
as it relates to a change in policy of the state of North Carolina,
dealing with their ability to hold referendums. Particularly one related
to say, a quarter sales tax for education, or half cent for transit,
whatever it may be, it would allow them a date certain, that date being
in 2015, to hold a referendum. So it gives them an option: That means
that if they are planning it, if they're considering it, if they didn't
have notice of this new policy being adopted by the state, or otherwise
they might have acted earlier, it gives them a chance to go ahead as a
community to develop the consensus, and to put that matter on the ballot
so the people in those local communities can go ahead and approve those
specific referendums. It's very narrow, and it's narrowly crafted for a
reason. It addresses fairness, it addresses the ability of these
particular counties in particular, to move forward if a referendum is
being discussed, but not ye t on the table and not yet on the ballot. So
I think it's a matter of fairness, it would cut it off after 2015, and
after then, the provisions as provided for in this bill as relates to
counties or cities seeking additional taxes would prevail. So I would
ask for your support.

You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGE] I did have a chance to speak with
Senator McKissick earlier. I explained to him that this is all part of a
master plan to try to have certainty and consistency within the policy.
There has been seven years that Wake or any of the other counties have
had an opportunity to choose to  use this. If everyone remembers if
there was a problem in their budget dealing with medicaid issues, this
is what was going to fill that gap. Apparently it wasn't necessary and
so I urge that you vote this down and allow us to move this job package
forward and start creating the jobs that we know it will create.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion or debate? Senator Blue for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGE] To ask Senator McKissick a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGE]Senator McKissick do you yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGE] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGE]Yield. [SPEAKER CHANGE]Senator McKissick I
don't know how Guilford and Forsyth county feel on this proposition but
from a Wake county perspective I want to say thanks but no thanks.
Because I don't think that our commissioners wanting to be put under the
gun with a specific timetable as they have determined what is best for
Wake county. They can't join or cannot fulfill their obligation under
the regional compact with Durham and Orange counties unless we impose a
half cent sales tax, but it has to go through a process to get there.
And I don't think at this point that I want our commissioners to be put
under the gun to do it so my question is whether you would consider
withdrawing this amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Well I guess my thoughts
about this Senator Blue is that I think it offers a reasonable
alternative. A valid window in time. A valid opportunity for those
communities that might be impacted. I know in Wake county the
commissioners have discussed a transit tax for a number of years. I know
most recently they've just began discussions of a quarter cent perhaps
sales tax for education. If they have contemplated it, if they have
considered it, if they are thinking it's something they might want to
do, if they're feeling as if it's not something they're ready to do this
election cycle in November of 14. It would give them to May of 15 to do
it. It would give them to November of 15 to do it. But it allows them an
opportunity that they do not have today. And in my mind it's a
reasonable window of time. It's better than having no opportunity.
That's what it provides. A reasonable opportunity as opposed to no
opportunity and with the bill as it is presently there would be no
opportunity. So it offers  at least that window. [SPEAKER CHANGE] To
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Blue is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. President and ladies and
gentlemen of the senate I know that many of you saw the article in the
News and Observer this morning but for the fifth time since 2007 Raleigh
appears on the Forbes list as the number one city for business and
careers in the United States. It's the only city on the east coast this
year that made that list. I figure out pretty good how to position
ourselves to do what is necessary to develop business, to attract
families, to make people know that they can pursue whatever career they
want to pursue in Raleigh or in Wake county without having to leave this
area. Quite unlike it was when I was growing up in North Carolina. The
potential is unlimited, and it's because the leadership of this area
decides the kinds of things that keep us attractive. Yesterday we spent
a lot of time debating the opportunity for the other ninety four
counties that don't have this extra authority to levy a sales tax to
build the transit systems. And comments were made about how you got to
level the playing field, how you have to look out for the other
counties. And just to set the record straight as I said in the past,
many of us here voted to take a quarter of percent, a half of percent, a
half</p>

amendment four passes house bill 1224 has amended its back before the
body further discussion or debate senator Hartsell.
Mr president.
why do you rise.
to send forward an amendment.
send forth your amendment.
it should be on the dashboard.
senator Hartsell moves to amend the bill, senator Hartsell you got the
floor.
thank you Mr president members of the senate quite honestly it's a very
simple amendment it moves the cap from point five or 2.5 to 2.75 no more
no less simplify the whole thing yesterday I was hoping to have the
opportunity to ask senator Gunn if he had applied [??] razor to the
context of this amendment because of its complexity because I don't
think I would've said anything much I mean the simplicity of this is
simply not apparent to avoid the conflict between the [??] whatever I
suggest that we simply raise the cap to 2.75 that's what it does.
further discussion senator Rucho.
Mr president.
you have the floor.
I stand to speak on the amendment I appreciate senator Hartsell's
efforts we've been talking about ways of trying to help work this
unfortunately apparently we've not agreed how to get this best done
there is consistency in the plan of setting it 2.5 what and it was
carefully crafted so there would be no image or hint of any nature of a
tax increase and this does give that image and I would urge that members
of the senate vote down what is a tax increase in the sales tax.
further discussion or debate.
Mr president.
senator Stein for what purpose do you rise.
to debate the amendment.
you have the floor.
a couple of points one is senator Rucho just said consistency in the tax
pays two and a half well right now we got a handful of two a handful
more actually they're mostly two about seventy something about twenty
something at two and a quarter one at 2.5 and two at 2.75 we've got two
counties at 2.75  folks we're [??] we're already I looked at the ten
commandments and nowhere does it say 2.5 percent this did not come from
[??] it's a number and not only that it's a number that has no
consistency in state law in fact the bill before us has 2.35 written in
for two counties for [??] memorial unless they change it so we're never
gonna be a 2.5 folks it is a number senator Hartsell is trying to
address the point that senator Brown raised with passion yesterday that
he thinks that there're two North Carolina's [??] that I absolutely
share we do have a divide economic development divide between the urban
and [??] areas this is a way so that [??] counties have the same
capacity that what current law today the six biggest counties have
second thing is that senator Rucho just called this a tax increase well
it's a tax increase only if the people choose to raise their own taxes
well guess what your bill does [??] is it gives people in the counties
an opportunity to go to two and a half when they're two now I guess he
has agreed with my point yesterday that your bill has a tax increase.
further discussion or debate on amendment five senator Hartsell what
purpose do you rise.
speak I guess that's my first time on the amendment.
you were explaining it that's correct you have the floor.
thank you I'm struck by how this conflict which I perceive as being
unnecessary it is a number but you know they say that consistency is the
[??] of little minds problem is it is consistent it simply says we got a
consistent [??] for everybody everything has to be in.

I'm not sure that when they talk about a tax increase or not a tax
increase. If there's a tax increase in the base bill, there's a tax
increase in this. I'm just trying to simplify the whole process because
quite honestly, everything is voted. And I submit to you that this is a

A motion to divide question on House bill 1224 in accordance with the
Senate rule 28, I move that the question of passage on third reading of
the House bill 1224 be divided into separate parts that state separate
and distinct propositions capable of standing alone as follows:
Proposition 1: Part 1 of the bill, local option sales tax options.
Proposition 2:  The remainder of the bill, parts 2-6.
Fletcher Hartsell Jr.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hartsell, would you like to explain your motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I certainly would Mr. President.
It's really very simple. Under rule 28, it separates the tax provisions
from the other economic development provisions and calls for a separate
vote on those 2 provisions, under the rules.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
Speak on the motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.
Members of the Senate, this bill has been worked on, addressed, trying
to work very diligently in creating economic growth, job creation, a lot
of parts to it are there. If Sen. Gunn was here he would be saying the
same thing, we're putting together a comprehensive effort to make North
Carolina, and give our secretary and the state the tools to create jobs.
This has been crafted together so that all the parts of it are part of
the solution for us to achieve that goal, and so under the circumstances
I would ask that you vote against this, because of the fact that it will
interfere with the ability of this bill to get through on the House
side.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate on the motion?
Sen. Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, just to explain: It doesn't do anything with regard to
the bill. It stays together, it just allows us, some of us who feel that
it's appropriate, to look at 2 sections because they are 2 distinct
propositions: One having to do with taxation, the other having to do
with forms of economic development. I'm just simply saying, if both
passes, the bill stays together. If it doesn't pass, or one doesn't
pass, it goes back to the committee and you can deal with it. But I just
think that people ought to have the opportunity to look at different
sections of a bill that can easily be divided. And that's what it does,
just gives us an opportunity to vote on the 2 sections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

If one part of this bill is good, and one part of it is less good but
still good. And if we like one part, we outta vote for it. And members
have some mis givens about part two. Personally I think we outta have a
show of hands on which part we like the best. So I think you got a good
motion. I frankly think both parts will pass. And to me, you can say
that its a package. Other people will say we got tax increases. If you
wanna take the democrats view on this. We got tax increases in one part.
I do not see the need for these to be wedded at the hip. I personally
feel free. And I think everybody could have their say if we vote on

do you rise.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the motion.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You know I've been here for 12
years. I've been here for about 12 years. And I wish we could divide
every bill that we've come up with. Because when you look at everything
that comes before us there is some good parts in it, some great parts,
and some that you may not like. Theres some votes that would benefit my
district, I voted for, but the entire state there weren't that good. I
think about that bill everyday. Senate bill 3. Where it would help some
areas of my district but the renewable energy portfolio is bad for all
of North Carolina. I wish we could divide the question on that one years
ago. Wish we could divide the question on the budget. I mean there's a
lot of things you could look and start dividing and start pulling up
some, tearing bills apart what you do like what you don't like. How
it''ll affect the coast, how it'll effect the mountains. You know this
is all of north carolina, we've been working on this thing together. I
urge you to vote against the motion.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok any further
discussion or debate on the motion? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr president
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin what purpose do you rise [SPEAKER
CHANGES] speak on the motion [SPEAKER CHANGES] you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell, I believe I see very clearly what
you're doing here and I understand it. And there's some merit to what
you say. And there's some dismerit to what you say, if that's such a
word. And I'll tell you why. Because if every section of every bill were
stand alone. We'd probably end up accomplishing little. Because not
everybody gets the whole cone of ice cream in this place and that's the
way we work. And if there's a better way, we haven't come up with it
yet. But we can't take our ice cream and split it on a hot day. That
doesn't work either. Now this is what's gonna happen, if the sales tax
portion of this is voted down, and it may be it may not be. Some of
those counties that like to have it, and they could use that for general
purpose. Would not have the necessary funds because they couldn't raise
them. For economic development to match the other parts of this bill.
And so for that reason, your motion isn't worth a hoot.  Number two,
some of the 96 counties that would benefit from this, might not be able
to build those schools that they need to build. Or to pay for those
teachers assistance that they so badly want to keep. And for that reason
your motion is not worth a hoot. And so my take on it is your motion is
not worth a hoot. And I don't think anyone should support it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown what purpose to you rise [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak to the motion [SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator has the
floor.[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think senator Brock got on the right message I
think when he was talking about how we vote on bills. There's not many
bills, I would guess, half the bills we vote on, there's sections in
them some of just don't agree with but the bill as a whole is something
we could live with. We make tough decisions up here a lot of times on
bills, state wide bills are always difficult because it seems like in
most cases you have some winners some losers.</p>

that it balances out I think it has overtime has balanced out. This is
an issue here I think you got 96 counties in reality that are happy with
the provision. You got may be 4 counties that you could argue on. And I
am not sure all 4 of those are in disagreement of what the bill does. So
you have got a bill here where most of the states is in agreement. So
why would separate something now for a few counties in this particular
situation. Again most bills will pass. It leans one way or the other in
most cases. I think it will set a terrible terrible precedent. Moving
forward. What will hand up happening is we will start dividing every
single bill on the floor and start voting it piece by piece. And this
process might just become a full time legislator because it won’t take
that long to go through the process. I think it’s a bad precedent and I
would say let’s vote this motion down

[Speaker changes] Senator Brown, we are not setting a precedent. Whether
you like this motion or don’t vote know or yes, we are not setting a

bill. Absolutely not. We have been able to do that. We have done that.
And we will continue to have that option and don’t think we will
separate every bill we don’t like. But it’s our choice on that. But we
have not set a

[Speaker changes] To speak on the motion
[Speaker changes] Senator you have the floor
[Speaker changes] Thank you Mr. President, It is a precedent for most of
us in the chamber. I haven’t ever seen this before and as I read through
this rule I find it quite ridiculous to divide on this rule. I could
understand if someone had a conflict want to be out of a vote on a
particular part but if we divide this question, if we vote no on any
part, you are killing the entire bill still and send it back to the
committee in the last days as we are going to recess. It does nothing to
move forward. To vote on any part of this down takes the risk of the
entire bill as to whether any other jaded improvement or where for the
companies that we trying to work for put those all at risk. By doing
this it is a ridiculous move and we had multiple options on   committee
and discussions any one can run an amendment to remove any part of the
bill that we wish rather than do so we are going through this procedure
and I ask you vote against it.
[Speaker changes] Ok Senator Clerk is back in the chamber Senator
Hartsell, what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes]To respond
[Speaker changes] Well I think you have already spoken twice. But this
is new territory I was hoping that you withdraw the motion. You have the
floor
[Speaker changes] Mr. President Members of the senate. There is a reason
for the rule in the rules. It’s an unusual circumstance and I rather
acknowledge. But they are two very very distinct propositions in this
particular case legislation. It appears to me that its appropriate for
us to look at that from that perspective. on those two. [??] if it’s
ridiculous you know that’s what we are here for and that’ what these
rules are for to address these things in a particular way. Simply
saying, it doesn’t affect any body in any way other than it tells let’s
ask about how we want to do what we want to do in this particular
circumstances on segments of the bill, which probably should have been
two bills anyway.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.
This bill has been vetted in 3 different committee meetings. We made a
few changes to it in the last rules committee, one dealing with the
technical correction on expunctions, another dealing with conditional
discharges, clarifying that they must be a joint motion of the defendant
and the prosecutor, not a substantive change, and the other that adds
possession of marijuana paraphernalia as a lesser included offense of
drug paraphernalia, making it a class 3 misdemeanor just like the drug
itself, which will save the state a great deal of money because people
charged will not rate a lawyer at the state's expense. Most of the time
when you get caught with marijuana, you get caught with something to
smoke it in or carry it in. That hints is paraphenelia. I would
appreciate your support, be happy to answer any questions you might
have.

Medic Aid Modernization
[Speaker changes] Senator Page is recognized to explain the bill
[Speaker changes] Thank you Mr. President
[Speaker changes] I am going to make some opening remarks and after my
remarks are over, if you would recognize Senator Hise for conclusion of
remarks, I would appreciate it.
[Speaker changes] Yes sir
[Speaker changes] Thank you Mr. President. Medic Aid is a system that in
need of reform. That if you quit laughing about that. In just the past 4
years, this general assembly had had to fill shortfalls totaling nearly
$2 billion. That’s money that could have been invested in other
priorities such as Education, Infrastructure and public safety. Every
year we have come in here and done our best to contain cost and reduce
growth and every year the choices get harder and the debates more
heated. And if we ever going to get away from looking for cuts, we have
to begin working towards reforms. Because without reform Medic aid
budget would continue to soar. In fact the physical research division
predicts that over the next 5 years the state’s Medicaid appropriation
would grow more than a million dollar. That of course is an
unsustainable Path. But this bill charts a new course. The senate plan
builds on the foundation laid by the House’s reform plan by harnessing
the power of competition between the provider led health plans. And
managed care plans. Competition apparently scares a lot of people. But
it’s the best way to ensure that the medic aid recipients get the best
care possible at the lowest cost to the tax payer. We recognize that the
provider led group would need time to get their feet underneath them
however. After all they are used to treating patients in a fee for
service system. Not managing population in a capitated system. So this
bill provides them with a 36 month glad path to bearing full risk. Only
by shifting the risk of budget overrun away from the state, will we be
able to ensure budget predictability. It’s the only way this general
assembly will ever be able to focus its energy and investment towards
issues like continuing to improve education system. And Mr. President,
if you would recognize Senator Hise for additional remarks
[Speaker changes] Senator Hise you have the floor
[Speaker changes] Thank you Mr. President and members of the senate.
First just o\to go over some details what we have in the plan. I think
not only is reform necessary in the plan but we begin by reform in our
own house. We being with reform in the department. I don’t have to
remind people about the problems we had in the department of Health and
human services. Not only over the last year or the 16 months, but over
the last decade. Software system glitches, other problems that have gone
through, mismanagement, misoperations, costlier suit by the federal
government. We got to pull it out and we are going to give a fresh
start. That’s why we have proposed the creation of medical benefits
section which will oversee Medicaid in the system. We go through this
budget over and over again. Looks like a spaghetti play. The budget is
so intertwined with everything else in health care in public health. And
it’s very difficult to get a hand off on what it costs to run a medic
aid department. And that’s we think this clean separation is necessary.
Secondly we know that this bill by 2016 will have a vastly different
Medic aid system that we currently have. That requires individuals with
different skill sets and expertise than we currently have. We need
individuals that can manage population and manage care and much fewer
individuals who process for the appropriate</p>

Speaker1: We have a code for this billing system and we are for service.
That’s the nature of the system we are moving to. And we begin that
process with the Board. A Board that you find in any major corporation
notxxxxxxxxxxxx.
We create a Board in place that outs a clear wall of separation between
those who are receiving payments from the system and those who are
making those decisions as to what it should be. So that individuals do
not continue to stack xx board to better their industry or better their
particular practice.  We take what is currently a legislative process ;
every year we come back in here we talk about the money we had put into
Medicaid, but how many decisions do we have to make about what the rate
should be for in-home care or what the hours of personal care service
should be. We as a legislature now hand back to the Board of experts be
able to make plan amendments and make the changes to the plan to be
consistent with the budget we pass moving forward. The budget that we
pass will create regions in the state of North Carolina xx. I suspect
you will see somewhere between two and three and xx regions, but that
they have that authority, the authority to set population thresholds for
how large the region should be or designate them rural or urban. And in
each one of those regions we first guarantee that a provider xx will
exist in that region if it forms, then we allow others to be it, to be
part of that region. By 2018 we expect all plans to be fully capitated
in North Carolina which means the legislative and budget risk will be
changes in population. We have budget risk if we have more participants
in Medicaid or if more age-barred or disabled or others come on we have
those budgets at risk, or if it’s more children reduce we will find
savings. That would be our responsibility in the budget. Board will take
up the responsibility of managing, the ACOs and MCOs will take over the
responsibility of managing the cost of those individuals subsequent to
the risk. Things we can’t do right now as a state.
X both the House and the Senate. People came down here to do a lot of
things in education, in economic development. And every time they plan
to do them they run into the next Medicaid hole that are having to fill
up.   X Barring major changes from the Federal Government coming I
believe strongly that this is the best system for budget predictability
and for whole person care. Two things that the legislature has said is
these priorities since we began this project xx and they have been
ignored in every other plan. So I ask for your support and will be more
than happy to answer any of your questions. Thank you.
Speaker changes: Let the records show that the good looking Jackson with
hair is back in the chamber, xx Jackson.
Speaker changes: Further discussion and debate. Representative Stam for
what purpose you arise?
Speaker changes: To speak about an amendment.

the amendment?
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. President. The issue of having an
independent department I actually, I think Senator Hise said there were
xx in the DHHS, in the minutes of DHHS. I don’t know the solution for
Medicaid xx in your department there may be other ways to get greater
oversight every divisional Medicaid assistants rather than upsetting the
whole applecart of House care services to our xx in North Carolina. That
said I do respect the value    on this system.

Sure, the independence of the board and there is that I think an
oversight that will reside in the drafting of the exclusions to who
consult on the board to talk to him about it has to do with the
managed-care companies right now.  If you are a provider who get payment
from division Medicaid assistance you were precluded from being on the
board.  This is a delusion has a contract can't be on the board, either.
Well, there are no managed-care companies that have contracts with
gauges, just because those don't exist.  That the whole purpose.  You're
creating this thread says is this if you are managed care employee who
gets appointed to the board, you can't come up with a way to write the
rules and then let the contract have to go to your employer, then quit
and have given a sweetheart deal for your company to says that if your
managed-care employee who's on the board, your company is precluded from
getting a contract for your time and it also has a revolving door of
provision as you all recall the prior supervisor.  Management EMA EMA
and when you work for managed-care company and I think that we need to
ensure that the public severance is so wrong.  These boards make the
decisions with absolute integrity and with the public 's mind at the

amendment would be troubling to the operations. I think first and
foremost it is looking at what we want the board to be. We have created
a clear, separation in the board from those who receive from the board.
Whether it be providers, doctors, benefits, and even recipients from
those who make the decisions about what benefits are available in that.
This clearly moves that wall much weaker. To take individuals who are
recipients of the program, although I would note for most individuals,
once qualifying on the board would no longer qualify for Medicaid, as
they would no longer be in the income requirements to meet that. I think
it's also important to look at what our Medicaid population is and look
at who you're drawing from. Our Medicaid population, first of all is
predominantly children number one. Secondly, pregnant women, so you have
a short time period of a pregnancy, it's usually three months before and
two months after that they would be a recipient. That they would have to
qualify in the nomination process to remain on the board. The remainder
would be the blind, disabled, who have medical conditions sufficient to
the point that they are to spend as it is on their monthly maintenance
that they cannot function, cannot work, cannot do these types of things.
How you pick from a [??] that is greatly limiting that population by
those perimeters finding two individuals to serve in a four year term
would be a very difficult process from that. One those considerations
and most importantly, for keeping that wall of separation from
beneficiaries, from the ones making that decision I would ask that you
defeat this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Further discussion or debate on amendment 2? Senator Robinson, what
purpose--
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I've heard Senator Hise's objections and I expected those. But, I also
know that there are disabled, elderly, and blind people who are not
necessarily limited in their educational assets or in their ability to
think process and how systems are to work. They just happen to have a
physical disability that limits their ability to get the kind of income
they ought to have to life. What this legislature does, yes I said at
the time they are put on the board. Certainly, we know when you make
$96,000, you're coming off this, which is a good thing. But, at the time
they go on. But, it also gives some additional information to a board.
If we want to do things different and better, we need some real
information from people it affects.  There are elderly people, we can
find them, it's not a matter of having them. I'm talking about children,
etc. We know that, but blind, elderly, disabled people. Elderly people
have contributed a lot to our state and to our country, and ought to be
included in these things. Blind people, disabled people, some are
veteran's, etc. I don't accept that as a reason not to have these folks
involved in it, in this board. I think its important that we include
them. You may say, we'll include them. We'll include them at the local
level, at the provider, at the regional level, they need to be included
in the process.

[Speaker Changes] Senator Bryant is recognized to explain the amendment
[Speaker Changes]  Thank you Mr. President and members of the senate.
Our health care sector by way, particularly of the provider led ACOs who
are considering stand really ready and willing and able to save money
variable program cost could be solved in a more robust manner as we also
eliminate as much uncompensated care as possible. That uncompensated
care would also continue to increase cost for the state and local
government and privately insured. If we have faith in this medic aid
reform to control the variability of the program cost then it makes
sense that would be the time to expand eligibility to eliminate as much
uncompensated care as possible so that our provider organization has as
much revenue as possible as they absorb the variable program cost that
we are wanting them to take on. In addition we have trouble attracting
qualified personal. No really good or top health care professionals that
can do what we need are going to be interested in providing over a
system where the most exciting thing they will get to do every day is
the fact what cost or service or sick person they can cut off and our
health care academic and community based and local governments will
leave no stones unturned including our non-profits in controlling costs
and providing the best medical outcome for our medic aid population and
our health care system in general. For that reason I send forth an
amendment that is in front of you. It recognizes the fact that we have
just until 2017 to get 100% medic aid match for the services or for
expanding medic aid services. After that as we all know it will step
down I think 95 or 93 90 to 90% by 2020. We need to capture as much of
that step down reimbursement as we could. Failure to expand medic aid
are not only harms our citizens who don’t qualify for subsidies , but it
also sends our federal tax dollars billions of federal tax dollars to
the other states who are expanding Medicaid. We Predicated thought about
opposition to this on the fact that our medic aid program is broken.</p>

Cost and our program services. The medicaid and the ability to control
our program services. So the medicaid reformed that your enacting today
will provide better certainty, you'll have full capitation, you'll have
better forecasting of enrollments numbers and you'll provide overall
service savings to the programs, you'll be decreasing growth generating
additional funding that can be used with along cause assets to serve the
expanded medicaid groups. So based on those reasons, this amendment
recommends that we would expand medicaid affective July 1st 2016 at the
time when your medicaid reform would fully kick in. In addition to the
cause savings from the medicaid reform itself, you get ?? assets from
the additional drug rebates from coverages for patients who we now pay
for under the general fund like in mental health or department of
corrections and for uncompensated care and we'll also get additional tax
collection from the economic activity. It's also important to know that
when we expand eligibility under the affordable care act we are only
required to provide the minimal level of care under that act which is
less than the current medicaid package so it'd be less of a cost per
person. I also wanna emphasize that medicaid is not welfare and since
thousands of these eligible persons are not sitting on port somewhere
but they are working families and working individuals at minimum wage.
medicaid expansion is economic development of billions of dollars an
year circulating in our economy in taxable purchases and activities at
the estimation of 25 thousand jobs in the first year that we would
expand. In fact this is the only way to produce immediate jobs in all of
the rural counties that we were discussing yesterday in our today as
well as today. In fact we had a report to our joint committee on
economic development that indicated in all the rural counties where we
have unemployment in double digits, health care is the major industry
sector. That existing industry sector would be positively impacted
immediately. We can also make revisions in our legislation to expand
that if the federal government who we often say mistrusts to keep it's
word if they would change their reimbursement rates and formulas or
other parameters that would increase our call so we could withdraw from
the expansion decision. In 2022, When the state share would reach 10
percent, we would be for going almost 6 billion dollar in federal money
for health care. That is more than we receive from federal Highway fund
or defense contracts. We can trust the federal government with our roads
and our highway industry but not with our healthcare for human beings or
our health care industry. By that time we  would have contributed
billions of dollars some estimate up to 2 billion dollars in our tax
money to other states. Business analysts have noted that expanding care
would provide relief to help our small businesses, minimum wage
employees, will lower personal bankruptcies and increase credit score
and business activity. For these reasons, I ask that you to vote for
this amendment to both reform and expand in North Carolina and at the
same time control our program calls and budget predictability.

Thank you Mr. President. Members of the senate, there are a lot of

this attempt to expand medicaid in the state of North Carolina. Since I
have been here, I'd ask you to continue that policy and would also know
that one of the major things that is still held in decision making by
the general assembly even with this board would be the population
covered under medicaid so there is always the general assembly that
would make decisions about expansion.

eighty one.  The first one is to create an expansion of state government
by supporting this bill you to support the largest expansion of state
government in recent history.  Secondly, it creates a new state agency
without clear directions and phone.  It creates uncertainty in the
delivery of health services for the most battle in the state and
undesirable on elderly and disabled, and for those reasons I like to
check that the president advocate a part hereof.  Statement of the
letter has for you would like to thanks in her highest to survey the
work in this area.  A notable group committed to coming up with the best
solutions to resolve Medicaid problems here.  North Carolina was sent
with him through many meetings with Angels of HHS oversight as well as
the appropriations subcommittees.  I know that there deeply committed to
resolving problems and we've experienced the past which we continue to
experience today at the same time, the solutions that are provided by
this bill.  I cannot agree with an see, I will completely edit HHS.
This totality.  I look at their responsibility.  I look at the
inextricable linkages between the Medicaid does not appear charge
responsibilities are and what HHS is otherwise responsible for when it
comes to approach them as a separate, independent agency.  I think it's
an issue that deserves far greater study in deliberations.  That's a
piece that needs to be put into a study bill.  We need to put together
those that are deeply rooted in the delivery Medicaid services.  Those
are providers.  We need to involve those who perhaps are legislators as
well, and individuals might be recipients to think about holistic lady
what Medicaid deliveries should look like in North Carolina.  We look at

it extraordinarily quickly without appropriates deliberation thought and

out with a system of countable care organizations as a proposed model

preferred route for us to take countable care organizations we spent a
lot of time trying to see what might be best trying to contain cost with
a deadline that would be established for everything to be put in place
that's a reasonable time frame for perhaps doing so i know that we look
to what that would mean we would end up with the system that would
indeed decrease our cost a system that would have the by ?? medicare's
across the state and more importantly a systems we would feel perhaps
comfortable with if for some reason that the countable care organization
model doesn't work we can always deviate we an always move different

result but if i thin about what we probably need to do at this ?? i
don't believe that the bill currently proposed takes us in the right
direction establishing an organization or independent department may not
in fact be the right thing it may be increasing more ?? mat be creating
problems that we don't anticipate we may find a significant legal
obstacle in doing so we need to study it we need to figure this thing

Further discussion or debate?
Sen. Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the bill, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.
I've been here since 2011, we've had 3 secretaries for Health and Human
Services. I think a lot of the employees are conditioned with those many
changes. We've had 4 Medicaid directors, so the employees are
conditioned if they keep their head down long enough, this too shall
pass. As far as Sen. Ford's expansion, and I can tell you what's
expanded sir, since you've been here since I've been here, is the
expansion of the Medicaid overruns. It's expanded since I've been here
some $2 billion, and I'll submit to you that we as Republican majority
did no better than the Democrat majority at control and cost in
Medicaid. We have been here and been here and been here, Sen. McKissick.
Sen. McKissick, we have spent, or the DHHS has spent 16 months on the
road talking to docs, talking to hospitals, talking about the formation
of the ACOs. I personally am in favor of the ACOs, even though they were
derived out of Medicare and have very little experience. Whether you
call it accountable or managed care, their drive is to reduce cost and
to have better outcomes. As far as creating another state agency, it
does put a spotlight on Medicaid. We can't duck the issues anymore. I've
served on that board since I've been here, in the shadows of Sen. Hise
and Sen. Pate and it is a very complex issue that I really don't have my
arms around because there's 2 or 3 sources of money, there's multiple
federal and state laws.  It is very much an uncertainty of who and what
get served here. So we've gone back ?? in a state now, and the MCO/ACO
approach were bringing forward the holistic approach to communicating
about each patient and what their outcome should be. Many don't agree
with this bill, there's some things in here I don't like. But I don't
think this Sen. McKissick will be done overnight, we will move forward
prudently and expeditiously to get something done, but to have a board
of professionals that are directed exactly to Medicaid, whether it be a
Republican of Democrat administration, if we get a handle on Medicaid,
then we can do other things. I don't like being placed in position every
budget. Do I pay teachers or state employees, or do I fund the poor and
their medical needs? That is not place for any of us to be. We don't
want to be there, we've spent the money on Medicaid, the time for change
is now. So I will have to support this bill and work with the doctors
and the hospitals to improve it as we move forward. Thank you Mr.
President.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's at times like this when I wish I could channel the oratory skills
of my predecessor. This is something that I feel very very strongly
about. I obviously have not had to deliberate with budgets as long as
the rest of you have, this is my very first session. But I have been on
the board of Health and Human Services at Bunkem county for some time
now, and I worked as an affordable care navigator for 6 months. And when
someone comes into your office that is broken or chronically ill and you
can get them access to health care, it really changes how you think
about things. Now I know the intention of the bill is to save money for
the taxpayer and to improve the quality of healthcare for North
Carolina. But I worry that we are throwing out years of work and we need
to protect those parts of our system that are working. Medicaid is a
safety net program, and what that means is enrolling is going to go up
and down with the rise and fall of our economy. So part of the way we
deal with that</p>

<p id="130:00">
is by creating a reserve, and I congratulate the Senate for including a
reserve for Medicaid in the budget, that's an important step. But we
have to realize that we are not, for many North Carolinians we are still
in difficult times. Yes, unemployment is improving, but the greatest
sector, the fastest growing sector of jobs, is low paying jobs. Three
out of ten North Carolinians make wages that are at or below the poverty
level. So my point to you is at least some of that uncontrollable cost
in Medicaid over the last several years has been because of the economy.
Overruns are a result of an aging population and persistent hard times
for too many of our, of our fellow citizens. Furthermore, due to the
Affordable Care Act and the work of Community Care of North Carolina, we
are actually bringing per person cost of Medicaid down. Community Care
has painstakingly built an infrastructure, with the help of our
physicians, that has saved North Carolina close to a billion dollars
over the last four years. And how did they do that? By making us more
healthy. By getting us access to regular care. This, to me, just sounds
like a program that needs to be replicated, not defunded. My next point
is that managed care is not a panacea. Kentucky and New York are reeling
right now from the abrupt withdrawal of their MCOs, and Connecticut has
traditioned away from managed care, claiming, quote, &quot;Diminishing
confidence in the value of what was provided.&quot; According to Mark
McClellan, who was the head of the Senators for Medicaid and Medicare
for George W. Bush; to be successful, we need to make serious
investments in provider networks and support systems, so that we reform
the way we deliver care. MCOs are not a quick fix. He goes on to say
that managed care plans that have tried to keep costs down by
eliminating coverage, although they reduce costs in the short-term, lead
to higher costs in the long-term because they make people sick. Health
care is a huge, complex problem. But what we do hear has ramifications,
not just for Medicaid recipients, but for all of us who need to see a
doctor or go to a hospital. Why in the world would we want to start from
scratch when we have model programs that are saving the state money by
helping make North Carolinians healthier? And what is the hurry? It
seems to me that this bill is a smoke screen to keep us distracted from
another real problem with the budget, one that we have not talked about
at all, and that is the $5 million hole that was created, I'm sorry, by
tax giveaways to corporations and to the wealthy. Now if you believe a
revenue shortfall is a necessary evil on the way to prosperity, that's
fine, but say so. Don't blame the shortfall on doctors in hospitals that
are working to actually reform health care and that are absorbing the
costs of indigent care because we failed to take the Medicaid expansion.
Don't blame the shortfall on the blind, disabled, and the elderly. Don't
blame the shortfall on award winning programs like Community Care of
North Carolina that are actually saving the tax payer money. And by all
means, don't blame pregnant women and the children of the working poor,
that's just not right. Thank you Mr. President.

that we can deliver quality healthcare to our poor citizens in an
efficient and effective manner.  Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.  And it will have competition within each region,
multiple providers within each region, which will keep a failing
provider from causing a problem for the state.

the opportunity to actually achieve the efficiency and the quality care.

understanding that the ACOs, the North Carolina providers, both doctors

well in advance of any type of MCO action?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, what we have here is two parts. One,we've given them priority so
that we guarantee each region has one of those provider led
organizations.  We've also given them a time period in which they don't
have to be at full risk in coming in.  They can continue to operate on
fee for service or partial risk systems to build up the capital in order
for them to come online and be able to work and insure the patients as
is necessary.

Thank you Mr. President and Members.  I personally, and most of my
constituents are opposed to the commercial care for Medicade management
that is in this bill,  the MCO provisions. We are concerned about our
tax paid Medicade dollars are going to for-profits, especially out of
state corporations versus going to better health outcomes for our
citizens and for economic activity with our providers, workers and
communities.  My understanding in reviewing the information on Medicade
MCOs is that they can only make a profit by ultimately denying care or
by setting up gatekeepers and bureaucratic systems that frustrate, delay
or confuse patients so that they either delay care, give up, become more
acutely ill or disabled, or unfortunately pass away.  Medicade MCOs at
their worst can be like the V.A. on steroids. So it is for that reason
that we have strong concern in the eastern part of the state, the
counties I represent, with higher than average Medicade populations that
we would introduce this MCO dynamic into our Medicade system and for
that reason I will be opposing the bill.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK.  Further discussion or debate?  Hearing none, question before the
Senate . . . Senator Blue, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.  You know, the debate around the country for
about six or eight years was on the escalating increase in health care
costs in this country.  It had gotten up to 17, 18, 19 percent of the
GNP.  Twice, three times, the percentage of the GNP of all of the other
western countries.  And the whole debate in Washington four or five
years ago was trying to get a handle on that and so you got the
Affordable Care Act. And I report to you that the cost of health care is
decreasing in the sense that the rate of increase has
reduced substantially. The same thing that you've heard talked about
happening in the public sector and Medicade has been going on in the
private sector. Health care is moving away from fee for service concepts
to capitated service ideas.  That's happening across the entire system
and that's happening in Medicade and Medicare and every other form of
the ??? of health care because we had to get a handle on it.  And the
amazing thing about this bill</p>

...is I would readily acknowledge that I’m not the smartest person in
the state and certainly not the smartest with respect to how healthcare
is moving and where it ought to be going, but I did have the benefit of
the wisdom of three individuals who I think are among the smartest on
this issue. The 16 of us in the Wake County delegation had an
opportunity several months ago to sit down and talk with the heads of
the three pet systems that operate here in the triangle. Among those was
a fellow named Donald Gintzig who now heads Wake Medical Center. The
interesting thing about him is he’s a retired admiral from the United
States Navy. Admiral Gintzig was he headed 40 military treatment
facilities, over 200 clinics and was hailed as one of the most
successful, best administrators in the system as a United States Naval
Officer. He’s run private healthcare systems and been the president of a
non-profit and now he’s here heading Wake Medical Center.
In addition to Admiral Gintzig, we had Bill Roper. Most of you know who
Bill Roper and you know Bill Roper. Bill had an extensive background in
healthcare. He was in the George H. W. Bush White House as one of the
chief advisers and had a sterling reputation. He heads the UNC health
system now. But is importantly he’s doing of the school of public health
and is a...was a practicing pediatrician, but in addition to that, he’s
head of the health care financing administration so he knows something
about the money involved in healthcare.
A third one at this particular meeting, Victor Zhao who headed the Duke
health system was not present, but Victor is now the head of the
Institute of Medicine. He left Duke at the beginning of July and now he
is the Institute of Medicine. The place in the country that is more
knowledgeable about health care policy, about medicine, about medical
research and they’re basically beyond reproach in what they do with
fellows such as Francis Collins, the guy who gave us the DNA and all of
that mapping and stuff. We talk to them and the one common thing that
came out of the conversation about fixing Medicaid in North Carolina,
number one, they said that we seriously needed some leadership that
could envision where we are to go and how we are to get there, number
two, we needed reliable technology and make the investment in it. A lot
of the major health systems in the state are doing it. You know a lot
about that. They spent billions of dollars in epic other systems to get
health care information. Unfortunately, the smaller systems can’t afford
it because they’re fighting for their survival.
The state went down that road unsuccessfully up to this point, I would
say. But they were all in agreement on those three things. The third
thing, that I didn’t mention that they were in agreement on, was time.
That it will take 3 to 5 year window to get a handle on it and get
control. Some of the brightest, best minds in this field. Now, I mention
that, because one of the things that this bill does, it says that if
you’re one of those bright, best minds, you can’t be on this board
that’s going to decide how you fix Medicaid in North Carolina. All three
are identified and associated with institutions that have gotten money
from Medicaid. More importantly, with respect to two of them, with
respect to Victor Zhao at Duke and Bill Roper at UNC and I could say the
same thing for the head of the East Carolina Medical School and the
various schools associated with healthcare is that among those three
institutions in this state, and we’re very fortunate in this state to
have them as well as Wake Forest, institutions that have healthcare
economist that study this thing, they write about it. They teach people
across the country and across the world about it. They’re precluded from
being part of this group that’s going to decide where North Carolina’s
Medicaid care ought to go...</p>

<p id="145:00">
And how we get a handle on it. I don't know. If you're a professor in
the school of public health or the school of social work with
international credentials you could probably be of some value advising
this board or being on this deciding where health care policy is going
to go. We preclude them, even though they are associated with an
institution with UNC system, an institution with 10s of thousands of
employees and 100s of thousands of students. We say, you're precluded
because we've got this imaginary conflict that your knowledge doesn't
matter. I think that that's one flaw. The other flaw I see in this bill,
and I told Mark to congratulate Senator Brown as a lead negotiator on
the Senate budget. When I first saw the reserve put in there for
Medicaid I thought it was one of the most sensible things that we had
done, because Lanier Chancellor, who was Secretary of Health and Human
Services, told us three years ago, or four years ago, whenever it was.
That when we put the budget that we did on Medicaid, that he could not
bring Medicaid in, within that budget. Lanier served with me in the
House, good Republican, very truthful, and he said he cannot bring the
Medicaid budget in where you set it. Then, we seem shocked and surprised
when they exceed the budget the budget that we set. He told you going in
it was at least $300 Million dollars more than what we were budgeting
and he would do everything in his power. So, predictability is dependent
on whether you realistically set the amount that you were expecting to
spend. That's why I congratulate Senator Brown and the budget chairs for
putting that amount in. I think you think you probably should of been a
little more stubborn and keeping it up at the level it was at without
reducing it, because it will still come in above that level. But, let me
say this in conclusion, we're thinking and may have already set up the
board to advise the treasurer on investments. She invests $70 or $80
Billion dollars, I think that's what the retirement fund is now. $70 or
$80 Billion dollars and we want experts to be the advisor and help make
decisions on how that $70 or $80 Billion dollars is invested. We want
experts in business to be part of this board that will govern the
Medicaid system. Those three gentlemen I mentioned, as well as the type
flight professors and participants at these schools across North
Carolina are national experts. You look at their credentials , they
serve on the boards of the biggest, most powerful corporations in the
United States and helped set policy, and they're unable to help us here
in North Carolina with all that expertise. But, when we look at what
Lanier was able to do with the money that we gave him, we really ought
to be somewhat proud of the efforts that were made by him in that
administration. I will tell you that whenever every medical group that
I'm aware of, in addition to these gentlemen that I just talked about--
There's a medical group in North Carolina, tells me that their
experience and their study shows that TCNC, Community Care of North
Carolina, is the kind of direction we ought to go in, it says a lot to
me, because they know a lot more about this than I do. When the doctors
tell me that they're doing the same thing with their privately insured
patients that they would do with Medicaid patients, and more doctors in
North Carolina are providing services to Medicaid patients more than
most of the other states. Having ACO, accountable care organizations, is
a way of insuring that they will still deliver those services at a much
higher percentage in North Carolina than most other states to Medicaid
patients, than I take note. All of the experts, that I rely on say, this
is not the way that we should be going in reforming Medicaid. Nevermind
my limited knowledge, nevermind my wisdom on these subjects, I'm more
inclined to believe those experts than I am us, who do it on emotion
rather than all of the facts that they've considered. I would suggest
that the concept of reforming Medicaid is a great</p>

and listen to the doctors, to the hospitals in North Carolina.  All of

it in this bill.  And, these experts who have worldwide experience on
how to get a handle on this.  So I hope you'll vote against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Van Duyn has an excused absence for the remainder of the
session.  Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak briefly, on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, I'm like you, I'm sure not a pro in this, and it's a
complicated issue.  And, it's a -- it's a -- probably the toughest issue
we deal with every year.  A few things I do want to touch on.  I know
Senator Hise and Senator Pate have been working on this issue for over a
year, and I've been a little bit involved in some of the work that
they've been doing.  And I can tell you that we have sat down with Bill
Roper, and Dave Herman, and the gentleman at Cape Fear Valley, and
several other major people as we've tried to figure out the direction to
take reforming Medicaid in this state.  And, actually we've met with
those folks on many occasions to try to figure this out because it is so
complicated and gotten a lot of input on what a new organization might
want to look like.  And have tried to incorporate a lot of those
thoughts into what this bill looks like today.  And again, this bill is
probably not a perfect bill--I think we've all kind of admitted that
today.  This bill's probably got a long way to go before it's finalized,
as we continue to talk to administrators and doctors, and providers to
continue trying to make it the best bill we can make it before final
passage.  But there's just several facts, and I think we all know it.
And, I'm not going to touch on them long, but in the past ten years
Medicaid costs for the state has grown from less than two billion to
over--to about three and one half billion--about a 75% increase--ten
years.  And if you compare it to education, which is the piece which is
probably the most important to us in so many ways, that piece of the
budget has only grown about 25%.  So you can see what the investment in
Medicaid has been over the past ten years compared to the other key
piece of our budget, which is education, of only 25%.  If we look at our
plan in North Carolina, we have a great plan.  I understand why people
want to come to North Carolina, especially for healthcare--we've got
some of the best in the world.  It's a great place to be.  Our Medicaid
plan is one of the best in the nation, no question.  Our eligibility
piece of it is probably the best in the southeast--one of the best in
the nation.  We cover more things in our Medicaid plan than most do.
And that's probably a good thing, if you can banish costs along with it.
 And, I think that's been the problem we've had.  You know, moving
forward, we gotta [sic] get some predictability; it's--and Senator Blue
I think you're exactly right--I think during the recession in
particular, trying to put budgets together, we probably underfunded
Medicaid.  Because, it was the easiest piece probably to underfund and
then you come back--you know--a year later and say why have we got a 300
million dollar shortfall?  Well, we didn't plan it right to start with.
But it--it's just growing at such a pace, it is absolutely--has
absolutely killed our budget.  Again, you know, look at JPS.  We've cut
it to the bone; there's no other cuts there.  Education, we haven't been
able to do what we want to do.  [??] we've made cuts, [??]gov we've made
cuts; it's just something we have to get our hands around is the cost of
Medicaid.  And, I--again, I want to thank Senator Hise and Senator Pate
for the time they've put into this.  I think you can see when they stand
up and speak, just how in-depth they've gotten in trying to understand
this issue.  I mean, I think Senator Hise can talk about Medicaid in his
sleep, because he's dug into it so much, he understands it probably
better than anybody in here.  But that's what it takes to try to
understand it and figure it out. I would just tell you, we'll--we'll
continue to work on this bill as it moves forward, we'll continue to
talk to administrators and doctors and providers, but reform is needed
in this state.  And it's a bold step, and something we've gotta [sic]
do, and I think today is the first step of that.  And we need to move it
forward;  and again continue to work on it and make it the best we can
be. So I ask you to vote for this bill.

Thank you, Senator Ford. Okay, that brings us to Conference Report for
adoption, Senate Bill 793. Senator Tillman's recognized. Oh, the clerk
will read, sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senate Bill 793, Charter School Amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Tillman has the floor, explain.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President. This bill has been worked since, well when we
first started the charter legislation. This is a cumulation of a lot of
things that needed to be caught up with the rules in the processes, and
that's basically what  we have here. The bill analysis gives you a
pretty good idea of what changes have been made and so forth. We've got
all the [??] on the Senate side signed off, and I believe the House side
has everybody, but one. I'd ask for your support of this conference
report.

Senator McKissick, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To ask Senator Tillman a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Tillman do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I would, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Could you refresh my recollections about the basic contents of this
bill, if you would, Sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well, the bill covers a lot of ground, but if you want to check your
digest it will give you a summation of the changes that have been made
and agreed upon by the House. I can go through them, or you can look at
them and see if you have a particular question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
If you could just-- Mr. [??], follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
If you could just briefly summarize, it would help, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
All right, we can renew charters for up to 10 years, we now have a fast
track legislation that will be included in this bill. We changed some
dates on the reporting to give more time for the Charter Advisory Board
and State Board of Education to review these applications. We've
tightened the application process up and having a review process, and
having some time for an appeal, if you don't like the decision. Rather
than no appeal and simply getting a letter. We're saying you can add a
grade if you want to. If you've got five performances that adequate over
the last three years you can even add a grade to the lower end, if
you've got middle grades, that was not in the legislation. This and some
of the other minor changes.

Thank you.

[??] Lauren, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
See if the Senator, gentleman would yield to a question, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Sir, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Senator Tillman. Just trying to look through this real quick.
There was an issue about transparency of salaries, etc. Is that
addressed in this bill, because that's important. Our citizens have said
to me over and over again, if you're paid by public funds, than that
salary ought to be of public record. Anybody ought to be able to
recognize that, so I just ask you that question, if you could--
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Good question. I was certainly expecting that one, so yes. If you are
employed by the charter school, here before you did not have reveal
salaries of anyone, but now as is required by public schools, you have
to reveal the name and the salary of your employees. To the charter
schools point of view, they're paid different, they already pay on merit
and when they have that Suzy, who has only been there five years is
making $10,000 more than Jane, who's been there fifteen years it does
present a moral problem. We do have look at that, and we may have to
look at that when we go merit pay for the public schools. But, yes,
right now fully transparent.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]j
Further discussion or debate? Question before the Senate is the adoption
of the conference report for Senate Bill 793. All those in favor of
adopting will vote aye, those against vote nay. Five seconds for the
