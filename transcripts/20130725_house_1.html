spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus, so that
with one heart and one mouth, you may glorify the God and Father of our

  <p>Speaker: …calendar, house resolution 1022. The clerk will read.
Clerk: House resolution 1022, house resolution amend the permanent rules
of the house concerning office assignments the house resolves.
Speaker: The house will come to order. Representative Hall, please state
the purpose.
Representative: To speak on the resolution.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution. The house
will come to order.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker for the introduction. This is a
resolution that we are making to the current house rules. This
resolution will allow the members to have full control of their offices,
who has access to their offices, and to ensure that anyone who wants to
access your office knows that you are the person that they would need to
see. The other people who would have access to the office would
obviously be the legislative staff, the maintenance personnel, and the
repair personnel, and the police. We do have an amendment, if I could
send for an amendment?
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The
clerk will read.
Clerk: Representative Hall moves to amend the bill on page 1, line 14 by
rewriting the line to read.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. This ensures that there is
consistency in the bill and the resolution such that it recognizes that
joint legislative employees in both sections will be consistent, and a
joint legislative employees include legislative service personnel and
other folks on the staff as well, as I have said, including the
maintenance and repair and cleaning personnel. It would also include the
legislative special police. As you all know you have panic buttons in
your office for situations that might happen – certainly they will be
allowed to come into the office spaces as well. So I would urge your
support on the resolution to the rules, and your support on the
amendment.
Speaker: Further debate on the amendment? If not, the question before
the house is the adoption of the amendment set forth by Representative
Larry Hall for house resolution 1022. All in favor will vote aye, all
opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The members may
walk, the chair will wait. The clerk will lock and record the vote: 111
having voted in the affirmative, none in the negative. The amendment
passes and we are now back on the bill. Representative Hall is
recognized to debate the resolution as amended.
Representative: Again Mr. Speaker, I think it is pretty clear on the
space. It allows you again to be responsible for and know who has access
to your office spaces and anyone who needs access to your office space
will know they can go through you and get the appropriate permission.
Further discussion, further debate on the resolution? If not, the
question before the house is house resolution 1022 as adopted. All in

I have just a brief moment of personal privilege before the motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal
privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I’d just like to thank you
very much for the position of this bill on the calendar. The last bill I
had to present kept being put way back behind the budget and a lot of
additional items and I was beginning to not feel the love, so I really
appreciate keeping this in this position on the calendar. [LAUGHTER] Now
may I be recognized for a motion? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized for a motion and to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. This is House Bill 34, which was the State
Personnel Act bill. It now comes back as House Bill 34, which is a
combination of House Bill 34 and Senate Bill 473, which was the Health
Care Cost Reduction and Transparency Act. They didn’t make many changes
to the original bill. The main change they made probably improved the
bill. It made changes to the grievance process, to require approval by
the office of state personnel of any final agency actions, and to allow
contested case appeal to the office of administrative hearings, and gave
the OAH 180 days to answer that appeal. And then parties can go from
there to the court of appeals if they’re still not in agreement. So
that’s probably a better process than what we had. As far as the extra
stuff they put in there, I’ll try to briefly explain Senate Bill 473
which they added. Now from Part 10 to Part 14 of this bill, will deal
with that extra bill that was put in. Part 10 creates the Health Care
Cost Reduction and Transparency Act. This act creates new reporting
requirements for hospitals on pricing for the 100 most common in-patient
diagnostic related groups in each hospital. It also requires reporting
requirements for out-patient departments and ambulatory surgical centers
for their 20 most common surgical procedures and 20 most common imaging
procedures. Part 11 of the bill makes it unlawful for any provider of
health care services to charge or accept payment for any health care
procedure or component of a health care procedure that was not performed
or supplied. So you can’t charge for things you didn’t do. Part 12 of
the bill prohibits the UNC health care system and its affiliates and
other schools of medicine from utilizing setoff debt collection
procedures to collect outstanding debts from tax refunds and lottery
winnings of debtors. Not sure why those, why the lottery winnings went
in with the tax refunds but it’s

  <p>Worst case the Senate something is a little quirky and I don&#39;t
understand and I&#39;m willing to accept it. The reason these hospitals
have been singled out is because they&#39;re the only ones as I
understand who could use this set off debt election procedure to start
with on anything. Part thirteen of the bill establishes a fair billing
practice for hospitals and ASE&#39;s The requirements are that the bill
must be written so as to be comprehensible to the ordinary lay person.
Which will be a big change. The notice be provided before sent to
collections and that the hospital keep the hospital from attaching
debtors principal residence spouses and tenors by it&#39;s entirety so
get some personal assistance from your personal residence not be
attached by a hospital. The final part of the bill part fourteen
requires hospitals to electronic health records to connect to the HCHIE
network and submit data on services page paid for with Medicaid funds. I
would ask that you...well my motion has been to concur with
this...I&#39;d ask that you vote green to concur.
Representative Doptree please state your purpose.
To speak on the bill.
The gentlemen is recognized to debate the motion.
The ability of hospitals to collect money for our pitch ?? who go there
for services has been a real problem in our state for years. I know in
our small hospital in hallway over twenty million dollars last year and
bills that were not paid. And it is not unusual for people who go to the
hospital for them not to pay their bills. And what this new bill does is
it allows we have adopted under necessities where it started out as a
common law that if a person goes to the hospital if a wife goes to the
hospital and incurs a debt the husband is liable. That&#39;s been the
law for a long time and what this bill does is simply says that if you
are a owner of property in a state called Tennessee by the entiretys
that means you&#39;re married if you own a thousand acres of land you
and your wife and your wife goes to the hospital well the husband goes
to the hospital and will not pay the debt. Then you are not going to be
able to go to the courts and go to judgement and collect on that debt
for the land owned by Tennessee by the entirety. It&#39;s very unfair to
the hospital to was supposed by the hospital association. We tried to
fix that on the committee yesterday by saying you could only you
couldn&#39;t levy on the hopes that plus five acres but now no matter
how rich you are you and you&#39;re wife are free from any kind of
collection of debt from the hospital if it&#39;s tended by the entirety
and it&#39;s very unfair.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Stan please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
To speak on the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
The gentlemen has the floor.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Yes I support concurrence on the bill but I completely agree with
Representative Dotree and for the information of the members. The bill
where his amendment was is on the calendar today. I understand when we
sent back the rules and we will do a fix in rules later today.
Representative Godtree which says that if eight twenty four becomes law
then your amendment and the other amendment would be added to it so I
agree with you but hopefully we can fix it.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Glacier please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
To see if Representative Collins would yield for a question please.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Collins do you yield Representative Glacier&#39;s
question?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I will give it a shot.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
He yields.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you Representative and I know it because there&#39;s lots of
changes trying really quickly to read through. There was...do you know
on either section either part of the bill whether there are any
organizations or groups that are actively opposed to either section? So
we get some sense of where people are.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
May I respond?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Yes sir.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I asked that very same question Representative Glacier because obviously
I had very little knowledge of the Senate bill coming into this process.
I was told that no associations have come out against it. My hospital
administrator is pretty good at letting me know when things come up on
his radar screen I get correspondents from him regularly I&#39;ve heard
nothing from him on this. So to the best of my knowledge there&#39;s
no...I haven&#39;t received any emails on this. I haven&#39;t received
any feedback from this  frankly as far as I know nobody is opposing this
new stuff that&#39;s in there.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you one follow up please. Representative Collins do you yield? He
yields.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you very much and on the first section of the bill I know there
was some discussion about whether this stage would please union was
opposed or for do we know what their position is on the last on this
version?

  <p>Met with them repeatedly and made compromise after compromise to do it.
I thought I&#39;d come up with something they could live with, and then
the day we showed up in committee, I found out differently.  I
haven&#39;t heard from them since, so I would assume they&#39;re still
probably opposed to it.  But I haven&#39;t had any active campaigning
going on this time through.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very much.  Representative Insko, please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To ask Representative Daughtry a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Daughtry, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Daughtry, I understand your concern
about this section in the bill about tenancy in the entirety, and I hope
that you might be willing to take a look at having the property divided
50-50, which would be a reasonable thing to do and not impoverish the
whole family.  Is that something you would consider?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I certainly will consider that, I just think that if
somebody owns a million dollars worth of land, and won&#39;t pay the
hospital, that the hospital ought to have the right to collect their
debt, and the hospital association feels the same way.  They supported
the amendment yesterday, and I hope that they&#39;ll support it again
today if we can get it through the committee later on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Haggar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To see if Representative Stam would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Stam, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Representative Stam,  in
talking about the tenancy in entirety issue, do banks have that luxury
if I default on a loan and I&#39;m married, can they take my property
also?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, that&#39;s a matter of contract, and every bank
that I know of, and by the way I&#39;ve done 4,000 closings, and
probably 3,000 of them involved bank financing, and they get it all.
They get it all. Find fault, including the house and every scrap of land
there is. Yes, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]So you&#39;re telling me that if I&#39;m the tenancy by
entirety, and I enter a debt, and my wife doesn&#39;t sign for it, they
can take the tenancy by entirety property?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]No, the banks always make your spouse sign for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]If she doesn&#39;t sign, similar that if she
doesn&#39;t sign in a hospital for instance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]They don&#39;t lend you the money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Gentleman has the floor to debate bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The bill, and most of what Representative Collins has a
good bill, the tenancy by entirety issue, I think as it is now, is a
protection for somebody that, you know most people don&#39;t own a
million acres, they own 5 acres, 6 acres, 10 acres or 20 acres, and as I
understand the law, maybe different than what Representative Stam
understands the law, if my spouse doesn&#39;t sign on to the, if
she&#39;s not a guarantor on the piece of property, they can&#39;t touch
that piece of property, the way I understand this law. And I&#39;ve done
a little bit of research here lately on it.  So why are we treating in
the amendment, and I apologize if I&#39;m off course Mr. Speaker, let me
know.  So I like the way this is set up, because it makes it consistent
with everything else, and the way everything else runs, whether it&#39;s
banks, mortgages, or whatever.  So I&#39;d urge you to vote for this
bill as it is, and keep it as it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Brian Brown, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Alright, the gentleman has the floor to debate the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Members, I think this is a
great bill, there&#39;s a lot of great things in this.  However, there
was one provision in it that strikes me, and it needs to be fixed, and a
little further explored.  And that is the debt collection regarding the
university systems and their health care practices.  In an environment
when we continue to cut funding to these systems, I&#39;ve voted against
the budget yesterday, in regards to cutting funding to this particular
system.  We are restricting their ability to continue to be solvent and
provide the extraordinary care that they do, particularly in my region
in the rural communities, by restricting their ability to collect their
debt off of  someone&#39;s tax returns.  We are one large system here in
the state.  We send them money, we ask them to be creative in ways to
create money and raise money to support themselves, and to be solvent,
and I think we need to be able to fix this one particular provision to
allow our university health care systems to remain solvent, provide the
important care they provide this state.  So I would ask you not to
concur so we can fix this one small issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Floyd, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To respond to Representative Hager, of course, and also
to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I plead that in response to iii Hager question, it was
that perhaps if the property was accrued prior to the individuals being
remarried, then the second wife, or second spouse then sign an agreement
where he or she is not responsible for the debt, because it&#39;s going
to the first.  But the question that I have as it relates

  <p>[0:00:00.0]
…It is on page 26, section 4, line 14 and 15, it is not so much that an
individual do not wish to pay his or her debt. The concern that occur in
building is that once a person entering to a medical facility he or she
receives many bills from that facility as an example he may go to a
hospital and receive bills from two or three other bills in the agency
they came the hospital had utilized after providing service as that
patient enter into their facility. I think that one thing that I have to
be look at as we go back and to rule that the hospital may notify the
client into process that he or she maybe receiving bill is maybe in here
but it just that the person maybe receiving additional billing from A,
B, C or D. So, that particular person would know and many individual
have experienced an entree fee___[01:07] and entering to a medical
facility and receive multiple billing for multiple agencies that he or
she may not thing that they need to pay or because they walked into the
door of an example of our facility, take that to the hospital. So, the
patient need to know where these bill will be coming from because if you
look at the internet system a very keen person can send you bills and
you will paying that particular organization bill that you do not know
and they can sort of tapping to our financial system meaning the
individual patient is there. So, I think that’s critical towards the
billing process that a particular patient knows, thank you Mr. Speaker.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Collins, I’m concerned in the certain state
personnel part of the bill on page 4 beginning at lines 47 and this has
been raised when the bill was first in the house that the number of
exempt positions in State Government is going to increase from 1000 to
1,500 that many of us thought was politicizing the situation in amongst
State Government personnel. I’m wondering whether the senate, whether
this issue came up at all in the senate whether the senate express any
concerns about this expansion of the exempt positions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologies, I heard you say that rise in exempt positions is a
political issue, is that the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question that I had Representative Collins was whether the expansion
of the exempt positions in effect turning civil servants into political
appointees whether the Senate had any discussion about that feature
because we did discuss it with some length in the house.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor to response.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My response is I have no idea what the Senate discussed they didn’t
change this so I wasn’t ___[04:00] to their discussions so I don’t know
whether that was a point of discussion or not? I understand now I have
been told by two or three people that Senate does not oppose this bill
anymore so apparently they don’t view at that way and I think the main
reason Senate probably is now on board has to do with the appeal process
change because that probably set and it’s probably is a better process
than the kind of convoluted process we had but I even heard from anybody
a discussion or criticism of that particular aspect since we send it
over to the senate. If there is any problem with that on their part I
don’t about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Collins. Members of the house this is not much
discussion in just now as we have reviewed the motion to concur and I
think it is something that we should draw everyone’s attention I think
that when this bill was before us, right before across over it did draw
lot of attention, we did see that 500 additional civil servants…

increasing the number of political positions in state government
administration is a good idea. I can’t support the bill on the basis of
this expansion of the exempt positions, of politically exempt positions,
which indeed therefore politicizes the state government administration.
Thank you.

I would like to ask Rep. Collins a question.

Rep. Collins, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. I’m wondering. This section about the dire necessities
about collections on the hospitals and all. In a situation where a
person cannot afford to pay the bill, and they’re trying to pay monthly,
what they can. This would not allow the hospital to refuse to accept
that and take their property would it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m told by those that have vetted as a separate bill in some of the
committees that I was not on, that the answer to that question is no.
I’m going to assume that they know what they’re talking about. Thank you
Rep. Collins.

I just want to remind everyone, that as far as the state personnel act
part of this is concerned we had a good vote on this and it went over.
The bill was actually improved. I’m delighted that scenic is supporting
one of my bills. It is a marriage in heaven that I never thought I would
get. I would ask that you vote in agreement to concur with this bill.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A question for Rep. Collins if he could?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Collins, do you yield? He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I certainly will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Rep. Collins. I just have a question. You indicate the Senate
was supporting the bill. Are they also supporting the hospital portion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’ve asked a question I have no idea about. Rep. Hall. I really don’t
know their position on that. Nobody has stated any opposition. No
organization has stated an opposition to me regarding that bill. So, if
anybody is opposed to it, I’m totally unaware of it. I might also say,
that in all fairness, that obviously this part of the bill has been
dropped on me pretty late in the game also. But, I was told by those who
dropped it on me that there were no organizations rallying against it as
well. I’m taking somebody else’s word for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, the part we’ve been having
a discussion on, is actually some legislation that has been done all
over the country. It actually has proven to lower health care costs. It
went through rules yesterday and it pretty much passed unanimously going
out of rules that this was a direction we want to go. I urge you to
support this bill and move forward.

fix it in rules.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. 553 is a bill that we
originally sent over I think as 320 and then we sent this bill over,
senate bill. Senate did not concur. When we had our conference we made a
couple of really clarifying changes. The bill is pretty much the
language that we originally worked out in house bill 320, which is a
good thing. In addition, we added to this bill the contents, or the
majority of the contents, of senate bill 663 which was here, and the
contents of that have to do with some housing issues and a few other
related issues that came out of recommendations from the Blue Ribbon
commission on the transitions to community living, so the contents of
that were, those provisions were worked out, those issues were worked
out, in the Blue Ribbon commission last year and earlier this year and
Senator Hise had put those, the housing pieces, since he shared that
piece of the commission. He put those in a bill and we made a few

  <p>...tweaks to those and put those in this bill. The other provision that
is in here is a provision that actually relates to a hospital
assessment. As you know in the budget we made some changes to hospital
assessment and increased it rather substantially. And what this
provision does, and the hospital&#39;s association supports this
provision, what it basically does is just allow them a better allocation
of those burdens among the constituent hospitals and there&#39;s, to my
knowledge, all of these three major pieces are sections of this
conference report are in agreement on no opposition. I&#39;d be happy to
attempt to answer any questions but would appreciate your support for
the conference report.

[Speaker Changes] Committee Substitute number 2 for House Bill 618, a
bill entitled &quot;An Act to Restore Firearm Rights to Certain Persons
Who Were Convicted of Non-Violent Felonies Before December 1st, 1995 and
Whose Firearm Rights Have Been Restored Before December The First, 1995
and to Increase the Fee to Petition for the Restoration of Firearm
Rights.&quot; Jones, Senator of North Carolina, you&#39;re next.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Speciale, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman has full room to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Ladies and gentlemen, this bill is a very simple bill.
In 1995 some changes were made to the Firearm Restoration law with
regard to convicted felons and there were many of them that had met the
requirements of the law at the time and had their rights restored, and
then they lost them again because of the law, because  there was nothing
grandfathered in it. And some of them are ineligible to ever apply again
because of changes that were made in the law. All this bill is, is to
fix what should have been fixed at that time. It will allow those whose
rights were restored, who have not since had any felonies or any
problems, to regain those rights. It will not change the current law and
it&#39;s applicable only to those who were caught in this trap, as far
as I&#39;m concerned, on or before December 1st, 1995. And so I&#39;d
like to send forth an amendment.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The Clerk will read.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Speciale moves to amend the bill on
page 1, line 13 by deleting &#39;after&#39; and inserting &#39;on.&#39;
[Speaker Changes] Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mister Speaker. There&#39;s just a
technical correction, it should have been &#39;on.&#39; If they had
their rights restored &#39;on&#39; the day that this bill took effect,
which was December 1st, 1995, then this would correct it. It
shouldn&#39;t have been &#39;after&#39; &#39;cause it will only apply to
those whose rights were restored &#39;on&#39; that day. I ask that you
would support the amendment and then I ask that you would support the
bill.
[Speaker Changes] Any further debate or discussion on the amendment? If
not, the Court...

on the bill. Representative Glacier, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill Mr. Speaker.
Speaker: The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. I really want to thank
Representative Speciality and Representative Stearns, I know who worked
on this and I had opposed, both in committee and on the floor, the
previous drafts because I thought they opened firearms to folks I
thought should not have it, but I am in favor of this modified bill
because I think it does exactly what Representative Speciality says it
does, and it really is a matter of fairness. It gets to a very small
subset of people who had their rights restored and then by retroactive
application of a law, which we should rarely ever do retroactive
application of a law, they had their rights cut off. In this sense, I
think this is really getting to that subset who was unfairly treated and
I support the bill. Thank you.
Speaker: Representative Harrison, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill.
Speaker: The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentleman of the
house. I appreciate Rep. Speciality fixing this bill and toning down the
impact of it. I think it is unfortunate that in the wake of Sandy
Bumkin, a war in Tucson, and the Trevon Martin tragedy, that we are not
discussing gun safety bills and instead, two days ago, significantly
expanded where we can take concealed carries, to the credit of
Representative Schaeffer, to her credit, did fix the provision, and
getting guns into the hands of ex-felons. I would like to be recognized
to send forth an amendment.
Speaker: The lady is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk
will read.
Clerk: Rep. Harrison moves to amend the bill on page 1, line 5, by
deleting.
Speaker: The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. This amendment actually moves to
repeal the stand your ground law that was enacted by this legislature in
2011. I have done a little bit of research since the Trevon Martin
tragedy and since Florida enacted the stand your ground legislation
justifiable, homicides have tripled in that state. Now we have expanded
where folks can carry concealed guns as of Tuesday night and now we have
this stand your ground provision. So I would just urge your support.
Thank you.
Speaker: Rep. Moore, please state your purpose.
Representative: Rise to a point of order.
Speaker: The gentleman may state his point of order.
Representative: Mr. Speaker, I would argue that this amendment is not
germane to the bill. I would ask that the speaker to rule the amendment
out of order.
Speaker: Representative Moore I think your point is well taken. It
appears that the amendment is not germane to the bill and is out of
order, and will be displaced. We are now back on the bill: further
discussion, further debate, on the bill? Rep. Speciality, please state
your purpose.
Representative: To speak one more time on the bill sir.
Speaker: The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill a second time.
Representative: I just want to remind everybody that this issue is not
about guns. For those who… it does not matter where you stand on it:
this is simply a fairness issue. A bill was passed here and it did not
take into consideration that some people had earned their right back. It
has been since 1995. Any of the folks who have had their right since
that time, if they were still people that we did not want to have guns –
if they were criminals, if they had any felonies since then, they are
out of the ballpark – it is as simple as that. So they would have shown
their colors – it has been 18 years, and I ask, in the name of fairness,
that you support this bill.
Speaker: Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill.
Speaker: The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
Representative: I would like to point out that a lot of oddities come at
the end of the session. For the second successive day, Representative
Glacier and I are in 100% agreement on a bill that we are speaking –
this is getting to be fun Rep. Glacier. I would like to reiterate what
Rep. Speciality just said: we are restoring rights that were
retroactively taken away from people – that is what this is about. I am
as much of a law and order person as any person in this chamber, with
maybe a couple of exceptions. This is a fairness bill: we are restoring
rights to people that were retroactively had them taken away. So, I
would ask that you vote green and vote for this bill.
Speaker: Representative Brown, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill.
Speaker: The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
Representative: I just wanted to congratulate Speciality for….

  <p>this could be all, I think this is an overall theme that we need to be
talking about when we&#39;re talking about restoration of rights. There
is possibly a voter ID bill that would come over that will talk about
taking away people&#39;s rights after they have been restored. I hope
that all of us that feel the same way about this will feel the same way
about that. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon, could you point to me any bill
in which somebody&#39;s rights, in which, specifically somebody&#39;s
right to vote, is being taken away. Because I haven&#39;t seen any such
legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to answer the question. There is a
provision in the Senate bill that would want the people, felons to have
five extra years before they vote, that is in the bill. I hope that you
would vote against that provision in the fairness of what you decided
today.

for the redistricting as it would affect Guilford County and Stanly

I&#39;d appreciate your support again today. I&#39;d be glad to take any

government elections. Thanks.

citizens of Guilford County have not expressed any dissatisfaction with
their local school board. Maybe a couple of citizens have some issues,
but that&#39;s no reason for us to meddle in Guilford County and change
their school board in any way. As a matter of fact, in the last election
there was only one board member that was opposed to. You should also
know that the Guilford County school board voted unanimously on the 28th
of March to oppose this bill. We should give the citizens of Guilford
County a thorough opportunity to

  <p>Representative: …make its own decisions, this bill does not do it, even
with the referendum, it does not address everything in terms of giving
citizens the opportunity of expressing their opinions about it. I also
believe that partisan elections are absolutely inappropriate for school
boards: they don’t provide an opportunity for the people who serve to do
the best job for all of the children. It is going to impede the board’s
ability to act appropriately. This bill was developed in isolation of
public opinion or input. Also, it did not receive input from our school
board. It is a bad bill for Gilford County. We do not want it. We do not
need it.
Speaker: Representative please state your purpose.
Representative: Mr. President I would like to see if Representative
Adams would yield for a question.
Speaker: Representative Adams, do you yield?
Representative: I will since I am at the end of my comments.

receive input from the Gilford County Board of Education?
Representative: Yes I did say that.
Representative: Well I…follow up Mr. Speaker?
Speaker: Do you yield?
Representative: I do.
Speaker: She yields.
Representative: Representative Adams, so you are saying that the
communications that I have had with the school board, with the chairman
of the school board, you are saying that none of that took place?
Representative: I am saying that you may have told them what you wanted
to do, but you did not listen to what they wanted to do. That is what I
am saying.
Representative: Mr. Speaker, may I speak on the bill a second time?
Speaker: Gentleman has the floor to debate the bill a second time.
Representative: Thank you. I just want to set the record straight here.
I have very much been in communication with the Gilford Board of
Education. I have actually had at least two members of the school board
email me within the last 24 hours to thank the house for the work we
have done to improve this bill. The Gilford County Board of Education
does stand in opposition to this bill but they prefer the house plan
over the original senate plan. I have sent an email out to all the
members the Gilford County Board of Education. I have been in contact
with them all through this process. I have gotten a whole lot of
feedback from them, as has also Senator Fairclothe, he has also worked
with me on this. So there has been ample communication between members
of the… between Representative Fairclothe and myself and others who have
worked on this. As you can see our delegation is divided on this, but I
think it is the right thing to do. I appreciate your support.
Speaker: Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
Representative: To ask Representative Harvester a question please.
Speaker: Representative Harvester, do you yield?
Representative: Certainly.
Representative: Representative Harvester, and this can be for you or
anyone who wants to answer the question, I just wanted to know – I am
just confused on why we have a referendum on one part and we do not have
a referendum on the other part with the maps. Can you just explain to
the body why we decided that the people should decide whether it should
be partisan but they should not have the right to decide what the lines
look like, what the redistricting looks like? Please explain the
difference.
Representative: I would be glad to yield to the question. The answer to
that is that I believe that the partisan elections provision is the most
controversial on this topic and we thought it would be best to leave
that decision to the voters. As to the maps themselves, I think, as a
legislator from Gilford County, I think it is very important to match
the commissioner districts with the education districts to make it more
efficient for communications between the citizens and their elected
officials, and between the two elected bodies. I think that is in common
concert of good government. So I thought it would be good to make that
change legislatively, but the partisan elections provision, being the
most controversial, I thought it would be best to put that to
referendum.
Representative: To speak on the bill please.
Speaker: Representative Brandon you have the floor to debate the floor.
Representative: I think that Representative had a clear indication of
why we should vote this down. It is in his opinion why he thought this
should not be a part of public input, but that is not what our laws
dictate us to do – it is not the opinion of Representatives [xx],
Fairclothe and Harvester to determine whether or not we should have
lines redrawn, it is the vote of the people that should do that. They
did not send us up here as just a matter of opinion, but to represent
them, and we are not representing them by just basically stating our own
opinion. I think we all know the real reason why we did not put it up
for public vote because they know that it would absolutely…

the redistricting laws and how important that is and when we talk about
redistricting we always have a specific way that we do that and that is
to take that to the people that at least have a public form so they can
have input. There are things that we have to take to the people and we
drawing lines is one of them. Do you not agree with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have a follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No I was waiting to respond to his question. Yes Sir I
do agree with that I believe that representative Hardister line that he
has duly communicate with people in his committee on this issue. When I
question your premise that what he is doing is not the reflection of the
will of the people in his district. I submit to you that every piece of
idea that you have including your position on charters school last
session was reflection of your position on it. In best interest of the
people that elected you to come here and represent them. And I submit to
you that what he is doing now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposition on education. Here is a representative of
people that I represent I had ten halls over 200 people 300 people came
from my district. They overwhelmly majority of them supported what I was
doing and so that&#39;s what I did but in this particular case we do
have protocol on how we deal with redistricting and I would venture to
say this math that we have on our table that 99.9% of the people in the
county have never seen that math. If anybody wants to challenge me on
that I would be glad to be challenged but I would say that less that
1.1% of that people in Guilford county have seen that math and that is
just wrong and my question is for you guys is that why is it okay for us
to have a referendum on one part of the bill and not a referendum on the
one that law states that we have one on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hardister please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see representative veil for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He veils thank you my friend. Representative you are
aware. You may or may not be aware my question is this map was published
in greens brow news in record. Are you aware of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am aware of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] so follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You still think that only 1% of population is seeing
the math.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. I do. I am gonna clear my comments but I just
want everybody to realize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Garland please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon would you up for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon do you veil?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Always.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon are you didn&#39;t say on the
decision we made on electronic notification was actually a wonderful
decision. Since in the nobody ?? newspapers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well it&#39;s actually less quick to look at the
county website that&#39;s like 0.5%. So that&#39;s where I come into.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon you to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon do you veil?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Always.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you running for Congress?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is not a big, everybody that knows me know that I
am a really big fervor and I get in trouble in both sides if it is a
referendum or vote for the local bill. If it&#39;s not a referendum I
will not vote for the local bill that is a strict policy that I have
always had. The last time we brought this to house it was 181 and I was
don&#39;t know when they voted against measure I will be voting against
this one was simply the fact that do all that I read says that you have
to take these types of things to the people that they have to have input
and I am just asking you to look at the fact that we have one part of
this that is the referendum and one part that is not that sounds kind of
fishy but it is fishy and I ask you to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to speak briefly a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady is recognized to debate the bill second time.
Thank you. As you can see from the debate on this floor while we
don&#39;t need a participant election of the decision to win this bill
forward was in partition one. That&#39;s unfortunate because Guilford
County includes several parties. People were not included in this
discussion to address this issue in this way, that&#39;s a problem that
should be pretty obvious, we say that representative Harrison mention
three people involved my county 8 times 3 is 24 is 24000 people that
does not.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just
wondering what a Congressional race has to do with this, why that’s
material to this conversation about a local bill regarding the school
board in Guilford County. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Point is taken.
Representative Faircloth, you have further questions? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
No further. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, you have the floor
to continue to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would wonder why the
issue didn’t come up before because when I look around here, there are
probably several other people, but here’s my point. I represent Guilford
County. Representative Hardister, you Representative did not have the
kind of discussion with the Democratic members who represent Guilford
County, this was brought by a partisan group, it is not inclusive, and
you know it was not inclusive. The school board, while they may have
been talked to about what you were going to do, they did not have
sufficient input. It’s a bad bill. I would appreciate you voting no on
it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Everyone
said quite a bit today. I just wanted to reiterate one point that
Representative Adams said. We talked about the bill being partisan. I
just wanted to remind you that less than four weeks ago you passed a
partisan bill for the City of Sanford elections and for the school board
elections. We had signups. And just so you know, this is the most people
signed up for an election that I can remember in my 43 years. We’ve got
primaries in Democrats and Republicans. Partisan elections work. Now I
know the side of the people not knowing about the school board
districts. I’ll make sure you understand that they line up with the
county commissioner districts. So they only need to know who their
county commissioner is, and they know what the school board district’s
going to be. I think it’s a great bill, and I’d ask you to support it
and move forward. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate?
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the House
Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 317. Those in favor will vote Aye.
Those opposed will vote No. The clerk will open the vote. [PAUSE] Clerk
will lock the machine and record the vote. 71 having voted in the
affirmative and 41 in the negative, the bill passes its third reading
and will be engrossed and sent to the Senate. Senate Bill 287, the clerk

CHANGES] I think we had a good vote on this bill yesterday and I would
urge you to vote green again today. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To,
a point of order, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor
to state a point of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Recalling all of the
Asheville bills on the calendar, I’m wondering if this will be the last
Guilford County bill we see today? Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Point is
well taken. Representative Adams, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If I may speak again. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I hope no
one has an objection to it. I do support this bill now, as it has been
amended. I think it’s a win-win. The notices get in the newspaper and
they get on the website so we won’t leave people out. I’d appreciate it
if you would support it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further

explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We had 112
votes for this yesterday. I would appreciate your support again today.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiring of the Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor to [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have an amendment to send
forth but I need to perfect it. At this point, what would the process
be, may I ask that it be displaced at this time, and the new amendment
be prepared? It’s a very [SPEAKER CHANGES] If the bill sponsor does not
mind displacing the bill, it can be temporarily displaced. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, we’ve been trying to work with Representative
Jordan since last night when he first brought forth the amendment. It’s
the opinion of the sponsor and the supporters and the Department of
Revenue that the amendment guts the bill. I’d like to go ahead and have
the opportunity to vote it down, vote the bill and move on. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forth an
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth
an amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Jordan moves to amend the bill on page 1, line 17 by rewriting the lines
to read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan is recognized to debate
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues.
Before the final, the vote we took yesterday, I asked Representative
Brawley about the last lines in his bill, 23 and 24, where it defined
the amount of the tax means the tax imposed before credits and tax
payments, and so what that does is even if you have overpaid taxes that
are due to the Department of Revenue, if you have not filed that report
you’re going to be penalized and it’s my understanding that the concern
of the department is really sales taxes and now the perfecting amendment
would have included excise taxes on alcohol, because those taxes need to
be distributed to local governments. And it’s important right now
without the report, the Department of Revenue does not know where those
funds need to go and they just sit there in the Treasury. But at the
same time, I don’t want to penalize income tax filers and other tax
filers who may have overpaid and given us a tax free, I mean an interest
free loan, why should they be penalized? They need to get that report in
definitely, but I don’t know why we need to take a sledgehammer to take
care of something that really needs a scalpel. So I’d appreciate your
support for the amendment. The perfecting amendment would have been even
better. It does not gut the bill because they told me that sales tax,
and excise taxes were the ones they were after. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Brawley, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As we discussed
last night, no individual tax payer is impacted by this bill. This is
only going to be businesses. It is also only going to apply in cases
where people do not file, and do not request an extension. In situations
where this will apply, and the way it’s written, is where people have
sent in taxes for sales and excise and are not doing the paperwork for
whatever reason. That’s the only way it applies. Representative Jordan
brought me an amendment last night. It was late, I read it, I first
looked at it, thought you know OK this makes sense, it’ll work. I can
support it, but let me run it by the department. I was shocked to find
they don’t work at 11:00 at night like we do, so I gave it to them this
morning. [LAUGH] Their initial response was it doesn’t work. It messes
up the bill and does not achieve what we want to do, it basically guts
the bill. I asked them to send me talking points. The gentleman that is
the, actually the expert is in Charlotte today and we’ve been trying to
get him on the phone. The local folks are working. We are trying to do
as much as we can. But the bottom line is we’ve had a bill that’s gone
through committee in the Senate. It’s been voted. It’s come over. It’s
been through committee here. It’s been voted. It’s had second reading.
It’s been voted. There have been similar attempts to make similar
changes at every step upon the way. There comes a point when you say we
have beat this amendment

So I ask you to defeat the amendment. Let&#39;s vote the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, and Representative
Brawley, I spent some time with last night, and we talked about this
bill and this amendment, and he brought a lot of things to my mind that,
as we look at the 2,000-plus bills this year that comes through here,
that was a considerable concern. I would ask that you would support the
amendment. I was hoping they would work this out so we wouldn&#39;t have
this debate here on the floor. But I have a lot of concerns with the
bill as it is, and I would love to see this amendment take place. I just
don&#39;t want the attack on small businesses. And I can tell you, from
a guy that&#39;s been in a small business, that you get a report from
the Department of Revenue, they don&#39;t tell you next month you
didn&#39;t send the paperwork in right. They tell you next year. They
charge you penalty and interest all the way back, 12 or 16 months. Small
business is the backbone, not only of North Carolina but the United
States. And when you do something that impacts small businesses, it
makes people want to get out of the business, and we feel like we&#39;re
getting hit over the head time and time again by our government. I know
this is not on the amendment, but therefore for now I&#39;d ask you to
vote against this, vote for this amendment, and I&#39;ll come back and
discuss the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, would the gentleman from Lee yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone, you&#39;re referring to failure-to-pay penalties
when there are errors in reports being submitted. Is that correct, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think there&#39;s multiple reasons in this bill, not just one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone, do you yield to a follow up? He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The point being that they are auditing a report you have sent in and
charging you for errors, and this bill addresses you not having sent the
report at all. Is that not correct, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can tell you in my 20 years of dealing with the State Department of
Revenue that we&#39;ve been told we haven&#39;t sent reports in that
we&#39;ve sent in, we&#39;ve been told we didn&#39;t fill out the
reports correctly that we had on file we sent out correctly. There was
times they were right, there was times we were right, but I tell you
what, we always got the bill. You don&#39;t have anyone to fight for you
when you&#39;re a small business. You pay the bill. I&#39;ll tell you
what, it&#39;s cheaper to pay the bill than it is to pay an accountant
$75, $125 an hour to prove you&#39;re right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will concede the gentleman&#39;s point on the small business
friendliness of the Department of Revenue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I move this bill be temporarily displaced. I believe
there&#39;s some valid concerns raised on both sides, but it sounds like
this is one where the parties could probably get together and resolve
this and save a lot of floor time. So I move the bill be temporarily
displaced.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection so ordered. House Bill 725. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee Substitute Number 2 for House Bill 725, a bill to be entitled
an act to establish the Juvenile Jurisdiction Advisory Committee, to
create a pilot civil citation process for juveniles, and to raise the
age of juvenile jurisdiction to include 16- and 17-year-olds who have
committed misdemeanor offenses. The General Assembly of North Carolina

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. I&#39;m bringing forth
before you a bill today that has been studied in numerous ways and
shapes and forms, and has been compromised in many ways and shapes and
forms. What we are proposing to do here is to bring our 16- and
17-year-old misdemeanant juveniles from the adult court system into the
juvenile justice system. The bill is fairly simple although it looks
complicated. And first of all, I&#39;d like you to look at the first
part, where we establish a Juvenile Jurisdiction Advisory Committee. Pay
close attention to the people who make up that committee as I explain
further what this bill will do. There is a pilot in here to look at
civil citation programs across the country. The one most people are
familiar with is the one in Florida, and this is simply a formalized
process of how we take these juveniles into the system, how we treat
them, how we hold them accountable, and then be able to

  <p>portion of the bill that you just explained, is it not coming directly
from a larger landfill bill that was heard by the Senate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don&#39;t know if it is or not.  You talking about Senate Bill 328?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don&#39;t, I quite frankly I&#39;ll be real honest with you.  I
haven&#39;t read Senate Bill 328.  This language was provided when we
had our conference, when they were doing their conference, and we were
asked to look at these, and we picked out the ones that we thought the
House would agree with, and went with those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then it is though, fair to say that this language appeared in the bill
for the first time during conference.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don&#39;t know where it was on the Senate side, quite frankly.
It&#39;s the first time that we&#39;ve seen it here, I think.  But there
was quite a bit of the Senate things in the conference that I hadn&#39;t
seen before.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, inquiry of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe it is true that section 59 of this bill was not in anything
prior to suddenly jumping into the conference bill.  It was not in
dispute.  There was no subject like this in the bill, therefore under
rule 44B, I believe, this being a significant matter, that this needs to
be referred to a standing committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The House be at ease.  Representative McGrady, you are correct that the
House has that rule.  The Senate does not have a similar rule, therefore
the chair would take the position that the bill before us is properly
before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.  Further question of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Coming back to part B, the first portion of this says that the Senate
doesn&#39;t have a similar rule, and it provides for that, but I was
referring actually to the second portion.  If the Senate does not have a
similar rule, which they do not, they just have a germaneness rule, a
conference committee report which includes significant matters that were
not in difference between the houses, shall be referred to a standing
committee.  It would appear, Mr. Speaker, with all deference, that the
first portion of the rule does provide that if the Senate has some
similar rule we do one thing, but the second portion of the rule
provides otherwise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair accepts the gentleman&#39;s argument.  We will go under recess
and we will hear this bill in rules and then bring it back to the floor.
 Ladies and gentlemen, for your planning purposes, we are likely to go
late tonight.  The chair anticipates objection to a third reading of a
bill that we will take up this afternoon.  The chair does not expect to,
because of the anticipated objection, we will have to meet shortly after
midnight, but only to take up the one bill, that, again, if an objection
occurs.  Otherwise the chair has made the decision that we will have
session in the morning at 9am.  But I say that to make you mindful of
the fact that we may be here anyway.  We will honor the gentleman&#39;s
request, and we will have this matter in rules and then back on the
floor.  So, without objection House Bill 74 will be removed from the
calendar and re-referred to the committee on rules.  Is there objection?
 So ordered.
Representative Moore is recognized to sent forth a committee report.
The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, for rules, calendar, and operations of the House,
Senate Bill 380.  Adjust landfill permit fee ??  Favorable House
committee substitute.  Unfavorable is the Senate committee substitute.
