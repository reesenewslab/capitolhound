  Welcome to the meeting of the local government. If you all would please
have a seat. I’d like to welcome the Sergeant at Arms Young Bate, Bill
Morris and Jim Moran. I’d also like to introduce the pages, Drew West
from Buckham County sponsored by Michelle Presnell and Andy duGraw from
Mecklenberg County sponsored by John R. Bradford III. Before I call the
first bill I’d ask Chairman Crawford do you have any comments that you’d
like to make. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We
look forward to these local government committee meetings and helping
everyone out with statewide bills but mostly local bills and getting
things done and moving them as quickly as we can. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The first bill that we will hear is, I’m sorry, can you hear me
now? The mic is on. Can you hear me now? I’ll just talk louder. The
first bill to be heard is House Bill 73, Kerry annexation call,
Representative Dollar. You have the floor, sir. This is a PCS. It was
properly noted by email last night. There’s a motion by George Cleveland
to have the PCS before the committee for consideration. Is there any
objection? Hearing none, the PCS is properly before us. Mr. Dollar, you
may proceed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, as everyone knows we have three methods of annexation, we
have voluntary, involuntary and legislative annexation. In this case we
have the community whose systems are failing. I just got another email
today from a couple, and this is Hollybrook right off of Kildeer Farm
Road in Kerry, it’s just situated right next to Kerry, right beside it
but doesn’t quite qualify for voluntary, excuse me, involuntary
annexation, it doesn’t quite qualify for voluntary annexation, but 85%
of citizens in Hollybrook, it’s all one subdivision, want to be in the
town of Kerry. Their water is bad. When they drink it, it’s a desperate
situation and we, they want to be part of the town of Kerry and the town
of Kerry is willing to and more than interested in taking them in and I
would appreciate your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any questions. Representative Floyd? [SPEAKER CHANGES] At the
appropriate time, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Are there any
other questions by any members of the committee? Hearing none, is there
anybody from the public who would like to speak on this bill. Hearing
none, Representative Floyd, I believe now is the time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, I move for a favorable report for the PCS,
unfavorable to the original. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And there’s also a serial
referral to finance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is
the motion. Is there a second? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Seconded by [??] all
those in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All
those opposed say nay. It passes, thank you very much. The next bill to
be heard will be House Bill 55, Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This bill, it’s sponsored by myself
and Representative Langdon here, Representative Ross as well as
Representative Duane Hall. All this bill does, this is a public, it says
public exhibition of fireworks at NC State. You have, currently you have
the School of the Arts as well as the University of Chapel Hill in
Orange County that are able to exercise under the statutory provisions
in 14-410 certain exhibitions of pyrotechnics. NC State who is, I can
assure you is just as well equipped as the University of North Carolina
wants to do the same thing within the confines of Wake County on their
property so there’s really absolutely nothing new here in this
legislation whatsoever. All this legislation does is simply add to, add
NC State to our existing statute

  That applies to this school and yards and the University of North
Carolina Chapel Hill and again it’s restricted just to Wake County the
same way Chapel Hill is restricted to Orange County, and the public
safety director for NC State would be here today to talk about this but
he’s, unfortunately, he’s under the weather more than I am. I’ll be
happy to answer any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not sure I would
equate NC State with Chapel Hill, but Representative Jeeter, did you
want the floor? [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Farmer-Butterfield?
Representative Faircloth? Representative Boles? [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I
think that’s probably what they’re interested in, the same way you would
do at UNC and Keenan State and.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct. Like I say, in the same
form and fashion and under the same rules and regulations that govern it
at Carolina and at the School of the Arts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further
questions from any member of the committee? Hearing none, is there
anyone from the public who would like to speak on this proposed bill?
Hearing none, Representative Jeeter, I believe now is the appropriate
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If NC State is going to use this at the stadium
after football wins, we won’t have to worry about their use very often.
That being said, I move for a favorable report to House Bill 55.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’ve heard the motion before us. All in favor say
aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed say no. It
passes, thank you very much. Thank you, Representative Dollar. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, thank you and thank the members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Next bill to be heard will be House Bill 43,
Winston-Salem Parking Meters. Representative Terry [??]. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
This is a very simple bill that does nothing except allow us to remain
legal so that we can expand the use or expand the methods by which we
collect parking. The old ordinance gives us permission to use tokens and
coins. We’re now in the 21st century so we want to be able to expand
that to use credit cards and [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So we’d appreciate your support. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions by the members of the committee. Representative Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At the appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Farmer-Butterfield? Any other members who have any
questions? Anyone from the audience who would like to speak on this
proposed bill? Hearing none, Representative Floyd, I believe now is the
appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move for a favorable report on
House Bill 43. It doesn’t have a serial referral. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’ve heard the motion before us, is there any discussion? Hearing
none, all in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All
opposed, no. Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Terry. Next item on the
agenda is House Bill 44, City’s overgrown vegetation notice,
Representative Conrad. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The
title of this bill is pretty self-explanatory. If you’ve been a local
elected official, you know one of the calls you’re going to get on a
regular basis is about overgrown vegetation. The current law allows the
annual notification just to be done by registered or certified mail.
Often the owner or the renter just does not accept receipt or even more
often the house is vacant, someone’s passed away and the heir is not
taking care of it. This would expand it to allow the cities to use
regular mail and also post a notice in a highly visible place on the
property if the regular mail is not received within 10 days, notices
served and therefore they can collect the cost of the, taking care of
the property or put a lien on the property. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there
any questions by any member of the committee? Representative Jeeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Conrad and Mr. Chair. My
question is why 10 days and then let me give you a reason why that’s my
question. Let’s say that I go on a 2 week vacation and I get a, and I
haven’t cut the grass as my wife will tell you I’m infrequent to do. If
I go on a 2 week vacation and I get a letter the second day I’m gone
under this bill if I don’t respond they can send me a regular mail, they
can post it and they can put a lien on my property, correct? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well, I, overgrown vegetation

  I understand your position. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Floyd. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you want to keep it under 15 then I think
this is a good bill because it provides, you know, income for local
vendors, so would you be amenable for the staff to add Cumberland
County. I can’t speak for others. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that in the form
of an amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you wanna
propose an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. If they have an objection
to it then I won’t do it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] Staff. [??] an
amendment. [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can we do the amendment on the floor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to get it out of
the committee but we would be open to amendments on the floor to add as
long as we don’t go above the 15. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, well, follow
up? The staff can add it now and it’d all ready be in there. Which is,
you prefer it on the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd, what
I’d like to do is get it through the committee clean and then there’ll
be other people I’m sure that will approach us and we will happily take
on any other counties as long as we don’t go above that 15 level to keep
it a local bill to help it, expedite it through the process. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I withdraw the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Faircloth [??] . Representative Cleveland. Representative Cleveland, did
you have a question or comment. Representative Brown did you have a
question or comment? Representative Boles? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you
could, you had not only food, purchase of food and supplies could you
elaborate on what you mean supplies? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
[??] okay? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, at times that I can tell you from
just a recent visit to the sheriff’s office in Crowington, there are
times when emergencies happen and the day I was there water was pouring
in through the ceiling in a conference room so that, you know, could be
plumbing or electrical, something like that in a certain case. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does that answer your question or you want further explanation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess that’s not what I wanted to hear. Are these
talking about like copying paper, toiletry items, supplies for, like,
clothing, cleaning? I guess supplies to me opens up whole can of worms
and I’m just, I have, I understand the purchase of food and, but when
you said and supplies for counties’ detention facilities without being
subject to the requirements, I’m just getting to janitorial and
clothing, etc, and I didn’t know if that was what your intent. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Ridell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Representative Boles, the purpose is strictly for food service
and preparation, so it would be any supplies ancillary to delivering
food within a detention facility. Trays, trash bags, napkins, I mean,
just thinks like that. Things that are directly related to delivering
food to the detainees. We’re not looking for an expansive way of getting
around other bidding processes. Their concern and that as expressed by
the county commissioners in the resolution was strictly for the delivery
of high quality, better priced food for the detainees in the facility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And just a comment. I’m not from South Carolina, but I
understand, but you know, the way I read it is for the purchase of food
and supplies and supplies to me is to be interpreted wide open and I
don’t know if we can clarify the title for the purchase of food related
supplies or, and it may not be a big issue. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are there any other questions from anyone on the committee?
Representative Fisher. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m
wondering if it might help if we had the wording changed to say, food
and food related supplies to make it a little more specific because I
think supplies, like you were saying, Representative Boles, sort of
opens the door to any kind of procurement, and then follow up, Mr.
Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may, would you like to prepare an
amendment to that effect? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Would you like staff to be working on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be great, and maybe

  Good morning. You&#39;ve heard a simple bill. This is just a clarifying
bill. I was asked to do this by the clerk to the county commissioners
because people who were having oaths done, like the sheriffs, deputies,
and people who were having to take oaths thought that they had to file
at the clerk of the superior court&#39;s office, and they just wanted it
clarified It already is clarified for the city clerks. It says to file
with the city clerk. This just says to file with the county clerk any
county oaths. That&#39;s all it does. I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions or comments from the board? Representative Fisher?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the appropriate time, mister chairman, I would like to move for
favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other comments or questions?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there anyone in the audience who would like to speak on this proposed
bill? Hearing none, the motion before us, you&#39;ve heard it. Duly

Thank you.

Thank you Representative Hurley. This meeting is adjourned.
