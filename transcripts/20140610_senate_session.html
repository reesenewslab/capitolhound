Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, we deal with so much more than
meets the eye here and we thank you for creating all there is. We thank
you for giving us structures in society to order our lives. All intended
to be agents of your good grace and your good purpose, and Lord I pray
that these structures that we are involved with right now will the power
of the principle here, the power of darkness. No, Lord, we pray against
rebellion. We pray Lord that you will enter in and have your way with
us. May your sovereign grace invisibly bring us back to your proper
place of humility. Underneath your leadership, Lord, and those that need
your corrective voice, refine our sense of being called to something
greater than ourselves. And Lord, give us the power to become agents of
your redemptive work around this state. In Jesus name that we pray,
Amen.

16 consecutive years. And whereas Zebelain, Doyle and Alley passion was

Section 3, the Secretary of the State shall transmit a certified copy of
this resolution to the family of  Zebelain, Doyle and Alley. Section 4,
the resolution is effective upon ratification.
Chairman: Senator Jackson of Mecklenburg is recognized. I’m sorry
Senator Davis of Macon, I apologize.
Senator Davis: Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and gentleman of the
Senate I am honored to serve in the same district in which Zeb served,
and although I have heard of his service, and the legend of Zeb Alley,
before I got here, I never got to meet him or talk to him. I met him one
day in Representative West’s office, and he treated me with extreme
graciousness and friendliness. I thought, because I was from the
mountains, and representing his district, that he was really embracing
me at that time, but what I found out was that Zeb treated everyone that
way. I am sure that there are a lot of stories from those members who
served here while he was an active lobbyist, and I am sure we will here
some of those stories, but as a Senator in the 50th district, I commend
this resolution to you, to honor the icon Zeb Alley. Thank you.
Chairman: Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative Apodaca: To speak on the resolution.
Chairman: You have the floor.
Rep. Apodaka: Thank you Mr. President and members. I too, like Senator
Davis, first met Zeb in Roger West’s office, that was also Zeb’s office
and he would hold court daily. Then, I started going, I know you are
going to find this hard to believe Senator Ruccho, to the cafeteria in
the mornings for oatmeal and, no matter what time I arrived, Zeb was
already there. I was trying to think of a story or a joke that Zeb told
me, but with the kids in the room, I really can’t think of one I can
share. He was always a friend to everyone, and he was a historian, which
we cannot replace in this building. He had been around for so long, and
knew so many things, and was always a good soul, but always a mountain
man. He never forgot where he came from. He would always say, now and
then, that he had a distant relative that was a Republican, but would
not discuss that at family functions. He said that more often as time
went on, especially after 2010. Zeb was a mountain man. He was a good
man, and will be dearly missed – he already is. Thank you.
Chairman: Senator Tilman, for what purpose do you rise?
Rep. Tilman: To speak on the bill.
Chairman: You have the floor.
Rep. Tilman: Let me take it a little further about those morning
meetings down in the cafeteria. Zeb wanted his bacon cooked crispy, and
every morning. Later…</p>

On George’s last days, and he was there up until about two weeks
probably before he couldn’t get out – maybe three. And you have Donny
here, Apodoka here, Harry Brown there, me over here, who did get there
before Zeb, but not much before him. No, we cannot tell the tales that
were told there, but Roger West would join us every now and then and the
stories would really get way out there. Some of Zeb’s favorite times
were those times in the mornings when he could talk about, especially
when he and Roger West and Don East got together up in the mountains at
one time - they had a tremendous amount of fun. You know Zeb spent a lot
of time supporting the military, and he gave us all these flags and was
wanting us to be sure we wore them. He was truly a patriot. He was
involved with former governor Hunt‘s library project over at the
Centennial Campus. They had a lot of things going on, and Zeb was very
gunho about that, and was actively involved in that right up until his
last few days. So, I certainly recommend a resolution Senator Davis and
thank you for doing that.
Chairman: Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
Senator Brown: To speak to the resolution.
Chairman: You have the floor.
Brown: Thank you Mr. President. Senator when you were with Zacharia
those mornings, in the cafeteria we are always entertaining to say the
least – to get your day going. You are right, when you had Roger, Don
and Zeb, getting that conversation going, you never knew what might come
out. One of the things I can remember the most about Zeb is the military
piece. I can remember on several occasions, I would be in Jacksville, at
a military ceremony of some type, and I would look up and there would be
Zeb. He would always go to those events, and they were gratuitis, they
never charged him. I know the Marine Corp Museum was something he had a
passion for in Jacksville and he represented them for no charge. So he
had a passion for that. He gave to the military any way he could to
support them and all their endeavors. I have a vision of Zeb right now,
and I promise you, it is he and Don East having a conversation, and I
bet there will be 20 people in that little circle laughing just as hard
as they can. So I recommend this resolution.
Chairman: Further discussion or debate? Senator Bloom, for what purpose
do you rise?
Senator Bloom: To speak to the resolution.
Chairman: You have the floor.
Bloom: Thank you Mr. President. You know back in ‘81 or ‘82, governor
Hunt brought Zeb over to Raleigh to basically implement his legislative
program, immediately Zeb sought out all us young fellows who had just
gotten here and it was about 15 of us I reckon, and started laying out
what the governor wanted. I commented to one of my colleagues that he
was a sort of strange fellow – he sort of comes at you and assumes you
are going to do and this and that, but that their [xxbellie??]. He ended
up being what I called North Carolina’s great treasures, he was very
involved in the last effort we had to increase the ability to build the
infrastructure of this state, and I remember distinctly in ’83 or ’84,
that Loch [Fairclaugh??] was the Secretary of Transportation, and they
have this idea where Moore headed a committee to put an extra nickel on
gas to build highways – this was before the highway trust fund. That
thing was pretty much dead: couldn’t get the votes out of the committee,
kept being one vote difference and stuff. So, the governor dispensed
Loch to work on some folk, Loch was a democrat then, and Zeb to work on
others, and finally he would bring it out of the finance committee, and
I learned a lot about Zeb’s style of operation, and got to be good
friends with him. He understood people and took the time to make sure
you understood exactly what he was trying to achieve, that he wasn’t
trying to put anything over on you. He respected people and he found
value in everybody with whom he dealt. He was a great traveling
companion. Over a 20 year period, probably 2 or 3 times a year, we
traveled together to different places – legislative events and things of
that nature, and…</p>

South Beach, or New Orleans, or San Diego, or Mexico. The many many
other places. Zeb was always there, always looking out for all the North
Carolinians he could put his hands on, and that he could gather together
without expecting anything in return. I remember distinctly once we were
in New Orleans, I was hanging around on Bourbon Street. I had my
daughter so I was behaving on Bourbon Street. And Zeb had seen this mule
a couple blocks up from where we were. And he sent somebody to come get
me right quick, and I found him after I wandered through the crowd.
Found Zeb and he had followed this mule around. And the mule was named
Aretha. And Zeb said, you won’t believe what this mule can do. Now you
and I are two of the few people in the state who really understand the
virtue of mules. But you won’t understand what this mule could do. So he
says get in this wagon and we’re going to take a ride. And so we got in
the wagon and pulled up to the corner. And the driver said, Aretha,
speak to that guy standing on that corner there. Aretha reached over,
shook her head, and then the guy said Aretha, kiss that fella standing
on that corner. Aretha reached over, kissed the fella standing on the
corner. I said Zeb somewhere or other you must have figured out that you
could pay this guy to do all of this stuff. This can’t be for real. This
mule ain’t doing all of that. But that was just Zeb. He’d find something
that was very interesting and he would seek you out to make sure that
you could get the same experience. Zeb was an interesting guy because he
was very, very smart. But he came on as if he was just one of the old
guys, sort of bumming his way through, but a very great fella. And
again, he knew how to break things down so everybody understood it. And
if you really wanted to know Zeb, and this applied to Democrats,
Republicans, staff, anybody who would come over him, he used to
routinely have hoards of legislators at his house in East Barton. And
the older ones would leave early. Early being nine and ten o’clock. The
younger ones would stay until one or two o’clock in the morning.
Checking their stakes and various other things and listening to Zeb tell
his stories. Some of them funny, some of them very serious. Again, I
think that we sometimes forget that people are multi-dimensional. And we
tend to deal with them in the boxes in which we’re comfortable in
dealing with them. Zeb lived north of the state capitol, more than any
other single individual. The World War II monument, World War I monument
that you see there, Zeb had to fight like all get-out to get that statue
placed on the capitol grounds. Zeb helped lead the effort to restore the
historical chambers, by helping to sell chairs, many people bought
chairs. Members bought chairs that were replicas of the original chairs
in those two chambers. But he was constantly doing civic kinds of
things, in addition to the things that we saw him do over at the
legislature. So he was a great North Carolinian, he contributed
immensely, he was a friend to all, and not just a war hero but a hero in
any dimension or in any respect that you want to think about him. And
I’m proud to have called him a friend. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion or debate. Hearing none, the question before the senate is
the passage of senate joint resolution 879 on its second reading. All in
favor will vote aye. All opposed will no. Five seconds will be allowed
for voting. The clerk will record the vote. 50 having voted in the
affirmative and none in the negative. Senate joint resolution 879 passes
its second reading and without objection will be read a third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] North Carolina general assembly enacts. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is there further discussion or debate? Hearing none, all in
favor of the passage of senate joint resolution 879 in its third reading
will stand and say aye. All opposed no. The ayes have it, and senate
joint resolution 879 passes its third reading and will be sent to the
house by special messenger. Members you can have a seat now. I just
wanted to add a little bit to the discussion. Zeb loved a lot of things.
But I don’t think he loved anything more than he loved veterans. And Zeb

One you could always count on to look after the interests of our
veterans and any veterans that happen to find a way into North Carolina
or particularly into the Legislative building. And I can remember, many
times, having meetings with Zeb and a group of veterans and always,
always, Zeb was the chief and primary spokesperson for all those
veterans. And not withstanding the fact that veterans have a special
place in the hearts of many, I would say that in the heart of Zeb they
were, they were clearly number one. So we are proud in the Senate to
count him as a former member.  And we are proud to have seen him as our
colleague and our friend for a long period of time. Members we have a
number of people in the gallery and on the motion of Senator Jim Davis
of Macon County, the Chair is happy to extend courtesies to the family
of former Senator Zeb Alley. And as I call your name if you would please
stand. Doyle Alley, the 2nd, Randall Alley, Anne Hoover-Alley, Charley
Alley, Kathy Alley, Chip Killian, Dr. Dale Hover, and Miranda Alley.
These are members of Zeb's family who are here and members I would ask
that you recognize them.

who’ve been here have seen every year all the ladies walking around in
red, especially Senator Apodaca; he’s nodding his head. So if you will…
they’re from your districts, they’re from all over the state, there are
thousands of them – you’ll only see a few hundred tomorrow – so we’d
appreciate if you would see them, talk to them regarding the issues they
have, and tomorrow they’re certainly… We’ve invited Senator Berger to

business will not be conducted until later in the day at 2 o’clock. Is
that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
With that clarification, the motion is that the senate do now adjourn,

favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. The
