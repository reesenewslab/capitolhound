  <p id="00:00">
  Well, good afternoon.  Want to go ahead and we start--we were gonna
start at 12:00 but we’re about two minutes behind, so I want to be
respectful of everyone’s time.  My name is Rodney Moore.  I represent
the 99th district from Mecklenburg County.  A few minutes ago we filed
House Bill 193, which the bill prohibits discriminatory practices by law
enforcement officials.  It also compels law enforcement agencies to give
their new hires, their new officers diversity training, cultural
diversity training.
It also seeks to capture data for traffic stops, homicide data, so in
instances or claims of racial bias by the police, we can either prove or
dispel those accusations through data.  And so that’s just some of the
highlights of the bill.  I really have a lot of great partners here.
And first of all, let me recognize my primary sponsors with me on the
bill, Rep. Jean Farmer Butterfield, Rep. Cecil Brockman, Rep. Craig, I’m
not gonna--Graig, Graig Meyer, I’m already--from Orange County.
And so this is a, this is a great first step, I think.  And having, and
having the conversation about how police, how our law enforcement
agencies interact with our communities of color, with the community as a
whole, as you know, there have been instances across the nation where
there’s been some questionable action as it relates to police and
homicides for men of color.
And so what we strive to do with this particular bill is to have this
conversation initially in NC and come up with some ways that we can
start to rebuild the public trust with our law enforcement agencies, and
have an open and fair dialogue, and have a way that we can  hold people
accountable for misdeeds.
And so that’s the long and short of the bill.  And so right now I’d like
to have any of my prime sponsors who would like to say a few words, one
to two minutes, I have to emphasize that, because I’m sure there may be
some questions, and we want to have as much time for questions as
possible.
So if there’s any of my co-prime sponsors or cosponsors that want to,
please be one to two minutes, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Rep. Moore.  My constituents asked that I sign onto this bill
as a primary sponsor in Pitt County.  Recently they had a forum where
they had the faith-based community, they had law enforcement and they
actually had an individual who had been racially profiled at that panel.
 And during that discussion, but the main thing I hear was they wanted
fairness and justice, and they wanted people to be treated the same.
And they want someone to be kind of a watchdog to oversee and make sure
that people were treated equally as it deals in relation to the law,
basically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hey, I’m Cecil Brockman.  I just want to say thank you to Rep. Rodney
Moore for his leadership on this bill.  As a young African-American of
color, this bill affects me personally.  I’ve had, unfortunately,
instances where I’ve had dealings with law enforcement, where I didn’t
necessarily agree with why I was pulled over and stopped.  And I think a
lot of members in the African American community have had the same you
know, experience.  And so I think this bill ias a great bill to try to
fix that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m Graig Meyer from House District 50, Orange and Durham Counties.  I’m
happy to sponsor this bill really in honor of all the families that I
spent 16 years working with in the schools before I entered the
legislature, and thinking about the many, many times I listened to
mothers and fathers talk about the tough lessons that they had to teach
to their children about interacting with law enforcement...and the great
amount of pain that those parents felt when they didn’t feel like...

  System of justice was protecting their children and working in their
best interest. We know that this nation needs a sustained dialogue about
trust between our law enforcement system and our communities of color.
We hope that this bill will help to promote that dialogue and ensure
that our citizens fell like the legislature is here to ensure that the
balances of the scales of justice are set equally and they have the
chance to have their voices and their experiences represented in the
process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Meyer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We
have some, let me acknowledge some partners that have been very helpful
in the formation of this bill. I’d like to recognize Sarah Preston from
the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, the Southern
Coalition for Social Justice, Mr. Collins which you will hear from
briefly, and also I’d like to thank the North Carolina Justice Center
and now I will introduce the chair of the Legislative Black Caucus,
Representative Garland Pierce from [??] North Carolina and thank you for
your participation Representative Pierce. It’s very important that the
Legislative Black Caucus really gets behind this. I appreciate your
support and you have three minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. State
Representative Garland Pierce in House District 48. We’re delighted as
the Legislative Black Caucus to share with Representative Moore on this
very important piece of legislation. We have talked to the leadership
about it and one of our concerns and one of our agenda items when we
talk to the House leader and the Senate leader as something that we
really want to push forward. I think the President said it well in Selma
that we still have a ways to go. We’re not there yet. So we would hope
with this bill that, I think law enforcement is somewhat I would say
they have some sensitivity to it and I think it’s something that we
should continue to have this conversation about profiling and I think
for different reasons no doubt they see young black males in a light
that’s just not favorable at this present time and I think that more
that we share with them and the more that they become sensitized or
trained that everybody who looks like a person of color is not a person
that’s trying to get into something that they should not be doing, so I
would ask that we have the continued support of all of our colleagues
across the aisle as Representative Moore makes every attempt to move
this legislation forward that we all rally with him because it’ll
protect all of our boys because I think what’s constant is a great
example of how things, the more we talk about it, the more it is
revealed on TVs that it’s still going on. So we need to have a serious
conversation and dialogue and I hope our representative ever success
that he’s able to move this legislation and we continue to have this
conversation because too many young men’s lives are being destroyed, too
many young men’s lives are being taken and too many ending up in the
court system based on the way that they look, where they come from and
we really need to stop that and I hope we can work together as this body
to improve this whole situation about profiling, and I just believe that
we will. I think North Carolina’s ready for it and I think we have the
drive to do it. Thank you, Representative. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Michaux, would you like to say a few words? It’s your
option. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. This is a subject that really needs
no introduction to anybody, particularly those of us of color because
many of us have in the past been profiled. I’m reminded sort of the
ideas that have been put into people’s minds. For instance, everything
black is not evil, right, is evil, everything black is evil. I’ll give
you an example, when we were growing up we were given fables and stories
and what not, and you take the story of the ugly duckling. At one time
he was a black ugly duckling and what happened to him was he turned into
a beautiful white swan, and when you look at King Arthur and the knights
of the round table, the black knight at the round table was the evil
knight. The black sheep of the family. Everything was evil. Well, what
this bill does is gonna make people understand that black is not evil.
That it takes both the black keys and the white keys on a piano to make
harmonies. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well said. I couldn’t have said it better.

  Strength, strength leads to character and character leads to victory and
so right now I see someone I must acknowledge, our Chair of the North
Carolina Democratic Party, Miss Keever, thank you for coming. Would you
very quickly like to give a few remarks or are you? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
think I’m here in support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, God bless you.
God bless you. God bless you. Okay, now since we’ve got all the
particulars out are there any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can’t
remember if you said this before but have you had dialogue with the
Sheriff’s Association or other law enforcement groups and if so were
they. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, we’ve had some dialogue initially with the
sheriff’s groups. Haven’t had the opportunity to sit down with the FOP,
Fraternal Order of Police or the PVA. I have reached out to the North
State Officer’s Association and so this, as we go along, once this bill
is filed, this bill is filed now so as we go along I welcome those
conversations with the Sheriff’s Association and all law enforcement
representatives. I think that for this bill to be successful that we’re
gonna need dialogue from both sides and as I said it’s gonna be a tough
conversation but the conversation needs to be had because we are losing
lives, lives are being affected in a very negative way because of the
misconceptions that some have in law enforcement as it relates to
communities of color and other groups of people, so I look forward to
that conversation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And how is it going so far? I think
you mentioned some dialogue with the Sheriff’s Association. What’s your
understanding so far? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I think they’re in a wait
and see mode. I think now that we have the bill out and it’s filed, I
think now is the time we can really go out and go into the intricacies
of the bill and go out and have a great dialogue from that, so I’m
looking forward to that. Hopefully we can set up some meetings with
those representatives and kind of see where they shake out on the bill
and try to make a way so that we can be respectful of everybody’s
opinion but also put good policy in place. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You said
you hope to rebuild public trust. What is the state of that public trust
right now then? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, the state of public trust as it
relates to law enforcement and I can say particularly the African
American community has always been a very strained relationship. I think
you have some instances, just last Friday you had a young man in
Milwaukee who was shot by law enforcement. You actually had a young lady
most recently in Charlotte, NC who was shot and killed by CMPD officer
and the young lady had a knife. She had a knife, she didn’t have a gun
and he could’ve tazed her. And we have to look at these attitudes. We
have to correct these attitudes and have more dialogue as it relates to
our way of dealing or interacting with the police and their way. So I
think that the public trust right now is strained. Very strained.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What sort of feedback have you gotten from your
republican colleagues when this was proposed? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I
think about my republican colleagues. We’ve talked, I’ve talked to, and
let me say I’ve talked to leadership about this issue and they were in
wait and see mode just like everyone else and so now hopefully we can
start to have a dialogue. I’m interested to see where this bill will be
placed and what committee it will be placed in and depending on what
committee it will be placed in we will start reaching out to that
committee chair and speaker’s office and see if we can, whatever
revisions we need to make. My goal is to get this bill signed into law.
That’s my goal and so I know we have a long way to go, but I think, I
know it’s not impossible to do, I know it’s not impossible, but we’re
going to have some dialogue and we’re going to have some disagreements,
but I think that we can all come together and we can at least agree on
that racial profiling or profiling by any, for any, any, anything is not
acceptable in North Carolina. So I think we can all agree on that, we
just maybe have differences on how we can achieve it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we gave him a chance on that, but I guess I could easily see
republican leaders saying yeah, we agree that racial profiling or any
sort of profiling is wrong but it’s just a question of whether we need
new laws

  <p id="20:00">
  I&#39;ve heard some people say that the construction and case law
already says that discriminatory profiling is discriminatory and
illegal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No I&#39;m just saying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I understand. What I stated is that you know there are provisions
in the constitution but are they being enforced? And by what I
understand and the tone of what&#39;s happening out in the community,
clearly you have laws on the books but it&#39;s not being enforced. So I
guess this would be a friendly reminder if you will that we need to
really enforce our laws with fairness and equity. And so that&#39;s what
I would say there again it&#39;s an ongoing conversation. Patrick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So in the bill it prohibits discriminary discriminatory profiling if I
remember it correctly there&#39;s no punishment laid out in the law if
somebody does that. How do you envision say some police officer does
something like happened in Cleveland or New York how do you envision
this bill working to make the process work better here compared to maybe
how it has in Ferguson or New York?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I mean
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right well I think that with this particular bill this basically serves
as a template. It&#39;s like a guiding document. Now, once we get this
law enacted then we may have to go through possibly understanding from a
judiciary point what the penalties how do we hold people accountable.
But my intention for this particular bill was to get it in place try to
put something in place you know we have more work to do but that&#39;s a
great question and, yes you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me get back to Gary&#39;s point, Gary you make a good point but just
remember right now in our state constitution it says it deals with the
qualification for voting and what did we do with house bill five eighty
nine last year try to add more qualifications for voting. We have in our
United States constitution even though it&#39;s illegal under the
fourteenth fifteenth amendment we still have statements in there stating
that black folks are three fifths of a person. So you&#39;ve got all of
these things written in the law but whether or not they, this bill so
it&#39;s there we&#39;ve got the protections there but we don&#39;t
we&#39;re not enforcing them we&#39;re not doing what we need to do with
what&#39;s there, this adds to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In Fayetteville several times over the past several years they&#39;ve
attempted to get a police review board bill through just for
Fayetteville and it&#39;s generated huge opposition from law enforcement
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What are you going to do if you get that this time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, what this bill actually has a provision that it talks about
citizens review boards what I&#39;ve seen the issue is that every time a
municipality wants to institute a review board they have to come like
you said a city specific or municipality specific. This bill will
empower cities or municipalities if they want to have a citizens review
board it&#39;s not mandatory that they establish a citizens review board
let me make that clear, but if they have the will at least they
won&#39;t have to keep coming back to the general assembly to ask for a
review board in Willmington or Charlotte or wherever. This would be a
blanket approval for them to go forward with their process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question this bill might get opposition because of that provision
from the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it&#39;s already gettin opposition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What are you going to do about that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We are going to sit at the table we&#39;re going to talk about it
we&#39;re going to come up with a solution that fits both. One of the
things that I&#39;m very aware of is that people will instantly,
instantly oppose a bill that they haven&#39;t seen. So now the bill is
out here let&#39;s go to the table we know we have differences, but
let&#39;s sit down and talk about it and come up with a workable
solution. So there again I look forward to those conversations with
whoever is opposed or would be opposed to implementations of citizens
review board. Okay, very quickly let me give reverend Nelson Johnson
from Greensboro two minutes to he&#39;s one of the people

  <p id="25:00">
  First of all, thank you. Sorry about being late. I’m so grateful that
Representative Moore has brought this bill forward and one way to think
of it is at the end of the day citizens actually have to run our
government. This bill provides tools that are useful to citizens and
there is almost an inherent push back to greater oversight. Nothing new
about that, but that’s absolutely important and it’s especially
important to those agencies that are empowered to take life, protect
life, imprison people, so I think we need to embrace the spirit of this
and that gives us what we need to work through the particularities of it
and I want to say that oversight is important and Ferguson provides a
little bit of a window into a moment. You can’t generalize it but you
can’t make it specific only to Ferguson. You have to assume that this is
happening all over the nation to greater and lesser degrees and so I
think we ought to embrace this. We’re gonna go back and work in
Greensboro to support it, we’re gonna reach out to other cities around
the state to support it. It is time. We don’t have to wait for more
imprisonments, more deaths. It’s time to do it. It’s the right thing to
do, it’s the moral thing to do and it’s overdue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that Representative Floyd wanted to
speak. I think he had some background on your question about Fayeteville
very quickly, thanks. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you so much. What this
bill provides and the reason why I came on board because of that portion
of the bill, timing is everything, you know, within the text of a bill
there. If it’s a short session they say that if you have all members on
board it’s easier to push through pieces of legislation. Now, if you
don’t then it’s very difficult. This allows, I mean this empowers to a
simply majority vote of the members of that particular board, maybe a
county board or commission or a city council to establish a review board
by simply not using the text that it takes a majority of the members to
put forward. This is why I came on board supporting the bill because it
gives local municipalities simply a majority. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. Thank you, Representative Floyd. Are there any other questions?
Seeing none, thank you for coming and appreciate and we will look
forward to speaking with you further about this piece of legislation.
Thank you very much.
