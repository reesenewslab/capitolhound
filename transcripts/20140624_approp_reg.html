<p id="000:00">
Good Morning. A quorum being present, the House Committee on Regulatory
Reform is now in session. I want to thank our Sergeants at Arms today,
Young Bae, Bob Rossi, Doug Harris, Carl Morello, Bill Morris and B. H.
Powell. And, we have a full complement of pages to help us, Calex
Anderson from Iredell County, Dana Arbeleaz from Wake, Adam Bonfield
from Burke, Alex Casey from Wake, Greg Cullock from Johnston, Jennings
Dixon from Chatham, Olivia DuBose from Forsyth, Josiah Evans from
Johnston and Kevin Gauche from Mecklenburg. I'm sure I've mangled
several of those names and I give you my apologies. The bill that we
heard last week is back, it has been bifurcated. We now have two bills:
Senate Bill Four Ninety-Three (493) has been reduced to the Health and
Safety Regulations only, Senate Bill Seven Thirty-Four (734) has been
turned into all of the other elements of the Regulatory Reform Act of
Twenty Fourteen (2014). Representative Murray is recognized to send
forth a motion that the PCS for Four Nighty-Three (493) be in front of
us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I make a motion that the PCS for Senate Bill Four
Nighty Three (493) be properly before the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Seconded by a Representative Jordan. All in favor say,
&quot;Aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed? Alright, before we start, I did want to say,
we,  Amy Jo Johnston? Raise your hand. And, Erica Churchill are going to
be the designated amendment drafters. If you do not yet have your
amendment drafted, please go to these two and they will either help get
it drafted or draft it for you. The remainder of our staff today, of
course, Karen Cochran-Brown, the indefatigable. Okay, What? Let's go
ahead and go, we've only got three hours. Representative Murray is
recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you members of the
committee.  This part of the regulatory reform package is, deals with
health and safety regulatory reform. In Section One point A (1.A), we
have the sum and substance of House Bill Four Ninety-Eight (498) which
passed the House in the long session last year, and Section Two (2),
complementary to the autism insurance coverage piece is a behavioral
analyst licensure for family, for people who represent, if you represent
an area that includes a military base, you are fairly familiar with the
behavioral analyst licensure issue coverage through Tricare. So, this
helps mitigate that. There's been changes to the Pharmacy Benefits
Management Regulations Section from the Bill that we heard last week,
last Wednesday, in consultation with the Department of Insurance. We're
going to study a couple of major issues dealing with incentives provided
to patients, as well as disclosure of patient information, the crux of
which remains, deals with, price updates for maximum allowable costs, as
well as definitions. I expect some further tweaks to this section, but
we are closer than we were a week ago on the proper definition and
coverage for allowing for price updates for maximum allowable cost
prices.  Section Four (4) deals with limited food services at lodging
facilities. If you've ever stayed at a Holiday Inn Express, you see the,
or a similar hotel they've got prepackaged food, pre-warmed food. You
shouldn't have to have a full-blown restaurant regulatory framework in
order for somebody to be able to warm up a bagel and that's what this
deals with. Section Five (5) is House Bill, I think it's House Bill Ten
(10) that passed the House in the long session. It deals with youth skin
cancer protection. Anybody over eighteen (18) using, it prohibits
anybody under the age of eighteen (18) from using a tanning bed. Section
Six (6) is a nursing home administrator act provision. Representative
Dahler brought this forward. That helps, actually I'm sorry, this is a
provision that was brought forward by Representative Arp. The Nursing
Home Administrator Act refers to a licensing exam administered by the
board. The exam is actually administered by a national body, so this ??</p>

<p id="005:00">
... the Nursing Home Administrator Act to clarify that to make sure that
the test referred to is actually administered by the national body and
not the board. Section 7 is reports, is a report on the subsidized Early
Education for Kids System before it can be rolled out statewide, we're
requiring that the Department of Health and Human Services in the
Division of Child Development and Early Education to report back to the
Joint Legislative Committee for Health and Human Services before it gets
rolled out statewide. Section 8 deals with conflicts of interest
provisions on hospital mergers. Representative Daughtry brought this
forward and I haven't heard over the past week any concerns on this
particular provision. Section 9 deals with multiplicative auditing and
monitoring a certain service providers. If you are accredited by a
national agency, and that comes with an audit then we are going to limit
the number of audits that can be performed by the state. Section 10 ends
a sunset for facilities that use alternative electronic marketing
systems. This is a provision that was brought froward by Representative
Dollar. Section 11 state Medicaid re-credentialing period. The Feds
require a maximum of re-credentialing every five years and we're
changing state law to go the maximum from three to five years. Section
12 is and amendment that was added in committee last week about the use
of spring water at coal located restaurants. That makes me thirsty just
reading this title. Representative Stan brought this amendment forward.
Section 13 deals with amendment to how animal euthanasia technicians
correctly calculate chemical agents for animal euthanasia.
Representative McElraft brought this provision forward. And then we have
the Section 14 severability clause. And  with that Mr. Chairman I'd like
to answer any questions about any of these provisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are there any questions for the bill sponsored on a macro level?
Representative Harrison?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair and Representative Murray, I apologize I missed last
weeks meeting because of a conflict. Do you mind just briefly explaining
on the pharmacy benefits regulation. Who is covered by that change cause
you said you made some tweaks to it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's right. That's going to be plans that are regulated by the
Department of Insurance would have to update their maximum allowable
costs pricing consistent with Medicare Part D. There's a CMS final rule
that requires a price update and disclosure of pricing every seven days
and this seeks to mimic that. There are additional provisions that we're
asking the Department of Insurance and the North Carolina Board of
Pharmacy to jointly study on what's happening on a national level and
come back with recommendations to the general assembly. But this is
limited to trying to be consistent with how Medicare Part D operates and
have regular maximum allowable cost price updates. Maximum allowable
costs is the maximum the pharmacy can be reimbursed. It changes rapidly
and so we just want to make sure it's on a regular update to make sure
that when the prices go up it helps the patients, or helps the prices go
down it helps as well. So, it;s just making sure we have a stable price
update system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up? Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. My question I guess, I've got two questions. One,
this only impact the people who are insured? It's not going to affect
the people who are not insured in any way? It doesn't regulate their
price in anyway?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, maximum allowable cost price update is a way to calculate drug
pricing for reimbursement to pharmacies. It doesn't effect patient
co-pays. It basically is a way to have a regular price updates
consistent with Medicare Part D.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I guess that raises the question. Why did we pick Medicare Part D?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Medicare Part D is something that's not regulated by the state and at
the federal level centers for Medicare and Medicaid services recently
issued a final rule requiring Medicare Part D plans to update their
prices every seven days. What we're trying to do here is make sure that
state regulated plans operate in the same fashion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another follow up, please? Thank you. Is this going to have an impact on
their health insurance costs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're talking about state health plan?</p>

<p id="010:00">
Well any of the health plans, how is it going to affect those health
costs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Drug prices go up, drug prices go down. We just want to make sure we
have regular updates and that's the goal here, to make sure we have
stability in how price updates occur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale is recognized to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question on that same bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. The lady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you,  my question is does this apply to all self-insured to the
ERISA plans too?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would only apply to plans that are subject to regulation by the
Department of Insurance and so I would think it would be actually
non-ERISA plans that would be subject to this regulation, not ERISA
plans. I think it's the other way around. ERISA, I believe, the way I
interpret ERISA, I think ERISA prohibits the state from regulating those
insurance plans.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The sergeants at arms have informed me they have set up a remote
location where it can be, this committee can be viewed on WRAL in room
421 for those of you that would rather sit comfortably somewhere else.
Representative Cunningham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Section 1 for the autism health insurance, how did
we come up-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham, I was going to let the pharmacy thing finish
and then start going through the amendments. If this is, if you aren't,
if you got another question about the pharmacy thing-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. I'll wait.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you, because we're going to discuss the pharmacy very well.
I know there's going to be two or three amendments about that.
Representative Speciale is recognized to send forth an amendment,
ATK-132, the gentleman is recognized to explain his amendment.
Representative, yeah okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This amendment changes, makes some changes to the tanning portion and
basically what it does it says the operator should not allow a person
under 18 to use it without a written prescription from the medical
physician or written consent of the parent or guardian. We're stepping
in an area, again, where we're taking away parental authority. If you
say they can't do it until they're 18 and they're determined to get a
tan, they're going to spend a lot more time out in the sun. They're
going to get that tan if that's what they want to get. So let's, as a
State Government, let's just back off the parents, let them do their
jobs, and let them decide whether or not they want to give their kid
permission to go to a tanning booth. Let's just leave it like it is but
ensure that they have parental consent, simple as that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry. Okay, Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I'd opposed the amendment. The underlying provision passed the
House about 5-1 last year. We don't have any reason from the Senate why
they haven't taken it up. Since then the major people who were lobbying
against it dropped their opposition and let's just examine the nature of
this amendment. Basically it's saying you can do whatever you want with
parental consent on this and think about 15-year-olds and remember that
the medical evidence is that people are dying, even in their 30's, from
this tanning bed use they did when they were 15. Alright, you have two
15-year-olds, is the argument that 15-year-olds should be able to smoke
cigarettes with their parental consent? No. Is the argument that you
ought to let 15-year-olds drink whiskey if their parents give it to
them? No. Is the argument that if two 15-year-olds want to have sex with
each other if they have their parentals, parents consent, that that
should be allowed? No. For centuries the law has protected minors from
abuse, neglect, and their own inexperience. We now know that this use of
tanning beds severely harms them in their future and the parents consent
or not makes no difference.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale is recognized to debate the amendment a second
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was a terrible analogy there. The bottom line here is we have a
sun. The sun does the same thing that the tanning booth does. If the
kids want it they're going to get it. Let their parents make the
decision like the parents should be making decision. If not, then I'd
like to put an amendment that we outlaw forks because kids are stabbing
each other with forks as well. I'd also like to put in amendments for a
bunch of other things that kids are doing. We can't regulate everybody</p>

<p id="015:00">
behavior, and again, the key here is there is a sun that does the same
thing as a tanning booth. So why are we getting involved? Why is the
General Assembly involved in something like this? Leave it up to the
parents. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dobson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to speak in favor of the amendment and
I appreciate Representative Speciale bringing it forward. This is a key
provision, to me, in this bill that talks about what the role of
government is and is it the role of government to make decisions that
should be left between a parent and their child? And I don't think that
it is. I think this is an issue that, with the written consent of the
parent, that this is a good amendment and it just philosophically comes
down to the role of government. I don't believe we should be getting in
to these issues that should be left between a parent and the child. So I
would strongly urge you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Robert Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Stam a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd be glad to yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, is there anything in this bill that would make it
illegal for that child to get  a suntan either in the sun or in a
tanning booth at home?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's really not a question to me. Obviously there's nothing in the
bill that relates to that, Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. If I might speak on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman's recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The parents are going to control the issue anyway so why not go ahead
and let them control the issue. As Representative Stam's acknowledged
that there's nothing in this bill that if the parents want to allow
their child to get a suntan their going to do it. So I support the
amendment, encourage you to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate? Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and as much as I sympathize with the argument
of the amendment sponsor and the others been mentioned I am very
protective when it comes to parental authority and very hesitant to see
government intrude on that. However, I agree with Representative Stam's
argument. We heard this bill in Health and Human Services and I don't
think that it's proper to equate a commercial tanning booth to the sun.
I think there's a lot more intensity that comes with a tanning booth. I
do think that there is a role of government when it comes to protecting
minors, as Representative Stam said, and the same argument occurred to
me. That is, as protective as I am about parental authority, I don't
think that the role of the parent, for instance, should be to allow
alcohol purchase, to allow cigarette purchase. There are certain things
where it is very clear that it is harmful for the individual and so on
this one I'm going to have to come down against the amendment and for
the bill, which did pass this House by a vote of 94 to 22 in its current
form. I think it is best to leave it alone and I would oppose the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, we're going to continue to debate on this but I do want to warn
the committee in three hours we're going to do both of these bills and
probably 20 amendments and we got to pass them out today. So,
Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I might think you'd find it interesting that
the sun has actually been declared a carcinogen. That's how far we're
going with some of our protection of people. It's getting to the point
that we're not going to be allowed to use our common sense in running
our own personal lives and the tanning bed industry is highly regulated.
As a matter of fact there's a move out now to possibly move it to a
different level of intensity, or whatever, in terms of licensing it, the
type of instructions that go along with someone who's going to tan. We
heard a lot of people in white coats, who I respect a great deal, speak
emotionally about an issue. Melanoma, which was their chosen cancer to
go against, is a deadly cancer but it's not proven, scientifically or
medically, that it's just suntanning that does it. There's a hereditary
link that's in there as well and I think when we start to meddling in
controlling everything that people do that we need to consider common
sense and giving them directions with the right kind of knowledge to run
their own lives.</p>

<p id="020:00">
Okay, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chris Millis, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, this is to add some more salt and pepper to this
issue but not repeat what has already been said. I fully support Rep.
Avila as well as Rep. Dobson so comments, this goes back to the role of
government. It is one thing for us to inform individuals in regard to
health and safety. It is one thing to actually have regulations, to
actually help inform citizens on guidance but is another, under the
guise of regulatory reform, to forbid. The current language actually
forbid- I actually support this ammendment and I hope you guys will very
carefully and prudently think about what our role is here as individuals
and allow of course, the parents to actually have the proper consent-
guardianship over their own children. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there someone here from the tanning industry that would like to speak
on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the pleasure of the chair, Rep. Brawley, we debated this bill on the
House floor extensively and it passed 94 to 22, so I would respectfully
ask that you call for the vote and let's move on because we've got some
other stuff to do..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I've got two people, Sarah Stevens and Skip Stam[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Skip, wave off.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would just point out we had last year, when we passed this 94 to 22, a
new meta analysis which is like a study of all the studies, which showed
a significantly higher risk for melanoma from those who had these
tanning beds in their teens. I mean we can't just shut our eyes to the
facts- defeat the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. So many as favor the ammendment by Rep. Speciale say
&quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, &quot;no&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm gonna call for a division. Raise hands if you're in favor of the
ammendment.
Thank you, put your hands down. Opposed, raise your hand.
Thank you. Twenty-one in favor, twenty-nine opposed. The ammendment
fails.
Rep. Horn is recognized to send forth an ammendment, &quot;Interstate
Connectivity of Controlled Substances Reporting System ATK 135 version
1. Rep. Horn, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This ammendment allows, or actually directs
North Carolina to participate in interstate connectivity. Presently 41
North Carolina counties abut another state. Controlled substance use is
a significant problem, we passed a controlled substance reporting bill
last year, but we don't bother to interconnect with our adjacent state
so that we can ensure that folks are playing by the rules, so to speak.
A number of counties have seen a significant surge in prescriptions
being filled in their counties, and which are also being filled in the
county across the state line. So this allows North Carolina to join the
National Association of Wards of Pharmacy for their PMP connect to
rapidly begin sharing controlled substance prescription data with
actually 25 other states. I urge you to support the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a good ammendment, Mr. Chairman, and I believe this is the
contents of an additional bill that has been filed. Has that come up
from- I want to ask Rep. Horn a question: The bill hasn't been heard yet
in this session but it was a recommendation from a oversight committee
in the interim, or my recollection is that this has been discussed or
this is a bill that has been filed and I'm glad Rep. Horn has brought it
forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Discussion or debate?
Question before the committee is the adoption of Rep. Horn's ammendment
ATK 135. So many as favor the ammendment say &quot;aye.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, &quot;no&quot;?
The ammendment carries. Rep. Larry Hall

<p id="025:00">
Is recognized to send forth an amendment, Pharmacy Benefits Management
Study. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, thank you, Mr. Chairman. This
amendment would take an issue that is partially being studied and
partially being debated and is something new that creates apparently
several different classes of rights for. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair,
could we hold just a minute? I'm not even sure what area, we don't have
the amendment yet, I'm not sure what area he's modifying. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Apologize, we'll hold for just a moment. I apologize,
Representative Stevens, it was my understanding that it had been, but.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And Representative Hall, I didn't mean any disrespect.
I was just trying to figure out where you were. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
everyone have the amendment ATC139 version one, excuse me, that's ATK139
version two. Is there anyone lacking the amendment, please hold your
hands up. Representative Hall is recognized to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and again this is an
amendment that turns this section of the bill into a study so we can get
the proper information we need and insure the impact of it. A lot of
consternation among people who are in the industry about this and
exactly some of the definitions and how it would apply, and so it
appears we're not really ready to move forward on this and don't have
all the information we need to satisfy the parties and ensure fair
competition between the providers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Murry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. This language is
incomplete because there's nobody at the Department of Insurance with
any pharmacy expertise at this point, and so I don't know how they'd
conduct this study alone, and so what we've done in the bill the PCS
sets before you, we've had a significant portion of the bill, of this
section in consultation with the North Carolina Board of Pharmacy, so
I'd ask members to oppose this amendment because it is one, incomplete
and two, the Department of Insurance could not conduct this study alone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there anyone from the Department of Insurance here?
OK. Further discussion, further debate. Do you want to address it? Or
not? Please go to the microphone and identify yourself. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm Rose Vaughn-Williams, I'm legislative
counsel to the Department of Insurance. I've not seen the new PCS or the
amendment, but I'm listening. We don't regulate pharmacy benefit
managers, and I appreciate the original idea of being changed to a study
to look at that. Our usual regulation is insurance and insurance
entities and their effect on consumers instead of business entities like
pharmacies. This would be something new to us to do and to learn how to
implement. So that I could say, I could answer. I'll do my best.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Other questions? Representative Stevens? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think, my question, and I realize that
Representative Murry has a lot of expertise in this area, but I don't
think that the rest of us understand it well enough to feel comfortable
proceeding at this point, which is why I would be more in favor of a
study, but I will have to vote no on this amendment because it doesn't
apparently target the right people. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm working with
?? on this provision and I expect resolution by tomorrow. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Then I'll withdraw the amendment based on Representative
Murry's comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And Representative Hall, I will
gladly have you involved in that conversation to get your level
comparability up as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative.

Speaker Changes: I just want to thank her for that clarification ,
Speaker Changes: Further and further debate,
Speaker Changes: Representative ?? and Representative Shepperd and
order,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.chairman just have a question about
physical impact on this provision to be have any kind of idea of the
fact that this is gonna cause anyone ,
Speaker Changes: Representative ?? the original bill that you have seen
before did have a physical impact because the sate health plan was in it
involved the state health plan just offered it's benefit on their
involution and so this bill as along as covers state health plans ,so in
terms of physical impact to the state that has been removed ,
Speaker Changes: Thank you,
Speaker Changes: Representative Shepperd,
Speaker Changes: Mr.Chairman just to make a comment,some of these
children in the early ages have not get the care  ?? they have needed so
sometime the lady giving the care if they are treated a little early at
an early age you see a lot of positive results from them with send some
of them on this age have not received a as extended because we got some
extended adults ?? they didn't get early on you so i support the amend ,
Speaker Changes: Representative Brian Brown,
Speaker Changes: See Mr.chairman we ought to respect the amend sponsor
?? if I'm wrong and certainly ?? can correct me as well on the language
of the bill but the argument on this extended age and the children are
been identified earlier than that that's absolutely correct ,bill
language state that this goes to 23 if you have identified priority in
age 8 I'm i correct Representative ??
Speaker Changes: You're correct,
Speaker Changes: So this is just an expanding coverage to the age of 23

important provision to extend much  needed coverage to these children

Thank you, Representative. Representative Hager. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. As a lot of you know, I was one of seven to vote
against this autism bill when it came through the House, but I will say
this amendment – and I think Representative Shepard maybe and I think
Representative Brown tried to address the issue; Representative Sheppard
may not have understood this – I think this… I would be in favor of
defeating this amendment because of the pullback on the extension on it.
I would like to see that 23 if not a little more, more towards
Affordable Care Act issue of 26, but 23 is in the bill right now. I
certainly would not want to see that pulled back, so I ask for members
to defeat this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cunningham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate all of your comments about autism. I
myself have an autistic grandson and understand that early diagnosis is
the most important thing you can do for autistic children because at the
delayed age of 23, after 21, developmental stages are unlikely to be
changed unless early change is implemented, so I’m only asking to
consider the amendment because not only does health insurances have a
commitment to assist with treating, but parental and families at home
also have a responsibility to recognize and get their children early
care just as I did for my grandson. So I think that 23 is not going to
do that much for increasing their vitality for life, so I still ask you
to reconsider on the amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, Mr. Chair. In regards
to what Representative Hager said, I did misspeak. I meant to say I want
to defeat this amendment because we do have some people who didn’t get
their early treatment, and we don’t want to leave them out without any
coverage, so thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate? The question before the committee is adoption of Representative
Cunningham’s amendment. So many as favor the adoption say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No’s have it. I think we have dealt with the last
amendment. We are now on the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman, I’d like to make a motion that we give Senate Bill 493 as
amended a favorable report enrolled into a new proposed committee
substitute unfavorable to the original bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a
motion by Representative Murry. Is there any further debate? So many as
favor the adoption of the bill say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Opposed, no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Carries.
Thank you Representative Murry. We are now ready to take up Senate Bill
734, and we have 14 amendments for this one, so… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman? Mr. Chairman, is that a PCS? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It is a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I make a motion that the PCS be properly before the
committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Motion by Representative Murry
that 734 PCS be before the committee. So many as favor say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. PCS is before us properly.
Representative Murry will present the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. This is Senate Bill 734. If you recall back to last
Wednesday, there were two section of the reg. reform bill that dealt
with business regulations and state and local government regulations. We
have split those provisions out and also added back in several
recommendations that came out of the Administrative Procedures Oversight
Committee that have already passed this chamber. That’s what you see in
part 1. Part 1 are the administrative reforms that deal with the
deletion of several unnecessary boards that haven’t been meeting over
the past few years, and that’s section 1.1. Section 1.2 clarifies the
process for readoption of existing rules, and the original statute sis
not set the process for agencies to readopt rules once the review
process was complete, so we’re amending that house Bill 74 from last
session the help clarify how administrative agencies go back through and
readopt rules. Section 1.3 is a recommendation from the APO Committee
that recommended an authorization of licensing board to adopt rules for
professional corporations. Section 1.4 deals with Occupational Licensing
Board reporting requirements, and this would require APO to notify that…</p>

<p id="040:00">
These licensing boards should have to report the number of total
licensees supervised by the board, and the number of applicants who
failed the examination each year. We’re not going to ask for the names
of the people who failed the exams, just numbers. We have an idea of
whether the veracity of the exam and that report back to the
administrative procedure oversight committee. Section 1.5 would
authorize the office of administrative hearings to allow documents in a
contested case to be filed and served electronically. Section 1.6
contains a clarified that the state board of education is subject to a
rule making under the administrative procedures at as part of
recommendation on the APO committee. Part 2 begins the business
regulation section of the bill. The original sent bill 493 had a
provision of prohibiting certain headlights, after market headlights.
That part of 493 is now in this bill. We have removed the section about
inspections. There were concerns that were raised about how an
inspection would occur. 2.3 deals with bail bond shield amendment. It
changes the margins of the bail bond shields so that all the numbers for
the newly licensed bail bonds can actually fit on the shield. Section
2.4 came from, is agreed to by the utilities commission to repeal
unnecessary and obsolete provisions in utility law. 2.5 deals with, we
passed a locksmith law in the last session, in the long session. This
clarifies that merchants can, are exempt from the licensing of
locksmiths so they can provide replacement transponder keys. Section 2.6
is a clarification of a professional engineering exemption brought forth
by Rep. Arp. Section 2.7. There’s a fair amount of conversation about
how we do. Whether we allow yahoos to serve process servers. This is
going to study the yahoos to serve people. This is a study provision to
discuss how we use private process servers. Section 2.8 clarifies the
effective date of the definition of discharged waste. Section 2.9
studies the membership under the insurance guarantee association act.
There’s some pending litigation dealing with this issue. We turned this
into a study. Section 2.10 was an amendment offered by Rep. Ramsey I
believe and the reform committee last Wednesday to clarify exempting
specialty markets and exempting farmer’s tailgate markets from
registration for the specialty markets operators. Section 2.11 deals
with the ADD requirements for private pools. It clarifies the North
Carolina building code. It refers to the federal definition of a public
place in the Americans with Disabilities Act. That concludes the section
of business regulations. Starting in Part 3, we deal with state and
local government regulation changes. Section 3.1 deals with notification
of property owners for transfers of right of way. That’s the DOT has
gotten more comfortable with this provision since last week. This just
requires units of local government to require right, require acceptance
of right away dedications in exchange for transfer density credits to
notify the applicant and the property owner when the local government
begins that negotiation. Section 3.2 deals with DOT condemnation and
court order map changes. Both of these provisions 3.1 and 3.2, Rep.
Stein has been working on these provision with the DOT. Section 3.3 is a
clarification for the law of notice to chronic violators in
municipalities and city’s public nuisance ordinances. This is basically
going to treat folks that have public nuisances the same as, treat
people who have overgrown vegetation the same as folks who have public
nuisances from our notice requirement. Section 3.4 addresses an issue
that was in the long session regulatory reform bill with regards to
treatment of fraternities and sororities with regards to zoning. This
basically gives a fraternity or sorority that has lost their recognition
from the university two years to re-establish or for a new, and gives a
new sorority, you have a year to get…</p>

Approval for a new fraternity sort 3.5 repeals the protest partitions
that have been discussed and debated by the house several times; I'm
sure we'll have more discussion and debate on that today. Section 3.6
working with the department of insurance to repeal certain unnecessary
statutes at their recommendation. Section 3.7, we talked about mug
shots; we are turning that provision into a study as well, that the
department of public safety and AOC will submit a report at the end of
the year to the joint legislative oversight committee and the department
of justice and public safety on how we should treat mug shots. Section
3.8 clarifies that inspections for worker progress are consistent with
the law that the general assembly passed last session, the long session.
Section 3.9 deals with ethics requirements for municipal officials; we
had some conversations about that last Wednesday, and so we're asking
that the state ethics commission and UNC school of government report

provisions. 3.10 deals with ?? building code to study the authority
granted to local building project inspectors in the cities and counties

Base Realignment Closure and helps make sure that the military, that we
have amends, open means to make sure that any conversations with regards
to BRAC by the military affairs commission doesn't become public until
the federal government makes their final decision with regards to BRAC.
3.12 is a new provision that deals with permitting restaurants, eating
establishments, food businesses and retail businesses on Centennial
Campus to sell alcoholic beverages with a permit. As the Centennial
Campus develops there are going to be restaurants on there and they
wanted to make sure that they had this clarification. Section 3.13:
Extend the deadline of adoption of the division of employment security
rules. THis is back in a provision that allows the--extends the ENC
rules to the end of the year, and requires them to report back to the
joint legislative oversight committee on unemployment insurance by
September on its progress. Section 3.14 directs the North Accountability
Code to study procedures and policies to approve material, design, or
methods. Section 3.15 amends the definitions for North Carolina code
officials to include a definition for willful misconduct, gross
negligence, or gross incompetence, and requires the North Carolina Code
Officials Board to notify all code enforcement officials in the state of
this clarification by October first. Section 3.16 is an amendment that
Representative Whitmire had been working on with regards to
clarification of flood plane ordinance and a bona fide form for ETJs to
exempt them from municipal regulations that are part of the ETJ of the
city. And then part 4 deals with the severability clause.

grammatical and punctuational corrections involving numbering of 493

A small adjustment made in the Senate committee last year. What this
provision does is it simply clarifies that municipalities and counties
do not have the authority to regulate the aesthetics on single family
homes and two-family residences and this applies to the outside
cladding, porches, non-structural exterior ornamentation, the style and
location of doors and windows, garage doors, types of rooms, and
interior layout of the rooms.  I want to make sure everybody's, maybe
refresh your recollection from last year. This only applies to
residential dwellings; it does not impact municipal or county regulation
of commercial or multi-family.  It doesn't impact homes that are covered
by historic districts, or on the national registry, or safety issues. It
doesn't apply to manufactured homes.  It doesn't apply to, impact at all
national flood issues.  And it also does not impact the municipality or
county's ability to regulate with regard to height, bulk, orientation or
location on the lot, and it also does not in any way impact HOA
covenants.  It was obviously supported by the home-builders, supported
by various realtor groups, and it was also supported by the North
Carolina Housing Coalition as well.  We had a very strong bipartisan
support for this legislation and I would be happy to answer any
questions, appreciate it's inclusion of this amendment in the bill.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate, Representative
Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Just a question for Representative Dollar.
I'm not, Representative Dollar? I'm not sure, who does it impact, then?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Who does it impact? What kind of home would it impact?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It would impact single family or two-family dwellings,
and you'll see that on line 9 of the amendment, one- and two-family
dwellings. So, it's a residential house and what it applies to is just
the outside aesthetics as well as the right of a home buyer or a future
homeowner to be able to say where they have their rooms inside their
house without concern that some municipal government would, would tell
them how many rooms they gotta have and where they gotta have them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate, Representative
Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a question for the amendment sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What is it that keeps a city from declaring an area to
be a historic district and thereby getting around this and just deciding
that they want things to look a certain way?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well there are a variety of rules and regulations that
apply to that. It's, that particular provision is covered in lines, for
example, 11 and 12 where it talks about structures that are located in
an area designated as a local historic district pursuant to part 3C of
article 19, chapter 168 of the general statute, so it's, it has to, it
can't just be on someone's whim, it has to meet the statutory
requirements for a historic district.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before the committee is the adoption of
the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm in front of you, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, sorry. Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, thank you Mr. Chair, I just, I'm trying to
recall the debate on this. I had some recollection that, that my city
was particularly concerned with this legislation. I don't know if
there's anybody from the League or something that can speak to this or
if that's appropriate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison, this is the bill where Rick
Glazier said that he had read the bill, read the law, and read the case
law and essentially this codifies the land vale decision from North
Carolina Supreme Court. I'm pretty sure that's why it had such an
overwhelming vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you still wanna ?? I've gotta
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? So any of us favor
the motion by Representative Dollar, say aye.

Is that this will be passed into law by July first is a long shot and so
we are changing several affective dates till August to provide for that
additionally there's some renumbering and re lettering of sections on
page eight and twenty three twenty four. There is a typographical error
it's deleting and clarifying how the association should read and we're
also clarifying board of Alderman versus government board on page twenty
one line twenty seven so I move to option this technical amendment.

Further discussion further debate. So many of us favor the amendment by
Representative Murray say aye.

Aye.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Opposed no. Amendment carries Representative Jordan is recognized to
send forth an amendment. Do you have a preference
which we see...OK he has two the first is AST two zero six version one
representative Jordan is recognized to explain the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chairman I move adoption of this amendment AST
two oh six is going to amend the section with the bail bondsman shield.
There were some technical corrections that need to be done we needed to
spell out what the department of insurance was saying was the specific
size which is the one point eight eight inches two point three six
inches high. Also there's a second section the attorney general had
determined that these folks can use what are called runners as agents to
help them capture the escaping felons. We're just putting in that we're
cadifying the attorney generals opinion of that is fine for them to use
runners as well as they can already use sure at ease and so forth. I'd
be glad to answer your question.

Sure. Further discussion further debate. ?? the motion before the

I think that's duplicative of the one we just did.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Stephens they both reference the same section of the
bill. But there are two separate amendments.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I'm sorry mister ?? I believe this is the final version of what I
attended to be the amendment the difference is if you'll notice this one
has a...yes we all overlook things Representative Stephens thank you.
(laughs) The only difference between this and the last one is we needed
to add in the first section there you see on line six and seven,
following that regulation twelve NCACO seven D that's the number
basically the name has to be on the sheet before it's delivered so we're
not delivering blank shields to people who then engrave their own name
and act like bondsmen.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
OK. I think technically since this amends the previous amendment that it
would be out of order so I'm gonna...
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Lift the chair.

The amendment is adopted. Representative Murry is recognized to send
forth an amendment. ARO-79 version 1. Gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chairman. This adds two studies on a
couple of economic development matters. These are laid to provisions in
SB853 that deals with Business Court Modernization and SB648 which is
the NC Commerce Protection Act of 2014. I believe these two proposals
adopt statutory language which permits North Carolina Corporation to be
merged into a wholly owned subsidiary without shareholder authorization
and a separate vote and allowing North Carolina corporations to
designate in exclusive form for shareholder disputes. Both of these
ideas have merit but I believe they need more discussion and so, we’re
asking the joint legislative economic development global engagement
oversight committee or the EDGE committee, give them time to look at
this and discuss and go into conference on these two provisions in this
bill and I would move adoption of these two additional study provisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. Hearing none, the
question before the committee is the adoption of the amendment ARO-79
sent forth by Representative Murry. So many as favor the adoption, say
Aye. Those opposed, no. The amendment is adopted. Representative
Steinburg is recognized to send forth an amendment. ARO-78 version 1.
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chairman. This amendment is making sure
that the commissioner of insurance has the authority to set rates. His
hands are currently tied. The only thing he basically can do now is
raise rates and what this does is it maximizes the flexibilities for the
commissioner to set rates appropriately even if those rates will be
lower.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions for the amendment sponsor. Representative
Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chairman. I think this is a good step
forward because as far as the rate making process goes, when they submit
the rate the commissioner is supposed to look and see if it’s
appropriate based on all the filing. Latest one is, I think, 3000 pages
or 1000 pages, it’s long. But, he’s only allowed right now to say it can
go up or stay the same. He can’t look at it and say, ‘well you know
after looking at all this information, it needs to go down for the
public’s interest’. So this would give him the authority to be able to
do that and I think it’s appropriate. So, I urge the adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. Representative
Robert Brawley is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like a better explanation from somebody
exactly what this does do. In the insurance committee we’ve been looking
at the rate bureau and what we do with that. Is there someone from the
industry or the department that can tell me in their words what this
does?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a gentleman from the insurance industry that
was here. Ben? Are you gonna speak on this? Popkin? Alright. He’s from
the department of insurance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, thank you Mr. Chairman. My name is Ben
Popkin. I’m with the department of insurance. I have not had an
opportunity to review this provision. I’d like to get a chance to look
at that and comment on that at a later point, if I may. I apologize for
this coming up but I have not had copies of the material that has come
before us relating to this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, do you want to try to review it now and comment
during the committee or you’re asking?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. For Representative Steinburg’s ?? I’m gonna
displace this amendment and we’ll have the sergeant ?? give you a copy
of it. Do you have access to the copy of the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do have a copy of the amendment. I do now have a

Representative Stam is recognized to send forth an amendment, AST212.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks, Mr. Chairman. A lot of section one does away
with commissions or boards that just haven't met at, but section 1.1k
reaches into the Supreme Court, and really has no effect because under
article 4 we have jurisdiction over their procedures and this actual
innocence commission was set up by Chief Justice Bevway, it morphed into
the Statutory Innocence Inquiry Commission, and then it's telling the
new Chief Justice, we will get a new Chief Justice in August, sort of
what to do or not. I just think it's unnecessary, accomplishes nothing
because we don't have jurisdiction over it, and it might send a message
that somehow we don't think innocence is important which, of course, I
think it's extremely important. Whether they set up another study
commission on that or not, who knows, but why are we doing this section.
So I just move we take it out and leave that to state Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chair. I have a little bit of a different position on it than
Representative Stam does, but my understand is the actual Innocence
Commission was established as a result of the request of the General
Assembly and as we review this in administrative procedures oversight,
we were trying to do away with obsolete boards and commissions, so all
this does is recommend to them to go ahead and delete it because we
recommended to them to start it to begin with. It has been replaced with
another situation and it is something that is in our statutes, the
recommendation, so we just are trying to remove it. Clean up things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? OK, we have a
motion by Representative Stam, AST212, so many as favor the adoption of
the amendment, signify by saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Opposed, no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair
believes the ayes have it. The ayes do have it. The motion is adopted.
Representative Meyer is recognized to send forth an amendment, AST203.
The gentleman has the floor to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. This amendment removes the language that would
repeal the rights of protest petition on zoning changes. I understand
that this issue has been debated at length in this chamber and that
there are many feelings on what to do or not to do here. I just want to
bring up a couple of points. One is that this is an issue that is
currently under study from the Property Owners' Rights Study Commission
which has not brought back a report to the full House, and I believe
that if that committee wants to bring back a report and make
recommendations, we could wait to handle this issue in 2015 with a
fuller study of an independent bill. Secondly I'd like to say that
although I understand that there are a small number of times where the
protest of a rezoning request leads to real problems and gumming up the
system there's also a very small number of times that the local council
actually folds to the protest petition. Usually there's a way to work
these things out and we need to leave that in place. The right of
protest petition protects individual property owners and minority
property owners around a zoning change in a way that is consistent with
the protections in our system of government for individuals so that
there is not government overreach, and so when an individual property
owner buys into a property and understands the zoning that is around
them, they're making an investment to the future and their ability to
maintain that investment is in part protected by this, and in fact it
also protects those who wish to rezone a piece of property because once
they buy in and have that property rezoned appropriately, they also have
the right to protest petition later should someone want to rezone the
property around them. So there could be a way that we could readjust the
legislation or the statutes to have a better process, but to do a full
scale repeal I don't think is warranted at this time. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Martin, I understand you have a group
of students here. Would you please tell the chair who you have. Please
use your microphone so we can hear you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Welcome a
group of 4H students from Wilson who came up to visit us today. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Welcome to the Regulatory Reform Committee.
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment. Representative
Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] First of all I would suggest we vote against
this amendment. Protest petitions basically allow one person to hold up
an entire city's right to have a zoning decision.</p>

Made by majority vote. But we’re not talking majority 50%+1. We’re not
talking 3/5 which we do in this chamber sometimes which is 60%. We’re
not even talking 2/3 which is 67%. This is ¾. This is 75%. This has done
something that needs to be dealt with and taken away. It allows one
holdout to hold up an entire project. Even when we hold 5% of the
perimeter of a property. I would suggest we vote against this amendment.
Let’s keep it the way it is in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chair. I have a certain different
perspective on this as the city of Greensboro for some reason was exempt
from the protest petition from 1971 until 2009 when we restored that
right and it’s been a very important tool for neighbors. These are just
re-zoning decisions, these are not zoning decisions. These are one, as
Representative Meyer mentioned, when you have you can rely on a zoning
characterization of a neighborhood and then a proposal comes in to
re-zone and just often, the zoning boards and boards of adjustments
contain full members of industry. So, I think that this just is a tool
that allows neighbors to have a voice in this debate and it’s been very
important for a number of neighborhoods in Greensboro and I just
encourage you to support this amendment. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks. This provision passed the house last year and
just wasn’t taken up by the senate. It is not for the benefit of the
property owners. This supermajority requirement inhibits the rights of
property owners to seek relief from a majority of their town council.
Probably the wrongest thing about the provision in line 5 is that it’s
called ?? protest petitions. They can protest all they want. When it was
put in the 1920s that was the only way people had to get a little handle
on their neighbor’s property. But since then we have 10 reviews before a
typical town council or county commissioners where they get to extort
everything they want out of the person who want to change the zoning.
It’s not democratic. Representative Meyer need to form a new party
called the anti-democrat party because he doesn’t like majority rule. I
believe that the city should be free. Let my people go free at last from
the tyranny of the one or two people on the council who use their
position emboldened by the protest petition to extort things out of the
majority of the council.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chair. I have considerable experience
of protest petitions. I found them thoroughly distasteful. They are
unfair. They do nothing to promote good planning. It’s generally
accepted that what we want to encourage, is density. But what a protest
petition does is allows one neighbor to say ‘Yes, I want density. I just
don’t want it in my backyard. Put it somewhere else in the city’ and
that’s how it works. It’s a way for local elected officials to sidestep
a decision because we don’t just allow a clear majority. If we’re going
to go along the principle that allows supermajorities, I think we should
expand it into tax increases including those involving property tax
re-assessments. That could get real interesting. As Representative Stam
says, this is just not fair. This is anti-democratic. We’ve got to put
this to bed once and for all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the gentleman offering such an amendment?
Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may, I’d like to direct a question to
Representative Wells. In a situation where we have repealed the protest
petition, what would be the recourse to people in the future with
objections?
Representative Wells?
At a local re-zoning here, there has, in my experience, been virtually
unlimited time allowed for opponents to the rezoning. Repealing the
protest petition is not an attempt to silence any opponents. They have
plenty of time to solicit support from neighbors, from people across the
city, the county council members and zoning board people. We actually do
this through a 2 step process in most.</p>

In municipalities, there’s a planning board hearing to make a
recommendation to the council and then there’s a council hearing. So we
go through two hearing councils already. Everybody has time to be heard
at both of those hearings. So if the majority of that community feels
like this is a bad thing, that a particular re-zoning is a bad thing to
do, they can make their voices, they’ve got weeks if not months to make
their voices heard. This is not something that’s being rushed through or
being pushed through in a big hurry. Everybody in the community has a
voice. And it is heard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there follow up? Did you
want to debate the bill? Representative Insko. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. I would just point out that there’s been a
considerable debate on this issue. It’s in a study bill, it’s being
studied. It is not a slam dunk amendment. And we need to let that study
committee complete its work and this is an issue, this is a major policy
issue that is controversial and I think it’s inappropriate for us to
deal with it today in this committee, when we are trying to move this
bill through so I hope that you would vote for the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Baumgartner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. I would ask that you vote against this amendment. This protest
petition is a problem. It’s been a problem in my district. It allows a
few not in my backyard people to control a whole lot of other people and
we need to have some reform in this area and I would ask that you vote
against this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I just wanted to offer my support for the
amendment. We have had a number of issues in our town and we talk about
democracy the people do have a right to be heard. They have a right to
protest. It is a good amendment and I hope you will support it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. Question before the
committee is the adoption of the amendment AST-203 sent forth by
Representative Meyers. As many as favor the adoption say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no. Decision of the chair, the
nos have it. The amendment is defeated. I have a second amendment on
protest petitions. I don’t have the name. This would be AST-205, amend
protest petitions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s mine. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Harrison. Representative Harrison is recognized to send
forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I wanted to
offer a compromise on this important protest petition. I believe
Representative Insko and Representative Meyer made a very good point
that this a very substantive policy. The decision we’re making is part
of a regulatory reform bill and my preference is that we not be doing it
in this vehicle. But in the interest of compromise, I am offering to
raise the threshold of the neighbors that need to participate in order
to file a proper protest petition and that would be raising it from 20%
of the neighbors to 33%, so one third. And then raising the 5% on the
closer 100 foot wide buffer extension to 15% so this raises it to a
larger percentage of the neighbors that need to participate in this
protest petition in order to reach the necessary threshold. I just
repeat that this has been a really important opportunity for citizens of
Greensburg to protest, usually these are commercial developments that
are going into residential neighborhoods. And I would urge the
committee’s support. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’d just like to take this time
to encourage members to defeat this amendment. I know this has been ??
articulately by Representative Harris that this is a compromise. But in
regard to representation of the constituents that we have the privilege
to represent, if you actually stand for private property rights, not
only for the individual who’s actually standing before the planning
board or the actual zoning board or the actual town council, but also
for those who are adjacent property owners as well, that we’re actually
talking about. I just want to make sure we understand what’s going on
here. Even if there is a commercial development that goes within the
area that’s abut residential neighborhoods, there are still building
setbacks that are enforced. There are still perimeter buffers that are
enforced. The actual adjacent property owner has the due recourse in
regard to making sure that their development is not necessary, or their
actual private property is not negatively impacted by the very</p>

Zoning regulations and planning regulations that this body gives the
authority to local governments. This is about an imbalance in voice.
This does not actually repeal anybody, it’s already been said, from
being able to have a voice. It just basically takes care of the
imbalance. While this appears as it is a compromise, it misses the whole
entire policy argument, and I would encourage you to vote down this
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wanted to offer my support for the amendment. It
is a compromise, that’s what we do down here. I think we need to
consider the neighborhoods and the people who have concerns. It has been
a contentious issue. It’s one that our communities in Guilford County
and Greensboro concerned about it. I would ask that you support the
amendment. It does appear to be reasonable. She has increased the
percentages, and I think we need to consider it and support the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
would request that Representative Harrison amend her amendment to say if
there’s a protest petition that it only requires a majority vote to
pass. Oh, that will be the affect anyway, of defeating the amendment.
But please defeat it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wells. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It is a fact of the human psyche that when you buy a house, a
subdivision, and you’ve got a 20 acre field sitting vacant behind your
house, over time you come to expect that that field is yours, and you
have the right to see it remain vacant. That’s what we’re really dealing
with. When people get used to having the open space behind them that
they don’t have to maintain, pay taxes on or pay insurance on, they
think it should continue as long as they’re there. So it’s a real shock
when somebody wants to come in and do something. And this isn’t a matter
of commercial development, this is a matter of good planning. You can
pull out the protest petition weapon, and it’s a nuclear weapon, you can
pull that out despite having full endorsement of the city planners. The
folks that are charged with making decisions on what is the right thing
to do, and where is the right thing to do it. A professional staff that
is under the direction of a manager and a council, is making a decision.
Those folks are under some political pressure to do the right thing, but
they also have a professional obligation to do the right thing for their
city. So pulling out a protest petition, requiring an anti-democratic
super majority vote on a city council that’s had the blessing of a
trained professional staff, that has laid out a plan for an entire city
on where things should go and how they should go, is just not the right
thing to do. We should not be doing this. Even as a compromise, this is
not a good amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would just point out that some
protest petitions succeed. New information is brought in. If they were
that bad, they would never succeed. The other thing is the reason they
succeed is that sometimes there is actually a taking in the process, if
you have a change in the neighborhood that’s substantial, it can reduce
the value of the property. And I think a person has a right to have a
protest petition in order to protect their property rights. So please
support the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate. Representative Hall, Larry Hall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. I want to speak in support of this amendment. I want to make
just a couple of observations and I appreciate Representative Wells’
experiences and those were of course in situations where protest
petitions existed and so the citizens’ individual property rights were
protected and they were able to come forward and ask that accommodations
be made based on the fact they were in most of every instance they first
and also had a recognized use that they were enjoying. The other issue
is what a staff advises the elected officials to do. Of course, the
elected officials are supposed to be representing the citizens who are
individual property owners and their rights because advisors provide
options, should not [PAUSE] go wanting because a staff provides an
option. The elected officials still have that responsibility to the
local citizens who are voting for them and should have</p>

some consideration of their desires. This amendment does increase the
number of individual property owners who have to be involved in this and
I think that we certainly claim that we're in favor of individual
property rights and individual property owners and their ability to
preserve what they paid for. In many instances the reason the area is
attractive is because of their efforts and so they should have some
ability to defend or preserve or have some input on how their community
looks going forward. So I'd ask that you support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative BumGardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would ask that you vote against this
amendment. There's one individual property owner that nobody's mentioned
here and that's the person that owns the property they're wanting to
develop. They get to sit back and watch the people that live in the
neighborhood down the road say, &quot;you can't do that, that's going to
hurt our property value,&quot; and so then they get the zoning board and
their protest petition out and they put a stop to it and keep them from
developing their property and doing what they want to do with their
individual property. And I ask you to vote against this amendment. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be brief. To paraphrase Representative
Harrison's quotes on the floor about the environmental amends bill, this
amendment's much better than the previous one but it's still bad and we
should vote it down.

I'm hearing that some people don't have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We don't have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a, intended to be a short-term fix for something that we're
going to probably need to look at when we come back next year.
Cosmetology, cosmetologists, since 1990, have had the same training,
plus more, that barber's have. They're taught to shave, they're taught
to cut men's hair, women's hair. They go through all the same stuff.
Some of them have opened their shops and call themselves barber shops or
barber and hairstylist or whatever and this has been going on for years.
Well, for some reason now, the Barber Board, which is a separate board
from the Cosmetologists' Board, has been going in a fining shops that
have cosmetologists that are calling themselves barbers or barber shops
and we're talking about $1,000 or $2,000. And this is a debate that's
been debated before, as far as I know, over the years about whether or
not they have authority over the</p>

... cosmetologists. It’s a recurring issue. Cosmetologists are having to
battle this out with the Barber Board, so in order to resolve this
temporarily until we come back next session and look at possibly
combining both board, it’s going to allow them to do what they’ve been
doing and keep the Barber Board out of the cosmetology shops. There’s
instances where cosmetologists are working in the barbershops, no
problem. They’re considered barbers just like barbers are until they
open their own business and they’re not licensed by the barbers; they’re
licensed by the Cosmetology Board. So it’s just a… appears to me to be a
power issue, so it’s to keep these folks from getting fined or having to
battle it out with the barbershops. This seems to allow them to do what
they’re doing until we as a General Assembly can battle this thing out
and figure out if we want to just combine the boards and let them
regulate all of them or not, and I ask for your support on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Presnell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. The barber’s pole is the oldest, most distinguished mark
of any profession, dating back before Christ. The arts of hair and
beard-trimming, medicine, dentistry and surgery were all performed by
the same operators in early history. Barbers were once called barber
surgeons and due to their services rendered, especially to royalty, they
were the most respected and protected of men. Barbers poles and the word
“barber” need to remain with barbers; not cosmetologists. I ask that you
vote no on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I‘m not advocating that the dentists and the rest of
them get the use of the barber poles; however, cosmetologists, they are
in fact barbers just like barbers are. They’re trained to shave, they’re
trained to do the hair; they do all the stuff they do in a barbershop,
so to allow them to utilize it – and to be honest with you, the barber
poles have been in existence for thousands of years, and for the barber
organization to say that someone can’t use it, if I want to put one
outside my house, I should have the authority to do that. They don’t own
that. It’s not trademarked, and let’s let these cosmetologists do their
job and work and make money and build this state. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the gentleman accept a question from the Chair? Being as someone
who finds himself very uncomfortable in… I think cosmetology shops is
also sometimes called beauty parlors, and one of the things that I like
about the barber pole is the fact that when I go into an establishment
with a barber pole, I expect to see a calendar with dogs smoking cigars
and playing poker, ESPN on the television, and a bunch of guys talking
hunting and fishing. Will you guarantee me that I will not have an
unwelcome ambience at a cosmetology salon, sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] A lot
of times I get my hair cut by the cosmetologists and they do an
excellent job. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion? Representative
Faircloth. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Question for the
sponsor of the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale, do
you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative Speciale. Is there anything, if someone gets their
training and decides, and they are generally, in most cases I suspect, a
cosmetologist is a female – may not be in all cases, but if they’re
female and they decide to go into this haircutting business and they
decide they want a barber pole, can they take the training and register
as a barber? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well certainly they can, but the
situation that we have right now is that there’s nothing prohibiting
them from using that barber pole, there’s nothing in writing, and the
barber regulations, the cosmetologists are exempted from those
requirements, so now it just becomes an issue of which inspector or
whoever they’re sending out from the Barber Board, what his opinion is
as to whether they should or should not be able to use that, so we’re
trying to resolve this temporarily until we come up with a better
solution, until we’ve got the time to look at this closer and possibly
like I said combine the boards and kill some redundancy. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cunningham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I understand what Representative
Speciale is saying. Now we have combined shops. When you go…</p>

To the salon, there may also be a barber. So you have two regulatory
boards coming in doing an assessment of that facility. So in order for a
cosmetologist to have the barber stand, they cannot have the sign. They
can have a sign that you can put in the window. You cannot have the
pole. But if it is a barber shop, they can have the pole. So it is a
little confusion between how many people need to come in and regulate
that industry. So I support Representative Speciale’s idea of how we
need to correct that issue. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion, further debate. The motion before the committee is the
adoption of the amendment ARO-74 version 1 by Representative Speciale.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just at the appropriate time I do have a couple
questions on the bill itself, whenever you’re. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This
would be the appropriate time. Go ahead sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. Representative Murray on page 12 it talks about the ADA
requirements for private pools. Can you just, for my own lack of
understanding, can you elaborate a little bit on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly. So there is a conflict in the North Carolina building code on
whether an HOA pool is a public place. That issue is clearly addressed
in the Americans with Disabilities act. So we are making sure the North
Carolina building code when it speaks toward public places and the ADA
requirements, that it’s whatever North Carolina’s interpretation is are
going to be consistent with the Americans with Disabilities act. And
just make sure that HOA pools fit appropriately under the definition of
whether it’s a public place or not, should be a decision of the American
with Disabilities act, not the North Carolina building code. It’s a seek
to clarify that issue. That’s the issue that’s being addressed. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] One quick follow up</p>

<p id="100:00">
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So we’re not adding any new regulations to
private pools in this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct and that’s the
issue you’ve just, you’re jumping up and down right on the issue. The
issue is that it is unclear where there’s certain HOAs based on the size
of the neighborhood, as a public place or whatever. And so we wanted to
make sure that the appropriate definition for a public place for
basically pools and the homeowners association is appropriately defined
and consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act which controls
how public places and people with disabilities have access to public
places. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and Representative
Murray. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Insko. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Representative Murray. On page 15
it’s the differential treatment of fraternities and sororities. I just
want to make sure I understand that. On line 35, I believe that you
mentioned that, I believe you said that if fraternities or sororities
were seeking approval, they had one year to do that, and I’m reading
here three, so. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So what we’re doing here, there’s
three provisions here. There’s the ordinance, so we’re talking about
zoning ordinances, fraternities and sororities. For a fraternity or
sorority that was suspended or not recognized, they have at least two
years to reestablish approval recognition. The ordinance must give a
fraternity or sorority, I’m sorry I did misspeak. Seeking approval, at
least three years to seek, to attain approval. And the ordinance must
require that property cannot be occupied successfully by a fraternity or
sority seeking to establish, reestablish approval or recognition and a
fraternity or sorority seeking approval or recognition or vice versa. So
it’s three years. I did misspeak. I did misspeak. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
actually, [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. So I
want to make sure I understand number three. As I read number three, the
purpose of that is to prevent a fraternity or sorority that has lost
their license, to have two years to try to get reestablished, and then
to switch to a different fraternity and become, and take three years to
get established as that new organization. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s my
understanding. It forbids you from being able to double dip. I think
that’s, if you didn’t get reestablished in two years, then you can’t
just change your name and try to be a new fraternity and get three
years. Now that’s exactly the issue we’re trying to address. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Horne is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think my question has been answered but
just in case it hasn’t, I want absolute clarity on the swimming pool ADA
issue. When we use the word private, and I understand that it can be a
private community but it could be a private home. And is that clear in
this change, that it is a HOA or that type of private, versus a private
home? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s more clear in the American with
Disabilities Acts than it is with the North Carolina building code. And
so that’s the change. And I will defer it to staff for additional
clarification and Amy Jo Johnson on staff was working on this particular
provision. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Murray. Yes, with
regards to the issue of the private pools, this is specific to the HOA
pools that would be governed by the building code. So although it does
not say it here because of the portion of the building code that’s being
referenced, that’s talking about the HOA pools which are not necessarily
public, they’re not necessarily private, it depends on the ADA and
telling the building code council to clarify that so that only the HOA
pools that would be considered public under the ADA are in fact
considered public under the building code as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Representative Robert Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d ask a
question on section 3.6. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Or the questions to section
3.6 to the department of insurance on the repeal of obsolete statutes
and I would ask that folks from the department of insurance that wanted
to have these obsolete statutes repealed be able to address any
questions regarding that section if that’s okay.</p>

<p id="105:00">
Ben, would you like to address that, or...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Rose Vaughn Williams, legislative counsel for the Department of
Insurance, and I'm sorry, I did not hear the question. I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I didn't recognize-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??] didn't ask it yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's why.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Williams, going through this, all of these sections repeal as best I
can tell effeciency reports, quality of care, accountability, and
effectiveness. But if I read correctly in some of the other provisions,
one of the reasons that they're being repealed is that they're included
in other legislation. Am I doing that correct-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right. Well, yes sir. Thank you Rep. Brawley. By other statutes already
in place, we get some of the information that we already need, do you
want me to summarize them? All the ones?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No ma'am. But on section 3.6d, that one I did not find, and it's a
requirement that false information be reported. Do we still require
anyone filing a false claim, or false information or fraudlent insurance
to report it to somebody?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Rep. Brawley, I'm sorry, I don't have the provision in front of
me and I don't know that the full statute would help me either but the
ones, the number of the reports, one of them is a reportable required by
law, it ended up the law didn't pass, but the report provision on the
effect of the new law has stayed in there since the 80s, one of them is
on motorcycles that was passed in the 80s, on the availablity of
motorcycle insurance and we've been sending that in the general assembly
and we decided it's plentiful these days, let's get rid of that, one of
them is an HMOs, I think we used to have twenty-some, and now there are
five, it took us full time employees to process and consolidate all that
data that's not needed that we have available in other ways, it was
taking the companies a whole lot of effort and work to get that
information to us. One of the- and now I'm going blank. But those are
the reports. So I think we are most careful to be sure we don't miss
something. I don't think we would have proposed it if we did that I'll
just say.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thank you. I just want to be sure that we're getting that information,
because it looked like good information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right. Believe me, we will absolutely continue to get what they need for
the market conduct exams. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Brody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Rep. Murry, I want to get back to the pool
thing again. Forgive me, but please let me know if I'm reading more into
this than is necessary, but I don't understand the ADA requirements so
when I don't follow them completely my imagination begins to wander and
I begin to picture scenarios, and one of those scenarios is that
generally, if you remodel, do something, remodel, then you become
subject to whatever the current legislation is, and in particular in the
pools, like private pools or HOA pools, I envision the new ADA
regulation to have the pool have zero entry versus a step and all those
things. Am I going too far in that, or do we face actually the
possibility of having those stricter regulations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My understanding is that the ADA definition of a public place would
actually be a benefit in the situation that you just described. First is
the existing North Carolina building code. That's my understanding, and
I will defer to staff again, but that's my understanding, to further
clarify my understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Rep. Brody, you are correct that typically when there is some new
build or renovation done to a public pool, they would have to adhere to
the more updated standards of the ADA, particularly in 2010. The issue
here is that HOA pools, though typically thought of as private, under
the ADA, some are private  and some are public, it depends on what the
HOA pool is functioning as. If it is strictly only for the individuals
in the HOA, they don't host meets, things like that, then it would
definitely be a private pool. Under the federal regulations however, an
HOA pool can be public if it engages in certain activities. This is just
(recording ends)</p>

...telling the building code folks when you're looking at whether the
HOA pool needs to do the upgrades or not, to consider, whether under the
ADA, is it actually a private pool and, thus, does not need to do those
upgrades?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess, if an HOA then wants to be extra careful and
not potentially to be subject to those rules that they really need to
watch what events or things that they do and basically keep it private,
would that be correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What constitutes the definition of a public place
under the definition of pools is the level of activity that occurs in
that pool. I think that's part of the clarification that's necessary for
this to help make sure that we don't unnecessary restrictions on HOA
pools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lucas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Ms. Julia. My curiosity was peaked by the
questions raised by Representative Robert Brawley in Section 3.6.
I was of the impression, and correct me if I have misunderstood that,
that that entire section with the provisions of the bill would suggest
that this whole section in the study.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry, do you wish to respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that's a straight up repeal of certain
statutes and reporting requirements in the Department of Insurance. In
Section 3.6, those aren't study.
That it is a straight up repeal of general statutes as recommended by
the Department of Insurance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A quick follow-up. Then, I suppose that would be taken
care of then, if it’s revealed. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're exactly correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brian Brown is recognized to send forth
an amendment, ASTself 201, Version 1.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I thank you. I tell you what, let me go ahead and
recognize you to send forth your perfecting amendment, which is ARN-42,
Version 1, and you can explain both the perfecting amendment and the
main amendment at the same time.
Gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. What you have before you,
members, is the exact language that was in House Bill 680, which this
body based on last session by a vote count of 103 to 1.
I'll explain the entirety of the actual language in the perfecting
amendment, as the Chairman said, together. Kind of the brief overview,
30,000 foot view of the actual language of the bill, this actually
provides this state with regulatory guidance as it pertains to what has
already been passed by the Federal Government and the Jobs Act allowing
for equity crowd funding.
If you're not familiar with that, I'll give you a quick overview of
that. A lot of you are probably familiar with websites like Kickstarter,
and those types of websites, where arts projects, businesses and things
are able to raise capital from their friends and families for exchange
for things like backstage passes, autographed photographs, and so on.
I can tell you that no one wants an autographed photo of me standing in
front of my business in exchange for any capital. What equity crowd
funding does is it allows businesses to be able to receive small amounts
of money from a large group of people to help with start-up, capital
investments and growth.
What the bill actually does is it does place some regulatory guidance as
it pertains to equity crowd funding in the State of North Carolina. It
provides the guidance that the business has to be registered with the
Secretary of State and allowed to be able to do business within the
State of North Carolina and can only receive funds from individuals who
reside within the State of North Carolina.
It also provides some caps for the amount of money that is raised and
the amount of money that can be contributed from each individual
purchaser of the issuance of the stock that is being served by the
issuer. Essentially, any company that has not went through a full
financial audit within the last 12 months and not disclosed that to the
administrator, as well as any potential purchaser, can only raise a
million dollars.
Any company that has actually went through a full financial audit and
has disclosed that to the purchaser and administrator can raise up to
two million dollars. However, there can not be any more than $2,000
raised from any individual purchaser.
A lot of disclosures have to be given, the type of company that you are,
a full business brand, including the amount of money that you are
seeking to raise. That amount of money will then be raised.
Every dollar that comes in for this raise will go into an escrow account
and will not be able to be issued to the issuer until that amount of
money has been raised.</p>

or exceeded as determined by the business plan. Also, identities of any
investor, of any owners of a company that own more than 10%, identity of
the Board of Directors, names of anyone assisting in the offering, any
legal procedures or litigation that's associated with the issuing
company, and also must have the purchaser submit in writing that they
understand that the business is speculative and any investment in the
business could provide in any losses. The perfecting amendment does
amend page 6, lines 38 to 42 by eliminating the fee. With that, I will
yield for any potential questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Question for the bill, amendment sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you discuss a little further on escrow agreement? My ears perked
up, as an attorney, and also realtors have escrow agreements. Could you
please discuss that because, I know as an attorney, if I have an escrow,
funds in escrow and do something wrong with them my license can be
taken. What, how is this escrow money protected in these escrow
accounts?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is over, it does have an overview from the administrator and it could
be audited at any time to make sure that any funds that are raised,
number one, is coming from North Carolina citizens, to ensure that that
is in fact the case and to make sure that any monies that have been
pledged is actually in there. The safeguard of not allowing the money to
actually be dispersed to the issuer until the full raise is made is
simply because, if you look at the business plan, they're asking for a
particular amount of money in subject to capital improvements, start-up
funds, whatever the case is. So if anything is raised less than that it
would be reasonable to believe that anything else contained in the
business plan would probably not be achieved also. So it just holds that
money in the escrow accounts up until that fund is actually fully raised
or exceeded that amount.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you direct me to the definition of administrator and also tell me
what sanction there would be on an administrator who misappropriated
funds from an escrow account.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could, I'd actually like to defer that to staff. If that's okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The administrator is actually the head of the Securities Division in the
Office of Secretary of State.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Has the Office of the Secretary of State been contacted to see if they
will undertake these additional duties?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan, this is actually the identical bill that we
passed under Representative Murry's sponsorship. The perfecting
amendment just removes the fee, so this doesn't, the whole bill doesn't
have to take a dip in Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize, these are questions I should have asked at that point, at
that time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's quite alright, sir, I just would, but please if you have more
continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dave Massey with the Security, the Secretary of State's Office and the
Securities Division was heavily involved in the development of this
legislation and I would expect a fee, at some point, to support the
operations that we're talking about here but in order for Representative
Bryan's amendment to move forward and this bill to move forward we're
going to defer the fee conversation until a later date but the sum and
substance of this bill has thoroughly vetted with the North Carolina Bar
Association's Security, Securities Bar, the Securities Division of the
North Carolina Secretary of State's Office, and it's endorsed by the
North Carolina Technology Association and various other start-up groups.
So I think, my expectation is the Senate will eventually take this up,
depending on how long we're here. It's in the queue, from what I
understand, but we just wanted to belt-and-suspenders this issue because
it's important for our small business start-ups and I thank
Representative Brown for bringing forth this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Susan Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I also appreciate Representative Brown and
Representative Murry bringing this forward. I was just wondering,
because there is a lot of detail in here, if staff could make available
the bill summary that we had, it's been a while since we looked at that.
Maybe when we go to the dashboard and we have the full bill that we
could add that summary to this component because it has a lot of detail
and I'd like to be refreshed. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff has accepted that direction have assented. Representative, did you
have a follow-up, Representative Martin? Representative Queen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I appreciate efforts to bring this forward, it is a very important
entrepreneurial tool for, why are the investors limited to North
Carolinians? It seems like the World Wide Web is as just exactly that
and you would want to allow North Carolina companies to solicit
investors from around the world, so-

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the question. We would love for that to be the case.
However, it does have to follow federal exemption for intra-state
transactions in Section 3A11 of the securities act of 1933, as well as
some other federal provisions that are only limited to intra-state
activity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hopefully when the Securities Exchange Commission finishes their work,
and listens to the startup community, that we will have a national
platform to allow for multi-state offerings, but at this point, the only
exemption that North Carolina can offer to the Securities and Brokers
Registration requirements is specific to North Carolina companies,
raising funds from North Carolina individuals. And so that’s our
limitation. We still think it’ll have an impact though. We still think
it’ll have a great impact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up? Further discussion for the debate? Okay, we’ve got, first,
the question before the committee is the adoption of the Perfecting
Amendment, ARO80-Version 1, send forth by our—Excuse me, wrong… Made it
all the way to the end – The Perfecting Amendment, ARN42 Version 1, by
Representative Brown to amend the amendments, so many as favor the
Perfecting Amendment, say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, no? The question before the House—Excuse me, the question
before the Committee is ASTf201 Version 1 as amended, sent forth by
Representative Brown. So many as favor the adoption of the amendment,
say Aye?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, no? The amendment is adopted. So we now have Representative
Steinburg is recognized to withdraw ARO78- Version 1, and send forth a
new amendment. ARO80- Version 1.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. That is exactly what I will be doing. We
will be withdrawing the amendment and substituting another, and the
substitution amendment will be to establish a legislative research
commission, to study whether the commissioner insurance should be given
the expanded authorities that the amendment that we’re pulling would
have given him. So this will be a joint legislative study commission
[elersy?] that I am proposing in this amendment for your consideration.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, I think that this issue is about fairness
and for the people in the state in regards to setting rates, which is
what the commissioner is charged to do. One thing that Representative
Dockham was kind enough to teach me before he left was, the number one
way to create unintended consequences is through an insurance bill, so I
would support this amendment to create a little more research on it and
a little more study.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Robert Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank Representative Steinburg
for working with us on this issue, because this rate structure affects 9
million automobiles, vehicles in North Carolina, and I do think it needs
to be studied a little bit, and this is the fairest way to do it. And I
do appreciate it and I do encourage support of the amendment.

the adoption of the amendment sent forth by Representative Steinburg,
ARO80 Version 1. So many as favor the adoption, say Aye.

record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you very much, Cady Thomas with the North Carolina
Association of REALTORS. We do not disagree with what you're trying to
do in section 3.3, however the way it's drafted we think that the actual
owners of record may not receive notice but yet they are defined as the
chronic violators. So we would really like to see some perfecting
language to make sure that the owner of record, in fact, gets notice of
the violations because in a property management or a leased situation
they are not necessarily the ones in the property. So if stuff is being
tagged to the door the owner of record may never get that notice from
their tenant. So we would just ask for some clarification on that,
please. Thank you.
