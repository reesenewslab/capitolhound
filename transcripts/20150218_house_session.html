[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is the day that the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in
it. Father, we are grateful for the Sun which has warmed our path, we
stand in all of the winter storms that better us, and we thank those in
public service who have work so hard to protect us from the harm, the
winter storm has caused. As we who legislate continue our work help us
to remain humble and remember our powers are limited, let us solve what
we can and trust you to use other voices and other organizations to
solve the problems beyond our charge. We each come to you in our own
way; I come to you in the name of Jesus, Amen.
