Can you shed any light on that at all?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Thank You, Representative Fisher. The ETJ
component, the town of Weaverville is neutral on this bill. What it

appropriate action. Representative Ramsey, you continue to have the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Buncombe County is

couple of years. Charter revisions are something that are necessary
periodically to conform charters with current state law. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Moore, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Rise for a question

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I would say that I along with probably
most members of this body are having a difficult time hearing the

working with our staff and folks in Burlington to get this done. You all
may not know this, but I’ll share it with you happily. Representative
Steve Ross spent 16 years on the Burlington City Council including 2
terms as Mayor. So, it’s very appropriate for him to be carrying this
bill today. Thank You.

the chamber today, so I would appreciate if you’d stick around. We don’t

Representative Shepard.
[tape break]
Ladies and gentleman, we now are in a position to take up the last item
on the calendar. Representative Moore will be recognized to explain the
reason behind us and then we'll be recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Having voted on the prevailing
side, I move that the House do reconsider the vote on third reading of
Senate Bill 38, short title Amend Environmental Laws 2014, would ask to
be recognized to debate my motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. Speaker, members, this bill, this was
the environmental amend laws that we passed last week. The staff
discovered an error in one of the amendments and we need to, for
procedural purposes, go back and do the third reading again just to
explain that amendment.
Representative Arp had an amendment that the correct amendment was
actually engrossed but the amendment that showed up on the members
dashboards was different. It's a subtle difference. I'll even let
Representative Arp explain that. It wasn't a major difference but out of
an abundance of caution we felt it appropriate to have a vote to make
sure we fixed that technical issue. I'll be glad to answer any questions
if there are any, but that's all this is and I would urge the body to
vote yes on the motion to reconsider and then I understand
Representative Arp's going to send forth a perfecting amendment to
correct that issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the motion? If
not, the question before the house is the motion by Representative Moore
to reconsider the vote on the House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill
38. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the
vote.
The Clerk will let the machine record the vote. One hundred and ten

of the energy audits. What this does is there was a mix up in the

title and make corresponding conforming changes. I ask for your support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, we had a good discussion this last week. I just wanted to remind
members that despite the fact that this is a much better bill than what
the Senate sent over to us, there are some problems with the isolated
wetlands, air permits, the landfill, the construction and demolition
landfill piece, and inland hazards and a few others. So I'll be voting
no and encourage you to vote no. Thank you.

... supported this bill last week. I might do it a little less
passionately tonight but I still support it. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative McGrady, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I add my
support for what Representative Samuelson said. Remember we’re going to
get into negotiations or conferencing potentially with the Senate. I was
really happy with the broad bipartisan support for this bill; it helps
us in terms of negotiations that might move forward, and so I really
hope we’ll have a similar vote tonight. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the House is the
passage of the House Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 38 as amended
on its third reading. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The
Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will lock the machine and record the
vote. 97 having voted in the affirmative and 13 in the negative, the
house Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 38 as amended has passed its
third reading. The bill will be engrossed and sent to the Senate by a
special message. Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the calendar. We
appreciate your indulgence. In spite of the disruption, we had a
productive session with several bills added to the calendar. Notices and
announcements? Representative Pierce, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Do you have schedule for the
week that we could…? For the session for the week? Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, well as I said, tomorrow we are going to move the
calendar up. The Chair doesn’t necessarily expect a long debate tomorrow
but I’ve been wrong before, so we moved it up so we can make sure we can
honor the commitment that the Democratic caucus has tomorrow night. On
Wednesday we may potentially have an earlier session, and on Thursday we
would anticipate probably noon. The biggest wildcard in that… We’re
going to try and do it as early as possible. At this point we do not
anticipate a Friday session but please stay tuned, but at this time I
really have to defer. Depending on whether or not the Senate intends to
engage in conference this week, it may require us to move the calendar
around, but we’ll give you notice as soon as we have to make any
changes, but for now we think you can plan on what I just said. Further
notices and announcements. The time tomorrow will be 2 pm.
Representative Moore is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I
move that subject to ratification of bills, messages from the Senate,
committee reports, conference reports, re-referral of bills and
resolutions, appointment of conferees, introduction of bills and
resolutions and modifications to the calendar, that the House do now
adjourn to reconvene on Tuesday June 24th 2014 at 2 pm. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Moore moves, seconded by Representative Brown,
that the House do now adjourn, subject to ratification of bills and
resolution, receipt of messages from the Senate, committee reports,
conference reports, re-referral of bills and resolutions, appointment of
conferees and modifications to the calendar to reconvene on Tuesday June
24th at 2 pm. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All opposed, no. The ayes have it. The House stands adjourned.</p>
