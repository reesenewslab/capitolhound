There was a call for the public hearing and we are complying with that
request. Gonna ask Greg Rooney to give you a quick summary of what is in
the bill currently.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. There are five main sections and provisions in the bill. And
I’m just going to kind of recap what this summary has. The first section
does, deals with the duty of a city to provide municipal services under
certain conditions. Municipal services are water and sewer. And the
condition, the main conditions are the application has to be within 60
days enactment of this bill and that the property owner has to abide by
any agreements to provide road improvements. The other big thing, some
other big items in the bill is it annexes 171 acres into the city of
Durham. This is 751 South property. A third major item is it provides
design build authority for the city of Durham for its police
headquarters and other buildings related to the police force and 911. It
amends the charter of the city of Durham to increase the authority for
the city council to delay annexation for up to 10 years. The current
authority is 3 years, so an annexation must occur within 3 years of the
vote. At this charter movement pass it could be 10 years. The fourth
major section is the design build authority for the water treatment.
This is for the county of Durham design build on water treatment for a
new water treatment facility. And those are the major five provisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions from the committee? Representative Lubke, member of the
committee, called for the public hearing. Representative Lubke, sir,
would you like to make a brief comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam Chair. My comment is simply to thank you for honoring
the request for a public hearing and for bringing citizens together for
an opportunity to express themselves. I very much appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our first speaker will be Cate Fellman. Ms. Fellman? Ma’am if you want
to come to the microphone and hold the button down, you can speak from
right there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hello, my name is Cate Fellman. When I moved to Durham 8 years ago, I
was pleased to learn that many citizens were actively involved in
decision making in our community. The first city council and county
commission meetings I ever attended were in Durham. And they can be
rough and tumble affairs. I’m impressed our local leaders truly listen
to citizen input and value community decision making. In the case of
annexation of water and sewer to this proposed development at the
Chatham county line, everyone I spoke to agreed. This would be a huge
mistake. It would raise our taxes, and divert resources from Durham’s
reinvigorated downtown and areas still in need of redevelopment.
Durham’s citizens let their city council know in no uncertain terms that
this wasn’t the direction that our city should take. And the beauty was
that they listened, despite immense pressure from two individuals, their
lawyers, and their deep pockets. The city listened to the citizens.
Taking into account the city’s own analysis and the upside down
financials of extending services to the far edge of the county. Please
do not reject the vote of our city council. Don’t turn a deaf ear to the
citizens of Durham who have played by the rules and said no to this
development on its merits. If the state reverses Durham’s decision, my
question is Who’s next? Who will be silenced next? If we truly want
citizen engagement, we must trust citizens and their elected
representatives at the local level. Don’t allow two high rollers with
connections in the state legislature to trump the voice of democracy.
Please vote no on Senate Bill 315. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ma’am. Don Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon, Madam Chair. Good afternoon Madam Chair and members of
the committee. I’m Don Moffitt and I serve on Durham’s city council. I
oppose Senate Bill 315 and I ask you to do the same. As a council
member, I’m elected by people I see every day in the grocery store, at
work and in church. I have an up close perspective on what citizens want
and in the fall they will decide</p>

services to the 751 project. Whether or not those ordinary citizens want
to make their property available for those uses. Senate bill 315 is a
bad bill. Everything about it promotes favoritism over the general
welfare and the public good. Members of the House, I ask you to stop
this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Miller.
Sarah Terry?
Sorry.
Hold it, don't hold it- Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Sarah Terry, and I first want to thank you for holding this
hearing and listening to what is in the hearts and the minds of the
people of this state on this important issue. I have lived in North
Carolina for nearly 20 years, and I'm proud of living in Durham, sending
my kids to Durham public schools, and attending church in Durham. I've
seen so many good things happen in Durham since I first moved here. The
result of local decision making that really reflects how the people who
live and work here want to see Durham grow. If this bill passes, I
wonder where Durham will be in another 20 years. I worry that people who
don't live here will have the power, with no accountability to local
voters to change things against the wishes of the community. I don't
know of any North Carolinian who wants decisions on local issues being
made by those who don't have to live with and pay for the consequences.
Please ask yourself how would you feel if Durham officials all of a
sudden had a say in where apartments, strip malls, and factories got
built in your communities. If that thought makes you uneasy, and it
should, you need to vote against this bill. If you are against the long
arm of government reaching into local decision making, you need to vote
against this bill. If you want to keep this from happening in your
community, you need to vote against this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Carolyn Gunther?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm John Gunther, I'm a Durham native, born and bred, and I work in
Durham, and I live on the Chancellor's Ridge subdivision which is
immediately across 751 from the proposed annexation and development. Our
association consists of nearly 400 homes and 80 town homes, and I've
reviewed my comments with the current president and board and they
endorse what I'm about to say. Our neighborhood and its HOA have been
actively concerned about and opposed to the development of this area for
5 years. Over 80% of our homeowners are opposed to this. When it started
out, we learned what the rules were for expressing opposition and
working with the city and county bodies to make our feelings known, have
them communicate with us and us with them so that we could have a good
understanding with the local bodies of what's going on. I applaud the
city council of Durham for refusing to let this development and
annexation proceed after they've carefully worked with us to understand
the implications for Durham and its citizens, it's a very complex issue.
Now it's frustrating for us to be at a point where after we've tried to
follow the rules and do things by the book, we find that the state
legislature is considering getting involved in this issue. We have
really worked hard to communicate with the local city and county
governments about this, and now we don't understand why there's a reason
for the state government to become involved. Please don't become
involved in this issue, it's a local issue, it's best decided at the
ground level by those who have spent an immense amount of time working
on it, trying to understand it, trying to communicate with the citizens,
with the homeowners' association and many other bodies, and we don't
understand a reason for the state government to be involved. Thank you.

<p id="15:00">
Thank you sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am, thank you committee.
My name is Christopher ??. I moved to North Carolina five years ago, and
to Durham four years ago. It was one of the best decisions I made
because Durham, North Carolina has turned out to be a great place to
live. I'm here in Raleigh today to ask you to vote no on Bill 315. This
bill will override local land use decisions that have been made, and
should continue to be made at the local government level. Local
governments are an essential part of the democratic process. They are
elected by local citizens and the citizens and their local elected
officials bring a deep understanding to issues involving their families,
their resources and the shape of their community. This bill instead
imposes big government decisions on local land use and services.
Although the bill sets a dangerous precedent for every town in North
Carolina, the language in this bill pertains to just one development in
Durham. The bill is designed for the sole benefit of two apparently well
connected land owners. This state government should not be picking
winners and losers. Finally, note that the recent legislation makes it
illegal for cities to annex a neighborhood against its will. But this
bill will allow the developers to annex my city against Durham's will.
Again, please, thank you for your consideration, and I ask you to vote
no on this Bill 315. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Will
Wilson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. My name is Will Wilson and I'm
from Durham. I'm speaking against S.B. 315, a bill that takes away
Durham's ability to plan for its future. Cities and towns from the
mountains to the peat moss of the coast are driven by local businesses,
the people who work hard to make them succeed. Teachers, police and all
our public workers, and the volunteers serving on boards, commissions,
councils, churches, schools and local non profits. This bill vetoes
those local efforts. This bill vetoes the dedication of people that
opposed and supported this one well connected outside developer's goals.
This bill takes away local control and if you approve, it opens up a new
era in North Carolina where outside money and political connections
dictate how the property next door gets developed. This bill says that
the best approach to make a fast buck is to seek out powerful
legislators anywhere across the state and first line up a bill in the
legislature, then tell local officials the way things are going to work.
Local control and local investment builds strong North Carolina
communities. Each community has unique resources and problems, but when
people come together to work out those difficult issues, the outcome is
a better future for its citizens. So I ask you to please consider this
before you vote. Do you want a North Carolina that's for sale to the
highest bidder or do you want a state that's in the hands of the people
who care about local needs and can best leverage local resources for
each community's future? Selling out communities to outsiders seeking
quick money or political revenge is bad when Democrats do it and it's
bad when Republicans do it. This bill makes it happen in my town right
now, but it could happen just as easily in your town. Thank you for your
service. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Carolyn Erinson. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Hi. My name is Carolyn Erinson. And I have a speech written but
I'm a rebel and I'm not going to read it. I'm also a Rotarian, and I
love Rotary. I've been in Rotary for six years and one of the things of
Rotary is service above self, which many of y'all might be Rotarians and
know that. And the other way is the four way test. It's an amazing thing
that made me want to be in that group, because the first thing is is it
the truth? Secondly, is it fair to all concerned? Will it build good
will and better friendship, and is it beneficial to all concerned? I
looked at this bill and whether or not this was for a development I want
or don't want, it is not beneficial to all concerned. Have they been
honest in how they're dealing with this? Have they been truthful? Just
look at all the things going on. If you really investigate this, where
is the truth? Last night I went to sleep and I cried myself to sleep. I
take this stuff very seriously. It really goes to my heart. Because I
love Durham passionately, and it breaks my heart to see our community
divided like this, over a development that's</p>

all citizens of Durham, it's for the benefit of the two. I hope you will

everyone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you ma'am, Susan Sule.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you to the finance committee for this
opportunity, my name is Susan Sule, and I live in Durham. I am here to
ask for your vote against Senate bill 315 which would force the city of
Durham to extend water and sewer way on to the county so that private
developers can build to the density they desire. This is a city issue,
one that the Durham planning department, city council and local
residents have visited at least three times. Each time the numbers just
did not add up to make this a sensible use of tax dollars. I speak today
with the support of my Durham neighborhood ??. My neighborhood works
with local commercial owners to make our neighborhood more walkable. we
work with the city planners to revitalize our urban neighborhoods around
us, and we work with develops to redesign a nearby abandoned commercial
area that we have much more to do. People are building new homes in our
neighborhood showing that our efforts are recognized. Mine is one of
many neighborhoods in Durham, each with it's own struggles and plans. I
am proud to help with this work. I have seen how important the voice of
neighbors is in planning. This work happens everyday, in every city and
county in our state. Volunteers and professionals working together. We
are local folks making local decisions about local issues trying to make
our community a better place.
Senate bill 315 is a giant intrusion into a local issue. It obliterates
the important process of local folks making local decisions about local
issues. Please say no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Deb Christie.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Good afternoon, my name is general Christie, I live
at 5212 twin pines lane, Durham. I lived in the Durham area for most of
my 64 years. I want to thank the finance committee of the house for
having this public hearing and thank you for your service. I urge you to
vote against Senate bill 315 which would compel the General Assembly to
meddle in local affairs, and would prevent the Durham city council from
setting the city's own boundaries and from determining the proper use of
our precious resources. Please don't cooperate with this plan of two
speculators to circumvent local government in matters that is always
been decided locally. The extension of utilities and services and
annexation. Think of the president this bill would sent. Do you really
want to open that can of worms.
Thank you for respecting local control over development. Thank you for
voting against Senate bill 315.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you ma'am, ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: My name is ??, I am here as a member of a family that
lives out in a farm in Southern Durham county that is very near 751. My
family raises cattle and operates a ?? dairy farm which is now open. My
parents farm this land before, and their parents before that, and we
have farmed this farm all the way back to the 1700s. We grew up learning
traditional North Carolina values which include two of my ?? and ??
favorites. The importance of individual responsibility and ?? of not
meddling in other peoples business. It's not in this city in care of my
family, but it's not my best is to tell my neighbors down the road what
to do or interfere with his decisions. There is another value I was
taught to relates this and that's the golden rule that Carol who ??
earlier already mentioned. Treat the neighbors thyself, I don't</p>

I don't want my neighbor telling me what to do, and I have to resist the
temptation not to tell him what to do. These values, and this is
important, have always been a central part of what goes in North
Carolina government, and for centuries, starting when my family first
came to North Carolina, when the regulators stood up to royal
interference, we have always believed that people and their local
communities all have to decide what is good and right for them. This
Legislature, just this term, followed that principle when it looked at
placing limits on how cities could annex and control areas outside of
their limits, and it does not make sense to me now, that that same
Legislature would seriously consider a bill that amounts to telling our
county what we can or cannot do within our boundaries. If the
Legislature approves this bill, it will be voting against what the state
I love stands for, and I urge you to please vote against. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Ma'am. Tina Motley-Pearson [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, my
name is Tina Motley-Pearson, and I appreciate the opportunity to talk to
you today. I have lived in North Carolina my whole life. In fact, I'm a
fifth generation native on both sides of my family, and my daughter
makes the sixth generation. Durham was once a center for textile
manufacturing, and known the world over for tobacco products. When the
last cotton mill closed in 1986, and the last of the tobacco companies,
Ligget and Myers, left us in 1999, Durham faced a major employment
problem, and a downtown full of abandoned warehouses, and not much else.
Under strong leadership, we've come roaring back, and our downtown is
now the envy of many other cities. If you haven't been to Durham in 10
years, you wouldn't believe your eyes, and our unemployment is among the
lowest in the state. Clearly, we're doing something right. One of the
things that makes North Carolina a fine place to live, is the fact that
every community gets to make their own decisions, right or wrong.
Durham's leaders have had a great track record, why would you want to
change this? The state has no business dictating this kind of decision.
Durham has worked tirelessly to improve our downtown, and as we move on
to other areas that need to be revitalized, we do not need another
mini-city, 10 miles away on the county line, sucking up precious
resources. Why would you second-guess the decision of our local leaders?
Please vote no on Senate Bill 315. Thank you very much. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Ma'am. Donna Rudolph. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good
afternoon. Thank you for receiving us and letting us speak our minds.
Not long ago I finished a 20-year stint working in state government, not
in North Carolina, but in Mexico I worked for three governments. Many
Mexican legislatures were freely telling me what was wrong with the
United States, but more than once they told me what they admired abut
this country. We admire your towns and city governments, your towns and
cities have vitality, our are stagnant because they are run by the state
or the nation, that's why our young people leave home for Mexico City or
the United States. I think SB 315 puts North Carolina on that same
track. Since this country's founding, all levels of our government rest
on this principle - officials who make decisions should be accountable
to their voters. If the NC Legislature imposes a change on a city
contrary to the popular preferences the local council reflects, you
undermine the ability of citizens to decide their own future, thereby
breaking the representative government bond that holds North Carolina
and the United States together. Besides ignoring our local and national
government principles, SB 315 presents a threatening precedent to every
city in North Carolina whose city council dares to say no to development
the taxpayers refuse. Please stop 315, remembering the words of our
first Republican president - &quot;No man is good enough to govern
another man without the other's consent&quot;...Abraham Lincoln...</p>

Good afternoon, thank you for tha opportunity  about this important
issue. My name is compressed learn. I was born in North Carolina, with
the exception of one year I lived here my entire life. I spent a large
portion of my adult life living only in South Durham. I'm a lifelong
Republican and German makes me pretty rare. one of the central tenets of
the Republican Party is that important decisions, decisions are best
made by the people affected by then and the big government solutions
impose from afar almost always get it wrong. it's just common sense
folks on the ground will look will better understand the situation in
their backyard and politicians who live hundreds of miles away. this
bill, Senate Bill three fifteen a big government solution. if there ever
was one, would benefit to individuals at the expense of the citizens of
Durham, a big government payoff for Chilean speculators. is this what
you signed up for when you came to Raleigh Durham city Council voted
repeatedly not to annex the seven fifty one South property. they studied
the issue deeply they undertook a financial analysis of five our work
was almost one hundred pages long and that it would take a long time for
the city to recoup the cost, leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab. the
Council read reams of material and listen to hours of public hearings
and finally the city Council voted twice, most recently on June third
against the development of recent polling in your paper showed that
eighty seven percent approved of the Council 's decision. now some of
the general assembly want to impose a big government solution. they
think that somehow, they somehow know better than the citizens of their
own and their elected city Council and don't need to say the issues at
all this is that link and you know it's wrong, it's on Republican. it's

[SPEAKER] Good afternoon, My name is Thelma White. I stand in support of
751 South of Bill 315. I am the president of one of the larger
communities in Durham with over 200 homes and still building in South
Durham. And our community supports this bill. I’m in support of this
bill for several different reasons. I’m going to start off with jobs,
jobs and jobs. We need jobs in North Carolina and in Durham. We need
jobs. This project is going to bring over 1500 jobs when it’s being
built. And after it’s finished, it’s going to bring over 3000 permanent
jobs. We need jobs.
Also I have three small children in the school system. This project is
going to donate land for two schools, elementary, middle and possibly a
high school. It’s going to donate land for a sheriff’s station and also
for a fire station. This is good land. It’s not swampy land. It’s good
land, just clear the trees and build it.
And the school system approved of this and they accepted this in 2008.
And I’m asking you to please support this project and it’s a lot of
people in Durham who support this project, not just two people, the
builders. Please don’t delay it by their untruthfulness.
The money that will be saved for this school will be able to make us
hire more teachers and teacher’s aides. And I have small grandchildren
that need teachers and teacher’s aides. And it would also allow us to
purchase more supplies and reduce the classroom sizes. And we need that.
When another school was built in Durham, it costs us taxpayers in Durham
and Durham County $38 million just for the land. And another one it
costs $1.8 million to clear the land, and another additional $3 to $5
million to remove rocks for the school that’s been built on South
Rockford and Martin Luther King.
This project will save tax payers millions of dollars and allow us to
put the money where it needs to be which is in the classroom. I’m asking
everyone that supports this project to please raise your hand. Please
raise your hand. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jackie Whitestaff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good evening. Thank you for allowing us to come today
and speak before you. But I want to make three corrections that were
made by three different speakers in here that actually made some
falsehoods.
One, Mr. Moffit was not elected by the citizens of Durham. He was
appointed by four council members. There was another misstatement that
87 percent of the people in Durham had been told and that they were
against this. Well, as I can see, I didn't see any of us in that first
group. So, I don’t think we were every told. That’s another one.
I want to say that this project, we would like to see this bill go
forward. This should not be a political issue. I heard several things
back there about out of town land speculators. I think the people that
are developing this, they've been in the same place for at least 13
years. So, when you say out of town, do you mean moved here yesterday,
last week or whatever? But eleven years makes you a citizen of Durham in
my opinion.
There are some jobs that we need. Could everyone here that’s here for .
. .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] . . . 51.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair will control the agenda.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. There are some jobs that we need in Durham. We
have one of the highest unemployment rates in Durham. And it’s even
higher in the black community. And anytime there’s a possibility that we
can see jobs become available to us, we are to support that.
You know, I’m hearing all of these different arguments about why this
project shouldn't go through. But the problem we have, we have an
elected body that’s afraid to challenge another body of people that are
playing politics in Durham. And if that body can’t get it right, this
body needs to help our town get it right. So I ask you to support this
bill and get it right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma’am. Victoria Peterson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m Victoria Peterson. I’m sort of very embarrassed to
sit up here and listen at a lot of these lies. I mean just pure lies,
dishonesty. I have been in both political parties. Both political
parties.
I live in Durham. And let me give you the real scoop. If you look at the
African-American community in Durham, a lot of our young men need jobs.</p>

<p id="40:00">
We have a serious crime problem going on in our community. It's not all
over Durham, but it is in the African American community. Many of us see
this project of putting a lot of our young people to work in this
community. Now, there are many folks that do not live in the African am
community who are employed who have nice homes and nice families. They
may not be worried about these issues, but we are. Over the last several
weeks, we have had young men killing and murdering one another. If they
were employed, this kind of foolishness would not be going on in our
community. These folks are trying to do this development have a history.
I do not want to get myself in trouble here, but I'm gonna mention one
of the projects that they have worked on and that's creed. Creed. Creed
has hired Durham residents. Creed has five buildings in our community.
Five. They also have built a development in our community and matter of
fact, I will not embarrass anyone here, but we have retired legislators
that live in one of their communities that they have built. Please,
these are not just some jack lake developers just fell out of the sky.
These men have a history to our community to Durham and they have been
faithful to our community. They have hired our people. Many of our folks
that have sat on the city council, and I'm not gonna beat up on our city
council members, but I  remember we voted against the ball park in
Durham years ago. The citizens did, but the ball park was still built
anyway. Now, tell me why if everybody's concerned that the people who
represent us vote for something and they vote against it or for it, that
should cease, but that does not happen. Thank you very much. Oh, and
please support this project. Please support it and thank you very much.
[speaker changes]
Thank you, ma'am. ?? Allison.
[speaker changes]
Thank you very much. I want to thank the legislature for getting
involved. I want to commend you Madame Chair. This is not a political
issue, this is not a, it is a moral issue. I hoped that when I went to
church yesterday, and I would ask you all to read psalm 82. Basically,
you can help us. I'm gonna leave one word - two words with you--
H-E-L-P. You can help us with health issues, you can help us with home
issues, you can help us with economic issues, you can help us with
education issues, you can help us with legal issues. Don't make it
illegal, make it legal. It's legitimate for you all to get involved. And
the bottom line at ?? in HELP. We ask you to get involved. This is a
moral issue to do good. You all over here  have power. I hope you will
understand the moral purpose of power. You have the power, make it a
moral issue, get involved, help us from the precinct level all the way
to the policy level. We thank you. We need to think about the person who
just died recently, just was buried. Governor Jim Holshouser, excellent
republican. It's not about democrats. It's not about republicans. It is
about moral issue and human beings. Doing something. It's a moral issue.
Madame Chair, use your power in the purpose of good moral way. We need
your help legislators. Do not talk about - we come to you at the state
and at the nation, to make a difference in the lives of people. I've
been working over fifty years. I'm gonna tell you how long still trying
to look young, but in the meantime,it's in your hands legislators. Come
together and vote for this. Cause we've gotta develop it. I've not
always been for developers, but I'm on this one because they're gonna do
some things and they're gonna do it right. Please, it's a moral issue.
All of this bull jive about talking about getting involved, Get
involved! I want to thank you, and then I'll come back an say thank you
Mr. legislators, Mrs. legislators. You've done a good job. Support it.

Was recommended for delivery of orders sewer by the Durham city manager,
was also approved for rezoning by the Durham planning board, as well as
the Durham county commission. They did so because 751 South is a
walkable, connected compact, and sustainable community. The support for
this project in Durham is broad, diverse, and eclectic endorsed by the
following organizations. The Durham chamber of commerce, the Durham
association of educators, Durham association of realtors, the Durham
committee on the affairs of black people, the friends of Durham, The
Durham morning herald ?? Editorial board. Now I invite you to think for
a moment about the organizations I've just recited in support of this
project. Groups that are seldom if every aligned and suggest to you that
in addition to receiving the water and sewer request they request,
connections they request that the developers are also deserving the
Nobel Peace Prize. Their ?? good reasons that all these organizations
support 751 south. First and foremost it will stimulate the creation of
over 3,000 jobs, that's according to the UNC institute for economic
development. Their gonna buy a million dollars’ worth of water a day in
Durham at twice the going rate in a town that's recently raised water
and sewer rates on its citizens twice, without any expense to the city.
Because they're gonna build a water and sewer infrastructure and give
that to the city. In addition 751 south will pay for nine million
dollars in traffic improvements throughout south Durham including 2
million in traffic improvements which have no connection to the site
whatsoever. They're gonna give two school sites, a Durham county
sheriff's substation, and a fire station site. The first project in the
history of Durham where the developers voluntarily setting aside 10% for
portable housing. $450 million dollars in additional tax base to the
city. They meet all federal, state environmental law guidelines and the
project received a 96% grade for smart growth. They're adhering to the
yet to be enacted Jordan Lake rules. And again to those who argue about
this is interference with local government this project's been approved
by the Durham city manager, the Durham planning board, and the Durham
county commissioners, thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Sir. Alex Mitchell.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Madam Chair. My name is Alex Mitchell and I'm the President of
Durham Development. As you can see I have no horns, I'm not a monster. I
was born and raised in Winston-Salem. I spent my high school years
living in David County. I graduated from NC State. Married a girl from
Salem College, and we settled down in Durham about 15 years ago where we
live in the three ring circus that involves raising 4 boys. I'm proud to
call myself a native North Carolinian. I'm also proud to say that as a
local developer we have listened to the critics of this project and we
have responded. They screamed about traffic so we sat down with the NC
DOT and the city of Durham department of transportation. We agreed to
every single improvement that they requested. A total of more than $7
million. We later agreed to the mayor’s request to do another $2 million
worth of roadwork as new ?? to our project. They screamed about
protecting Jordan Lake so we took our 165 acre piece of property, we
surveyed every specimen tree, we designed our project around those
trees. We set aside 50 acres for open space, we committed to the county
in writing to cap our impervious service at 55% although we are allowed
up to 70%. Finally in 2010 we agreed to the yet to be enacted new Jordan
Lake rules. I would have thought the environmental groups including the
people's alliance would have run to our side and said look here's a high
profile project that is willing to use the rules that we have celebrated
as the savior for Jordan Lake, that didn't happen. That's when I
realized this is not about the environment, traffic, or any other
logical issue. This is simply growth versus no growth. This is not my
backyard. The people's alliance has vilified me and intimidated the
elected officials. They have worked through misinformation and lies to
make people scared to come out and support a project that is not only
good for Durham, but good for the state of North Carolina. They have
convinced the city council to ignore the decision of the county
commissioners that rezoned us. The advice of their own city manager to
sell us water and sewer in the recommendation for approval by their own
planning department. They convinced them to kill this project by denying
the precious resources of water and sewer. I'm here five and half years
after buying the property, I'm here three years after having it rezoned.
I am here after fighting and winning two Superior court cases financed
in part by members of the people’s alliance. I am here hoping that this
assembly sees that this isn't responsible government fighting
irresponsible development, but quite the opposite. It is irresponsible
government doing the bidding of no growth groups in order to stop
responsible growth, thank you.

<p id="50:00">
Thank you, Madame Chair. I’m Anita Keith-Foust. I’m a native of Durham.
Been there all my life. Almost 60 years. I want to let you know I was
very distressed sitting back here having to listen to things that were
not true talking about the project. I support SB 315. I also support
this project.
The reason I support it is this – I grew up in Durham when there was a
tobacco industry. Durham. I hear a lot of people saying they’re from
North Carolina. I’m from Durham. Proud to be from Durham. I grew up
going to school in the downtown area. I could smell the tobacco in the
morning. It smelled like oatmeal. Then when it was time to leave school,
it smelled like Fritos.
I really have to tell you that I was disappointed when the tobacco
industry left. But guess what? The jobs went away and our crime went up.
We started having people come in from Research Triangle Park. We
supported Research Triangle Park because we thought the jobs would go to
the people who live in Durham. We have a lot of people who are not from
Durham making decisions for us, who welcomed them with open arms.
Now the people in Durham who lost those… I can’t see that. You’re going
to have to tell me the time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One minute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. All right. The people in Durham. The poor people
in Durham. If you notice this is almost a black and white issue, even
though Alex is not black. But you see, the people who are supporting the
project are the people who don’t have any money. The people who need
jobs. Those 3000 jobs that Alex is trying to provide for Durham, other
people are probably going to come to Durham, too. They came to Research
Triangle Park.
Let me tell you about the tax situation. Nobody cares about whether the
taxes go up. My taxes on my house went from $600 to $2000 like that.
Nobody came out to help me. I’ve got to scrap it together the best I
can. Please give our people jobs. This SB315 would not be necessary if
all those things that Alex talked about, how the intimidation has gone
on. Help us.
During slavery time, we had to get help from people who would look out
for us, and they were outside of our community. We’re looking to you
because we couldn’t get it fixed. Please help us. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rebecca Board?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m here today to ask you to vote against this plan.
It intrudes into what the citizens of Durham have been asking for. The
citizens of Durham voted out many of the county commissioners who
supported this plan. The citizens of Durham opposed it so much that we
turned over. There’s a new majority in the county commissioners who not
have passed this.
The citizens of Durham are handling this on their own, locally,
discussions amongst ourselves, elections amongst ourselves. There’s no
intimidation. There’s just good communication. And the system is working
the way it should. We do not need people from North Carolina state
coming down and telling us how to conduct things in our won city. We’ve
got an excellent track record. We know what we’re doing Please let our
elected officials do what is wise in their own eyes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma’am. Melissa Rooney?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hello. My name is Melissa Rooney. I live at 301 Spring
Garden Drive in Durham, North Carolina. My stepdad is salt of the earth
people from Eden, North Carolina. I grew up raised Republican in
Martinsville, Virginia. And one of the things I was always told, from
Civil War history, Revolutionary/Civil War all the way to present day,
at least in Martinsville, Virginia, was that the Republican Party
believed in Town Hall meetings.
And I remember going to some Town Hall meetings in Martinsville,
Virginia, and seeing that as the foundation of Democracy. This is a town
hall meeting. This is a town hall meeting that has had several town hall
meetings in Durham. The people have decided that regardless of any
promises of jobs, regardless of private property rights, regardless of
environmental concerns, this is an issue about the boundaries of local,
state and even federal government.
The state of North Carolina is reaching over and negating multiple town
hall meetings in Durham, North Carolina. It’s disillusioning to me, it
should be disillusioning to any Republican. It should be disillusioning
to any American to see this happening in a microcosmic situation here,
when we read about it day in and day out at a federal level. I plead
with you not…</p>

...federal government got involved and Republicans were at the helm of
making that happen. We now have a situation where environmental concerns
are outweighing people's lives. Do the right thing. It's time that we
stand up and say that we are for the people who live in the communities
for which we govern. This is where we sit right now. I, for example,
bought property in northern Durham in which all of a sudden it went from
two acres per lot to three acres per lot. Why did I buy eight and half
acres? In order to split it up into two acres per lot so that each one
of my four children could have a house and we could call it home. What
can we call it now? Who's daddy's favorite. This is a problem. We are
regulated far more than what the State DNR has regulated for the area in
which we live. How did that become an issue? Because of this well-funded
PA organization that has come into or neighborhood and forced us to lose
property values and property rights. It is a property rights issue. It
is a do unto others as you want them to do unto you. It's been done to
me. Do the right thing and let's correct it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Joe ??. Joe Mouser? Mouse?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I thank you, Madam Chair and members of this committee
for allowing me to speak. I'm going to say to the State legislature,
you're responsible for us as citizens of the State of North Carolina.
And we're at a time now where jobs are paramount. Can we afford to turn
back 3,000 jobs when in Durham City we have neighborhoods that are
predominately black with over 50% unemployment. And I want my
legislators to hear this. Over 50% unemployment. So I ask you to support
this Senate Bill 315 and allow the State of North Carolina to have these
3,000 jobs. I want to say to you a lot of what's been said by the
People's Alliance representatives here today is just not true. First of
all, only one county commissioner got defeated last year and that was
me. The only one. The other thing is this project is not going to cost
the taxpayers of Durham anything. The developer bears all the expenses.
It's just unfortunate that we have to come to you in order to make a
wrong right. You have one organization with a lot of loud people and
people who command the papers in Durham who have beat back this project.
The majority of people in Durham want this project. When they came
before the county commission it was two to one. And I would say to you
today the majority of people here are in favor of the project. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. That completes our list of speakers.
I'm going to go to the committee now and questions from the committee.
Members of the committee. Mr. Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess staff, since they would explain the bill. I've
heard several times about the developer bearing all the costs and in
this explanation of the bill it says the property owner is reimbursed
for the cost of improvements made under General Statute 168-328 to the
extent generally required by the city. Could staff tell me what that
means?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Cohen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is correct that's stated by the bill but I don't
know what the City of Durham's policy is for reimbursing developers for
improvements in this situation. It says it shall conform to their
policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there someone here from the City of Durham that
could tell me how much the developer will be reimbursed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there anyone from the City of Durham that can
properly address this? Yes, sir. If you'll give us your name, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Tom ?? and it's ?? and I'm presently the Mayor of the
City of Durham. That speaks to the fact that if someone else comes along
and wants to use the water lines that the developer has paid for, they
would have to reimburse the developer for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Brawley?

<p id="65:00">
What does someone else mean, because developer, as he sells these houses
somebody else is gonna be using that water.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No it's not in the development. It's for persons who might tap into the
lines outside the development to make use of the, make use of the water
lines. The lines that are gonna go into the development and just like
any other development, the property owner who, who taps onto the, the
water pays for that. But as persons outside the development that might
use those ?? lines would reimburse the developer for expenses there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Wells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chairman. I'm glad to hear, see the Mayor's here. I
wasn't quite sure who to direct this to. For those of us who are not
from Durham, we've heard a lot about the city being required to extend
water lines, extend city services. How far are the water and sewer lines
from this property?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Mayor, if you would give us your name at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize, I said no, but I run public ??. My name is Bill Bell and
I'm the Mayor of the city of Durham, North Carolina. I don't know the
exact distance. It's really fairly close to the lines that are already
on 751, so I don't know the exact distance, but whatever that distance
is, the developers are gonna pay the full cost of that. The city won't
pay for it and the whole idea about double rates, the whole idea about
annexation is we have done an analysis of the development, we being the
city, and if the development were to develop at a certain pace, we feel
it would be about seven to eight years at least before the city could
recoup the services that it would provide. So that's why it's important
to change the charter from three years to ten years to allow that, not
just for this development, for anybody else who wants to voluntarily
annex into the city and wants water and sewer. So that, that's the
reason why that, that, that part is in, in, in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Wells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you're saying that by extending out the annexation time period,
we're, that helps the city of Durham get some tax space out there before
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It, it, it does, let, let me, do you mind if I follow up? I personally
don't want the state to come in and tell us that we have to run water
and sewer lines, but, but, but I'm going to preface that, but that
happened the last time, and I sent a message that if we weren't able to
get together with the developers, they were gonna run the same bill. I
went to my Representatives, Representative Michaux, Representative Larry
Hall, Representative Mike Woodick who sat on the city council, not
Senator, and Senator Floyd McKissick, and I said look, are there votes
in there to, to run this bill. And they said yes, you need to try to
work out something. So that's the reason that I'm here. That we did work
out something with the developer, it went to the city council, the city
council voted against it, I'm fine with that, and now it's back over on
this side. So there are, there are two issues to this, and it's not that
I was freelancing trying to get a better bill. I was freelancing to get
a bill because I've been told, if you don't do something, they're gonna
run it anyway. So that's why I did what I did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me see, I had some, yes, one more follow up, Mr. Wells we're over
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mayor, can you tell us to what extent the city is using its currently
available water and sewer capacity, plus, within ten percent or so?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If, if you ask, again, Mayor Bill Bell from the city of Durham, if
you're asking do we have the capacity to provide water and sewage to
this development, the answer is yes. We have the capacity. We've done
that type of analysis and it's no question. Based on where, where they
are, it would benefit us in terms of not annexing it and just providing
water and sewage because we're getting double the, double the rates. But
as I said, seven, eight, ten years out, when we would like, possibly, to
annex it we wanna make sure that we could do that, and our present
charter doesn't allow that because we only go three years that's why we
ask for ten years. But we have the capacity to provide water and sewer
to this development.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Representative Moore?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank, thank you, madam Chair. I guess I'm part of the reason we're all
here today. It's good to see everybody. The, the question that, that a
couple of folks wanted to make is why does someone who lives in the
Western part of the state care about what happens in Durham? Well, you
know what, we're all citizens of North Carolina, and I would submit to
you that what's good for Durham is good for North Carolina. The, in this
case, how did I get involved, I got involved because I heard the story
of what these folks were trying to do to bring jobs to this area. Where
they were trying to take an area and develop it, and trying to put this
land to the highest and best use. And I saw what I believed was the city
violating private land rights, mainly using access to water to thwart a
development that had been approved by the county. And that just seemed
fundamentally</p>

...fair to me. That I will submit to you that's unfair in Durham. It
would be unfair in Kinston, it would be unfair in Asheville, it would be
unfair anywhere in the State. And so as a result of the that, that's why
I began having some discussions with the members of the Durham
delegation, with a number of folks, in looking at legislation. I will
point out to the members that there was a bill filed initially that, at
least I was told, that the city was pushing that would have passed
legislation that would have essentially completely land lock this
project. I don't know if that's true or not but that's the way it was
portrayed. And that's how the whole prospect of the legislative
environment began. But over the period of time, I've gotten to see what
this family has done. The business they built with Cree Lighting, one of
the best companies in this State bringing jobs to Durham, to Alamance
County, counties all around this State. You've got folks who are showing
a great commitment. I wish they were trying to do this in my county. I
bet a lot of people sitting around this table would just be tripping all
over themselves to have this kind of development happening in their
county. Three thousand jobs. That's permanent jobs. Plus the
construction jobs on top of it. That's an incredible thing. Folks,
that's something all of us ought to be behind. I submit to you it's good
for Durham, it's good for North Carolina. Thank you.
[applause]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I naturally have to respond to
my good friend Tim Moore over hear. Didn't have any business sticking
his nose in Durham's business.
[applause]
It's up to the Durham people, it's up to the Durham delegation to do
what the people in Durham want to do. We're the ones who will have to
make the decision, Representative Moore. The people back here, both
sides, are the ones who are going to have to make the decision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of order. Are we addressing the issue now among
committee members or still taking public comments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is an open meeting and we have welcomed members
of the Durham delegation and also from the Senate, so it's permitted,
yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, Madam Chair, I appreciate your giving us the
opportunity to have both sides of this issue heard. We didn't need
Representative Moore in at all to help us make any kind of decision. We
will meet as a delegation before this matter is resolved and pass it on
and that's it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Representative Jordan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a couple of quick
questions and I don't know who would answer them, though. The first one
is why is this project paying double water rights? Who would answer
that, the Mayor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can answer. It's a policy, not just for this
project. It's a policy for any development that uses water and sewer
outside the city limits, they pay double the rates. The research
triangle park, for example. It's outside the City of Durham, they use
city water, they pay double the rates. So it's not unique to this
project. It's unique to any project that's outside the City of Durham
that gets the water and sewer utilities from the City of Durham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How far from Jordan Lake is this project?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would defer to the developers to answer that
question. I don't have the exact numbers on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Mitchell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I could have one responding, Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alex Mitchell, President of the Durham development.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you can answer that one question, Mr. Mitchell,
please, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] According to Judge Howard Manning, it's one mile from
Jordan Lake.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One mile, Mr. Jordan. We have the...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. Comment on the bill before us, Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. My understanding is that the rules
protecting Jordan Lake are for a half a mile out so that this project
apparently is a mile out. I think I agree with Ms. Allison and Ms.
Waguestaff that this sounds like a pretty good project to provide this
many jobs and I agree with Representative Moore that we would love to
have it in my area. I wish we could just transfer it since they don't
seem to want it. Some of them don't seem to want it. But, Madam Chair, I
think this is definitely something that would be good for the State,
good for the county, good for the city and I would support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. Two quick questions and I
think both of these would be for the Mayor of Durham if the gentleman
would yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Bell? Mayor Bell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mayor Bell. The first one is, is there an
alternative supply of water and sewer for this development or is the
City of Durham the only source?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me, again, Bill Bell, Mayor of the City of Durham.
Again, this is a matter that was done under the county commissioners. It
was not done on the city council. And I don't want to give you a lot of
history, but when the county commissioners approved the development and
when...</p>

<p id="75:00">
the developer's team for the city asked them for extension of water and
sewer utilities.  This city council said no, but we--we--we said no
because it was in litigation.  And we've made it very clear that we were
not going to address the issue of city and water--city and sewer
utilities as long as it under--under litigation.  The developer's
lawyers said look, you've had this for a certain period of time;
according to your policy you owe us an answer.  We said if you want an
answer, we're gonna [sic] give you an answer.  The answer is no. That's
the answer we gave them--to deny that.  Then, as I understood it, the
developers were then looking at using the county sewage treatment plant
and possibly digging wells to do their project.  Beyond that, I don't
know of any other source of water.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  A second question, ma'am. [crosstalk]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I inferred from--from an earlier answer, and I just want to correct my
understanding.  If you were to supply water and sewer as an un-annexed
development, that the statutes require you to annex it within three
years or else you lose the ability to annex at any time in the future
and that's where the additional cost comes in--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No-Not--again, [??] bill [??] the City of Durham.  That is not quite the
way it is.  Presently under our annexation rules, we're saying that if
you want city and water services, you have to apply to be annexed into
the City of Durham.  And we approve the annexation, within three years
we'll provide--we're required to provide--to annex you, and provide the
services:  police, fire protection, water, and sewer.  If you also ask
the water and sewer extension along with the annexation, we can begin
supplying the water and sewer as soon as it's feasible.  But, after
three years, if we haven't--haven't annexed you, okay, you're
automatically annexed to the city.  We can't--we've gotta [sic] do it
within a three year period of time.  What we're saying is for this
development, the due diligence that we did indicated it wouldn't
pay--pay us back to annex them until seven or eight years out.  So,
therefore, we asked our charter to be changed from three years to ten
years, which would allow the developer--if we approved it--to get the
water and sewer, begin his development; seven to eight years out when it
looks like it's feasible, then we could go ahead and annex and start
providing other services.  And then the water rates will go down to what
an annexed area would be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, I believe this is your bill, and we'd like to give
you the opportunity to make any comments, sir, that you would like to
make.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll keep my comments very abbreviated.  I'd first like to thank the
Chairperson for holding this public hearing today.  I think it's always
an excellent opportunity when people can come out--regardless of their
position--on an issue and articulate it and do it succinctly.  So this
particular House Finance Committee can consider the merits of the bill,
or the lack thereof, as the case may be.  When Senator Wood and I first
put this bill forward, I there was some confusion about what that bill
consisted of.  It was simply a bill, at that time, to allow the City of
Durham to move forward with the design, build--method of construction
for a new police headquarters.  So, when it was submitted, it had
nothing to do with 751, it had nothing to do with annexation, or any of
the issues that are here today.  What did occur in the interim was that
the city council of Durham did vote the project down.  Representative
Moore did take interest in this particular project, and we worked
together to look what could be done to replicate what would have been in
the original agreement negotiated between the mayor and the developer as
it relates to that project  What you see before us in the PCS is
essentially the essence of what that agreement was that was negotiated
with the blessings of the city [??] intervening with the mayor; and of
course, the developer.  So that's what's before you--it's--it's--what
you do with this bill--you've heard the public comment.  The Durham
delegation will be meeting tomorrow.  Hopefully, we can reach some
consensus on it.  I don't know if we will.  I have reason to believe it
may be a divided vote among us.  But, I just don't know.  We know right
now--looking and hearing from the audience that is here, that the city
and the County of Durham are divided.  There is no simple answer here.
So I think it's a matter of evaluating what we have before us,
determining whether it is in the best interest of the state to
intervene, whether it's better to leave it local government to make
decisions which they have already made, or whether there is some other
alternative that's not before you at this time that could be considered.
 There are a number of tweaks or potential revisions that could be made
to this particular PCS; which, if this goes forward, I would hope that
they would be made as the bill is considered by this committee.  Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. I see no other hands or comments.  I want to thank the
audience for your patience--and I know many of you have been standing on
the back for over an hour.  And, I appreciate--I appreciate you being
here and I believe we've had a good and fair hearing, and at this time
we st--[end of data]</p>
