Call the meeting to order. Sergeant-at-Arms today Marvin Lee, Barry
Moore and Doug Harris, and McQuaid, and I appreciate what they've been
working hard to get stuff out since we had a committee in here before,
took up the place. Our pages are Skin Williams, Chad Turtleton, Benjamin
Tweeter and Jane Sulliban. I appreciate you people being with us today.
I'm going to shift a little bit because the people got some other places
to be. Try to help them get to the committee that they need to be in
elsewhere. We're going to start with House Bill 691. Representative
Lucas? This is the PCS, you going to have a motion for that?
Representative Collins make the motion. All in favor of the PCS being
forwarded say aye, all opposed no. The ayes have it, the motion's
carried. Representative Lucas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. This bill came to me from
Fayetteville Technical Community College, a local community college that
serves Cumberland County and serves Ft. Bragg. And I represent District
45 which includes Ft. Bragg, largest military installation in the United
States. The issue here is, you see we have a very active community
college and serving our soldiers there. Out of approximately 56,000
active duty soldiers, about 5,000 of them are enrolled in a course at
FTCC towards achieving their associate degree. As you are well aware of,
the country has had several wars going on and Ft. Bragg has played an
integral part in that with numerous deployments of soldiers to foreign
theaters of operation. And additionally, when they come back they don't
always stay at Ft. Bragg. They often are conduct what's called a PCS, a
permanent change of station, to another military installation. So the
issue here that this bill is addressing is you have a soldier who starts
with a North Carolina community college, their education, they may get
deployed somewhere, they get transferred to another State. My example,
from Ft. Bragg to Ft. Hood, Texas. Now what happens when they go there?
They might be deployed again. The issue here is that we want to make
sure that people who start their education in a North Carolina community
college can actually achieve their degree from that North Carolina
community college, not stop that education and then pick it up somewhere
else. That saves the service member money. It helps us and it's just
really showing that we're a very military friendly State by what we do.
The PCS is there, you can see the summary. It adequately lays out all
the different parts of that. I've just told you what the bill
accomplishes. We have Dr. Larry King here, the President from FTCC.
Also, Dr. Mary Shoeping, who represents the community college system.
They're both very much in support of this bill. In summary, for the
small amount that we might be forgiven, $11 or $12 for every credit,
what we're gaining is the fact that we're showing soldiers that we care.
We're relieving that potential burden on them. We're keeping soldiers
who PCS somewhere else and they're deployed, the opportunity to finish
their education in a community college in North Carolina and not lose
their investment and frankly, not lose our investment in the fact that
they've started here so that they can finish here. And it really is an
incentive to those soldiers to continue on to degree completion. And it
just continues to show to our soldiers, to the State, that we are a
military friendly State. I ask for your support on this bill and I'll
entertain any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, very much, Mr. Chairman. I agree with
Representative Szoka. I recognize that they're issues that
appropriations will have to resolve when the bill gets passed, if it
does there. But as a matter of educational policy and as a matter of
security policy for the country, actually, I think this is really an
excellent bill and at an appropriate time, Mr. Chair, I'd like to move
for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Representative Tolbert? Representative Lucas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Representative Glazier has
already beat me to the punch on what I desired to say.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Sheppard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, Mr. Chair. I'd like to ask the bill...</p>

sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yeah, I hear you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Szoka, have any of the community
colleges weighed in with you on this, and do they have a staff, a
community college presence or anything on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well Dr. Larry King, who's President of the
Fayetteville Technical Community College is in support of the bill, and
he's here today.  Also the community college system has said that they
support this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Graham, G. Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chair.  One question to the presenter.
Would this also impact on continuing education courses?  Could we make
it applicable to continuing ed courses, or is it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, it was just to achieve the associates degree
because they start a course of study, and it's to completion of that
course of study, so it really wouldn't apply to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yeah, I was thinking that there may be a training
program where they would get CEU, or continuing education credit and the
fees could be applicable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, that's a good idea.  The majority of what
soldiers are enrolled in the community college for is to achieve their
associates degree.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very much Mr. Chair, I move a favorable
report for House Bill 691, and re-referral to committee on
appropriations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]So, wait, this is a?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Sorry, favorable to the PCS, unfavorable to the
original bill, re-referral to the committee on appropriations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Any discussion on the motion?  Hearing none, all in
favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]All opposed say no.  Ayes have it, the motions carried.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Cleveland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]House Bill 239.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman.  House Bill 239, Non-resident
scholarships out of state tuition, would remove the prerogative of the
university system of giving in-state tuition to out of state students
that come in under the various and sundry programs that Morehead, Cain,
and others.  Presently we're spending $6 to $8 million, a little more
subsidizing these scholarships, and it is something I do not feel, and
others do not feel that the state should be subsidizing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  For those of you
who don't know much about the Morehead scholars and the Parks scholars,
these young people who come to our state and take these scholarships are
some of the most extraordinary students in the entire country.  And they
come to North Carolina, they make tremendous contributions here, many of
them end up staying here.  In fact, our own Jerry Cohen, who has done
such a great job here at the General Assembly was a Morehead scholar who
came to North Carolina from Connecticut, and stayed and made incredible
contributions.  I think it would be penny wise and pound foolish to not
support bringing the best and the brightest to our campuses to make both
contributions to our campuses and to our state.  But the other thing
that you need to understand is, if we cut this money out, the Morehead
and then the Parks there at NC State, their foundations will have less
money, and they'll still want to bring out of state students, but what
the result will be, is that they'll just have fewer scholarships.  And
that will be fewer scholarships not just for the out of state students
that they have to pay for, but the in-state students.  And so our own
North Carolinians will have fewer opportunities for these incredible
educational, and work experience, and cultural additions to this state.
And you know, sometimes we have to protect our crown jewels, the things
that make this state special.  And these programs at our public
universities</p>

Fees, but this isle says things than I would strongly urge the committee
to vote against this L um and let's hold North Carolina tool higher
standard than simply , is chairman of the isolated as of the students
and the  scholarship programs are from the state of North Carolina
independent states which the scholarships a passive told me that 50% of
the graduates and staying or state of North Carolina residents , I
cannot think the taxpayers North Carolina to be subsidizing the
education of people from Austria and the brothel Turkey again, the
United Kingdom I don't think they should be subsidizing the education of
a bit from Georgia telephone we have been made I do not fall program I
think it's a good program (SPEAKER CHANGES)  I just didn't think that we
as citizens in the state should be subsidizing the reconnaissance and
this will be fewer students will get scholarships however if the
university system feels this is a worthy program they come up with money
within their system which are a host of other sources including tax when
they come up with the money in their system to cover the state solution
to these four and announced a two and represents them like to support
this bill if you look at the pass some repair the first paragraph very
less sense these persons must be consumer resolution or, for all
purposes by using must be given if a commission but they're not and
cannot display the display this idea that old proverb project much is
given much more should be given that might be the principle of theology
but it's not a good principle of us to screen the tax lines emerging
Cleve is exactly right we had no duty to distribute tax funds to people
from other nations or other states that inflation thank you very much is
chairing the only really rise to 22 fundamentally disagree with the
spill on five-hour simply when you are on the same page two years ago
when we all know the number of us here in both parties to get rid of the
Cal state athletic scholarships but that's very different from the
academic scholarships their ideas will inform the C with New
Orleans,(SPEAKER CHANGES)  it's not just a Morgan hill there are, 10
merits and user merit scholarship programs, and that of the 10 or
institutions are so many of us have universities of benefiting from the
eye and what is essentially of scholarships to, is a lot of the
scholarships are funded by private money a public money we put it simply
leverages that allows them to create additional scholarships and so the
net effect of the culmination of the money allows play on scholarship to
have a lower cost which thereby allows the program have more in state
students receiving scholarships that they would otherwise be able to
uncover the scholarships by the donors to the university's have a
certain percentage about the state scholarships to have to be part of
that in order for the funding to continue from the dollar so we don't
allow that's how we essentially cut back in fact that some of the
scholarship cases may end up winning scholarships to eliminate any new
scholarships and Wilbur chief liberty in state students because the
money is coming in will they all have to go for the out of state does
not want to happen, I think it's really a porch and I was well that we
get them in the statute several years ago so that ended in a string the
scholarships 116143.6 says that the institutions still have to maintain
the current number of North Carolina residence entered into the
institution that is the scholarships for taking the place of the north
Carolina’s to their own funds some brilliant as state students that will
increase the research and prestige and we (capacity of the school's
stadium are staying allow for recruitment, in the other students were
brilliant, North Carolina State year as a philosophical matter we spent
hundreds of millions of dollars last year supporting subsidized, tax
credits and incentive programs to bring in our state businesses

business capital in this state.  Why are we oppose to spending a little
bit of the money to bring in the human capital from out of state to keep
in this state and move us forward?  And so, because I think this
actually creates more in-state capacity, adds prestige to the
university, doesn't take away any in-state spots, and really does all
the things we would want to happen in a university community, I would
really hope that we would defeat this amendment, for the same reasons we
came together to get rid of the athletic scholarships, the reverse
reason exists to keep the academic scholarships and the talent in North
Carolina, and at our university, and I would be voting no on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Gliddon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman.  It's my understanding that the
larger organizations that have these scholarships, basically are
required to have 50% of the students  residents of the state.  They may
drop a couple of students, I don't see where that's any humungous harm.
 I'd like to point out that 4 or 5 years ago, there was about $2 billion
in federal and state aid for tuition to the universities.  Today, that
amount is pushing $4 billion.  I would think there's sufficient aid out
there to make sure that if this student, and North Carolina resident,
that got dropped from this program, that he would not suffer the loss of
his education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I am opposed to this bill and
I'm going to give an example, kind of echoing Representative Glaziers
comments.  If you look at the Levine scholarship, that goes to the
University of Charlotte, it has by the foundation, 15 allotments that
cannot be reduced.  It's not permissible by the foundations statute, so
what the net affect of this bull, if it passes is, you're going to
increase the cost, because 4 of those are automatically out of state,
based on the foundation.  You will eliminate 8 other scholarships that
are given primarily to in-state students that go to UNC Charlotte if
this bill passes.  Just that case, and that to me is concerning, because
I agree with Representative Cleveland on principle, what I'm concerned
about is the unintended consequences of some of the foundations and the
detrimental impact it will have on our in-state students, national merit
scholars and others that are going to lose funding because some of these
foundations don't have the option to reduce their scholarship from 15 to
12.  That's not permissible.  And that's why I would oppose this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I was curious when you mentioned
Representative Cleveland in the bill of the sundry scholarships, and I
curious about what that, if somebody could provide that list, and I want
it in a comments.  Does the staff have a list of those scholarships?  I
know Morehead was one that was mentioned.  What was the others, or would
you know, Representative Cleveland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I honestly don't know.  Parks is one, Levine
scholarship.  To give you an exhaustive list, I couldn't.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]A follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]If I can just comment on the bill then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chair.  the fact that we don't know.  I
mean, I think we need to know what we're doing before we do it, that's
number 1, but I also believe that as had been said, there's going to be
an indirect negative impact on our state students.  I also believe that,
from the things that I hear about around here, there's not a lot of
value placed on students who come to North Carolina to be educated, who
has been mentioned.  Many of the students stay, I'm one of those
students who came to be educated and stayed.  I think I made a
tremendous contribution, paid taxes and done some other things,  I think
we need to place a little more value on what students who come to North
Carolina bring to our state, to add to the diversity of our university
programs and have an overall positive impact of what we do here in North
Carolina.</p>

And  I don’t believe that with the problems that universities are having
now with funding with even foundation funding dwindling that we can just
say that it’s gonna be easy for these universities to come up with the
money, I just don’t believe that. It’s very difficult now for students
to be able to stay in school and to get an education so I’m opposed to
this bill and I hope that you vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Represent ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman I didn’t say it would be easy for the universities to come
up with the money, I said, that if these programs were such a benefit to
the universities that they could come up with the money, I neglected to
state that the bill holds harmless those that are already in the
program, and moving forward they would be funded at the in-state rate.
And I would think that would assist the various foundations in adjusting
their programs to do what they have to do to remain viable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I‘d like to ask the bill’s sponsor. The bill as
I understand it says all of the scholarships. So what percentage, I’m
curious, we’ve heard comments here about the merit end. What percentage
of these scholarships are merit? There are lots of kinds of, lots of
types of scholarships, for lots of reasons. So is this scholarship
program truly targeted or the result is that we really do get a
significant number of high performing students?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think each program has different criteria for their program. The
Morehead-Cain does go out looking for exceptional students and they
recruit them. Exactly how they go about recruiting them, I’m not really
sure ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My point, Representative Cleveland, is if these scholarships are in fact
oriented to or achieving the goal of bringing high performing students,
that creates an environment on our college campuses that we want, and I
can’t help but believe that a reasonable percentage would find North
Carolina a good place to stay and do business and that they would be
students that our industries here in North Carolina would want to
recruit so that my  concern about eliminating these scholarships  with a
broad brush when in fact they help our universities raise the bar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re not eliminating the scholarships with a broad brush they’re maybe
some reductions in the various programs. I can’t take that as fact cause
I don’t think is fact, it’s gonna depend on what the university system
wants to support and if they are really interested in this diversity
that they claim they are interested in they should support this. I do
not see or expect a drastic change in the way the number of students and
in the way things are going on right now. It’s just taking the
taxpayer’s dollar direct dollar support out of the equation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, just to respond to several points and to speak a second time
on the bill. First Representative Horn is absolutely correct that all of
the scholarship services are merit based this is not a need based
program, they are all merit based scholarships that we’re talking about.
Second the institutions that are affected by this in numbers are AFT,
Eaton, Elizabeth City State, FSU, NCA&amp;T, North Carolina State, UNC
Ashville, UNC Chapel Hill, UNC Charlotte, UNC Greensboro, The School of
the Arts, those are the institutions that have these scholarships. There
may be others but those are the ones I’ve been able at least accumulate.
And just sort of in response to that, there is no question for some of
these scholarships by taking out the state money either the scholarship
will simply have to fold or in some of these cases the rest of them they
will not be able to offer the numbers of scholarships nor the numbers of
in-state scholarships that they’re currently offering because we</p>

Help cover the cost and it seems to me again that we ought to be
encouraging best in the business talent to educate and stay and build
businesses and come to the state and we do in every other thing we do
here. This is the minimal price that we pay to bring these people and
really rev up the reputation of our universities and our business
entrepreneur in the state.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I heard a lot of anecdotal evidence and I'm not
the educational expert on the panel here but I'm ?? of a little bit of
balance to what I've been hearing. These foundations are totally
independent for the state of North Carolina for it's decision making on
how many scholarships they offer.
Isn't that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Couldn't this have an affect on system we have now? Couldn't this have
an affect on actually costing tuition money and increasing tuition on
other students.
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The possibility exists, I couldn't ?? say it would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I think we should keep tuition down and this is a good step on
this bill.
Follow up, Mr Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have leaved it and affect hasn't been mentioned. Could also be that
these foundations decided to opt for more in state scholarships. The
reputation and designation of the best bargain nationally makes us feel
great but it's there to serve students, primarily North Carolina
students and that's just an opinion I'd like to share and support the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, and I'm glad Representative Iler made those points because I think
he is getting down to the basic math problem here. I think there is idea
out there that there is some free money that if we supplement these
foundations, somehow the money doesn't disappear elsewhere. But we
subsidize our in state students about $13,000 per student per year. So
just to make the math easy, if this affected a thousand students that
maybe more than it affects but we'll use that because it has lot of
zeros, effect would be that the university, board of governors will have
an extra 13 million dollars that they could apply to its priorities. Now
that maybe for merit scholarships for some people, it may be more needs
based, maybe for cutting tuition but the priority will be decided by our
board of governors and our assembly and not by these private decisions
of these wonderful foundations but nevertheless, no matter how wonderful
they are, they are private. It's also disproportionally chapeled here in
NC state, you give a list of other but really the big numbers are
chapeled here in Raleigh.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Folks, we are delivering this point and this bill it does go after
appropriations after here. Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question it goes a long line before the last few speakers have
mentioned. Does anybody know how much money these programs are costing
to the state of North Carolina and exactly what the savings would be if
we cut it? I'd like to hear some numbers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do have a staff person to say she has that number.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Andrea ??, physical research division. If every non
resident receiving one of these scholar ships, we'd have to pay non
resident tuition instead of resident tuition and total additional
revenue would be about 7.9 million dollars. Under representative
Celveland's bill, the impact would be phased in over the years as
different classes phase out the impact would accumulate so the estimated
impact in the first year since everybody has already been awarded these
scholarships would be zero additional revenue, 14-15 just under 2
million dollars of additional revenue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Ross, a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much and I'll be brief. This goes back to Pennywise</p>

foolish, and many of the points that were made by representative Horn.
If these students don't get the benefit of any of these scholarships,
they're simply going to go to school and other states.  And their talent
will go to other states, and that's a decision this general assembly to
make that we think that every bit of talent is here in North Carolina,
and that we shouldn't benefit from some of these folks.  But, these are
kids to get accepted to MIT.  These are kids to get accepted to
Stanford.  And if these opportunities are not here in North Carolina for
them, they're smart consumers.  They'll go somewhere else.  Mr.
Chairman, I would just like to call for the ayes and no's when we do the
vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, you may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to point out that the house voted to do this during
appropriations deliberations in the last session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I heard someone say that if we pass
this that, or if we don't pass this that tuition will go up.  Is that
what I heard?  Question for the bill's sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't think that was the statement that was made.  I think the
statement was that the costs at the universities, fees and whatnot,
could possibly be increased to support the programs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess what I'd like to remind the committee of is the fact that part
of the funding for the Moorhead scholarships or the park scholarships
comes from the fact, as representative Glazier said, that a lot of
matching money is made available to the college's if they give these
scholarships to people who come from out of state.  And then, the other
thing that I'd like the committee to consider is how many of your
children have ever gone to school in places other than North Carolina?
There you go.  And how many of those states, where you have sent your
children to school, have footed at least part of the bill to make sure
that your student got there?  I would say that there are a lot of
opportunities that are given to students in other states in other parts
of the country modeled after what North Carolina does currently.  I
would absolutely hate to see these opportunities go away, and I will be
voting against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This bill fundamentally says that the
university can call something something that it is not.  Either we have
an in-state student, or we do not.  That's a question here.  We're going
to say something is what it is not, or that it is not what it is.  And
so, that's the basis we need to vote on, and I support the bill on that
basis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Folks, I don't have anyone else, and I need a motion at this time.
Representative Gill, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do have my hand up.  I just wanted to ask one question.  I don't know
whether the staff would be able to answer the question, or the
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
By the way, this is the last person.  We're gonna vote after this, OK?

That's fine.  Or the presenter.  We talk about the amount of money that
we pay toward the scholarship.  We don't talk about the amount of money
that the private group pay to North Carolina.  So I would like to know
what percentage of money has come from North Carolina through these
scholarships.

and Mr. Chair, with your permission I'd like to recognize that Dr. Garry
Green is ?? The president of Pasai Technical community college, and I'm
sure he'd be happy to answer any of your questions that might remain
after my presentation. This bill is the re-purposing of 3 million
dollars that was allocated to Pasai technical community college way back
in 2005.
The original intent of this 3 million dollars was to construct a
facility within an economic development project located at the edge of
Winston Salem. This property originally was part of RJ Reynolds tobacco
company. It was ther warehouses. Some of their factories. And this
project is being overseen by wake forest university. You might be
familiar with this economic development project by the name of Pedmont
triad research park. But it is recently been re-branded as the wake
forest innovation quarter. You may be wondering why here we are in 2013
talking about the utilization of money that was appropriated in 2005.
This economic development project has taken perhaps a little bit longer
than Pasai tech and others had originally expected. For a number of
reasons. First, we had the downturn in the economy. Second there was a
lot of infrastructure that was required of this part, including the
movement of railroad tracks, which is a big endeavor. Second, some of
the executives at Wake Forest university had changed over time. And most
importantly, and what is the driver of this bill, as the developers also
changed. The new developer is Wexford and in its agree</p>

Met with White Forest University. No longer could Versailles Tech
construct a building there. The new agreement requires private sector
ownership so that the community college will need to lease space rather
than purchase a part of an existing building or land for a new
construction. What this bill will do is this $3 million dollars will be
divided into $300,000 dollar payments over a period of a decade for the
operations and lease for this building. It will be called the Center for
Emerging Technologies. It will be involved in biotechnology,
nanotechnology which is a fascinating innovation if you're not familiar
with it. We're very fortunate to have a leader in nano technology, David
Carol [SP] at White Forest University. Also a design, an advanced
information technologies program, a small business center and corporate
and industrial training programs. Again I emphasize this is not new
money, it is just re utilizing and re-appropriating through the
community college system the $3 million dollars that was granted back in
2005.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, thank you Mr. Chairman and good morning
ladies and gentleman. You have in front of your a local bill, house bill
537 which is simply reducing the terms of the board of education members
from six years to four years. Moving forward anyone who is currently
serving under the six year term will be allowed to continue doing so but
this is basically changing those terms moving forward from six years to
four years. Out of the 115 LEA's in the state of North Carolina, only
four have terms that exceed four years and the [??] school district is
one. So this is an effort to get us more in line with the other school

<p id="50:00">
To look broadly at bringing students into the program that could
successfully complete it because they could have an opportunity to get a
bonus as a result. Now I said that in Florida this program has worked
quite successfully and part of that is illustrated by the numbers that
have occurred since this program has basically been in effect down there
since the school year 2007 and 8. They have something that are called
career and professional academies and each school district in the state
of Florida beginning back then was required to have at least one of
these cape academies operating in the school district. They have in fact
since this program has started expanded very dramatically.
Students who are in these cape academies and who are taking the
certifications and completing them successfully, over the roughly four
years now that the program has been in place shows several things. But
basically all of them are that their grade point averages are higher,
their drop out rate is lower, their absences are lower. Various of the
measures that we look at. They're earning their high school diploma. If
they go through these more rigorous courses that are leading to jobs
then they do better in school.
A final point that I will offer on this is that the data would suggest
that this is true across all ethnic groups in the state of Florida.
looking just at the 2011 membership the white membership in Florida was
42.42% and essentially the rate at which they were completing these
certifications their percentage was about 45%. Not sure that
statistically that little difference between 42.42 is much difference.
For African-Americans the statewide percentage of the overall membership
is just under 23% and their percentage of completion of certifications
is at the same level, just under 23%. The Hispanic population 28.5%,
their certifications completions rate is right at 26%. So it is across
all groups that this benefit is being spread. And so I would like to
close by simply saying that we are pleased that the North Carolina
Association for Career and Technical Education has described this as an
excellent bill, it has their full support, and I hope the committee will
support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Bill you're first up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman I just wanted to say that it
sounds liie a good bill and I wanted to know if the state board endorsed
it. Sounds like it's going to call for a lot of collaboration between
state board and the school systems to get this moving.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The liaison from DPI is here, she may want to speak on
it. It's my understanding is that they are supportive of the basic
intent that lies behind the bill. They are a little antsy I'll say about
the use of incentives for teachers. But my concern is that if we're
going to use data from other areas and we've got a model that worked,
I'd hate for us to say well we're going to delete pieces of it and
expect it to do as well here. So I think it's worth our piloting it and
we're going to follow this and if it doesn't produce the results I hope
we will abandon it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill you had a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could we hear from her?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Who do we want to hear from, Joanne? Honeycut, who is
CTE director to the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. The department of public
instruction and career and technical education already collaborates with
a lot of the entities that this bill names. It's part of our standard
practice in developing programs of study for students in career and
technical education. We collaborate with department and commerce and
work force development boards as a matter of practice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.

Representative Luebke.
[speaker changes]
To speak on the bill.
[speaker changes]
you may speak on the bill.
[speaker changes]
Thank you. I may be the only one thinking along these lines.
Representative Wilkins and I usually agree on everything but I am really
troubled by this bill because we're going down, particularly if I take a
glance at the next bill, about AP incentives. We're going down a road of
providing bonuses for teachers, a kind of - a sort of a merit pay for
engaging in a particular part of the curriculum. And that seems to me to
be very very troublesome. I heard the representative from DPI, Mrs.
Honeycutt, say that they were already collaborating with school
districts. I am a very very strong supporter of CTE. We have one of the
best CTE programs in Durham - in the whole state and our school board is
encouraging our faculty to expand in the area of CTE etc, but what this
bill does is actually then puts money int he hands of teachers and
students, if I'm reading it right, who go down a particular track. I
don't think that's a good way to go. I mean, I wanna know, for example,
surely we need to have young people understanding globalization. Where
is the bonus for getting students t get scholarships to go to college-
four year scholarship to study issues of globalization? Why not that? To
me, there's no difference between studying globalization, studying CTE,
or increasing AP participation. They're all important activities that
we're doing.  We should not be starting to go down a road of giving
teachers bonuses, students bonuses to do things that are really their
job. And to me, it does distort - a phrase that's popular around here -
the marketplace, distorts the marketplace because it really would say to
teachers, You know, you get a little bit of money now granted Mr. Stam
is right, it's not a whole lot of money, but still, you're giving people
money to push students in one direction as opposed to another and I
submit to you that globalization - what could be more important than
having our students get prepared for globalization? I just,
Representative Blackwell, can you tell me why it's a good idea to be
shooting money to teachers, a kind of merit bonus for pushing in a
direction? Why is this a good idea as opposed to supporting the program
which I totally do.
[speaker changes]
I guess it's a, perhaps, a philosophical divide. If there is the concept
that teachers who do a good job should they be paid somewhat differently
than teachers who are not getting results, then it seems to me you want
to take advantage of this. We have a program that worked rather
dramatically so far in Florida enhancing the very things that I think
you are alluding to when you talk about globalization. Globalization
largely means preparing students so that they can compete in a global
marketplace. That means more rigorous career-type work and it means
having a relationship to jobs that are available in the global economy.
That is precisely what we would be rewarding.
[speaker changes]
But globalization could also be having someone study political science,
or sociology, or economics. We could continue this conversation</p>

<p id="65:00">
looking outside this room, but I do want to ask one other thing about
your bill.  I'm very troubled about the idea that the Department of
Commerce is gathering some data on economic employment needs and somehow
that’s being thrown into the mix as we determine how big the bonuses
should be.  Do we really want to say that the intent of our high school
programs is to directly link itself to where there's job shortages in
one particular year.  That seems to be really troubling.  We can
disagree on all the rest of it, but bringing in the Department of
Commerce to tell us which jobs have the greatest shortage in this year.
That  seems to me we're crossing a real new line there. What do you
think about my concerns there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Again I suppose the
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Folks we've got a bill before us.  We're gonna move
on and I'm gonna vote right now and we're not gonna answer your
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chairman.  Could we have at least
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes. Representative Lucas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  a division on the vote please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Pardon?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  A division, so I can see whether I'm all alone with
my concerns here or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  A division.  Show of hands on the vote.  All in favor
of the motion raise your hand.  All opposed.  The motion passes.  Before
us next is 969. Yeah. By the way you people remember who is Chair up
here.  Sometimes you're trying to bypass me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chairman this is the other piece that deals with
those student who are on a college ready trajectory. Nobody is forced
into one of these things, but again the desire is to have students
better prepared for whatever they might choose to do after high school
by taking more rigorous preparation and hopefully helping them get a
head start on completion of work that may get them credited at the
college level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Blackwell let me interrupt you.  I got
a pcs Representative Cleveland vote that's before us.  All in favor say
aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  All opposed.  The ayes have it.  Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Here again the explanation is somewhat similar to the
earlier explanation on CTE.  In this instance the data goes back over a
longer period of time, but it does again come from Florida.  In 2000 the
State of Florida began working under the system that is akin to what we
have attempted to duplicate in House Bill 969.  Some of the data is
worth taking just a moment to tell you about.  From 1991 through 1999
that's before the full program was in place in Florida, there was a 67%
increase in the number of students in Florida taking the AP exams.  From
99 through 2012 there was a 391% increase.  That's just the number
taking it.  For the same time periods there was an 86% increase in that
first period in the number of AP exams taken and there was a 404%
increase from 1999 to 2012.  From 1991 through 1999 without the full
program in place there was  a 100% increase in the number of students
passing AP exams.  From 99 through 2011 there was a 316% increase.  The
greatest impact in Florida has been on rural and minority students.
From 99 to 2012 there was a 585% increase in the number of Hispanic
students taking AP exams.  For the same period 99 through 2012 there was
a 710% increase in the number of African American students</p>

Taking the exams while the numbers are not quite as high there are some

Of our teachers because we have just not made an effort to increase the
salaries of our teacher who work hard everyday on behalf of our children
and one day when we are gonna get to that point, incentives are fine, I
think teachers are ought to be doing what they are supposed to be doing
anyway but I don't believe we need to believe in any teacher or any
student behind and when we don't do something for the collective body of
teachers who are working with our children, making a serious commitment,
I think we are just creating a problem we shouldn't have. Our teachers
shouldn't have moral problems that they have because it doesn't appear
this the general assembly is really concerned about the work they are
doing. I have a grandson who is 11 years old, sixth grade, he is an AP
student takes all AP courses, reading at 10th grade level. I support
those students who may not be in AP courses, who maybe in other classes
but the teachers are still doing what they need to be do these children
which is forgetting about them. That's my real problem with the bill, I
support these children, I support AP courses, I support other courses
that students may take that may not be AP. We have got to be consistent,
show some consistency and support for our teachers and all of our
children.
