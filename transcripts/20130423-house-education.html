<p id="00:00">
We’re going to start with House Bill 365, and if the sponsor of that
bill would come forth. ??, you have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is
a pretty straight-forward bill. It’s to allow Chatham County to have a
special election to fill a vacated school board slot, and it’s actually
the slot that I left. They had two people apply for this position. The
board has four members. They were split equally. They could not come to
consensus. They actually hired a mediator and still could not come to
consensus. They want to coordinate the special election with the
municipal elections in the fall with a filing period from July 5th to
July 19th so that other candidates could apply if interested, and I
believe they were going to try to have a special county-wide bond
referendum for an agricultural building at the same time. I would ask
for your support please so that they can fill this spot on the school
board. Any questions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just a quick question of the bill sponsor
and then a motion if it’s appropriate. So how many people are on the
board, and you’re saying that your seat is still vacant; is that
correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am. There are normally five school
board members. Currently there are still four on the board and they
could not come to a consensus on this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
Mr. Chairman, over here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I apologize if you already said this. Is the board itself
agreeable to this procedure? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry; I had
resolutions from both the Board of Commissioners and the Board of
Education requesting this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I offer a motion to give it a favorable report?
Unless it’s already been done. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Representative
Adams said she wanted to do a motion, so we’ll let her go with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’d move for a
favorable report for House Bill 365. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have heard
the motion. All in favor of the motion say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no. The ayes have it and the motion
passes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Next is
House Bill 760, Summer Reading Camps. Representative Brandon. This is a
PCS. I need a motion to have the PCS before us. Representative Lucas
makes that motion. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All opposed, no. Brandon. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair
and thank you members of the committee. I want to thank my bill
sponsors, Representative Hardister, Representative Cotham,
Representative Brown, who helped me with this bill. This is a really
very simple bill. What this bill does is that when I was trying to build
capacity in my district for the summer reading camps that we passed with
the law last year, what I found is that some of the people through the
public-private partnership actually had the capacity to serve some
kindergarteners, first-graders and second-graders, but the way the law
is currently written is that you only can be a third-grader that is not
reading proficiently in order to be eligible to go to the summer reading
camps. All this bill does is say if the public-private partnership has
the capacity to take those students in kindergarten, first grade and
second grade, then they’re able to also attend those summer reading
camps, and I’m happy to yield to any questions if there is any. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Do you have any questions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Shepard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, a
question for the bill sponsor. Representative Brandon, this difference
from regular summer school – if a child’s having problems then they may
take summer school courses, so this program is entirely different than
summer school courses? [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is correct. This is with
the… What’s the bill called last year that the Senate did? Whatever that
bill was called. It’s something, the education act of last year. What
that does, if a kid was not proficient in reading in third grade, the
law states that we had to have summer reading camps available for the</p>

<p id="05:00">
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The third graders that did not pass, because the
current law from last years act says that if you are not reading by the
third grade then you cannot go to the fourth. But we were supplying
these summer reading camps for those students that were not reading
proficiently in third grade and specifically for the excellence in
public school act. And so this is just really clarifying that if a
public private partnership, which is already in the law to establish
these summer reading camps, if they have the capacity to actually teach
kindergartners and first and second graders who are not reading
proficiently, then they can also attend those summer reading camps.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think maybe some of my questions have been answered.
So this is a public private partnership, so it is being funded by..
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right now, we have current appropriations that
probably does not do justice. So thats the reason that the current law
has asked for public private partnership. And so for example, in our
district, I’ve been reaching out to reading connections and others,
along with our superintendent, to try to figure out how we can build
this capacity, and what we’ve found is that many of the community
partners that we had identified to do these summer reading camps had the
capacity to actually incorporate K, first and second, but they just
under the law, they couldn’t do it, and so this just clarifies that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, its open to any child now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And so when you run out, you won’t run out of space?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, our idea is that we don’t want to limit. There
will be all types of things that might could limit. There might be
space, and there might be a time issue. But those who do have the
capacity, wouldn’t want to just limit them to third grade. If they have
the space, and they have the additional funds, then we didn’t want the
law to prohibit them from being able to include those students.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Corbit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion at the appropriate time, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Representative Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, I want to start with a couple
of questions for staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m looking at what current law on this, and quick
questions, but is there programs like this for all 115 school districts
at this time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke  the retention and summer camps
won’t start until the summer of 2014. But according to the budget from
last year, which enacted the excellent public schools act in the north
caorlina read to achieve program, all local administrative units would
provide a summer reading camp to any child who does not demonstrate
reading proficiency and who may be retained under 115C-83.7.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And follow up, so there is an appropriation already in
the two year budget for this 2013-14?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chris Nordstrom from fiscal research could answer that
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chris Nordstrom, fiscal research. As you know,
Representative Luebke  the 2012 budget only covered 2012-13, we have yet
to do any adjustments for sort of new aspects of the program that are
coming online, such as the summer camps, so that would need to be
addressed in the 2013 budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes you may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess this is still for staff, I’m sorry. I guess
I’m not clear if we’re even going to have money for these in budget that
is being worked on right now. Does anyone know, does the governors
budget include this program?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chris Nordstrom, again fiscal research, I think its
safe to say that the governors budget did include funds for the summer
camps. May be some disagreement about what the total cost should be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, if I may, its in the budget, but its not clear
that its enough for all of the school districts? Representative
Brandon..
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What I was going to say is that the lat years budget
didn’t have enough in it, either, and thats not the point of the bill
because it is a public private partnership, and so I think that what the
bill was intended to do, whether...</p>

<p id="10:00">
Agree with it or not, we can have that debate. Was to try to get more
community partners in, to try to help go on with their reading summer
camps. This bill is not to really deal with the money cost of it, it’s
to deal with the community partner side of it. And if they do have a
community partner that does have the capacity to do K, 1st and 2nd
without our money, the current law says they can’t do it. So this just
fixes that, and says if you have the capacity there’s no reason why you
shouldn’t be able to take those students that are younger than third
grade, that are showing difficulty in reading. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you very much. Representative Hall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. This is just a clarifying question on the difference in
difficulty with reading development versus not demonstrating reading
proficiency. And is there some defined, some way to define that category
of difficulty with reading development versus a test that you use that
shows you don’t demonstrate reading proficiency, so we know who should
be considered to have the additional access? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Leader. I
appreciate the question. I’m going to defer to Patsy because Patsy
schooled me on this part of the bill and how we could actually have a
determinate factor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, Patsy? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Hall, in the statutes now on 115C-87.3, there
are different definitions for each of these terms and I did summarize
them under the current law part of the summary. So reading deficiency is
when a child doesn’t demonstrate reading proficiency on the end of third
grade tests. Reading, problems with, or difficulty with reading
development, that would be any child, K through 3, that isn’t showing
any kind of appropriate developmental abilities in reading in different
areas of reading like phonics, ?? awareness, or vocabulary, based on any
sort of observation or diagnostic or formative assessment. So not a
standardized assessment like the, not demonstrating reading proficiency.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that okay? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a quick follow up
then. So there’s a set of different factors, as opposed to performance
on an end of grade tests, you can look to a different set of multiple
factors and someone could make that recommendation to the parent? Who
does the recommendation get made by and to whom? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Patsy? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Representative Hall, the parent or
guardian of the child has the final approval of whether or not the child
would go to the summer reading camp, so teachers and principals would
recommend to the family member of that child that they may benefit from
attending the summer reading camp. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Michaux. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are these programs available for charter
schools? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have an answer to that? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under current charter school law, they can actually address the problem
of reading deficiency or not developing reading any way they want to.
They still have to report how many of the children in the charter school
are not demonstrating reading proficiency but there’s no specificity as
there is for a traditional public school on that approach. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So, I guess my question is, are those persons in the charter
schools who fall into those guidelines, are they able to or do they have
the funds or how are they treated, are they treated the same as regular
public school kids under this program? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The charter school would not have to offer a summer reading
camp. The charter school could address the reading problems any way they
saw fit. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmore.</p>

<p id="15:00">
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I like the concept of the bill, so these are
just clarifying questions please. For year-round schools that may or may
not have the six to eight weeks off during the summer, how does it
address that is one question. Second question: might it be a provision
for parents to opt out if they so choose for their children? Have you
got any potential comments for the Schoolboard Association?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Schoolboard Association did contact me via email and ask for parents
to mandated and we don't agree with that, because the current bill does
give parents the option to opt out, because some parents might choose
that they might want to go to Southern Learning Center to address this.
They might want to choose alternative ways to be able to address this
and no way in the world do I think we should be mandating parents of how
they should be dealing with their deficiency problems, so we don't agree
with that. And with the six to eight weeks, we're just dealing with
current law and the way the current law reads, that those schools have
to do some adaptation or different things to be able to address that,
but of course, if they're in the school in the summer they don't have
summer reading camps. But they still are required to meet the
third-grade law, but they do have to adapt and we're just going to deal
with changing existing excellence in public schools act. We just want to
deal with what's currently in law, we just want to make it available for
those students who came first and second if they showed a reading
deficiency, so that's all it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative G. Graham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Brandon, I have a question that I want to
ask. I'm right here. What is the budget and how many participants do you
plan to have in the program?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Like I said, we can argue against the budget, and we don't know what the
current budget's going to be. All this does is says- because this is
really a public-private partnership. Whatever budget you get, it will
never have enough money to serve all the summer reading camps. It just
won't happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Well, what was the budget last year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would have to ask fiscal research on what it was last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chris Norris (??) from fiscal research. The summer camps would not start
until summer of 2014, so there was no budget for summer camps last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think there was an amount, maybe, I'm not sure, in the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the overall Excellent Public Schools Act there was 27 million
appropriated last year, but that covered other requirements. It did not
include summer camps. Those aren't starting until summer of 2014 so they
aren't budgeted yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our other Graham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Just a quick question, Representative Brandon. I think
this is a good idea and I like the concept. My question is, the children
who identify as developmentally delayed, is this going to- how will
those kids, providing the space is available, have an opportunity to
participate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We originally- that's why Representative Hall's question was, if you
listened to the answer, was a very subjective way that we do that, so I
think that any teacher that recommends the child and whether they'd be
developmentally delayed, the problem is that there's no real test up
until third grade that we have that we can say, &quot;Oh, they are not
reading proficiently,&quot; so we are going to have to rely on teachers,
whether they're special ed teachers or just regular classroom teachers,
that see that a child is not reading proficiently and can recommend them
to these other things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to follow up to make sure I
understood, with response to Representative Whitmire's question. I
thought I heard you indicate that there was some concern via the
Schoolboards Association, and Mr. Chairman, I would just like to know if
the Schoolboards Association Representative could just detail that so we
know what the concern was and how it's been responded to. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. My name's Leanne Winter. I'm the Director of Governmental
Relations for the North Carolina Schoolboards Association. We do not
have issue with the substance of what the bill sponsors are trying to
do. We actually think it is a good thing to try to address children
before we get to the end of third grade and have essentially a
&quot;gotcha&quot; for those children. The two things that we-</p>

<p id="20:00">
Shared with the bill sponsors that were of concern with us, for us, were
one, how to deal with schools that are year round where the students
only have a two to three week break in the summer. The law specifically
requires that the summer reading program be for six to eight weeks long,
which those schools do not have and thus our districts that have year
round schools are not sure how to comply with the law. The second part
with the base part of the law that they're concerned about is about
parents having the ability to opt their children out of the summer
reading program at the end of third grade. If they opt their child out,
and the child cannot demonstrate by the beginning of fourth grade, they
will automatically be retained. Understand what they are saying and
maybe a middle ground would potentially be that the parent could only
opt them out if they demonstrate that they have another avenue for which
the child will get that intervention. What we are concerned about are
parents who think their child is okay and, or not engaged in their
education and thus get no services throughout the summer and will
automatically be retained at the end of fourth grade. If the state of
North Carolina is going to be serious about children being able to read
at grade level by the beginning of fourth grade, we need to make sure
that that happens. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett, are you ready for a motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely, mister chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a PCS, okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct, and my motion will be, and it's an honor to offer this
motion, that House education committee report out as favorable to the
proposed committee substitute to House bill 760 and unfavorable to the
original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You've heard the motion. All in favor say aye. All opposed, no. The ayes
have it, and the motion's carried. Thank you gentlemen. Our next bill is
House bill 765, Representative Dixon. This is the PCS. Do I have a
motion to accept the PCS? Representative Collins makes the motion. All
in favor say aye. All opposed no. The ayes have it. Representative
Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. Mister chair, I would suggest the following
procedure. I would like to make a brief overview comment and then I'd
like to have a brief comment from staff, and then I'd like to have a
brief comment from the representative from the Association of School
Board. And I think that'll be the, and then we will entertain questions.
I think that'll maybe save us some time and get us on the right track.
May I proceed? Members of the committee, this bill would seek to amend
current law G.S. 115C-341 which governs the procedure for resolutions of
disputes between Boards of Education and Boards of County Commissioners.
The proposed committee substitute in addition to existing law would
require that the court find the facts as to the amount of money
necessary from all sources to maintain a system of free public schools.
In addition, the proposed committee substitute would add that the jury
also has to consider the educational goals and policies of the local
board of education, the financial resources of the local board of
education, and the physical goals of the local board of education. The
background for this and the language in it comes from a North Carolina
supreme court case in 2009, and we've incorporated that same language
here in this bill. The effective date of it would be when it becomes
law, and mister chair, I'd like a brief comment from staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe Representative Dixon explained it correctly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chair, I'd like a comment from Ms. Leanne Winner, representative
of the Association of School Boards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Leanne?

Also represent the North Carolina Council of School Attorneys on this
issue. The process is actually a two step process. The two boards must
first go to mediation and then if the mediation is not satisfactorily
resolved it would potentially go to court if the school board so chose.
This part is specifically addressing the jury instructions at that
stage. Since this law was put in place in 1997, There have been 31 cases
across the state during the 16 years of where a local board of education
has actually asked for this process to be used. Only a handful of those,
I’m only aware of four, there may be a couple more, have gone from
mediation to court as Representative Dixon said, most of this language
is actually from the Beaufort case which went the the North Carolina
Supreme Court. He was very willing to work with us to add a few words
that you have seen between the first version and the proposed committee
substitute and we are fine with the bill and hope you will support it.
Thank you.

Any questions or debate? Representative Lucas.

that the Senate mail is in the process of proposing a bill that would
take this authority from the school boards.

let us know how the County Commissioners feel about this?

Yes sir, Representative Collins, we do. Ms. Rebecca Troutman is here.
The Association of the County Commissioner wholeheartedly and
enthusiastically support this bill. If I’m wrong, the chair may call on
Miss  Troutman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard. Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chairman. This committee is probably the most knowledgable
group in the entire state of how much we spend totally on education, or
maybe education approp to those. Most people don’t. I saw a poll about
three months ago, where they ask the people in North Carolina how much
do we spend and people in general think we spend about less than half of
what we actually spend in K12. If the jury is not informed what is
actually available, the jury can’t possibly make a good decision. I
think it’s a great bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Daughtry for the motion.

has some comments and can talk more intelligently than I can about the
medical issue with regard to it. And then, Mr. Chairman, we have a
number of people in the audience. One or two may want to speak, and the
rest, if you would simply ask for a show of hands so everyone knows
who’s here, I would really appreciate it. This bill is based on research
we did in three states. There’s actually eight states that have this
bill, but Illinois, Virginia, and Georgia were ones we took the most
look at. It’s simply requires first that local school boards, charter
schools, and now regional schools, the regional, I think the one or two
regional schools that we have, provide at least two epi auto-injectors
for use by trained school personnel to provide emergency medical
assistance to children suffering from anaphylactic shock or reaction. As
you know, this can happen as a result of often seafood, or peanuts, or
any number of allergies and it can trigger a number of kids will have
medicine with them, but some we never know until the first hit occurs on
that child at a school when they’re having a peanut butter sandwich or
they’re outside on the playground and get a bee sting.
We have sadly lost some children over the last several years over not
having this available. What the bill really does is allow and require
each school to have two injectors and we do that for our first reason,
because one sometimes is not enough. Second, obviously, even if it is,
you want one there till you can replace it. We require that a training
program be put in place to allow the staff that is going to be
designated to be able to use the epi and Representative Murry can show
you how easy that’s going to be. We also require that this be done for
purposed of anything happening on school grounds or school sponsored
events on school grounds. Much as we’d love to cover busses or love to
cover offsite capacity, it’s just very hard, obviously, to have that
accessibility. Your PCS adds charters and the original bill didn’t. It
adds in the regional school. It also requires, if you look at the bottom
of the page, each school to develop its standards and procedures for
storage and the storage has to be in an easy accessible site. We looked
at subsection e, which is essentially to remind folks that although we
don’t want the school to be the sole medication supply for students who
have a known medical conditions, neither do we want to be in a position
where a child comes to school and forgot their epi, lost it on the bus,
and then say that you can use the epi that’s available at school in an
emergency circumstance. We worked the school Nurses Association to put
that in place. There’s the immunity clause that’s in subsection F that
provides if everyone does their job and it’s not grossly negligent or
intentional wrongdoing, that there’s immunity from damages, which the
other states do. With that, I’d like to turn it over to Representative
Murry to talk about the real importance of the bill and then the one or
two speakers, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think the takeaway from this legislation is
that, currently, in order for an epi pen to be in a school, it has to be
specifically prescribed for an individual student, only for use for that
student. This would broaden it so that there would be two epi pens at
each school so that should should an anaphylactic reaction occur, that
there are epi pens available and trained personnel at the schools to be
able to use that. The manufacturer of this product is willing to give
two epi pens to schools, so I think that’s a good faith effort on the
part of the company to make sure this doesn’t add any cost burden, but
the use of these epi pens is extremely simple. It’s injectible, the
needle is right here, you slam it down on your leg and push it down. I
mean, it’s really, really simple to use. The instructions are right on
any epi pen so it’s very simple and it can go through the clothes and
it’s really, really simple way to save lives. This is good legislation.
I’m glad the public health advocates brought it to our attention. I
would urge your support. I’ll be available for any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, and I should also say public health is here as are school
nurses association, but if you could, I wonder if you would be able to
recognize two speakers and then ask others who might be willing to just
stand up and show their support. Kendra Montgomery-Blinn who brought
this to our attention, and Dr. Brent Townsend as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll be happy to recognize them if they’ll come forth to the mic back
there and identify yourself.</p>

Here we go, good morning my name is ___ Gurney Blen, I’m here today as a
mom, I’m from Durham. This guy struggling over here because he is little
bit shy is my son Marco, he is in kindergarten. He is allergic to
peanuts, tree nuts, kiwi, and pineapple. He keeps two nappy pins in his
class at school, two in the nurse’s office and two in his after school
program. I’m extremely proud that North Carolina has being proactive
with this bill and not waiting until we have a child so name it after.
Behind me a lot of people who are here to support the bill, a lot of
other parents but also some daycare providers have come and they have
asked me if they don’t have time to speak just to mention for them that
we are asking that you also extend just the immunity portion of the bill
to daycares and private schools. I understand that the law could not
require private schools and daycares to stock the nappy pins but the
immunity would give them the security that they would need to administer
on nappy pin. Many children are first diagnosed with a life threatening
allergy when they have their very first reaction at daycare. In
Virginia, the school workers did not gave Maria another child’s nappy
pin because they were afraid of liability, they are afraid that they
would be sued even though there were other nappy pins available in
office. So, we just ask you to protect all child even those in daycare
and private schools and extending that immunity would safe lives and the
trainers have been distributed I think you have already seen those and
learn how to use them. The best news that I can tell you as well is that
right nappy pins are being given to the schools for free, we distributed
some literature about that as well. The drug companies are giving out
four free nappy pins to schools who qualify. In order to qualify they
must have a law like this one in place. And then they can obtain
additional nappy pins to reduce price. Can those behind me those are
here in support of this bill please stand so that everybody can see who
you are, we have got parents, daycare providers, doctors, school nurses,
Representatives from the Pediatric Association. If anybody is in
opposition to the bill can they stand I’m not sure that I know of
anybody but I suppose I should give them a chance. I’m proud of North
Carolina, I’m proud of this bill and I’m proud to speak on behalf of it.
I will try one more time to show you Marco who is struggling he is six
and a half. Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Dr. Tounson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dr. Tounson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pleasure to identify you Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I’m Dr. Bran
Tounson, I’m a pediatric radiologist here in Riley and I’m also the
parent of Alex Tounson the five and a half year old with severe food
allergies and I’m speaking to you today as both as parent and as
Representative of the North Carolina Pediatric Society. First of all
personally, when Alex as 14 months old I got the dreaded call from
daycare that he would accidentally gotten into another child sippy cup
that had milk. And she said, “It looks like he’s having trouble with
breathing, should I give him the nappy pin?” And even though I knew that
was a right thing to do and luckily we had a prescription to have the
pins of their size, I hesitated just because I was shocked that this was
actually happening to my family, luckily his daycare teacher did not
hesitate giving the nappy pin and everything was okay. And now as a
physician I wanna to say that food allergies are on the rise. A recent
study in 2011 says that one in 12 children has food allergies and that
number is increasing overtime. The reasons we don’t quite understand but
more importantly in 2005 a study from the general pediatrics showed that
one in four children will have their first allergic event at school and
will not even know that they have an allergy until they are in trouble.
Now, luckily there is a cure for an anaphylactic reaction and that care
is epinephrine. In 2007, the general pediatrics that are widely use
epinephrine auto injectors and they found not only the epinephrine the
first line a treatment for child who is having an anaphylactic reaction
with that there are no adverse effects for otherwise healthy children
who receive an nappy pin and that’s important and that is one of the
reasons we so strongly support the immunity cause. It is much better to
treat and definitely let that child have that reaction. And if there are
any other concerns about epinephrine or what this mean and food
allergies please don’t hesitate to contact me or any member of the North
Carolina Pediatrics Society so we can speak more. I’m very much in
support of this bill and as we said several other people are as well.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I have Representative Dickson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman for a motion at appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Representative ___[04:56].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman just couple of quick questions of the bill
sponsors.

If I may
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes you may
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you gentleman, very ?? of this but I gotta ask the basic
questions.
Number One. What is the possibility of missed diagnosis and what would
be the effects if it was missed diagnosed of having someone injected
with this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that's part of the reason why we have a training program is to
help the teachers identify what an allergic reaction really looks like.
Shortness of breath, tongue starts swelling up, itchy that kind of
thing. The dose of Epinephrine is actually very small in these Epi pens.
And any adverse reactions to would be mainly because of the injection
more so than the drug, the puncture wounds that type of thing. That
would be the more adverse thing. But from the diagnose perspective or an
recognition of an Anaphylactic? reaction is easily identifiable and side
effects from the drug would be minimal because the dose is small but the
dose is significant enough to stop a reaction from proceeding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You got it
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is this considered a controlled substance as you would think?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir. It's not a controlled substance. It is a prescription medication
but it's not a controlled substance. And that's one of the benefits of
this legislation instead of having patient specific only Epi pens at
school it has Epi pens available for use should an reaction occur. So
that's one of the things we're doing with this legislation is enabling
Epi pens to be accessible for any allergic reaction not just the patient
specific prescribed Epi pens
at schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Representative. Thank you Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
G. Graham
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I think this is an excellent bill and I think it
will be very helpful. But I'm concerned that juvenile diabetes is on the
rise in North Carolina. And I'm wondering if the committee, the health
committee, could maybe look at that. I don't know if you could make it a
part of what we're doing now but it is an issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm certain that we can communicate that to an representative,??
representative Avalon representative members on that and communicate
that and agree with you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank You
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Just a quick question on the Epi pen. I noticed
there's
no ingredient statement, there's no statement as to active ingredients.
Is that required?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So that's a placebo.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What your holding is there is no active ingredient in that. If you look
at the it is clear it is clearly indicated on the Epi pen it talks about
the delivers zero point three intramuscular dose of Epinephrin its on
the you've got a placebo because if you wanted to practice we've given
that to you so you can practice, if you want.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I practice on you? Representative Gill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the speaker spoke to non private schools, non public schools and
to private day cares.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To be included in the bill. Do we need an Amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me respond this way. When we originally drafted it we talked with
folks. We added in charters and we added in regional schools. First for
private schools. I think the jurisdiction of the general assembly to
mandate into private schools is more limited. And I didn't want us to
get into that battle or that thicket when we are trying to deal with
public schools. It may be that what we can do, and Representative Murray
and I have talked about it, as this proceeds through the House and into
the Senate is look at adding the private school in the Immunity Clause
so that if the private school chooses to do this they would have
immunity and that sort of makes sense. And we can do that at the next
stage. The day care issue I think has two things. Number One. We
haven't,that we are aware of, gotten an agreement from the Epi pen
manufacturer on producing free ones to all day cares. So there is a cost
issue. Secondly, because of the vast nature of the different types of
day cares and their private, public blended its going to take a little
research I think to figure that one out. And also to figure out there
will be some additional regulations required, I think, given those will
be junior Epi's and so again, we didn't want to get that issue messed up
in stopping this bill. But we are going to look at that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Horn
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your indulgence.</p>

Mr. Chairman, my question is is this the only product of its kind? Are
we committing or promoting a particular manufacturer or are there
competitors out there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There really isn't a competitor to this, it is the
only, the only other way to administer an epinephrin would be to draw it
up in a syringe from a multi-dose vial and that's - we don't want to go
there. Now if you're in an emergency room situation that works, that
might work, but from a market place standpoint this is the only game in
town.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dixon you ready for the motion, and
this is the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, may I make a brief comment before my motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may, just brief.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll be very brief. Thank you Mr. Chair. Members of
the committee I don't know all of the technicalities of this but I do
know the reality of it and just a few weeks ago the most precious little
perfect four year old granddaughter to exist to anybody in North
Carolina had one of these experiences and I can tell you the difference
between her fear of another situation and knowing and having this
explained to her that it was going to be available was the difference in
night and day. And so it's a great honor for me to make the motion for
favorable approval of the PCS, unfavorable to the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You heard the motion. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The ayes have it and the motion is carried, and that
concludes our business today and we're adjourned. [AUDIO ENDS]</p>
