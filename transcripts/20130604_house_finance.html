604 House Finance:
Speaker1: I know how much you all have been waiting for this moment. I
would like to call this meeting of the House of finance together and to
order.  I would like to thank  xx. sorry Mr. Hans, Mr. Sears, Mr.Brandon
and Mr. Clangford, Thank you for your endurance.  I would also like to
thank our pages for todayTodd Marseil, Noven xx Kevin Sizen, and Errin
Walker. Thank you for what you are about to observing and we appreciate
it. At this time we will take up the PCS for House bill 998.
Representative Hager moves to have PCS for the House bill 998 for
discussion, all in favor say aye, all opposed. Motion carried.
Speaker changes: Thank you Representative Hager, that’s very kind of
you, and a surprise to you, I know.
Speaker changes: Representative Lewis. We will continue the discussion
from the meeting from last time.
Speaker changes: Mr. Chairman and ladies and gentlemen, thank you again
for the chance to be here. Sorry to you, and I am sorry because that was
smooth so you must want to see it.
Speaker changes: We’ll try again.
Speaker changes: Thank you so much for the chance to stand before you
again today; I tried that line, what I thought was a very detached plan
the last time we met,  I’ll be glad to go in there and to whatever part
of the tax plan that you’d like to discuss, I had a respect for the
committee’s time, I know that many of you may have some inquiries that
you’d like to pose or memos that you would like to send forward.  So
I’ll take the xx to what direction as to what he wants me to do.
Speaker changes: We can start with the memos and then .. Representative
Brawley xx
Speaker changes: If I might ask you a question?
Speaker changes: Proceed.
Speaker changes: Personal Income Taxes . Johnny the plumber operates out
of his house. And has been taking, whenever he files his taxes he takes
it Tax deduction for operating the plumbing business. Under this bill,
will be able to take deductions for those expenses?
Speaker changes: Yes sir he will.
Speaker changes: All of them?
Speaker changes: To the extent that they are the same businesses, xx
stuff
Speaker changes: Yes sir.
Speaker changes: Okay if it is Johnny the real estate agent will he be
able to do the same thing and deduct his licensing expense and
continuing education and all of that?
Speaker changes: Yes sir.
Speaker changes: And Mr. Chairman if it would make the gentleman feel a
little more confident in that response perhaps you could recognize Dr.
Boardman to respond to that if that would be okay with Representative
Boardman.
Speaker changes: But yes is the answer.
Speaker changes: Dr. Boardman.
Speaker changes: If you don’t mind
Speaker changes:  Further explanation regarding that question?
Speaker changes: With respect to expenses of the so proprietors
following schedule C, in that schedule all expenses are expenses would
be included as  part of filing the income tax and then what we might
want to refer to is would want to  xxx when you calculate your Federal
adjusted income those business expenses would represent one of those
adjustments.
Speaker changes: Thank you, for information purposes and members of the
committee we are going to take up the amendments on this bill, have
discussion and we will vote on this bill at 9.40. One way or the other,
up and down, any way Mr. if we don’t get there , we will  take 4
amendments  and let the appropriate  committee members have some joy in
hearing them on the floor. Since they are missing    that is missing at
this time. At this time we will take up the Howard amendment. Amendment
1 , has amendment 1 passed out? Do all members have Howard amendment? I
would also like to represent, welcome our new Representative to the
committee Representative  Glen Martin.Welcome to the House of Finance
unofficially.
Speaker changes: Thanks xx
Speaker changes: Absolutely ; that is unofficially welcome to the fray,
we would like to have you.
Speaker changes:  We hope you feel that way after today.
Speaker changes: Representative Howard.
Speaker changes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and this is really a simple
amendment; it looks like xx with long lines but it does actually three
major things . It removes the cap on the mortgage interest</p>

deduction it removes the cap for the charitable contributions and it
also allows the folks to continue to take their local property tax
exemption as they have in the past.  I will plead the case for the
amendment.  Our building industry is very fragile, we are slowly coming
back and if folks really look at what makes the great state of North
Carolina function, it is the building industry.  When they are down, we
are down. When they are up, we are up and I don't think it is in the
best interest through tax reform or any other policy that we adopt that
we do anything that is detrimental to that industry.  It's just not the
time to do it.  I would ask for your support on the amendment.  I
realize that it has a price tag.  I realize what that is and it simply
means that you need to reshuffle the deck and I would ask for your
support and I would be glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to speak on the amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I support this amendment.  My wife is a real estate agent in Wilmington
and I know we have representatives here from the real estate industry
and I know how important the mortgage deduction is to people who are
looking to buy a house as well as being able to deduct their local
property taxes.  I received a lot of emails, I talked with
Representative Lewis last night about the fact that I knew there would
be people here that wanted to speak on that and I would just like to
relay in their behalf that I hope that everyone will consider supporting
this so we can keep the building industry and real estate business
thriving.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Certainly we all understand how important it
is that the home industry is coming back and how important property
taxes and other things are to overall function of the state and the
building industry is something we really need to look at as far as
building North Carolina back so as we look at this I hope this amendment
will be one that we can support and again find some way to keep it in
the tax plan.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you.  Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to speak to this. I certainly
understand the importance of the mortgage interest deduction and
certainly understand the right and the good that comes from various
charitable contributions.  We took a look at these exact scenarios as we
put this House tax plan together.  What I'd like for you to understand
is that nearly 80% of the filers in our state take our standard
deductions anyway which means they do not take the deductions that this
amendment does address. I'd also like you to note that most folks in the
state that take the mortgage interest deduction are in the $75,000 -
$120,000 range of income and that amount, their net tax reduction is
less than $400.
The total cost of this amendment to the tax plan is $525 million, at
least.  With that, I would say that with the pressure that we are under
to fund essential state services that this amendment simply goes a
little bit too far and with that I would ask that the committee not
support the amendment as it is sent forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Further questions or comments from the committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Jones, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was just going to ask and this may be a
question appropriate for staff and perhaps it would be. I don't know if
you have the exact figure or not.  It says this amendment addresses the
cap on mortgage interest, on charitable deductions and local property</p>

this exemption. Three different things. Representative Lewis just said
that the cost would be approximately 525 million at least. I was
wondering if you could give us a breakdown, between those three
entities, as to where the cost lies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, could we direct that at the staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Unfortunately, my answer is, I cannot break that down. We're reliant on
statistics of income data from the IRS, and they aggregate all three of
those components into one piece of data, so we can't break it down for
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley of Iredell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To comment on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I understand correctly, the state may give up 525 million dollars
based on this package, but what that really means is, that the
homeowners that are taking the mortgage interest deductions, and people
making charitable contributions, will not have that money to pay their
bills with. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Representative Brawley, the answer to that, I think, was given by
the author of the amendment in her remarks. She said it would require
the deck to be reshuffled, which means, whichever pocket you want to
take it from, it's going to come out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't think that was the intent of my remark. It was the intent that
you would need to reshuffle the projections on this new bill. This new
bill is called Tax Reform. I just bring you back to the point that when
people bought homes years ago, they understood that they could take off
the mortgage deduction. They could also take off the property tax. Now,
they're into that mortgage. They're into that debt. And then, is it in
our best interest, under the guise of tax reform, that we say, &quot;Oh,
no, that's changing&quot;? You're in the debt, you're paying the
mortgage, but you are no longer going to be able to take those
deductions that you've been able to take in years gone by. I think that
is egregiously unfair. Somebody asked me yesterday, &quot;Well, why
don't you just start it for the new home buyers?&quot; Well, that should
put a black cloud against all of the new buyers that are out there, that
are trying to start, small families trying to buy their first home. It's
not a cost to the state. It's money that has been swept up to do the
disguise of tax reform, of reducing personal income tax, corporate tax,
all the reductions in there. It was a sweeping up of money, a place to
find money. I think this is the wrong place to look for it. I again
would ask that members consider this closely, when you go home, and you
go to church, or you go to the grocery store, or wherever you got to go.
If this provision remains in place, what you're gonna find is families,
working families, trying to buy their first home, or perhaps they're
already in that home, looking to you to say, &quot;Why did you reduce,
or take away, something that I was counting on to make the monthly
payments?&quot; I would ask for your support of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, speak a second time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I appreciate the comments from the lady, and I apologize if I
misspoke about the remarks that she made the first time that she spoke.
To be clear, the response to them is that this plan cuts the percentage
of income taxes that they have to pay. And in every scenario that we've
run, that means they have more money left in their pocket at the end of
the day. It just makes sense. The larger the base that you have to tax,
the lower the rate is that you can tax. If you shrink that base, if you
shrink that base, then the rate has got to go up. The money that comes
out of the pockets of folks will have to go up. I would respectfully ask</p>

That this Committee at this time not approve this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I would move for the adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative  Howard.  Any further discussion from Members
of the Committee? If not, you heard the motion from Representative
Howard to adopt the Amendment Number 1.  All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion carried.  Amendment Number 1 is adopted, thank you.
Representative Blust?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just have an inquiry of the Chair from your earlier remarks at this
bill would be voted on at 9:40. I’m assuming no one knew that that’s.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
9:40.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s coming from on high.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s coming from no one but ?? here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I implore that we have at least an additional day, if not two on a bill
of this magnitude that has probably the biggest issue beside the budget
that the General Assembly is going to take up.  That this is going to
require some very thoughtful deliberation and time to really think
things through and soak things up and if you have amendments to prepare,
good amendments and I’ve got 2 that really need some tweaking. And I
just think something of this magnitude for the state needs additional
time. More than an hour and fifteen minutes in this Committee meeting
and I know Thursday is was presented for about an hour so that’s 2 hours
and 15 minutes for a bill that is of great import.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, I understand your concerns.  But if you also will
note, the majority of the body is not here because half of the body, or
this is less than half of the body so the Appropriation Committee
members are missing the debate so will would be helpful on the full
floor that the entire body hear this debate and so that is another
reason that why we’re going to move this onto the floor so we’re going
to have thorough debate with the full body.  So I’d say get your
amendments ready if they’re not ready to be heard here and have them
ready for the floor. Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  With respect, I want to agree with
Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me just point out that last time it wasn’t an hour.  It was less
than an hour because we spent a whole lot of time on the Interlock bill
and if we have time, listen to the tape. We had less than an hour on
this bill.  This is, as Representative Lewis has said, the most major
change to our tax code in decades.  It is truly Mr. Chairman, I truly
have asked you to let the Committee hear all our amendments.  Have our
debate, and if we don’t finish by 9:50 that we meet whenever you and the
other Chair, Senor Chair Howard wish to meet. And let me stress also one
other thing if I might and why I just, again with respect disagree with
your analysis that we should move the amendments to ?? onto the floor.
It is entirely possible, and as the cliché goes, above your pay grade
and again, no disrespect .
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
None taken, it’s above yours as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, you know I’m about 100 feet in the cellar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But you have served in this station before and yes Representative, we
are wasting time discussing the bill but let’s continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, let me get to my last point, because I have been in the Chair. It is
entirely possible that a decision will be made by the Speaker or just
below his level, to put this into the budget and not to bring it to the
floor.  We don’t know that.  I can assure you that in 2009 that’s
exactly what the Democratic majority did. We heard the tax bill and it
went into the budget.  That might happen here too and it’s totally then,
just impossible for those of us who have other amendments in this
committee to be heard. And I respectfully ask you to not vote today if
indeed we aren’t finished at 9:50.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I understand the concerns about the bill but
I’m going to offer an amendment and if you would go ahead and pass that
out. And as it’s coming out, I’m concerned about the cumbersomeness  of
the services tax and how that would occur when certain pieces are put in
and other pieces are not. Say for plumbing we discussed it in a meeting
the other day that if you put a toiler in yes there was a sales tax, if
you put a washer in to fix something there wasn’t on the services. So
there’s a little bit of cumbersomeness that I’m concerned about. I’m
concerned about the shifts when we’ve lowered some of the tax rates to
the middle class.  But this amendment.</p>

takes care of one of my concerns, which is the corporate income tax
rate. From what I understand from different businesses, we really
haven't lowered it to a point that makes it as attractive as we'd like,
to bring some folks in. What this one would do, and I sought to be
revenue neutral, in regards to it. It would implement the 7.75 for a
million dollars over, again, so that highest income tax rate. So, from
zero to a million it would still be the flat 5.9. Anything a million or
over would be 7.75. On the back you can see what the corporate income
tax would lower to. 4.9 in the first year, down to 3.8, to try to make
it more attractive for corporations to come here. So, that's the
explanation. I'm prepared to answer questions. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions, comments from the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I would commend Representative Tine for his attempt to lower
our corporate tax rate. The concern that I would express, is as
Representative Tine and the members in this room know, many of the
business entities in our state are structured in such a way... For
example an S Corp, or an LLC, or LLP, or what not, to where the income
from the business, all of it, whether or not it truly is realized- cash,
profit, or not. All of it flows through the personal income tax side.
They don't actually pay a corporate rate. As such, this would in fact, I
believe, be a tax increase on many, many of the businesses in our state.
I know when you look at an amount like a million, it seems like a lot.
And I can assure you for me it is a lot. But, if the gentleman's intent
is to spur business growth, I don't think raising the tax on the most
popular form of our small businesses is the way to go. So I would ask
that you vote against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and thank you to the bill sponsor. My point is, is when we
lowered some of these rates, you started and you brought in the
electricity, and... we let the earned income tax credit go and the
services  was increased, the percentage of the salary paid for those
lower income folks is actually increasing the percentage of it. My idea
is then, to the percentage of the income, not the actual percent. So if
I'm a high wage earner and I spend less of my money on services, less of
my total money then I don't have as high a percentage of my income, is
what I'm saying. If we're trying to lower our corporate rate, and really
get it down to a rate that is going to attract business then we should
spread that cost of that particular initiative across all income folks
and make it a more fair and broad base. And I would like to request the
ayes and no's please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me ask a question of Representative Tine. I assume someone on the
staff has run the numbers, that if you tax over a million dollars at
these rates, then you are able to drop the corporate income tax, to
these lower rates on the back page. The numbers are there to sustain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it's a revenue neutral amendment. And just a clarification, the
7.75 is the way it exists now. So it's not a tax increase from where we
currently are. It's actually keeping it at the same level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I going to oppose the amendment. I think Representative Lewis hit it
exactly right.
There are many entities, there are many businesses that are taxed at the
personal rate through flow through accounting and this would not make it
any more attractive for this businesses to be</p>

In North Carolina that’s the ultimate goal of the bill is to make North
Carolina more attractive place for business and for people. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Collins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I agree
with Representative Lewis’ statements about the majority of our
businesses, especially majority of businesses that are hiring people
even during the recession being passed through entities. I have a
question for staff. I guess it’s Dr. Borden/g. I’ve always heard that
the billion or so dollars that we collect in corporate income tax every
year, that the great bulk of that is paid by just a handful of
companies. I was wondering if he could either corroborate that or
disabuse me of that notion? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Borden/g. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The, about one point two, one point three billion dollars of
corporate income tax 65%, 75% of that is gonna be paid by your 400
largest corporations. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I am speaking in support of the
amendment for two reasons. First of all I have heard for so many years
the importance of dropping the corporate rate and I’m pleased that we
Democrats are dropping the corporate rate lower than what Representative
Lewis has done in the Republican tax bill. So that’s great. The second
part of it is, it's important to understand how few tax filers make more
than one million dollars. I have checked this with staff. It is less
than one half of one percent. Less than one half of one percent. So this
is asking those who make, in the category of less than one half of one
percent to keep their tax rate at seven point seven five. That seems
imminently read, reasonable. I don’t know how many people in this state
that feel a lot of sympathy for millionaires. We’re in touch with the
people in this state when we support the Tine amendment. Thank you
members. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Tine? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I, I
move for adoption of the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Warren? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I just
wanted to speak on the amendment. I, I’m not in favor of it. And maybe
from a little different premise than some of the other points that were
mentioned. And it goes back to the motivation behind the, the amendment.
I don’t believe it’s absolutely essential that we have the lowest
corporate income tax in the area or in the country in order to attract
business here. It overlooks the fact that North Carolina also offers
other attributes that are conducive to conducting good business and
business growth such as our rail, planes, water and so forth. I, I, I
think that what Representative Lewis has put forth gives us a
competitive edge without necessarily having to sacrifice anything on,
on, in terms of corporate rate. So I, I’d stand against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Brawley of Mecklenburg.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I was looking at this and I
was thinking if you have a cursory knowledge of non-competitive game
theory, what we’re really gonna do is take a lot of businesses that are
pass-through entities and turn them into C corps where they’ll pay the
lower rate. But I, I’m really enjoying the rhetoric here because we’ve
decided that we want to tax individual’s high income families more so we
can give tax breaks to Bank of America and Exxon. It seems to me like
that’s just a, it’s kind of a silly political game. And we have a tax
plan [CROSSTALK] modeling. Unfortunately true. But I think this is more
of a specious amendment and just a, it’s just a political game. Let’s
don’t waste time on this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative
Moore? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just, the gentleman from Durham wanted to
make it partisan and I just [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, dear. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] thought it interesting when he was in charge he never met a tax
increase he didn’t like. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Pandora’s box. [CROSSTALK]
But the, but I would point out exactly what Representative Brawley said.
And that is that, the effect of this amendment to tax families, to tax
individuals to give breaks to large corporations. I, I can think no
worse amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Any further questions
from the committee? You’ve heard the motion. Oh, excuse me.
Representative Hall, I’m sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. And, and just to comment again folks changed their status of
their business or the, the type of business they have based on what this
tax policy is. We all know that. That’s why a lot of people immigrated
to other types of business forms. And I think this is a sincere attempt
to try to make an improvement to the bill and, and I hope the committee
members will support it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative
Hall. Representative Jones. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman.
This is a question perhaps staff would like to address. I would just
like to know since part of the purpose of our bill is</p>

Speaker 1:   Make our state more competitive for jobs in the economy .
We are looking out at all the surrounding space, Virginia, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, so forth and so forth; if any of those
states have 7.74 cash rate
Speaker changes: Miss Avery .
Speaker changes: The highest and looking at the personal income tax the
highest tax rate in our surrounding states, we are at 7.75, South
Carolina goes from zero to 7%, Georgia up to 6, and Virginia up to 5.75.
On a corporate schedule our rate is 6.9%, South Carolina at 5, Georgia
6, Tennessee at 6.5 and Virginia at 6.

the amendment is that if those of us in this room as Representative
Brawley just mentioned anybody can figure out in 10 minutes that all you

Thank Mr. Chairman, if you're ready for an amendment, I'd love to send
forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can't wait, do members have the amendment? Committee will stand at
ease until the Hager Amendment is passed out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I want commend you on your enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know, absolutely. This is not the first time I've been here. And I'd
like to thank you all for your kind endurance.
Do all members have a copy of the Hager Amendment? Representative Hager,
please explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment would actually end the film tax
credit by the end of the year. It would save, I'm going to go in the
opposite way, if we had done this last year, it would have saved the
state 69, almost 70 million dollars, of which we could have applied back
into -- 'cause that is, if you guys remember, that is a refund credit,
it's not just a tax credit. So basically a check that we cut for every 4
dollars spent, we remand back, the way the formula works ??.
And I'll give you a good example, on Iron Man 3, their total spending
was 81 million dollars. And that number is kind of phenomenal because
there with a 20 million dollar refund cap, if you spend 80 million
dollars, you get the cap. So I kind of find that a little suspicious. In
2012, we spent 69 million dollars on this tax credit and this is money
that could have went to things like giving our state troopers a raise.
The average state trooper makes 36,000 dollars a year. We could have
retained some teacher's assistants. We could have put some money back
into the education system. This, I akin this a lot to our house being on
fire but we don't want to bother the neighbors because we told them we
don't want to bother them. And we've got to fix the situation. ?? Let me
give you some good examples, numerous studies through Connecticut, New
Mexico, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Massachusetts that showed how
much we actually return back in money from every dollar spent.
Connecticut Dept. of Commerce and Economics says it's 7 cents for every
dollar spent in revenue on the film tax credit. New Mexico puts it at 14
cents, Pennsylvania Legislative Study puts it at 13 cents per dollar
spent, Arizona puts it at 28 cents, Michigan puts it at 11 cents, and
Massachusetts puts it at 13 cents for every dollar spent. Now, Iron Man
3 claims that they've put $8.99 for every dollar spent. We've got
numerous, numerous states that claim a lot less than that. Mr. Chairman,
I ask for the amendment passage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Hamilton?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr, Chairman. I didn't bring my very thick file on the
benefits of film into committee this morning, because I was not prepared
to argue this today. But just off the cuff, in 2012 alone, film and
television production spent over 121 million dollars in North Carolina
and put over 10,000 people to work, directly related to the film
industry. This is not to say that that number, that 10000 person number
does not include all the spin-off number business that benefited from
the presence of the industry in the state: lighting companies, companies
selling wood products, restaurants, bars, any other number of facilities
where those secondary and tertiary expenditures are made with the money
that was being brought into the state. In 2012, we project that
statewide, the presence of film brought more than 350 million dollars to
the state. So, this is all in a two year period: 2011 and 2012.</p>

...which just coincides with the adoption of the most current film
incentive. Up until that point, millions of dollars had been spent in
the State. I believe over the last 30 years the film industry has spent
in excess of $5 billion in the State of North Carolina. But once we
adopted the current law in 2010 and put it into place in 2011, we saw
those expenditures in North Carolina from film go up exponentially. Many
people have benefited. We're not talking about the Robert Downey Jr.'s,
we're not talking about Claire Dane, who many of you got to see on set
yesterday. We're talking about the plumbers, the electricians, the
carpenters, the make-up artists, the people that are in the trades that
are affiliated with the film industry throughout the country and around
the world. A film production or a television production is not put
together by one person. It is done behind the scenes. Ninety-five
percent of these jobs are trade related jobs. They are good paying jobs
and this is a clean, green industry for the State of North Carolina. It
provides uncounted dollars in tourism and marketing for the State and I
urge you strongly to please not support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I like Representative Helm
to, was not aware of this amendment was going to be presented so I don't
have my rather thick file on the movie industry either. But if I could
be allowed to make a few comments. It was my impression when I got
elected to this office and Governor McCrory was elected Governor that he
wanted to do everything that he could to make this business friendly and
to have industry come to North Carolina so we could get the much needed
jobs that we need for our economy. I can't think of a better, clean
industry for this State to have than the movie industry. Any
representative who is in this room that represents a district where
filming has occurred knows the huge financial impact that the movie
industry has made from the areas that they represent. As Representative
Hamilton stated, you're talking about thousands upon thousands of
permanent jobs, even more so with part time jobs. You're talking about
the trickle down effect that these people that have these jobs have
earned this income, they buy cars, they buy houses, they buy groceries.
They go out in the community and spend money and they help to invest in
our State and also to make our economy thrive. The bottom line, and
believe me, I was on the film commission in Wilmington and I got to know
the movie industry. I got to know how it works. I got to know the
importance of the incentives. You want to kill the movie industry? If
you want to see everybody move out of Wilmington and everywhere else
where filming is going on now and never come back, then simply get rid
of the incentives. It's that short and it's that sweet and it's that to
the point. So you want to get rid of the jobs? You want to get rid of
the economy? Then get rid of the incentives. So I please ask you to
seriously, seriously consider this amendment. With all due respect to my
friend, Representative Hager, but to vote against it and keep this movie
industry in North Carolina so we can keep the jobs, we can keep or
economy growing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Davis. Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and of course, I want to give
all due respect to everybody who worked on the bill and whoever the
amendment sponsor is, Representative Hager, but at the same time, as we
know we're trying to move forward, be a more competitive State and this
industry, of course, has the hallmarks of all of the type of things we
want industry coming to this State to have. Representative Hager cited a
lot of statistics from other States who've done their studies. We
haven't completed our comprehensive study to make a determination and I
certainly think we've seen jobs leaving just on the thought that this
might happen. So I'd ask folks please vote against this amendment. Let's
try to keep the film industry here and make it more of a partner here in
North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I do support this one amendment. The bill,
as a whole, is a work of art, but it has this little smudge on it that
we need to take care of. The movie industry is all about illusion and
fiction and the reality is that we had an analysis that was just handed
to me by Mr. Tark, but done by Dr. Patrick McCue and I've actually sent
it to most of you. This is from our own staff that says, and I'm only
going to read you two sentences from this, but it's about the 2011 tax
year where we had $30 million in credits. Listen to this, two sentences.
It's supported by 10 pages of text, but here are two sentences you have
to understand. &quot;Under the most plausible assumptions, the film
credit likely attracted 55 to 70 new jobs to North Carolina in 2011. The
film credited created 290 to 350 fewer jobs than would have been
created...</p>

through an across the board tax reduction of the same magnitude. I rest
my case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. It’s always very hard to stand up and
oppose something that’s sent forth by one of your friends. I wanted to
offer a slightly different take. I don’t think we’re prepared this
morning to really argue the merits or the bad side of the film tax
credit. When this bill was sent forth, what I attempted to do was to let
the credit, let this credit, that has been used by folks. It, the bill,
did not address this at all so there’s been business plans made and what
not that contemplate this being in place. So, my thought was we would
be, with that in mind, and you’ve got to assume that that’s a fact that
we would be better off if it was going to expire to let the expiration
occur in 2015 when it’s set to occur now. So, I would have to oppose
this amendment at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Chair. Actually, the bill’s ?? have
pretty much said what I was thinking, which is, and this a problem we’ve
had on a number of things, if we’ve told people we have a tax credit,
we’ve given an expiration date, people have made investments, have put
in contracts -- one of the things I heard last week were the number of
people who said, and I’m not a huge fan of this whole thing but I’ve
been learning a lot about it, and the number of people who said that the
presence, it may not have brought new jobs but it saved the jobs they
had. It saved these companies that were doing transportation, that were
doing lighting, that were doing things I’d never thought of being
associated with the film industry and it saved their jobs in a time when
the economy was down. There had been contracts set on the current
expiration date. We need to leave the current expiration date in place
and not cut those contracts short in the middle of contracts that have
already been signed and are underway. I know of one company, for
instance, in Charlotte that has already leased the building, a lot of
square footage, based on the current termination of the contract.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Rodney Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Chair. I just want to echo some of
the sediments that’s been made around the table, especially I’m just
going to cut it. Unlike Representative Davis, I’m going to cut it, cut
quick and straight to the point. The film credits have been a advantage
for North Carolina in attracting different projects in the film
industry. There’s a lot of activity. Of course, you have to understand
I’m from Wilmington, North Carolina. It’s where I grew up. I remember
when the De Laurentiis came in and put the studio there and I know the
economic impact that the film industry has had on the lives of people,
not only in Wilmington, but also in the district that I represent now in
Charlotte, North Carolina, as far as the filming of Homeland, some other
things. And I actually took a tour with Representative Samuelson last
Friday and as she said, this is not about the production. This is about
the ancillary and the supportive industries that this film credit
supports and it’s been a help and it saved a lot of the jobs that could
have been catastrophic because there could have been catastrophic losses
because of the recession. So I ask that you not only just defeat this
amendment, you know I have great respect for my friend Representative
Hager, but let’s defeat this amendment and let it sunset where it is now
but we also need to have some help to debate going forward about how we
attract the film industry and keep our competitive advantage in this
industry going forward. So, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Chairman.  It’s all been said but I
want to point out that I think most people in North Carolina think that
maybe in this building up here that the film industry is in Wilmington.
It did start there but it grew and that should be a testament to why
it’s important to keep this industry growing in North Carolina. It has
spread across the state. Our City Council had, at the beginning of their
legislative request from us, and we removed it. And that was to extend
the film tax credit even farther.</p>

It's growing across the state. If we support this amendment, with all
due respect to the amendment sponsor, but if we support it, right now,
what has been happening with the growth here is going to South Carolina.
They're already waiting to see what we're gonna do here, and industries
is looking there. But it's growing, why stop it? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I represent the people in Nash and Franklin counties and as far as
I know, we're not doing any films there but I want to go back to comment
that Representative Stam made. I don't know why the taxpayers in the
counties that I represent was high in employment should have to
subsidize people down in Wilmington or Charlotte or wherever else the
movies are, are, are playing. It seems like to me a, a, a reallocation
of money away from poor areas to other areas. Some of those jobs that
would be created that Representative Stam was talking about by overall
tax reduction costs across the board would be in my district. They would
be in every district. They would be spread across the state. I keep
hearing that well, we've got so many jobs in this industry that the
state is, that the taxpayers are paying for, whether solar, solar energy
or film or whatever else, and my thoughts are this. You're gonna create
jobs in any industry that the taxpayers pay for. We're just deciding
which businesses are gonna prosper and which ones are not here in North
Carolina rather than out there in the private sector where the, where
the market should drive what, what prospers and what doesn't. I get sick
of millionaires telling us that we've got to prop them up with taxpayer
dollars or they're gonna leave, whether sports franchises or
entertainers or anybody else. People that are providing absolutely
nothing that we have to have for the functioning of our state. They're
not like teachers or doctors or lawyers that we have to have. We could
do without professional athletes and do without special entertainers and
have a great society. So, I get really weary of millionaires in adjunct
industries that we really don't really have to have telling us that
without taxpayer dollars, they're gonna leave and go somewhere else. I
say let them go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. Just to, couple of closing comments. With all
due respect sir, it's not about the movie industry leaving if we don't
have incentives. It's about the movie industry not coming if we don't
have incentives. One thing I will say, the movie industry is watching
North Carolina and the attitude that North Carolina has towards the
movie industry. These people don't do these things fly by night, they do
these things years in advance. They go scout locations. They look at the
economy. They look at what's there as far as accessories to be able to
do the filming. They look at the workforce. They look at all of these
things, and they make a huge investment for years in order to plan to
come eventually to the state. And there's very much concern, because
I've had phone calls from film people in California. I've talked to them
when they come to Raleigh, as others have in the House. They are looking
at this because it sends a bad message to the movie industry. We're
talking about ending the film incentives, and they're not gonna come
here if they don't feel like we've got a positive climate for the movie
industry because they're not gonna invest all that time and effort
beforehand before they finally do come here. And, and, and one last
point. I just can't emphasize enough. That, that report, with all due
respect Representative Stam is not an accurate report and it's based on
some faulty information and to think for one minute that Iron Man 3 only
created fifty jobs? Come on, it's like Representative Samuelson said, a
lot of those jobs are being protected by the movie industry. We're not
talking about the big movie stars that make millions of dollars. We're
talking about the people that build the stages. They go out there and do
the grunt work. And I know people, when the movie industry wasn't doing
so well in Wilmington they had to travel to Louisiana and these other
states to get a job to support their family. But thank goodness, they
still love Wilmington, they stayed there, and thank goodness the movie
industry came back and they're able to still live there. But I'm, I kid
you not, you take away the incentives, it's gone, and then you can look
at all these jobs we could have had but don't have, and look at what it
does to our economy. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Will Brawley of Mecklenburg.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. Questions either for sponsors or staff. As I
understand, first this is already slated to expire at the end of 2015.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And there are, are there a raft of other tax credits that are scheduled
to expire 2014, 2015, 2016 approximately how many of those are there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is, I don't have them right in front of me, I'm thinking there's
probably ten to fifteen that are set to expire in 2014, and there's a
couple or three set to expire in 2015, and another couple in 2016.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for the amendment sponsor, why are we just doing this one and
not doing all of them?

Session 55:
Speaker 1: Thank you  Representative Brawley because this is one of the
more unusual and this actually is a check that we cut from our state
coffers where tax payer money actually flows in a bank  transfer or
check to the entity itself and this is money  that we could be using to
fund other folks  xx  like teachers, teachers’ assistants, so it is
immediate pay back. Representative Brawley.
Speaker changes: Representative Starnes.
Speaker changes: Thank you. I want to be clear on something. I thought
it in last week’s meeting when we had a discussion and I asked a
question on the other tax credits that were set to expire or were they
built or was the revenue they  will generate moved  into the Tax
proposal and your answer was
Speaker changes: Yes.
Speaker changes: But in this bill it was not built into that. So
basically to represent  Brawley’s point those other tax credits are set
to expire but their revenue is built in to the assumptions that we could
lower the tax rates. The xx  tax credit  was not built into that
assumptions so if it expires it  would generate, it would free up
revenue that could be used to lower the rates further.
Speaker changes: Representative Hamilton.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Chairman, one more follow up comment.
First I would like to,  xxxxxxxx Second way, this industry  is not
eligible for other tax credits that are currently enjoyed by  all other
corporations across the state , they don’t have depreciation, they can’t
do those write-offs that a traditional corporation can do; because they
are not set up as traditional corporation which is why the tax credit is
structured differently. The state of  North Carolina has the toughest
stand on it in the Unites States for its view and approval  and auditing
of the tax credit. The production must come, it must spend  all of its
money , it must close it books; the books must be audited by the state
department of revenue and everything be closed down and approved before
any money is returned to the entity to the corporation. And so at the
end of the day it’s always a net gain to the state of North Carolina in
terms of sales tax revenues and other secondary and tertiary benefits to
the state. But the amount that the production spends in the state always
exceeds what is returned to them after the production is closed and the
books have been audited by the state department of revenue and approved
for other payment.
Speaker changes: Further  questions or  comments? the committee.
Representative Hager.
Speaker changes:   Thank you Mr. Chairman, there’s some   we talked
about earlier. I think it’s Representative Hall that said if this the
type of jobs  we won’t.
Speaker changes: Well I agree with it if other folks have anything to
say and if you pay me to come  into the state and live, start on a job
and you pay somebody else to come into this xx the type of jobs you
want.
Speaker changes: What we have decided here  guys is do  we want to
continue to spend money this way    attract folks in here, we have to
pay to come or do we want to put that money into loan and we are rate
starred ?? citizens,  do we want to put that money into giving our High
way patrol  who  make $ 36,000 a year?  Your own Interstate 4 A.M. in
the morning,  would  you stop somebody you don’t have $36,000 a year.
For this money we could give them at least as part of a raise or  this
money we could work  on teachers’ assistants, but  tp apy for folks to
come in here work part time
Speaker changes: As Representative Stam said we have spent $ 350000
million  in 2011- 2012, if you have that as a hundred seventy five
million what we spend,  $ 70 million in 2012, get that $175 million ..
Speaker changes:  if the numbers are right. There is no stay there’s no
numbers I have seen from anybody  that says this actually a winner for
North Carolina.  There’s five or six, I think Seven states have made
these studies; and it just doesn’t work out.
Speaker changes: Sure. It may feel good, it may look good to say I am xx
but the number does not prove out it’s a good thing for North Carolina.
Speaker changes: Representative Jones.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Chairman, sometimes I think we feel
guilty , perhaps debating the wrong issue. The issue here is not whether
you write the Movie industry or not. I think the issue is this; the
right way for us to do this is to North Carolina and it is really
effective; some people say it really is. If any person in this room ,
represented a particular x or particular business..</p>

Change Speaker:review wheel and we decided it was to have everybody any
other certain amount of money you will get all the money to represent
Hager and that he or his business or his industry go out and create jobs
with it. I would like to think that he would come back to us and
referred that, yes, Leah. we got some business, and we got to talking
with a question. I think we have to ask is not only that question MEP
could eat it working, but how many people are noticing on working in
Manhattan had to get out of many good to represent Tiger and I think the
same principle applies here. I think we also have access to the
question, visit Lowell government to pick winners and losers because us
basically what we thought we could say the limited target a particular
industry is an industry that the subject. why can some people think that
this is a good opportunity for us, but a lot of energies that create
jobs as well so that you set up a permanent sanity and yet more ascended
this particular one thrives. I'd also like to suggest that this debate
is not a change when is great is that
those of us that were here last session that was already set to expire
was extended for another year and then continue to happen to continue to
incentivize our members. if you go to go out and campaign that time.
this is something that I'll probably don't know the General assembly and
a minimum heart, try to extend these tax credits to my particular
industry. my particular area applications have to decide is this is the
right thing and there's nothing to Hagerman, it is a good one, and for
all those reasons Change Speaker: as you all that we all campaign work
