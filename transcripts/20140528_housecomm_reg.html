I call to order the meeting of the full House, regulatory reform
committee members, if you could, find your seats. Guests, if you could,
retire to the back of the meeting room. This is the first meeting of the
full committee for the short session, I'd like to recognize our Sargent
of Arms for the quick turnover of the room, the Senate were here
previously and that's the reason there's a little bit of chaos, but Bob
Rossy, David Collins, Martha Gadison and Doug Harris, thank you very
much for your hard work and for bringing a little order to this meeting.
We do have some house pages I'd like to recognize. Pages, when I call
your name, if you could, stand up and hold up your hand, I would
appreciate it. Ian Boehner, Connor McVicker, Samantha Naylor, Daniel
Lou, and Lauren Lee. Thank you very much for being with us this week,
and I hope you enjoy regulatory reform as much as we do. Folks, we have
a full calendar of bills on the agenda. A lot of these of very
technical, so for the wonky aspect of your personality, you'll enjoy a
lot of these, but we need to move through them at a fairly good clip.
I'd like to go ahead and recognize Chris Millis, Chris? Chris is going
to be running House Bill 1081. There is a PCS before, so we have a
motion to adopt PCS. Representative Brown has made a motion to adopt
PCS. All in favor say aye. PCS is beforced. Representative Millis, you
have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair and members of the committee. For those of you all
who are part of the ERC Committee this interim, this bill is familiar to
you all. For those who are not, I will briefly explain what these
measures do. Before I do so, let me thank those with the ERC as well as
the state ?? groups who worked tirelessly throughout the interim to
actually take the original intent of addressing the problems that this
bill works to address and polishing it out and hammering it out and
having very frank and delivered it in open conversations to make this
bill the best bill that it could be before you today. So very grateful
to the stakeholders and all the work that's been put into it. Very
simply it's this: the bill does exactly what the short title says, and
one thing that I want you to understand is while the bill says that it
reforms the review of engineering work, please understand that every one
of your constituents, who actually desires to turn dirt on their
property, to expand their business, or to do any type of development
that requires regulatory approval, that this is actually a bill that
affects them directly, and what the bill looks to do is reform our
regulatory processes to move more towards an effective and efficient
manner to uphold our protections to health and the environment. And what
the bill does is, the first section has the definitions; the next
section actually requires the individuals who are your constituents
going through these regulatory agencies to distinguish between what is
recommended by the agency from what is required in order to get a
regulatory approval, and if the regulatory agencies require such, this
legislation to simply ask that they state the authority that they have
to require such for the approval, so the measure is simply to uphold our
protection of the health and environment that our constituents have sent
us up here to protect, but to do so in a way that is efficient and also
very effective. I'll appear to stay and answer any questions, but due to
the schedule that the Chair has, I want to be very brief in my comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Millis. Any questions from members of the
committee for Representative Millis? Say non, do we have a motion?
Representative Waddell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move that we give favorable report to Bill 1081,
unfavorable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. We have a motion to give favorable report to PCS, unfavorable
to the original bill. All in favor say aye. All opposed. Thank you very
much, Mr. Representative Millis.</p>

Have a subsequent referral to environment. Next on our agenda are two
bills with Representative Brody, the House Bill 1105 and House Bill
1106. There are no PCS’s. Representative Brody you’re recognized to,
just run them each separately. You’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. A couple very short
bills, they come out of the study committee on land development
co-chaired by Representative Torbett and myself. Just to be real brief,
in our study committee we had actually encountered and it may be
stretching the imagination of everybody that sometimes government causes
problems and we need to step in and attempt to fix it. The first bill is
very simple that it says that when a county decides to take over the
erosion and sedimentary control from DENR that currently they can take
it over but DENR can withhold some projects. What we’re saying is that
if they’re going to decide to do it, they need to take over everything.
This way that they will be able to look at everything and so they’re
aware of certain problems that might arise. If anybody wants the details
on it you can ask questions in the next few days.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Representative Brody. Representative Iler?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Move for favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Hold your motion. Do we have any questions regarding
this bill for Representative Brody. Representative Hall?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Just a quick question about
what caused this to be the focus of your attention, was there a specific
problem of sharing of information between the state and local?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Brody?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] That’s exactly what it was. It was one agency was
looking at the other and said they’re responsible and it caused a very
severe problem within a particular subdivision and what we’re trying to
do is number one, if this would have been in effect then when a
particular gas and ?? would have taken over the sedimentary control
program from DENR they would have discovered this, they would have had
to deal with this long before the problem manifested itself, but your
assessment is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Question. In my district I’ve got a problem where the
design of the water flow coming off of the highway and the development
in the highway with the heavy rains we’ve had in the spring it’s created
a terrible erosion problem on one man’s property and everybody seems to
be passing the buck that it’s somebody else’s responsibility. Will this
do anything to help something like that clear up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’d have to refer to staff to be specific to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Representative Brody. Bill Patterson?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair, members of the committee.
Representative Brawley, I do not believe that this bill is particularly
designed to deal with the problem that you’ve described. This bill deals
with situations where there are land disturbing activities that’s under
the regulatory authority of DENR and a local government. It decides to
submit a program for approval by the sedimentation controls commission.
Sometimes, as Representative Brody indicated, and in this case that was
the subject of this committee study. Sometimes DENR will grandfather
over existing projects, subdivisions, where there’s land disturbing
activity that’s currently being enforced by the commission will be
grandfathered when the local government takes over the regulatory
function. This is designed to ensure that everything gets handled at the
local level if they have their own program.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I support your bill. It sounds like a good idea to know
who is responsible for what and if that’ll help us I’d appreciate what
you did.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Representative Brawley. Representative
Faircloth?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Representative Brody you
mentioned in this particular case ‘this developer’ and that always
troubles me a little bit. We’re not doing this for an individual, we’re
doing this for the good of the overall programs. Is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] That’s correct. The problem in the existing subdivision
is going to be there and there’s nothing we can actually do about it.
What we’re trying to do is prevent something from happening in the
future.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Any additional questions? Seeing none, Representative
Iler is recognized for a motion.</p>

The problem ?? Representative Brody's committee I'd like to move for
favorable report to House Bill 1105.
SPEAKER CHANGES: With referral to environment. All in favor of the
motion will say aye. All opposed? Motion is adopted. Representative
Brody, thank you. You're recognized to run your second bill, which is
House Bill 1106.
SPEAKER CHANGES: 1106 is on about the same lines. What it says is that
if there is in, when person files for an erosion or sedimentary control
permit, if one of the items that is required in this permit is
structural, where it would require an actual footing and that, in that
case would require the local building inspector to actually inspect it,
that the, the two, the agencies would coordinate the deener or the
county would be required to tell the inspection department that there is
a structure going to be produced on that, on that property required by
erosion control, and they are supposed to then inspect it. Simple as
that.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Thank you Representative Brody. Representative Iler?
SPEAKER CHANGES:  At the appropriate time.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Please hold your motion. Any questions for members of
the committee for Representative Brody? Representative Hall?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Thank you Mr. Chair. Quick question about any creation
of additional liability on the part of the parties involved, since we
asked for an additional certification from the designer of the device?
SPEAKER CHANGES: I'm going to refer to staff on that one.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Refer to this to Mr. Patterson.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Thank you Mr. Chair. Representative Hall, to the extent
that the designer is a professional, which is I think usually the case,
usually a licensed engineer. I think that the fact is this is requiring
that person to certify to deener (??), that the device has been designed
in accordance with applicable law and specs. And further, that it will
be installed in accordance with the erosion and sedimentation control
plan in the area where it's being installed. So, if nothing else it, it
puts somebody, it makes somebody accountable for that being done. In
this particular case, I believe the subcommittee, I mean the study
committee, found that the person who designed the retaining wall for
this particular subdivision was never on site. It was not in fact
installed in accordance with a design that was approved, and this would
attempt to, I think, provide some motivation for a little more oversight
on the part of the designer to make sure that the design is carried
through and is installed as designed.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Avila?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Thank you Mr. Chair. I just need to clarify
Representative Brody, this here again we're talking about commercial
installation design and installation?
SPEAKER CHANGES:  This particular one was a residential subdivision, but
I would, I would believe that when you get a erosion or sedimentary
control permit it, it doesn't distinguish between commercial or
residential, it's just a land disturbing activity. So, these would apply
to, to everything in those.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Follow up?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Yes, if I could raise a question in terms of like a lot
of a DI wires like to do retaining walls. They're real popular in my
area. What is the current control or procedures if someone wants to
install a retaining wall, if they're not an engineer, and they just run
out and lay a lot of brick and that sort? Do we have any kind of
permitting or anything like for building an addition type stuff?
SPEAKER CHANGES: The, the code actually provides if, if it reaches
certain parameters, like certain month, certain height, then you would
be subject to the code. But in particular in this case, what they're
saying is that it would be a person who's required to build a retaining
wall, for example, under the, an erosion control permit, and the
difference in if somebody just wants to build one. Yeah.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Jordan.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Very quickly, this may be a question for Mr. Patterson.
It says here that this is only in the case where these walls have to be
inspected and permitted by local government. So, my question is if it
has to be inspected and permitted by local government, isn't there a
local inspector that's making sure that it's been installed according to
all the local ordinances? Why do we have to deal with this and bring in
other people?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Brody, you want the question or would
you like Mr. Patterson</p>

<p id="15:00">
?? to address her
[SPEAKER CHANGES ]I think I'll Let mr patterson take a shot at it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES ]Mr.Patterson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES ]Thank you mr.chair. Representative Jordan, you are
correct that this bill would apply when there is an erosion control
device that by virtue of it's design requires something to be installed
that would permitting for which and inspection of which would fall
within the jurisdiction of the local building inspection department. The
bill is intended to do two things, i think, one is to get the designer
of that erosion control device on the record to certify that it's been
designed and will be installed in accordance with applicable law and the
plan. The second thing you will notice that is does is it requires
Deener to tell the local chief building inspection officer for that
locality to provide them with a copy of that conditioned permit, it's
conditioning the issue and so if that erosion control permit on that
certification so its clear from this that the local person who is
responsible, it's not bringing anyone else in to inspect, but it's
saying that whoever is responsible for inspecting the device is going to
have before them the conditions including the certification by that
engineer. i think that is what it's designed to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES ] Any additional questions for representative brody?
Representative Cunnigham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES ] Thank you. my question is currently where I live at
there is a retaining law that was put there by the city and it is to
retain sedimentation from coming down the hill and rolling into the
road. If we already have in place the codes for that to be done at the
city at the local, why do we need additional designer to come and tell
them this is how you need to build it, when we already have people that
know how to build it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES ] Representative Brody?
[SPEAKER CHANGES ] I think what you're looking at is , if you have
somebody qualified that can certify within whatever the jurisdiction is
that they're able to do it basically what this is requiring is that
there are other entities that may require a retaining law such as Deener
in a sedimentary control measure, and if we dont tell them that if this
going to be structure or if its going to have a foundation and be
inspected, then they might not do it. and if they dont do it,  it falls
which is precisely the problem we had,was it manifested itself somewhere
down the road and it can be extremely expensive, so what we're doing is
just saying is that you have to tell the person you have to tell the
inspection department that this is there, and then the inspection
department knows that they're going to have to go in and inspect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES ] Representative Millis
[SPEAKER CHANGES ]Thank you Mr.Chair. I just want to bring up in the
discussion here one major point, and that is the bill currently is in
the confines of the existing codes existing regulations and existing
processes that already occur but the gap that's actually being filled is
this, and its a very important gap,on behalf of public safety and public
health is the aspect  is that a design and a plan that is on a piece of
paper is scrutinized and approved and that piece of paper sits in a
filing cabinet. And what this measure does is to make sure that what is
built in the field has been built according to the design, it is making
sure that the intent of the design was carried out at construction on
behalf of the public health, safety, and the environment. So i
definitely commend this build, and i think it's a good measure to
actually bridging the gap
in a regulatory reform manner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES ] Representative Ailer you're recognized for a motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES ] I haven't seen the situation that we dont want to
occur again. Move for the adoption of house bill...favor report house
bill 11.0.6

<p id="20:00">
Carbon monoxide poisoning and subsequent death in the western part of
the state, and it’s actually happened a couple of times in other areas
of the country, and so in 74 in the Reg Reform Bill last year, House 74,
we went in and tried to make a requirement for public safety that you
have carbon monoxide detectors. Well, after we passed the bill, it came
out that there were some technical issues about it’s actually not a
detector, it’s an alarm. It doesn’t do any good to detect something and
not notify people. What you want is to detect it and notify people. Then
there was a question about whether they were hard wired or
battery-operated. Then there was a question of exactly who is going to
enforce this and make sure that you have it in there, and some of that
was set up to be studied with the Environmental Review Commission. They
came back to us, we set up some task forces this year and sort of
divided it all up, and one of the task forces that I was on was to work
with the people who were in charge of getting all those details lined
up. As it turned out, because of all the snow we had this year, they
ended up meeting without us several times and were able to
self-negotiate. That’s the great thing, when you can get the groups to
get together and self-negotiate what this needs to be. What you have
before you is a way to clarify when a carbon monoxide alarm, not
detector, is required to be installed in a lodging establishment, what
constitutes a lodging establishment and they define that and where
they’re covered in various areas of statute. In fact, the PCS was to
make sure that a type of lodging establishment that is covered in
another sector, and already requires carbon monoxide detectors, that
they weren’t covered by both of them, so that was all we did on the PCS
was clarify it. Then, who inspects it? Candidly, the thing that was the
most contentious was, if you fail the first inspection what is the
follow-up procedure? We went through to make sure, if it’s one of those
situations where there’s imminent danger there’s a fast follow-up; if
it’s not imminent danger, give the people three days to figure out what
it is they need to do, whether they need to change a battery or buy a
new alarm. That’s the gist of the bill. I’m going to let staff address
whether I missed anything on that. Peter?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, Peter Ledford with the Research Division. I think
Representative Samuelson did a great job summing up the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Ledford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, for the safety of the people all over the state of North Carolina, I
would urge your support of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions for Representative Samuelson regarding House Bill 1140?
Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, thank you for bringing this forward, but I’m
concerned about the definition: it says seven or more continuous days
down in line 34. Does this include, individually, on homes which are
rated at the beach from Saturday at 3 p.m. to Saturday at 12?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. Those are the ones that when we—and staff make sure because this is
the part of the PCS—I’ll let him describe it, but no. That was why we
made sure that the PCS didn’t accidentally pick up things we didn’t mean
for it to pick up, so Peter can address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Ledford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler, if you will look to page three of the PCS, lines
41-43. Subdivision six there says that properties that are subject to
the provisions of either general statute 42-42 or 42A-31 are not subject
to these provisions. General statute 42A-31 regulates vacation rental
properties, which is a rather specific definition, and they are subject
to different requirements and we’re going to let those requirements
stand, and they would not be subject to these new requirements for
lodging establishments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And you’re actually a perfect example of why we put it in there, because
they were concerned that, when we had the language about the seven days,
even though it quoted the statute, the average inspector may not go back
and look to see. That’s why we added it, to make sure it was clear.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any additional questions for Representative Samuelson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Reives, welcome to House Regulatory Reform.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, thank you for the doing this presentation. One
question I had was, do you know why the term dwelling unit or sleeping
unit replaced enclosed space? I was curious about that change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes because there was—and it’s a good question for a Freshman, thank
you—because we found out that enclosed space could include things like
if you had an open patio, and had one of those kind of like lattice
roofs on it, that could technically be considered an enclosed space but
we’re not concerned about that, because if you’re outside with a
latticed roof you’re not going to worry about carbon monoxide so it was
a term that we chose.</p>

Next up, for everybody keeping track on your agenda, the burden of proof
in certain contested cases will not be heard today. We have a little
work left to do on that particular bill. At this time I’d like to
recognize Representative Stevens. She’ll be presenting house bill 1170,
disapproval of a funeral board rule. Representative Stevens, you’re
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, this was on a part of our Administrative
Procedures Oversight Committee. We had ten people file objecting to a
petition by the funeral board to increase their fees. As we got into
some of the details of this analysis, the funeral board had a lot of
money in reserve. They had made a tremendous expenditure buying, instead
of renting or leasing, they bought a million dollar condo to house their
facility, and they want to get that paid off in eight, eight or ten
years. They’re getting tighter on funds because of that over commitment
they made. They could do some refinancing, and we were just opposed to
allowing them to expand the fee for that purpose, and therefore. The fee
had not been increased in a long time, but they still had more than
enough money to operate. So, we didn’t feel it was appropriate, and this
was the pathway for the funeral directors to object at ?? Fort.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions for Representative Stevens? Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  What was the fee for? I didn’t quite.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The funeral board directors have a fee for the licensing fees to become
a director, to become an assistant director, the various arrangement of
fees that they charge for these people to become licensed and do
business. So, it was a business affiliated fee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens. Thank you, Mr. Chair. What is that fee? Do you
know is it the same fee for all situations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff has that, I think.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Karen Cockenbrown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. The fees that were being increased by this rule
included a fee to an application for establishing a funeral home was
increased from $150 to $200. The annual renewal fees for embalmers,
funeral directors were increased from $40 to $75. The total fee for an
embalmer and funeral director, when both are held by the same person,
was increased from $60 to $100. And the annual renewal fee for a
transportation permit was increased from $40 to $75.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any additional questions for Representative Stevens? Representative
Iler, you’re recognized for a motion.

interesting as we can. This particular bill is clarifying the existing
rule readoption process and, essentially, if the rule’s review
commission feels as if one of our agencies is failing to follow the
procedures, they are directed to refer that to our committee so we can
address that and they’re also directed to establish a date as to when
certain rules need to be reviewed. This is all kind of an extension of
the rule making process that we did in House Bill 74. I won’t take you
through that but, as these things begin to unfold, we need to tweak them
as we go, so I move for a favorable report on the PCS, unfavorable to
the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just had one quick question, and I don’t believe anything’s in here on
this, but what are the consequences for not filing your annual report
and not getting it in?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, if you could direct that to Ms. Cochran-Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Cochran-Brown, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Representative Stevens, the process that you all
created last year for the review of existing rules provides that, if an
agency fails to conduct the review as required by law, their rules will
expire and will be taken out of the code, so the agency will not have
rules that they can operate under.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions from the committee? Representative Stevens?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions? Members of the committee, you’ve heard the motion for
Representative Stevens regarding the PCS for House Bill 1109,
unfavorable to the original bill. Any further discussion or debate? If
not, all in favor say aye. All opposed. Motion carried. Thank you
members of the committee. Representative Moffitt, House Bill 1152.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. This is a bill that has already cleared this
committee. Actually it’s cleared a committee previously and has already
cleared the House. This is eliminating obsolete boards and commissions.
This actually got caught up in Senate Bill 10 last year, and a
consolidated effort to do a lot of other things, so this is actually
doing the responsible thing and eliminating things that we no longer
need as a state from a board perspective.  I can answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Part nine, I think I’m on that commission, which hasn’t met in many
years: how do we know it still exists since it came from the Chief
Justice? As somebody from staff, I think it morphed into something else.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Cochran-Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Representative Stam, you’re correct. In 2006, the
legislature established by statute the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry
Commission and that really is the entity that would perform this
function now. The Chief Justice, by a resolution or some kind of a
document, created the actual Innocence Commission. This is worded as an
encouragement to the Chief Justice because it might be a separation of
powers issue for the legislature to try and repeal something that was
created by the Chief Justice. It, however, still seems to exist and
we’re encouraging the Chief Justice to take some formal action to
eliminate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was my question, because I think I was on the successor. Do we know
it still exists? Has there been any recent communication from the
Supreme Court that this actual thing exists? Go ahead and pass it but I
think, before it gets to the floor, we ought to find out for sure that
it actually exists so that we’re not asking them to do something that’s
already been done years ago.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We wouldn’t want to do that. Thank you Representative Stam.
Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I wanted to ask, you mentioned obsolete, how you
determine that a committee is obsolete? You can answer that first and
then I’ll follow up.</p>

<p id="35:00">
Representative Adams. This is actually, we’re just picking up a bill
that we argued through the house last session, so a lot of the
preliminary work I did not participate in so I’d like the Chair to
direct that to Miss Karen Cochran Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Karen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Representative Adams, in 2012,
the joint legislative administrative procedure oversight committee
studied and reviewed these and went through all of the outstandings for
the boards and commissions and checked when they had last met, whether
they had been appropriated any funds basically trying to find out any
information about them. These were the boards that we found and if you
look in the summary for each one of them, it indicates that they haven’t
been active in a number of years. In some cases, they’ve never been
funded. There have never been appointments made to some of them. So
basically all of these boards and commissions were the ones out of that
review that seemed not to exist in any way currently. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to
comment because I was not on the committee for dropout prevention and
certainly involved in that and I guess the question I think it did good
work and it did exist and so forth, but funding was not appropriated for
it and so it was just kind of eliminated by this legislature, which I
didn’t necessarily agree with, but anyway. The question I have is on
some of these and that one in particular, is the work being carried on
in some other way? Maybe that’s not the business of this committee, I’m
just curious about that. Miss Cochran Brown may know that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I don’t know that, Representative Adams. I can check that for
you and find out. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative
Baumgardner. [SPEAKER CHANGES]?? when you need one. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Thank you. Representative Horn. Representative Queen.
Representative Harrison. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Just a
quick question to I guess Miss Cochran Brown. Do we know Blue Ridge
National Heritage Area was established? That’s number five eliminating
the national heritage area designation commission. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
honestly don’t recall, Representative Harrison, whether it had ever
existed but it hasn’t for many years functioned. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, further questions? Representative Hall? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. And this is a question about the repeal of the small
business contractor act and the small business contractor authority.
Does anyone know the history on that other than the fact it wasn’t
funded? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Cochran Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can’t
recall, Representative Paul. I’ll be glad to check that for you. But as
indicated and this information was culled during 2011 and 2012. Nothing
has happened since then in any of these boards and they hadn’t for a
number of years before that time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Queen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, just as a matter of information, the Blue
Ridge National Heritage Area Commission did do their work and we do have
a Blue Ridge National Heritage Area established. So there’s no need for
this because we have succeeded in it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Further questions, comments from the committee? Representative
Cunningham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt do we know what the
savings are on these commissions for the ones that was funded, the
finances, because when we serve on the commission you do get a travel
and a state, do we know what that savings is? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Rep. Cunningham. I don’t I know when this review was done as
indicated by Miss Cochran Brown that no money had been appropriated
there. I’m not sure if any expenses were incurred or not. I’ve asked the
chair to redirect that question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Ma’am. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Moffitt is correct in most of these cases these
boards have not met in many years, so there had been no expenditures for
them for a long time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, any further
questions. Representative Baumgardner. ?? motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Favorable report for this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the
committee, you’ve heard the motion of Representative Baumgardner. All in
favor say aye. All apposed. Motion carried. Thank you. Representative
Moffitt, you’re recognized for House Bill 1153. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chair. Members of the committee, this recommendation was
brought to APO by the office of administrative hearings. Essentially
this authorizes them to file their documents</p>

... electronically on contested cases. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions from
the committee? Representative Stevens. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion for a
favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, you’ve
heard the motion on the floor. Is there any further discussion or
debate? If not, all in favor say “Aye”. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All opposed? Motion carried. Representative Moffitt, you’re
recognized for House Bill 1163. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Members this is again our effort to continue streamlining the
rule-making process, and essentially what this does is eliminates the
need to certification in regards to moving through the process of rule
adoption. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions or comments from the committee?
Representative Bumgardner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion for a favorable
report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, you’ve heard the
motion on the floor. Is there any further discussion or debate? If not –
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair? I’m sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Ma’am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Over here to your left. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry.
Representative Harrison, pardon me, I’m sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chair. I’m sorry, Representative Moffitt, this certification
process, was that something that we’d had in last year’s bill, or is
this something that’s been longstanding, the certification process we’re
eliminating? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I don’t know the particular history
in it. I just know that it became an issue in regards to rule-adoptions
– that certification became one of the sticking points in regards to
adding a lot of time and money to actually moving through the
rule-adoption process, so seeing as it was not a necessary thing to
have, eliminating it should streamline the process. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall. Further questions or comments from the committee?
You’ve heard the motion from Representative Bumgardner. All in favor,
say “Aye”. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed? Motion
carried. Representative Moffitt, you are recognized for House Bill 1165.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair. For those of you unfamiliar
with APO, essentially we had oversight responsibilities for the
executive branch agencies as well as the occupational licensing boards,
hence the reason why we’re eliminating a lot of the obsolete boards. In
regards to the reporting requirements, in an effort to continue to
streamline, there was some confusion in regards to whom the occupational
licensing boards should submit their annual report to, and when we asked
for those annual reports to be submitted for review, some were actually
sent to another entity and that entity did not exist, so this is really
kind of clarifying what the reporting requirements are, and there are
some – I guess there’s probably three components here in regards to what
should be contained in the reports. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions,
comments from the committee. Representative Lucas. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moffitt, do you know of any opposition to the abolition
of this? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not aware of any opposition. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow-up. Representative Lucas. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Move for a
favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, you’ve
heard the motion on the floor. Any further discussion or debate? If not,
all in favor say “Aye”. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All
opposed? The motion carried. And last but certainly not least,
Representative Moffitt, you are recognized for House bill 1173. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is again… APO is only moderately
more interesting than General Statutes Commission, and when you’re
looking at how the APA rule-adoption procedure is implemented, there are
certain things that are really unclear, and this particular issue
regarding rules for professional corporations indicated that we needed
to kind of fold into the statutes that govern them the process that they
need to follow. I hope I explained that sufficient. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions, comments from the committee? Representative Moffitt, you’re
recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move for a favorable report
of House Bill 1173. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, you’ve
heard the motion on the floor. Any further discussion or debate? If not,
all in favor say “Aye”. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All
opposed? Motion carried. Members of the committee, I’d like to thank
you. I’d also like to thank the public, and for those of you who have
not seen your email, please extend your sympathy to Representative
Starnes. His father passed away today. This meeting is adjourned.</p>
