<p id="05:00">
It was one that went in with a considerable discussion and the House had
agreed , orr certainly the House Republic Caucus had agreed that the
advertising would not move from 1 to 2% without provisions of the ?? Act
and during those negotiations. Of course the Senate attacked this very
publicly, very vociferously for some time. And the House in the
compromising to working toward a compromise on the budget, relented on
this, on this provision. Now in those discussions, the House discussed
with this our Senate colleagues ways in which there could be some
modifications to the ?? Act that we thought might delay some concerns.
Those discussions were not fruitful for the purposes of keeping that in
there. So we were willing to give I guess  what I'm trying to say. But
to offer this up with no provisions of the ?? Act seems to be very
counter to a position that this House and certainly the budget
negotiators have taken and I would have a grave concerns about this
provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stamp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment there on that provision that's being
passed out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized to explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This amendment deletes Section 26. Just to give you a  ?? technical
changes. Of course this isn't technical at all. But what is so amusing
to me is it's in Revenue Laws. When this thing passed ya'll.  Anybody
who was here that day remembers we took second and third vote at the
same time. When the constitution says Revenue Laws have to be on two
different days and entered in the Journal. But the Court of Appeals said
that the lottery wasn't even a revenue bill. And then the Supreme Court
tied 3 to 3 so that's  not a precedent.But the whole ??, the whole
foundation of the lottery is that it's not a revenue bill which course
we know is ridiculous. The effect of this language and I would almost
sort of like it to go a floor vote because I would get a total of 25
minutes where I could take all of their ads and show you each of their
lying and deceptive ads and in which way they're deceptive and wrong.
And this House on a vote of about 100 to 8, voted to be honest about it.
About 100 to 8. But what this bill would do would be to have twice as
many lying and deceptive ads. So I and plus I got a transcript that I
sent to many of you of the Senate Hearing on this, in which they just
trashed this whole idea of raising the advertising limit as part of the
budget negotiations. Now how much that was genuine and how much of it
was hypocritical who knows? But I certainly think it would be completely
wrong to include this in a Revenue Laws Technical Change Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. First of all I would like to say that this amendment would
have no effect on the current budget. The budget is being negotiated as
we speak. And hopefully that some of us will see it in writing later
today or tomorrow. But this provision has absolutely nothing to do with
the budget that is moving forward today or this week. Second to
that,the, I believe the conversation with the Senate, the disagreement
was that there was lottery proceeds that was going to be used for a
particular purpose. If my recall is right. It was the teacher's
assistants. They were opposed to that. As probably they should be. We
have passed the North Carolina Education Lottery. If you want to repeal
the lottery. Then somebody needs to run a bill and repeal it. And take
it away. We. It's here. The 2% in advertising is</p>

Going to only allow the lottery commission to generate some additional
dollars. And I will tell you that on the fund the finance side. And
everybody that's on finance this year, everybody that's gonna intend to
come back and sit on finance next year, we're gonna need additional
dollars. There's no question about that. So I think we're putting our
head in the sand. There are some people here that don't like the
lottery. They didn't like it when it was first passed. They continue to
talk, do certain things to, I would just encourage those, those persons
to follow bill and repeal the education lottery. And see if you can, can
just take it away if you don't like it. I will say those same people and
I'm trying to be as respectful as possible certainly have their handout
for opportunity scholarships and they are certainly taking money from
every pot to enhance those opportunity scholarships. Folks you just
can't have it both ways. And again, I'm gonna say this has absolutely
nothing with the budget negotiations that are ongoing. There's no impact
on the current budget as we will see it in the next few hours to vote on
it up or down. That has nothing to do with it. But on, simply being on
the note of caution, I, I again will tell you as Pryor Gibson would say
you're gonna need every tool in every toolbox to sustain what you are
getting ready to vote for this year. So I would just ask you to think
about that and remind you again, we already have the North Carolina
education lottery, which we are currently using for scholarships and for
programs that we need. You're gonna need a whole lot more next year to
sustain the budget that you're getting ready to pass. Thank you mister
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair. Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much mister Chair. This is the second time in just a few
days that my colleague from Wake, the Speaker Pro Tem, and I have agreed
wholeheartedly on something so, something, it's that end of session
weirdness.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it's special.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And chairman Howard is now, chairman Howard has now invoked the Pryor
Gibson which, which adds to the weirdness. But, but I, I would say that
I would agree with Chairman Howard that without a doubt, that if you do
want to get rid of the lottery that you do need to introduce a bill to
do it and have a vote on that, but that's not what this amendment is
about. You can agree that we need to have a lottery but still need, but
still think that we need to run it in a proper way and in a certain
fashion, and in my mind the gentleman from Wake's amendment does exactly
that so I'll certainly be supporting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question. It relates to the amendment and the bill. What are
the considerations that go into preparing these type bills that seem to
be more and more prevalent of catch all provisions stuck in, in a bill,
how are they prepared? What are the parameters or requirements? How are
the decisions made to put something in versus not put something in?
Because I just have a lot of concern with them, I'm thinking we need,
going forward, to start putting a name with provisions of these types
so, so we know where everything's coming from, because we've had a long
process, long general assembly, two years session, this is the short
session, and I just like some information going forward as to how, how,
how do we arrive at these bills? What goes in, what goes out?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well that sounds like that's gonna have to be something for a future
assembly to decide on the rule, and you know as I well, as well as I
know there's nothing new under the sun here. But would staff like to
answer that question how this bill is composed? I wouldn't think so, but
thank you for your comments. Representative Dollar. Representative
Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman.</p>

<p id="15:00">
I would, of course, support the Stam amendment, and just to clarify,
because I may not have been clear earlier with how I see the interplay
with the budget, is obviously the provision as indicated, as I
understand it, wouldn’t necessarily, I don’t know whether it would
necessarily impact this, the availability later on, some time this year,
let’s assume that it wouldn’t, as has been stated. My discussions were
really more in terms of the issue itself. I mean, because obviously we
have gone through this issue. The decision of the House was that if we
were going to move forward with increasing doubling the lottery, and
that’s basically a cap that right now is about 17.5 million, it would
move it up to about $35 million, in the ability to advertise. And that’s
separate from the marketing budget, of course, for the lottery. Without
the honest lottery act, or at least some provisions of that, that was
not necessarily a position that the House was willing to take, and maybe
we will find out. The Senate seemed very clear, in fact I don’t’ know
how much more clear they could be, they were certainly opposed to
including any provisions whatsoever from the honest lottery act. Also,
in the open budget discussions we had, we had several of the full Chairs
of the Senate that expressed opposition to whether there was honest
lottery act in there or not to the increase. I have real concerns with
moving it up to 2% without any of those protections being put in there.
And I would, just to clarify, not that I don’t think it’s substantive to
the amendment, but to clarify, when we had the provision in previously
in the House budget, it was, the money’s just going in to the same line
items that it had gone into in the past. The classroom teacher line
item. Now, the TA’s are now separate line item within the budget within
the compromise, but obviously that’s with no additional lottery money,
per se. Obviously not from this provision. But again, I would request
committee members to vote for the Stam amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well I was here when we voted on the lottery,
and I voted no. But the lottery is here and it’s a fact of life. And
even though I was opposed to it and didn’t like it, the sky didn’t fall
down. And so, the lottery is here, and if it came up for a vote today, I
would not vote to repeal it, because it does generate a certain amount
of revenue, and we benefit from the revenue. And we all know that we’re
going to need additional revenue next year. And in the year after. And
as long as the State’s in business, we’re always going to need money.
But I’ll tell you, I think there, we need to be wise in the way we raise
the money. If you, what, I don’t like the lottery advertising. I don’t
like to see ads on the television. I don’t like the billboards, but it’s
a fact of life. If you’ve got a product, then you have to advertise it
to sell it. But if you, when you travel to other states, and you check
into the motel room, and you got the television on, and almost
immediately you see lottery advertisements. You know, in these other
states, they don’t have the restrictions on advertising that we have.
And their airwaves are bombarded with these lottery ads. And I don’t
like it, and I don’t want North Carolina to look like these other
states. So Representative Howard, we need the money, but we can find it
another way and I’ll be supporting the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Robert Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Either staff or the sponsor of the proposed
committee substitute, maybe Representative Dollard answered my question
a while ago, but is the 8% pot and the 2% pot two different pots, or is
the 2% inside of the 8%?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Everett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr, Chairman, if it’s Ok, Timothy from fiscal will be able to address
that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Chair, to answer your question the 8% is the total cap, and
that 2%, and that 1% is currently within that 8%</p>

<p id="20:00">
So, right now there’s roughly 4.5% of that 8% cap contained both
administrative and advertising. So, if it went from 1% advertising to 2%
advertising and administrative expenses stayed the same, you would
expect to see around 5.5% of that 8% cap taken. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Just a comment on the . . . I
appreciate that, it makes me feel a little better about the provision
but, it still works out the same, that if we increase this 2%, we are
taken 1% of that lottery money away from education and that does affect
future budgets and what this state does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Jonathan Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. I have a question for staff. At the beginning of the summary
the last sentence there says, of the 4 changes only one section 24 is
[substantive]. For my edification going forward, can you define, when
you say [substantives]? What does that mean to you? Because, on I rely
on your opinions on things. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. If you’ll notice
that summary was to an earlier version of a committee substitute and
that’s why on our verbal explanation we wanted to point out that there
was an additional section added, which was your lottery advertising that
had been put in. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So to
confirm, Section 26 would be considered a substitute. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  You know how definitions change all the time
around here. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Comment on the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Of course. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I went along with the 2% lottery
increase because we had the honest lottery protections and we needed for
it the budget, but we decided later on not to do that. I got one Senator
Apodaca’s little scratch-off tickets in the big budget hearing, even
though I didn’t win, I appreciate him giving me that and showing me what
the opinion of the Senate is on using those funds. So, I don’t want to
mess up this whole bill by putting in something that I’m pretty sure
[inaudible] So, I would be for the amendment, that we would not muddy
the waters. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And good luck with that. Representative
Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I’m speaking against
the amendment. I think too frequently we let issues go by that deserve
debate. I think the fact that we are getting ourselves into a financial
situation, and we’re going to be looking for revenue and revenue streams
next year. I think whether or not the 2% provision would pass or not
from this committee is irrelevant to the fact that we are obligated or
should feel obligated to explore any possible revenue stream. Too
frequently, we’re laying things on the table, we’re avoiding a robust
discussion, I think that we should vote the amendment now and then we
could discuss the duplicity that we have as a body on the virtues of a
lottery. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Myers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate all the
discussion by majority party today about adding tools to the tool kit
and exploring every revenue option available. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, we
all do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I look forward to those discussions next year.
I do have a question. Probably for Representative Howard. Although,
anyone could answer this. If this is not going to going to impact the
current budget, why do we need to consider it today? Why not wait until
next year? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Myer, I think that it is in our best interest to prepare
for what is coming in the future, and you can’t wait, or we shouldn’t
wait till we’re in a total crisis of need, and then we do certain
things. If we wait, it’s no skin off my nose whatever happens to with
this amendment. I think it’s in the best interest of everybody who is
sitting on the Finance Committee today, but more so, for those members
in this room who are in this today, who are on appropriations. The
Finance Committee is charged with raising revenue and providing the
resources for the Appropriations Committee to spend and as we prepare to
leave session this year and come back, regardless, this is not a
partisan decision by any means, the House will develop the budget next
year and you’re going to be looking at</p>

Change speaker: speaks briefly, you recognize the look at section twenty
seven. this provision is not repealed would go into effect. hopefully
next week, not in some future year you would have. this saw that glass

then preserve the status quo sure I'm left to reveal the lottery. I
don't have the boat, for I have it attempted to do that. but this up.
this maintains the status quo. it's the underlying bill that turns our
lottery into a big carnival atmosphere to other one other break point.
this is not an alternative to attacks. the lottery is a tax if the tax
at about twenty seven percent of the ticket. the only difference is that
the taxes embedded in the price of the ticket and that's what it isso if
you want to say what other people say, well, that's a voluntary guy
would think about it all taxes. if you think about are voluntary, but
this is a tax on a particular set of people. it's at the facts. what a

I appreciate that. My name's Brianna Hager and I'm with the North
Carolina Education Lottery. I am brand new, so I'm probably not the best
person to talk to about this, but I can answer some questions if you
guys have them for me.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. Miss Hager, is it. Does the lottery have any sense of whether
additional advertising would simply increase consumption from current
users of the lottery, or would it create new users of the lottery, or a
combination of both?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I don't think we have those numbers of that research done, but we can
get those numbers for you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Do you have, or does the lottery have any sense of how much potential
lottery gross sales would increase by doubling the advertising budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
We do have those numbers, but also and personally, I don't have them,
but I can get them for you, Mr. Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Dale can answer some of those questions. Mr. Dale.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Brawley, Timothy Dale, fiscal research. I'm going to
speak just to a memo that Dr. Boardman had prepared, I think about a
month ago or so. But, basically, in his analysis, if you take it from 1%
to 2%, your looking at roughly a $56 1/2 Million minimum on an
annualized basis. In terms of a net revenue the state would receive.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Any further questions, Representative Brawley? Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes. To speak on the amendment again and to counter Representative
Hall's point. We have money that we spend on appropriations in small
amounts everywhere. In fact, yesterday I believe it was, we revealed
that the historic tax preservation credit was about $12 Million a year,
maybe as much at 20. That's something that this one extra percent would
take care of two times over.  We spend our money in small increments, we
save it, and we draw it, we pull it in in small increments. I think it
all adds up, I think its an important piece and I think its an important
point that we need to discuss. Whether we agree on it ultimately or not.
But, again, I asked urge everyone to vote against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Alexander.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to point out that it appears that
there is a great consensus on the fact that we are going to be in the
hole by the beginning of the next-- By any, a considerable hole. I would
suggest that revenue laws in the interim might seriously want to look at
the revenue potential for such things as--
[Laughs]
One of my favorite proposals, which is about $100 Million in tax
revenue. Then, theres some opportunities with taxation as Representative
Howard mentioned, concerning video poker. I think the time has come for
us to seriously start looking at alternatives. Though this is a somewhat
humorous point, its a serious point. We are building a budget, that I'm
sure in the next few days that we're going to end up adopting, that
guarantees a train wreck next year.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
There always is.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Revenue is going to fold and demand is going to go up. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Every budget I've seen since I've been here has been a train wreck. But,
thats a different story. Representative Robert Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Listening to this train wreck discussion, I've
heard a lot of talk putting down incentives for business, where you get
a 10%, 14%, 20% return. You invest $10 Million, you're create income of
$200 Million, $300 Million from the business transactions that take
place as a result of that. We've just had a discussion fighting those
incentives for business, yet here we're willing to spend $18 Million
dollars on this increasing advertising for an expect $56 Million return.
We're expecting a 3% to 1% return, I mean a 3 to 1 return on something
that, unless I'm mistaken, we also know the lottery is more participated
in by people who really can't</p>

Can’t afford it. So we’re taking money out of people who can’t afford
it, for a 3 to 1 return, and we turn down businesses who pay their own
plus at 10 and 14%, 10 and 14 times return. We need to support this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam. Further questions.  Representative Dollar
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me make sure something is cleared up here
or at least let me give you my view of it.  As the Speaker mentioned in
press conference I believe yesterday or after that press conference, the
state of North Carolina following enactment of the budget compromise
will have in its  possession at least a billion dollars in reserve
whether you’re talking about rainy day fund, whether you’re talking
about risk reserves, other reserves,  that the state has available to it
and that we have been working on building back over the last several
years.  I would also anticipate that employment, as everyone realizes,
unemployment has been going down.  In fact unemployment’s been dropping
in this state, faster than other states,  most other states. North
Carolina has been bouncing back rather well.  We have implemented a
regulatory reform of a variety of areas, we’re implemented tax reform
which the leaders of the finance committee have put together, that’s way
above my head. And we are seeing benefits already that leadership of the
finance committee and others in our economy and I would anticipate that
we will although years are always tight, needs are always out there,
that we will be fine in our budget that we’ll begin the process for the
following biennium.  So this $55.6 million I guess that is the estimate
without the honest lottery act, is not I believe is critical at this
pointin time to enact.

with this in treat income producing properties and non income producing

constitute a reduction in the credit amount for income producing
properties, we'd be looking at credit of fifteen percent on the first

million dollars with investment that's compared against a forty percent

were reducing the credit amount by a certain amount for income producing
properties there is a bump of 5 percent on that credit for tier 1 and 2
counties and a bump of 5 percent for projects that would currently fall
under article 3h the mill credit in addition for non income producing
properties the credit amount is being reduced to 20 percent for
properties that are worth less than the median home price under the
current program there's no provision about how valuable the home is so
this is for homes that are less than the median home value in North
Carolina you get a credit of 20 percent for homes that are between the
median home value of 100 percent and 150 percent of the median home
value its a credit of 15 percent so its slightly less for homes that are
a bit more valuable and if a home is worth more then a 150 percent of
the median state wide value of a home this credit would not be eligible.
 In addition for non income producing properties this limits the types
of expenses that the credit can be taken against under the current
program theirs no limitations placed on the type of expenses and this
specifies that basically only fundamental investment expenses so
structure exterior hvac plumbing electrical things like that those are
the only types of expenses that would qualify where as currently
anything that's you know either cosmetic would qualify so my
understanding is that part of the intent of this was when you got a
million dollar home that puts in a you know $250,000 kitchen with
granite counter-tops that would not qualify under this amendment

Representative Luebke
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
mr chairman thank you two things the first I really think this is a good
amendment and because its been a great help to Durham has been and
continues to be helpful I first raised my hand simply Mr Chairman
because I think there is just a technical problem in lines 3 through 5
because it includes the words advertising expenses and thats not there
any longer and I know staff will clean that up but just wanted to draw
that to your attention
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Stam
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
this is a very weak statement I'm sort of in favor but I'm going to vote
against it
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
of course appreciate
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I dont know the parentage of this but we did study this quite a bit in
the economic development boards sub committee on community services dah
dah dah and I came to the conclusion that this is one of the least
harmful credits that there is so I'm not going to vote for it but I will
say that it is not disruptive of the economy like so many of them are
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you for your indifference we appreciate that Representative Moore
Representative Starns Rodney Moore excuse me Representative Rodney Moore
pardon me
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you mr chair just wanted to advocate my support for this amendment
but also I want to magnify the comments by my colleague from Willmington
were picking winners and losers here and we really need to be cognizant
of the film industry because you already have 4200 existing jobs in the
state that are here and you have so many ancillary jobs that are tied to
this industry so I would ask that you be fair across the board and look
back at state but I will support this amendment just wanted to get that
out there thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you sir. Representative Starnes
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you mr chairman well you know we are presented with a wide range

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
they always are

and I love history I love the old buildings and I think that this is
historic tax credits have benefited the state but your in the finance
committee were dr jeckle and mr hyde. Dr Jeckle just a few minutes ago
said we dont want to raise anymore revenue but now Mr Hyde say but we
want to keep spending the money and the east and west are not going to
meet so you while I love the program and think it has benefited we cant
afford it I mean if were not going to raise the revenue then we cant
continue to spend the money so for that reason I'll vote against the
amendment

<p id="60:00">
up to be and Representative Starnes I think this speaks to the concern
that your or that the issue problem that you raise and that is what is
the overall impact of the state making this investment of expending this
money as it shows in return back to the state in terms of economic
activity and ultimately revenues to the state as well from tax payers
and from all the economic activity that you generate I'm certainly not
an expert in this area by any stretch of the imagination but from
everything that I understand the return on investment has been extremely
strong for the historic rehabilitation tax credit both with regard to
the construction aspect of it as well as the long term longer term
benefit of increasing property values and economic activity as a result
of whats going on after the rehabilitation is done and so my suspect is
that its very much in that game the other sort of question not directly
a question but an observation for Representative Hamilton is that as she
continues to bring up the film facts credit which I we appreciate I hope
that means that if there is something in the budget that deals with them
that Representative Hamilton is going to show that same level of
enthusiasm for the budget compromise
[SPEAKER CHANGES].

[SPEAKER CHANGES].

Representative Lewis just some very quick question is this the credit
that the preservation of North Carolina folks have been hoping to
accomplish in this session have they seen this bill?

[SPEAKER CHANGES].

just dont want to mis-speak on this direct
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Patrick
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I wont speak for the for cultural resources directly but I will say the
language of this is more or less identical to what came over in the
Governor's special provisions so this is more or less what the
administration came over with
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I think what were witnessing here is a couple of good things were
finally making some compromises for whats good for the economy of this
state and were actually having a dialogue were having a little too much
fun with it perhaps but I think that this is I would not be doing my job
for the 1200 citizens in my district who are employed by the film
industry if I didn't say that the budget provision is not a compromise
its an end to the program and I'm willing to support the extensions of
these tax credits and others that come for the good of the state and I'm
going to ask you again to support the extension of the film incentives
for the 4200 families that work in the industry in the state so I urge
your adoption of this amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you Representative Warren
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you Mr chair you know for every action there is an equal and
opposite reaction and if we don't support this credit and what it
accomplishes I think we have to look at what the result of that is and I
want to echo what Representative Dollar was saying there is a return on
investment here you rehabilitate a historic building you got property
tax there you got jobs that are being supported if not created in the
renovation of the project I think its a short sighted move to try to
save you know to be penny wise and dollar foolish I don't see it as
being anything different than a local Jdig grant its an investment and I
support it and I hope you'll will vote for it
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you representative Tim Moore
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you Mr chairman part of this and I support this fully
Representative Dollar Representative Lewis and others have fairly
summarized the reasons this is a good thing but you know this whole
notion of trying to go in and do this with historic properties actually
got started during the Reagan administration under Jack Kemp when he was
secretary of HUD with the enterprise zones finding distressed areas and
finding a way to make to bring those back to life that started</p>

The inner cities. And what it spread to, fortunately, is throughout the
state. Those of us who represent particularly rural North Carolina have
seen the old textile mills that for years employed hundreds and
thousands of people. Representative Setzer, you've seen plenty of them
in Catawba County, the furniture factories. Those, those places sitting
empty. The problems that happen when you have empty buildings. And this
has been a great thing. For those of you that haven't seen it, the old
Loray Mill in Gastonia, in the West side of Gastonia, recently
participated in this. It's been covered in the Charlotte Observer, the
??, a lot of media, and the success that's being brought about. I know
we should always be very cautious about tax credits and so forth, but
folks the fact is, these things work. They're providing jobs and they're
taking some of our blighted areas and making them productive again. I
hope you'll support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I got my question answered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Well, I do think that the historic rehabilitation
tax credits go to very worthy causes, but I just want to remind you of
the euphoria we had last session when we passed comprehensive tax
reform. And we said we're gonna fundamentally change the way we do taxes
in North Carolina, and we started moving away from tax credits and
that's reason, this was one of them that went. All the tax credits were
set to sunset, because we said well, we want to lower income tax rates,
we want to lower corporate income tax rates and we'll go more towards a
sales tax based economy, but it takes money to do that. And so what
we're seeing now is the death of tax reform. It was a fight to keep the
little county fairs from having to pay the sales tax. I don't, I don't
know if it was worth the fight or not, because that was pennies compared
to this and so, really, tax reform is gonna be dead because it's started
to unravel and we can't stop it.
