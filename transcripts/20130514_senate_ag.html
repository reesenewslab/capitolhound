before you start, Jeff, needs to say something.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Just to expedite the movement of bills today,
we've put together bill packets that are being passed out now, it has
all the PCSs and summaries that you'll hear today. They're in order that
they appear on the calendar, so PCS for 515 is on the top of what you're
seeing. The code on these is different from the code on PCSs you
received last night, they've gone through proofreading overnight, the
only changes that would have been made are technical changes that were
caught in proofreading. Otherwise the substance of the PCSs are the
same.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Gunn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a question, may I ask a question at this time to staff
concerning the announcement that was just made?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is this information available electronically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It was emailed to you last night.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The PCSs were sent out last night. Some of the summaries that were
prepared last night were sent out, some of the summaries were just done
this morning, they have not been sent out to you yet. All this will be
on the dashboard before it gets to the floor. So some of it yes, some of
it no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Gunn, you're up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, members of the committee, and I would like to thank
Sen. Wade for being here also.
There's one thing that I can say unequivocally to start this meeting,
and that there is not one single person that I believe that is happy
with the quality of the water in Jordan Lake. We understand the economic
engine that Jordan Lake serves, we understand the hundreds of thousands
of people that are affected by Jordan Lake every day, we understand that
it is a viable engine for growth, a water supply, for recreation, for
wildlife conservation. But here's where the problems lies, folks.
A little history, and putting it in a little bit of historic context:
Back when this lake was built, and back in the 70s when it was being
compounded, the feds knew, and they didn't make any single bunch about
it that this would be an impaired water source. Here's what our bill is
going to do: As you notice on the front page, it talks about a little
bit of history and it states without any exception that we knew what we
were getting and the feds knew what they were providing when we did this
lake. What this bill also is gonna do is it's gonna clearly state that
the legislative intent, that the current water quality strategies are
not working, and it will set forth a new strategy to improve the water
quality of the lake by developing new rules. What this bill will also do
is it will immediately repeal the related session laws and direct repeal
of rules by October 13,  and this allows enforcement of rules prior to
repeal. This bill will also create a LRC study commission made up of 5
from the Senate, 5 from the House, and they will immediately begin to
research the issue during the interim. Including reiteration of
authority to higher technical consultants, and they will provide
legislative proposals to the 2014 General Assembly.
I cannot emphasize to you enough, cannot emphasize to you enough that we
have had tireless discussions with DNR and they have been very
cooperative. And the bottom line is this folks, it has always been
impaired, it's impaired now, and every single source of reasonable data
will tell you that this lake, biding by the Jordan Lake rules that are
now in place, will stay impaired forever, regardless of the amount of
money that is put in mitigation efforts upstream. Hundreds of thousands
of dollars have been put to mitigation upstream, in many different
areas. This has become a tremendous burden on the municipalities</p>

<p id="05:00">
Tremendous burden on developers, on tax payers, and we have got nothing
to show for it, folks. Now I’ve got studies from DENR going back eight
years. I’ve got them with us. You may not have it in your handout but
bottom line is in eight years, up through 2012, there has been no marked
improvement in the Jordan Lake and in some cases there’s been some
degradation of some of the nutrient levels. Development has been stopped
in the Jordan Lake basin, among many municipalities. The tax burden
continues to increase. Now here’s the positive. And here’s what I like
about what we’re going to do. Technology today did not exist like it
does now. Technology has improved and DENR has acknowledged that in our
conversations with them. These new technologies required us to take a
new regulatory approach to the Jordan Lake. There is simply no sense in
us continuing upstream to do mitigation efforts that are not showing any
market improvement of our lake. Simple phrase, let’s quite throwing good
money after bad. I will be glad to answer any questions that you may
have. We want the purpose of this, the purpose of this bill is to have a
chance to improve the water quality of the lake. We are convinced beyond
a shadow of a doubt that mitigation efforts upstream are going to have
no impact on the quality of the Jordan Lake and we need to concentrate
our efforts in the lake or at the lake, and we’re going to work
tirelessly in the next year to come back and at the beginning of session
in 14, with a full report and recommendations. We will work with DENR.
We will work with stakeholders. We will work through our legislative
body. We will work with corps and we will work with EPA. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to move for a
favorable report, as soon as we can? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hold up for a
second. Senator Kinnaird. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Well,
this is my district. This is my lake. It touches both of my counties.
And I would like sort of a period of comment and a series of questions,
if I may. There were years of negotiation and public comment that got us
to the point where we are now. And I realize the cities are very
unhappy. Guilford and Greensboro got out last year. Durham, and I
realize that people don’t want to put the money in. You know, it’s sort
of a love nurture, what happens upstream and what you put in the water
ends up downstream. But it just bothers me that those years of
negotiation and public comment are just going to be turned over. I don’t
see that, there’s new science or new elected officials, but I don’t see
that. So I have a couple of questions. First of all, and you’re saying
there’s new technology. I’d like to know what that is. But I’d like to
know what the EPA is going to say about this because they’re very much
involved. And what is going to be the costs? What is the new technology
and what is the cost going to be? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s exactly why
we’re going to have the study committee, by the way. To come back with a
plan and that plan not only will have a cost figure for mitigation,
hopefully at the lake or in the lake. But it also will have, part of the
recommendation will be how the basin – this is a basin issue by the way.
I want to be clear, this is not to involve folks outside the basin – how
the basin is going to pay for this. It needs to be a contributory
agreement, among all the basin stakeholders. What is our feeling from
the standpoint of the federal government, the corps, and EPA. If you’ll
notice in your bill, it specifically talks about how we will immediate
engage the EPA and the corps to help us mitigate a situation that to
date is causing a terrible water condition in the Jordan Lake. As far as
technology</p>

<p id="10:00">
Representative: go to Senator Keneer. I do not want to…I think there are
some folks here that can talk a little bit more about hat. The bottom
line is if you are satisfied with the water, these are working. If you
would like for us to start afresh, take a new approach, find out how all
of us can benefit with a cleaner lake with a new method of mitigation is
what this is about; otherwise, you have got what you going to get.
Representative: One last if I may, and then I will be done. When really
have we done anything? We have put the rules in place but… Greens
County, Gilford County got out of it last year. We have not done much of
anything yet, so how can we say it is working?
Representative: There actually has been a lot done and a lot to be done.
The point here is that what we have had done, a lot of that in point
source, where it is just discharged, over this time period, we have seen
no relevance. We have also had studies done, some independent, some
through the division of water quality. To be honest with you, in a
meeting in Burlington, NC, when the question was asked, this is going to
cure the problems that the Jordan Lake, and they stood there in public
saying they could not make any guarantee with no significant increase in
the quality in this timeframe. I think it is safe to say that we really
need to revamp our thoughts and improve the lake quality, and, I think
this study will do it.
Speaker: Senator Raven?
Representative: Thank you. I just want to make sure that I have the
concepts under. What we are going to do is keep doing what we are doing,
so there is really no change for the near term, while we study the
problem and try to fix it for the long term: does that capitalize it?
Representative: Not exactly, but it is close. We actually stayed a lot
of the rules a couple of years ago, so you should not see any material
changes in this next year, but we are repealing the rules that are
currently in place and immediately proceeding into next year with new
rules based on better scientific evidence, better due diligence, better
technology and probably in a different location than upstream which, for
reasons we believe, will not be able to improve the water quality.
Speaker: Senator Bryant?
Representative: I have a question about the time table about the repeal,
and all this process. From what I can see, it appears that there could
be at least 6 months to a year where there could be no rules, is that
correct? The appeals and the study, and then the time it takes to
reinstitute new rules, that could be a year or two. Could you respond?
Representative: I think the best answer I could give to that is to not
mistake what we are doing now for the fact that we still have to abide
by federal rules. A lot of that has to do with the biggest thing and I
believe that source point. So, federal rules remain in place. This is
just working with our state rules, which, if you can remember, a couple
of years ago, we set those back. So, I do not think you will see a
material change in a year.
Representative: Follow up? Will we have to get any federal approvals
once you repeal all these rules and statutes?
Representative: We are going to take the legislative action to repeal
the rules now. We will obviously be in contact with the federal agencies
to let them now what we are doing. We will have that documented along
with them at that time. We are going to repeal the rules and here is the
bottom line: we need to stop what we are doing, regroup, and formulate a
new plan that is going to increase the water quality of Jordan Lake.
Representative: One more follow up Mr. Chair? Do you have an estimate of
the costs to the state of this process of repealing and reenacting these
rules. I do not know if there is any risk of any fines or penalties, or
anything, but is there some cost? Your history lays out a long term
process involving multiple groups and entities, and approvals in getting
where we were. So is there a cost, or do we need a fiscal on any of
this?</p>

<p id="15:00">
I think it’s a double answer there. We’ve got, I don’t think that
relates to what we have in place. Anytime you’re doing a study and you
got some folks that are going to have some input, I guess there will be
some….that item will be addressed at some point in time. The bigger cost
is not doing something. Right now, Kerry is in the process of looking at
a $2 million aerification system at their intake and they are the least
effective intake on the lake. The cost is going to continue to rise if
we don’t do something.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, I’ll be brief. A couple things, are we talking
about high algae content in the lake and there has been no movement in
that in eight years to speak of?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ll there’s actually been no movement since the formation because it
was a record from the time that the core went on record that it would
have high nutrients, it would have high algae content and it’s been
there since the formation of the lake and remains there today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One other follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a drinking water lake. Of course it’s been around since I drove
down 64 going to state back in the 70s when it was being built. How many
 municipalities dump treated waste-water into the lake?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, that may be a staff comment. I cannot give you an answer
on that. That’s a good question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jeff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have folks from the department here who can probably answer it more
specifically, but the basin basically starts with Guilford County, runs
down through Alamance, parts of Orange, Durham, much of Chatham and a
little part of Wake. Most municipalities that have wastewater systems,
Burlington, Greensboro, I believe they discharge into the upper part of
the basin which eventually flows into the lake.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clodfelter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Gunn, looking at your proposed study, a
lot of the topics that you’ve got here are fairly technical or involve
expert knowledge. I’m curious about the decision to have the study be
done entirely by legislators rather than groups such as the EMC that has
backup of that kind of technical expertise. Why do the study with a
group of legislators rather than the ENC for example.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clodfelter, I thank you for the question. I think that the
commission is going to be made up of legislators, but it also, I think I
made reference, that we plan on drawing on all technical and
stakeholders, even some from the public sector, some from the private
sector to come up with a plan and a study to make sure that we’re
getting the best information, but I think the makeup is simply for the
commission, but the commission’s role will be to do a complete study and
use folks, whether it be  public or from the private that can give us
valuable information as we try to modify these rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, Senator Cook moved to accept the proposed
Committee Substitute. Also, I guess that was for the bill itself. I
don’t have anybody from an audience listed to speak on this bill
so...nobody signed up. I’m sorry, Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just...this is a very simple question. Has anybody ever monitored the
effectiveness of the rules that are in place now as to reduction of
content. Is there any study that anybody has done as to whether or not
this is reduced content? That’s my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Hartsell. I have a...going to the…bear with me a
second, I’m trying to get to the right page. I’ve got a study that goes
back that DENR did from 2004 through 2012. That study was to look at the
percentage amount of phosphorus, nitrogen, and chlorophyll in the lake.
As this graph would indicate to you, nothing on this chart was...</p>

Tell you that between 2000, for the last eight years, 2005, 2012 or 4 to
12, that there has been any, any improvement in the lake and in some
situations it’s gone downhill a little bit. So we basically have had no
improvement in this whole time and the studies have been consistently
year to year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes follow up.  And the intakes and discharges from
the watershed have they changed at all, during the period of adoption of
these rules?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I don’t think so.  I don’t think so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Just to follow up; Senator
Gunn’s staff shared with me that there are multiple multiple
municipalities in this clean water lake, that we use for drinking water,
dumping treated waste water into the lake. Multiple ones. I don’t know
to add
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  You talking about directly
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Directly, directly into Jordan Lake.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Members of the Committee, the motion before you set
forth by Senator Cook is unfavorable to the original, favorable to the??
All those in favor will say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed No.  The Ayes have it. Thank you.
Next on the agenda is Senate Bill 112. Senator Jackson. This is a
proposed committee substitute. Senator Jackson moves for adoption for
discussion purposes. All those in favor will say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Opposed no. Senator Jackson the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
This is a rather lengthy bill, but I’ll try to run through it very
quickly and will be happy to answer any questions at the end.  A lot of
this is from the recommendation of the VRC committee that met in the
interim, and Part One is basically just a technical change. What it
amounts to is adding the words “and operate” to the general statute to
conform to Senate bill 810 that was ratified in June of last year.  Part
Two clarifies the process for appeals from civil penalties assessed by a
local government that has established and administers a state approved
erosion and sedimentation control program, purely technical and an ERC
recommendation. Part Three amends the notice procedure to repairing
property owners that adjoin property subject to an application for a
dredge and field permit. This is a ?? request and part of their efforts
to fast track certain permits.  Part Four amends various statutes
governing wildlife to conform to federal law.  This is another technical
change sent over by them, and this makes technical corrections that more
accurately reflect protected and endangered species safeguards.  Part
Five(a) amends the statute regulating ownership or use of venomous
reptiles to correctly refer to them in the term as antivenin not
antivenom. So, that is certainly purely technical. I didn’t know what
antivenin was until this came out. Part 5(b) amends the statute
governing investigation of suspected violations, seizures, and
dispossessions of reptiles to direct law enforcement personnel to
consult with representatives of the North Carolina Museum of Natural
Science or the North Carolina Zoological Park to identify appropriately
and safe measures to seize a reptile. ?? has asked that we put this in
to protect the law enforcement officers who are being called out in this
??  some of these snakes that are invading our state, and other reptiles
as well.  Part 6 amends administrative procedure act to provide the
Wildlife Resource Commission with temporary rule making authority for
manner of take.  Currently the Wildlife Resource Commission can change
the seasons, but the courts have found that WRC cannot change the manner
of take. For example, the WRC can lengthen deer season, if there is a
high population of does, but they cannot execute taking bucks during the
extended season.  Part 7 amends the definition of the term “build upon
area” as it pertains to storm water management.  In 2006 session law
currently includes partially impervious surfaces and definition of
“build upon areas”.  New language removes conflicting language and
clarifies that gravel and other pervious material as well as partially
impervious material, paving material that absorbs water or allows water
infiltration is not included in “build upon area”. This new language
creates an incentive for developers to use impervious or partially
pervious paving materials instead of impervious pavement, which I think
should be environmental friendly. Part 8 provides that underground
storage tanks and systems installed after January</p>

...the 1st, 1991, and prior to April 1st, 2001, are not required to
comply with  well setback requirements or provide secondary containment
until January the 1st, 2020. This is another date of request because the
underground storage tanks and systems installed after April the 1st,
2011 already had a requirement for the secondary setbacks.
Part 9 amends the rules in the North Carolina administrative code that
pertain to open burning for land clearing or right away maintenance.
We've been working with ?? to help them change the rules in accordance
with Secretary ??'s goal of lessening the permit process when
applicable, and this will do so.
Section 10 exempts ponds that are constructed and used for agricultural
purposes from our ?? buffer rules. This section provides that the ??
buffer rules must apply if the use of the property adjacent to the pond
changes such that it no longer is used for agriculture. And it
grandfathers in ponds used for agriculture that were either in existence
on or constructed after July the 22nd, 1997.
We've worked with Farm Bureau to provide relief to farmers who are
building ponds for irrigation and find themselves losing land around the
ponds because the distance of the ?? buffers. This will not affect any
?? Buffer that is currently in statute, and we'll repeat that. This will
not affect any ?? buffer that is currently in statute. It just keeps
farm ponds from having to live out the last standard.
Part 11 amends the rule also in the administrative code to provide
reduced flow alternatives to the daily flow rates for design for waste
water systems. And this section would exempt proposed waste water
systems from complying with the daily flow rate for design. There are
numerous options that an engineer can employ to design a low flow
system, including waterless urinals and low flow faucets. My Sampson
County accent's getting me, y'all, hang on. This sanction allows
technology and design flexibility to allow more development on existing
lots, which is great especially in rural areas. This provision rewards
conservation efforts through low flow design and should allow for more
development for technology is available to overcome changes of ?? and
waste water systems policies in our state.
Part 11 further provides that proposed waste water systems with a daily
flow for a design of less than 3,000 gallons per day, are not required
to obtain state level review for the system. This language was added for
clarification because 3,000 gallon restriction is when a permit is
kicked up to the state level from the County.
Part 12 amends the continuing education requirements for certified well
contractors to provide that a well contractor must obtain six hours of
continuing education within a three year period rather than obtaining
six continuing education units within a one year period, as is currently
required by rule. This tries to help them out by not changing the
continuing education credits, but allows them to accumulate them in
three years instead of the current one year when they all have to go in
and pay. This is done in many other instances with licenses, such as
pesticide license and others as done over a three year period.
Part 13 directs the Department of Transportation to adopt rules for
selective pruning within highway rights of ways for vegetation that
obstructs a motorist's view of properties on which agri-tourism
activities occur. Some of our wineries and flower farms live and die on
people seeing their operation from the road and stopping. Overgrown
vegetation can cause serious economic harm to these small business
owners, and I believe it is not dependent on the state of our business
for survival. Or it is dependent, I am a believer that it is dependent
on our survival for these small groups. I will see the Department of
Transportation adopt rules that allow these individuals the opportunity
to prune that vegetation around their signs or entrances and not wait
for DOT to arrive.
Part 14 prohibits public entities from purchasing or acquiring an
ownership interest in rural property with known contamination without
approval of the Governor and the consulate state. This section applies
to a purchase or acquisition of interest in rural property occurring on
or after July the 1st, 2013. This state has a problem with public
entities buying contaminated sites with the knowledge that the state
will clean up the mess. This language will sort of correct that, moving
forward.
Part 15 prohibits a local government from impeding the storage,
retention or use of non hazardous recycled materials including asphalt
pavement, ?? or roofing shingles in properly zoned storage facilities
through regulation of the height for recycled material stock piles.

pavements are very significant and measures should be taken to maximize

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, the bill is before you.  Questions?  Senator
Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, I'm looking for a little bit of clarity, sir, please,
on section two starting about line 49 as it relates to the collection of
civil penalties that would be remitted to the civil penalty and
forfeiture fund rather than going back to the local government's general
fund as non-tax revenue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  This was a recommendation from the ERC committee and I'll ask
staff to help me out there on this one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jennifer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford, that is actually a constitutional requirement that fines
and forfeitures go to that fund, so this is a correction needed to this
statute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bingham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was just going to move for a favorable
report with your permission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold that for a second.  Any other questions for the committee? Senator
Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry I had to leave, Mr. Chair.  I'm back to ask Senator Jackson a
question about the procedure for adopting a temporary rule by the
wildlife commission.  They can just adopt most anything they need in
this.  Where's there accountability or control or regulation or whatever
there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, I have that same concern.  I sort of don't like giving
free reign on rule-making, doesn't matter which agency done being
directed to the wildlife resource commission; but, I have spoken with
Gordon Myers, and Gordon has told me of the issues.  And Gordon, would
you like to address this question.  I think he can give you a very good
explanation, or he did for me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gordon?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Senator, the wildlife commission has the
explicit authority to adopt temporary rules for certain conditions for
setting seasons and bag limits, for establishing no wake zones, and also
for gameland regulations.  And the way we implement those rules is we do
it concurrently with permanent rules subsequent to holding public
hearings and in that way we can implement season changes that we believe
are necessary biologically to move forward with or to satisfy conditions
on landscape that we need to address.  But we do go through the public
hearing process with full public involvement prior to initiating
temporary rule-making.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Also, Senator Tucker, I'd like to add that they already have

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Of the original bill 689 that was before you,

of trap known as a Conner bear trap or a body-gripping trap off of dry
land and required it to be totally set in the water.  [AUDIO ENDS]</p>

from protect of those animals there that are not targeted to be trapped
from protecting given some protection of the biggest problem that is
that bodyguards all their lives or sale of buckets and when they have in
the wallet and they say about it the first thing you think about the
food and so the first thing that is to convince of this bucket and the
money it takes care of all of that goal is so those are born to be
prohibited to be used on the next thing that we're looking at is some ,
chaps that the government can only sell dry land by 77 conditions one is
that they are inside a specially designed on the enclosure of this

the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate. This bill has
4 parts. 1st part amends the marine fisheries law, 2nd part amends
terminal growing construction law, third part camera permitting and
forth part clarifying actions dealing with municipalities in cities on
the coast. A group of us got together, a bipartisan group from both
houses and looked at different things on the coast that we would like to
address during this session and we came up with this bill. There are
some other things that we wanted to look into, but this one pretty much
summed up what we thought were the most important. Part one amends the
marine fisheries law, which simply states in every county there will be
fishing licenses for sale. Some counties don't necessarily warrant that,
and so this allows the commission to have them if they seek necessary
but not demand that they're there. Section two amends the terminal
growing law and it makes the following changes to the law we passed in
2011. Provides an environmental impact  statement for the growing
pursuant the federal law is sufficient to satisfy the terminal growing
law.  It repeals the following: long term maintenance and monitoring of
the growing- implementation of litigation measures, restoration of
public/private trust of the growing's adverse impact on property. This
is addressed further in the bill. It provides that requirement of an
inlet management must be reasonable and may not require to address
speculative matters or impose requirements whose cost outweigh the
benefit. It repeals the requirement that an ?????? for terminal growing
demonstrates the structures and infrastructure are imminently threatened
by erosion and non structural approaches to the erosion control. It
provides the coastal resources commission to consider the benefits of a
terminal growing when determining whether terminal growing will result
in adverse impacts to private property. It repeals the requirement that
inlet management plan be adequate for purposes of monitoring and
litigating the impact. It repeals the limitation that no more than four
terminal growing may be permitted, i think they are underway currently
the total. It repeals the prohibition use of certain type of local
government financing in terminal growings. And repeals the direction of
the department of environment and natural resources to adopt rules to
implement terminal growing law. Part three amends the camera permitting
law and it basically requires that any person developing property in an
area of environmental concern to obtain a permit, a camera permit.
Section four would limit the areas of environmental concern to those
designated at the time of the permit, in other words- we don't change
the rules as you go along.When you apply for your permit the rules are
in effect at that time are the rules that you will live by until your
permit is receded. The final part- part four clarifies that cities may
enforce ordinances within the state public trust areas which allows
cities to remove certain structures that can be hazardous and to enforce
their rules</p>

?? The mean high-water mark of the beaches, and what have you. And the
final thing is the effective date the provisions of government issuance
of ?? counter permits will become effective when this act becomes law.
And the provisions governing the abilities of the cities to enforce
ordinances will become effective July 1, 2013. The remainder of just one
week past. Now I'll answer any questions on the parts of the committee
if the committee has questions if that's okay with you Mister Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Questions? Senator Bryant?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just curious as to this terminal groin, all
these terminal groin changes? So this means now there's no, I need an
understanding, I'm assuming there's no limit to the number of terminal
groins that can, is this on the coast? Is that unlimited now?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Raven. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, senator. There is a
limit because there are only 14 inlets. And so if every ?? in the state
decided they would like a terminal groin, which is a structure on one
side of an inlet. Then there would be none but 14. Which is, in other
words, everyone who has an inlet, or that is affected by an inlet, could
in theory anyway have a groin if the so wish. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay,
follow up. This question is for the sponsor and/or the staff. So now,
with all the repeals it's hard for me to wrap my head around what is now
required for the other 11 inlets I guess. To get terminal groins, what
would they have to do? And who can do it? Will somebody refresh my
recollection on that and walk us through who can initiate or have a
terminal groin, and then what do they have to do to have it? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Would you like me to answer that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Please, if
you would like to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Bryant, the
municipality or the counties in which these inlets exist would be those
that would be applying and they would apply through the department for
those groins.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Following what requirements would they
now have to meet? Since so many of the requirements have been repealed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll let staff cover that. The requirements still
there are quite stringent. We've changed some of the rules as far as
the, how they can be paid for. We've added things that put a little more
teeth in it as to who will remove these if they're not functioning
properly. Or if damaging is, if damage is approved. Just how we go about
that. The staff would chime in on that. Mr. Hudson? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mister Chairman. Senator the current requirements are set out
beginning near the top of page 3 of the ?? committee substitute. In
sub-section E there. And you can see from the red line, the deletions,
the strike-throughs, and the underlining, these are things that are
either being taken out or added. So, E is basically what the applicant
and as Senator Raven mentioned, this is typically going to be the local
governments in the area of the inlet. This is the information they have
to supply in their application. The first thing there that is being
changed right now under current law, the applicant has to demonstrate
that infrastructure would be immanently threatened by erosion and other
approaches, other non-structural erosion control approaches are
impracticable. That requirement is being removed so that they just have
to demonstrate that structures are threatened by erosion. The
sub-division 2 there is being changed. There's an environmental impact
statement requirement under another statute that could be triggered by
another terminal groin application. This basically says that if you have
to do an environmental impact statement under federal law, that will
suffice for the environmental impact statement here. Down in
sub-division 5, this is the inlet management plan as one of the
requirements for the applicant. They have to have a plan for managing
the inlets. Construction, monitoring, and maintenance, throughout its
life. And this basically says that the mitigation measures have to be
reasonable and don't have to address speculative matters. Subdivision 6
is again another requirement, a proof of financial assurance. Right now,
the financial assurance has to provide for the long term maintenance and
?? measures as provided in the inlet management plan. Modification or
removal of the groin as provided</p>

…to B2 on line 18 of page two and on page three around line 22 it simply
said,  “That a community college board of trustees is prohibited from
adopting a policy that is more restrictive.” It’s been corrected to say
“more restrictive than state law.”  Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Members of the committee, the bill essentially is what the
title is. Basically what we’ve got is a situation around the state where
a number of localities and other institutions are trying to take this
legal product and say you can’t consume it outdoors. I just personally
find that objectionable.
I think if you’re walking down the sidewalk you ought to be able to
consume a tobacco product. I think if you’re in a park, outdoors, I
think you ought to be able to consume a tobacco product if that’s what
you choose to do. I certainly think if you’re on a windy beach in
southeastern North Carolina you ought to be able to consume a tobacco
product.
Now I can understand municipalities wanting to have a high fine for
littering, I think that’s reasonable. But I just find it ridiculous that
we can’t be outdoors and have somewhere for people who choose to smoke
to smoke.
And so I’ll be happy to answer any questions. One other point if I
could. I think it’s important for the consuming public to have some
sense of uniformity. You know if you come from out of town and you go
out to the beach and you’re a smoker you might not realize that some
city has it illegal and they’re going to turn you into a criminal
because you smoke outside on a breezy beach. I just think it’s
ridiculous. I think we ought to have some uniformity and I hope you’ll
support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill and maybe to ask a question. One of my main
concerns when I think about this in outside sources is now a lot of our
towns, I know in my area, have outdoor family events. We have an outdoor
film series, outdoor music entertainment, a lot of families come,
children, babies.
And I’m concerned that even if you’re outside with 500, 1,000 people
outside and people smoking anywhere throughout that area, and it appears
to me from this they can’t designate a smoking area or anything, they
can’t make any restrictions, so it’s going to really be inhibiting and
dangerous for our families and children.
It is uncontroverted that second-hand smoke exposure to anyone, but
particularly to children stunts their educational processes. We have so
many children now with asthma and other kinds of conditions that you
can’t even bring your family to an outdoor event that’s sponsored by the
city or town and feel safe for your children. That’s just a major
concern.
I know our community colleges in my area have contacted me. They’re
concerned about the success they’ve had with the no-smoking policies
they’ve implemented with the support of their local boards, the
protection it provides for students, employees, et cetera, on the
campus. Plenty of other opportunities for people to smoke before they
get there and when they leave with no complaints.
I just have concern. But I’d ask the sponsor has he had any thought
about or input on the impact of this in these public spaces outdoors
particularly where children and families would be involved? Is he open
to any compromises in that regard? That kind of thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Bryant, I may be wrong and if I am
wrong I hope staff will correct me, I don’t believe that the state law,
and that’s what this bill does is make it all uniform, I don’t believe
the state law would prevent there being set aside a designated smoking
area.
I might be wrong about that but I don’t believe the state law requires
that. If it does, I’ll say this. If you’re talking about an outdoor
public event, like an outdoor band or something like that, a concert
series in a Downtown Live kind of thing, I personally think we have to
smell diesel exhaust and I think people can move their children to
another spot if this is really a problem.
I get it when you’re in a sports stadium and you’ve paid $200 or
something to see the Panthers play and the guy next to you has got a big
fat cigar or keeps smoking cigarettes. I kind of get that. But if you’re
at a free public event where you’re free to move around…</p>

…that, I just think we ought to draw the line somewhere.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bingham
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Senator Newton and I actually
introduced something prior to your bill and Senator Jackson’s aware of
this  at ?? community colleges. I had a change of heart on that and the
reason being the community colleges, I got a lot of push back on this
issue because of the board, the students. They’ve taken a lot of time
and effort in making a decision on whether to make this a smoke-free
campus and in fact they did and Davidson… and it’s worked very well.
Also even went to the trouble of talking to some students that smoked
and they didn’t find it as a great inconvenience. That would be the
reason for me to…your other arguments are very strong but I do certainly
couldn’t agree with you on the community college campus aspect of this.
I just wanted you to know that upfront. So anyway, thank you. Thank you
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I share many of the concerns expressed by
Senator Ford and Senator ??. I’m getting a lot of push back. I think the
best thing to do would be to move toward some sort of accommodation for
designated areas in some of the places, like the schools.  I don’t like
to home in on just the schools. The beaches same thing. It’s not so much
a case anymore of everybody knowing the health risk and choosing to die,
it’s that the self-discipline to police yourself. Nobody knows how it
feels to strip a cigarette anymore. It’s an old army term where you had
to rip them down, ball them up and throw them away so there was no
litter. I think there’s room in here to negotiate a little bit and get
into a place where you don’t have just open carte blanche because it’s
almost an unaffordable thing in some places to keep cleaning up after
people who won’t clean up after themselves anyhow. I think we have to
consider that part of it and I would work with you on trying to figure
out some words for it. I have no problem with prohibitions or letting
people do what they want. It’s simply a case of what’s practical and
what opens the door to things that are way out of bounds for what we
want to happen any place that we go, crunching through cigarettes or
Canadian geese or whatever. Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill will have a serial referral to state and
local government so it’s not the only stop before we get to the floor.
So we can take another look at it when you’re looking at the types of
things that you’re working on. Senator Newton, I have just one question.
If these people do declare to go smoke-free, is there any way that we
can remove any type of excise tax for tobacco taxes that go to those
areas that want to be smoke-free? Or you want to work on that amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I certainly would be interested in working on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not sure yet how that can be done but I think that
would be reasonable. That could be a good logic instead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We’re going to vote on this bill today but we’ll have
to come back and take up the rest of the bill some other time. They’ve
got to use this room and our staff. They’ve got somewhere else to go to
so they’re tired of us already but Senator Jackson moves for a favorable
report on senate bill 703. All those in favor will say aye. Opposed no.
The ayes have it. We’re adjourned.</p>
