the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let&#39;s pray please. Lord, thank you for another day where we can come
and bow our heads and even our hearts. Thank you for the grace that
flows down on this day when men will run down the court at the ACC
tournament, when farmers will plant in the fields, where kids where go
to school, and they&#39;ll even come here to bless us. We ask for your
protection in your flourishing in all these aspects of our society. We
look to you for strength. We look to you for guidance. Lord of host, you
are the Lord. You uphold our right hand. You say to us, right now,
whether we&#39;re dealing with money issues or whether we&#39;re running
a nonprofit, whether we&#39;re feeling injustice, where whether
we&#39;re feeling the tight grip of a poor marriage. Lord, you say to
us, do not fear. I will help you. It&#39;s in Jesus&#39;s name that we
pray. Amen.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Bingham is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President.  Ladies and gentlemen of the
Senate, I was contacted by a parent of a sexual assault victim, this
victim was assaulted as a minor and the parent was not advised at the
time of the trial that should could get a permanent No-contact Order for
her child.  Of course, years later this became a problem, now that
she&#39;s 21, she has to look over her shoulder and be concerned about
protecting herself from this person, unfortunately it&#39;s her father.
Without a No-contact Order, that&#39;s exactly what has happened.
With this Senate Bill 60, which was discussed at length in J-2 and
passed unanimously, this permanent No-contact Oder will resolve this
problem, and I would encourage you to support this bill.  Thank you
ladies and gentlemen, I&#39;ll be happy to try to answer any questions.

  has framed the amendment. Mr. President, if you don&#39;t mind, I think
she wouldn&#39;t either explain this amendment so we could move on. This
is--improve this bill. Thank you, Mr. President.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Barringer, for what purpose do you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
To send forward an amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
You can send forward your amendment. The clerk will read.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Barringer moves to amend the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Senator Barringer is recognized to speak to the amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you so much. As a bit of background, this particular bill, what it
does, is it requires that if there is a document that purports to be a
birth record, that the Register of Deeds would actually put on the face
of that document, &quot;this document is not an official birth
record.&quot; In my amendment, at the request of the Register of Deeds
Association, and it is a friendly amendment and I agree with it, concur
with it too, that the section would be amended to say &quot;this section
does not apply to a document or instrument which is attached to real
estate documents as an exhibit.&quot; Oftentimes there are birth
certificates that are attached behind, and it would be onerous for those
Register of Deeds to actually go through the document looking for such a
document. I urge your support of this amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Is there any discussion or debate on Amendment 1? Senator Bingham, your
microphone&#39;s still on, just FYI. If there&#39;s no discussion or
debate, the question before the Senate is the passage of Amendment 1.
All in favor vote aye. Opposed vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for
the voting. The clerk will record the vote. Forty-seven having voted in
the affirmative and zero in the negative, Amendment 1 is adopted. The
bill, as amended, is back before the body. Senator Bingham, would you
like to speak to the bill?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. President, certainly. The local Register of Deeds in my
county had someone come to him with an unofficial birth certificate from
some country that I couldn&#39;t pronounce--I think it had thirty-some
letters in it and other things. And so he began to have some concerns
about the legitimacy of it, as I would. So he brought this to my
attention and I talked with ??, et cetera, and so once this birth
certificate--he had to register this--but once it&#39;s registered,
other governmental agencies rely on it as an official document. So this
bill--what this will do, it will have in bold letters, and I think
you&#39;ve probably got a copy of this, it says &quot;this document is
not an official birth record.&quot; So it will notify other agencies of
the danger of what could happen. So there&#39;s been other folks who
have contacted me have run into the same problem, and so I would urge
your support. And we&#39;ve got some further work that we&#39;re
intending on doing, research to try to even strengthen this more than we
presently have it. So I would encourage you to join me in supporting
this bill. Thank you, Mr. President. I&#39;d be happy to try to answer
any questions.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you. Is there any discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the passage of Senate Bill 82 as amended on its

Forty-seven having voted in the affirmative and zero in the negative,

happy to send it to Ways and Means. I guess not. Thank you, Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further business to come before the
Senate. If not, the chair recognizes Senator Berger for a motion.
