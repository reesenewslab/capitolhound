Could Senator Allran come help Senator Berger with his iPad? Oh, we’ve
got it. Thank you Mr. President. [PAUSE] Thank you Mr. President. House
Joint Resolution 1006, appoints two individuals to the public utilities
and energy, well the utilities commission. It is current House member
who are trying to get past is Jerry Dockam and Mr. James Patterson I
believe from the Guilford County area have been nominated by the
Governor for this position. We met the individuals in the Rules
Committee earlier and reviewed their resumes and both of them, well Mr.
Patterson seems overly qualified and will remain to be seen on Mr.
Dockam. He’s a good man, he’s been a great member of the House. So I
recommend both of these individuals to you and ask for your positive
vote. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or
debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the adoption of
House Joint Resolution 1006 on its second reading. All in favor will
vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the

Resolution 1006 passes its second reading. Without objection it will be

Joint Resolution 1006 on its third reading. All in favor will say aye.
Opposed no. The ayes have it. House Joint Resolution 1006 is adopted and
it will be enrolled. At this time the Chair would like to extend
courtesies of the gallery to Jerry Dockam and James Patterson who are in
the gallery. Please stand and be recognized. Thank you for being here
today and congratulations. [APPLAUSE] House Bill 336, the clerk will
read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 336, continuing budgeting authority.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members. This is the continuing resolution.
It allows our government to keep operating through July 31. Until we’re
able to get a budget passed and finalized. It authorizes spending at a
95% level. It’s a fairly standard continuing resolution. The one
exception to that would be that there is a further Medicaid fix in the
bill, that increases the cap on the fix that we passed in House Bill 980
from 450 million to 496. I’m happy to answer any questions. I’d ask for
your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or debate?
Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. President. Would the gentleman yield to a question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The schools have to go ahead and set their budgets and
I think they’ve got to give a starting amount of notice, maybe 90 days,
for the people who will be terminated and so forth, and I know our
budget, I don’t know about he other budgets, propose terminating 4800
teachers and teaching positions and 4500 teachers’ aides positions.
What’s this going to do to all that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, first of
all I don’t think either budget eliminates 4100 teaching positions. I
think you’re probably referring to the flex cut elimination, how that’s
being handled. The answer is that we’re, that no notices are being
given. If there are unfilled positions, I believe under this bill those
positions remain unfilled. But this just allows us to keep operating.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, for what
purpose do you rise, Senator Tillman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman has the floor to speak to the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senators, all we need to do is look back to year
after year after year, when you were in charge of the budget, we did CR
after CR after CR. And you know they all operated on the past year’s
budget. They’re going to get 95% of continuing budget, and continuing
resolutions are not new. We didn’t do one, we didn’t have to do one the
last time. And we may still be able to get out of here without this, but
it’s not ideal for any</p>

<p id="20:00">
That starts their budget July 1 not to have an official, fully funded
budget. But we don't have. But for anyone to be questioning why we can't
start and for anyone to keep using that erroneous statement of four
thousand five hundred teachers and four thousand teacher assistants is
totally wrong. You're taking a flex cut that those positions have long
been gone, flex cuts started by you all, not. And we are removing the
flex cuts and just showing where the cuts have already taken place.
Those people are not working. They have not been working. We are not
eliminating any classroom teachers. And I know it sounds good to put
that out and make some people believe it but I will give you a ten day
report when we come back and let you see the numbers of how many
teachers we have and how many classrooms we have. And that's the only
way I know to do it, is to show you the actual membership figures.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
To see if Senator Tillman will yield for a question.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Yes, I will.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
I understand there is a debate on the teacher positions. The teachers
were let go over the last year or two years and now you're making it
clear, those positions are eliminated. Whether they are filled or not,
those positions won't be there because we are taking it out. But I
thought that your budget did eliminate four thousand eight hundred
teacher assistants in second and third grade. So, am I mistaken about
that?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
First of all, this budget is being debated right now and I don't know
how many will be left out. In our budget, we did not fund the second and
third grade teacher assistants and there are a few thousand of those
positions that are not funded in the Senate version of the budget. But
you have said, and Senator Nesbitt just got through saying, and you said
more than once on this very floor
that we eliminated over four thousand teachers. Teachers will not be
eliminated in this budget. State dollars for teachers will be virtually
the same as they've been.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
I appreciate your clarification that those teacher assistant positions
which are currently filled will be eliminated. Thank you Senator
Tillman.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you, Mister President. To speak on the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Senator Nesbitt, you have the floor.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister President and members of the Senate. It probably isn't
going to do any good to talk about this much longer. But the record is
what it is and history is what it is. And when we were doing negative
reserves down here, there were provisions in there saying but don't fire
teachers. Remember those? It won't be teachers. They can get them
somewhere else. Well, they didn't have
anyplace else to get them. Now what they did was not use state money to
fund them but they used stimulus money that they had left over. They
used some local money. They used reserve accounts and everything else to
try to keep these people hired. Now when they find out that this money
is permanently gone, they are going to have to eliminate some people.
It's going to come down to that, in my opinion.
Whatever it is, in your budget we just eliminated four thousand one
hundred teaching positions. And that's all I'm trying to point out. The
question wasn't questioning a continuing resolution. I was just asking
what I can tell the folks back home when they ask me. Because that's
what happens every year. You all know it too. They'll start calling us
tomorrow saying if this goes into effect, what can I count on? And
that's not your fault. You're having to do what you got to do. I just
needed an answer for them and I think I got a good answer. The answer is
that don't fill any unfilled positions and don't give any pink slips. I
think that's the answer. That's a good one.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Mister President. Senator Nesbitt, if you can put that to me as a
question I can clarify for you.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Yes sir
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Mister President
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Senator Nesbitt, the way it works is that if the item is agreed to in
both budgets, if there is a position elimination somewhere in the budget
then notice is authorized to be given. The two items that you've
mentioned continue to be in dispute in the two budgets. So, there really
won't be any action on them based upon the continuing resolution.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you sir
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
And I do want to point out, now is as good a time as any. I've offered
you an amendment before and I'll just say it now. July 1, seventy
thousand people that are unemployed and have been for probably up to a
year are going to lose their unemployment. And they're not being take
care of with a continuing resolution. They're going to fall off a cliff.</p>

<p id="25:00">
I offered an Amendment that showed how we can take care of those people
to give certainty to the business community that they wont go into
penalty in 2016. We are the only state in the nation that is not taking
those extended benefits we're the only state in the nation that said no
and I can't remember how much money it is now but it's tens of millions
of and I believe in the neighborhood of 75  or 80 million dollars we're
just saying no to and the highest unemployment and the longest
unemployment is occurring in rural North Carolina where there are no
jobs for these people and they desperately need this money in the
economy I guarantee you give unemployment benefits to some whose been
unemployed that long it'll get spent and they'll buy something from a
local merchant and it'll help the economy in these areas hardest hit I
happen to have an area up there I don't know we beat them up pretty bad
over the last year but they just keep right on humming and were doing
fine on jobs up there in my district it's not about me but in a lot of
your districts people are hurting and they need some help we can  help
them and we can do it with money we've sent to Washington that we aren't
going to get back and we;re just choosing not to and I hope you all will
reconsider that I think we probably got to do something before July the
1st or we pass a point of not return there but I would say that to you
and we understand the reason for the continuing resolution to keep what
we can running. So I'll be voting for it because it's necessary at this
point in time but these reservations
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
during further discussion of the debate Senator McKissick what ?? your
Aye's
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
yes sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
in reviewing the continuing resolution what we have here is language
that specifically targets an increase in community college tuition now I
can understand why we want to continue things at 95% level but why are
we targeting our community colleges at this time to go ahead and pass on
an increase in tuition when we dont know the other ramifications of the
budget
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick the way we approach the resolution is that items that
were not in dispute between the two bills would go ahead and get
enacted. This item was not in dispute between the house and senate
version of the budget
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator do you yield for a follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
how much percentage wise will these increases amount to just in terms of
what additional burdens our students will be forced to bear cause I mean
its good to be able to go back and share with them. I know been getting
letters and inquiries from community college presidents within my
district and there are two of them so I'm trying to see what it is
percentage wise that's actually in the final numbers that we're looking
at
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, Mr President, Senator my recollection is this is 250 per credit
hour, $2.50 per credit hour its a fairly small increase
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr President
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho what purpose your rise
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
to speak on the Amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho you have the floor to speak to the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amend the bill excuse me you know Senator there's been talks about this
July 1st event but let's bring a little bit more knowledge into the
situation.  We made a tough decision to preserve the solvency of the UI
fund since it was 2.5 billion dollars in debt basically bankrupt with no
future because there are some limitations now as to the amount of money
you can actually get from the Federal Government as far as continuing
those benefits but we made that decision and in advance and we let
everybody know where we were going as of July 1st but Senator Nesbitt I
want you to pay close attention because the reality is there are eight
other states since the sequestration bill passed that have been required
to cut five percent off of their UI benefits. Rather than cutting five
percent what they basically did is they went in there and they just
sliced off the last group of folks that were at then end of their
eligibility. So in reality what happened was they made a lot of the same
cuts we did except we did it in advance and gave people plenty of notice
also we were</p>

are you concerned about the fact that fund is now on its way to
solvency. so at some point when it needs to bring to let me the next
needs of the unemployed workers. then all of a sudden we'll have that
one in place. secondly, as as as what was happening, North Carolina.
we've been required by the Department of Labour to cut seventy six
million more dollars because of the fact that we planned ahead and make
the tough decisions to put solvency of the system. we ended up by not
having that additional problem so that we give the people of the state
's got been taking care of it on plenty of notice and an opportunity to
put solvency back in the system. make sure that easier for future
unemployed workers, and that's what we hear to do is
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
the design program draws its original.your true question original deal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
yes, when I thought having a rate of eight. eight percent, fifth highest
in the nation and some of them are struggling to ensure they provide a
chair placed Beelzebub,or procure the present monolithic this bill. I
see nothing in here dealing with unemployment fund anything else. I
think we need to stay on top all the way around and move for us sinners.
we will keep your conversations in your focus on the bill at hand and
not unemployment is not part of that capability in place to predecessor

Mr. present thank you members for wellness to bring this resolution not
just passed the House just a few minutes ago and came over all, as did
the family of love over representative Bobby Barbie and they are up in
the gallery and at the rockets understood present. if you would
recognize them, but I have a few words to say. first I guess I'm the
only member in here who served with Bobby. Bobby when he was a member of
the house and I was over there with him for three of those terms. he
served nine terms in the House from nineteen eighty seven through two
thousand and four. now it so happens that a couple of Sundays ago, my
wife and I were driving through Stanly County on our way back home from
having visited visited some friends and we got eleven o'clock hour. we
were looking for a church where we could go in and worship, and we
stopped in Locust, North Carolina. I recognize the name of the town as
me and Barbies Bobby's former home. it has a much better home now. by
the way, but we stopped into worship at the Presbyterian Church in
Locust, North Carolina</p>

[Speaker Changes] And we enjoyed the worship service and after the
service was over we met the pastor and I asked him if he happened to
know of Bobby Barbie, and it just about tore the house down because he
was a very involved member of that church, he and his family, and I
appreciate him so much, all the stories I’ve heard about Bobby, I’ve
heard quite a few when he and I were together in the House. But the
people of Locust really thought a lot of Bobby and his family and they
were quite involved citizens, they still are in that town, and so I
think its only fitting that the Senate join in with the house to pass
this resolution of respect, memory, and sympathy for the family of Bobby
Barbie, and I commend a resolution to him.
[Speaker Changes] Any further discussion? At this time I’d ask the
Sergeant in arms to lock the doors. If we could ask the pages to go to
