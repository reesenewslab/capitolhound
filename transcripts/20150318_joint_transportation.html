  <p id="00:00">
  Good morning ladies and gentlemen. We&#39;re going to operate on House
time today. Thank you all for being here. We&#39;d like to start off by
thanking our Sergeant at Arms for helping us today. That&#39;s Carlton
Adams with the House, Joe Austin, thank you Joe, and Martha Gadston, hey
Martha, good morning. On the Senate side we have Terry Vaughnheart.
Terry, thank you. And Howl Roach. Thanks Howl. Some of the most
important people working with us today are our pages. And from the
Senate we have Anthony Fortae. Anthony, welcome sir. And he&#39;s
sponsored by Senator Rabin. I believe that&#39;s correct. I&#39;m doing
this without my glasses guys so bear with me. And on the House side from
my neck of the woods, the Garden of Eden of North Carolina, Gaston
county Sierra Cox. Sierra welcome. I hope you have a very fun packed
week. Thank you for being here. We have a few presentations we&#39;re
going to go ahead and get started on it. The first one up is North
Carolina Railroad Company. Present Scott Sailor and Scott you have the
podium sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you members
of the committee. Ladies and gentlemen, it&#39;s my pleasure to be here
today to talk to you a little bit about the North Carolina Railroad
Company, give you an update. We are. Is that ok? Is that better? Sorry.
A little bit. Is that better? Ok, thank you Senator. We&#39;re moving
ahead with our strategic plan and it&#39;s showing signs of success and
economic development with our key partners. Business continues to be
very stead on the railroad and even increasing in the last year or two.
We&#39;re going to talk about that in a few minutes. A couple of
projects. Our recently restate mission calls for a renewed emphasis on
economic development and I want to talk about this in just a moment.
This emphasis goes to our capital budgeting, our partnerships, and to
the performance metrics we have for the success of our organization.
These three new vision elements drive our investments, they were
adopted, these principles were adopted by our board about 20 months ago,
enabling freight to create jobs and business, expanding rail to move
more people, and investing in the railroad for the long term health of
the franchise that is now 165 years old. It is North Carolina&#39;s
oldest corporation. We manage this asset and the capital it generates.
It&#39;s a 317 mile line as most of you know, between Charlotte and
Morehead City. About ten percent of the freight network that you see on
this map is the North Carolina Railroad. The health of this network is
so important to the economic development of this state. The North
Carolina Railroad serves as a key backbone, not the only backbone,
because you gave two mainline freight line railroads going North South
through the State. Our line is part of that western mainline, stretching
over to the East to the port and three major military installations and
other significant customers on that network for the rail service. A lot
of the trains you see or read about are passenger trains. So I put this
map in here to also give you that picture as well. Our line, as do some
of the other lines, host these Amtrak  trains under a 50 year old
statute that created Amtrak. These trains are not a revenue service for
us. They are operated by Amtrak under sponsorship by the Federal
Government, from our DOT, who help sponsor those trains. And they
operate as you can see here, not only just over our line but over the
entire network. All passenger trains in North Carolina operate over the
freight network with one small exception, the light rail in Charlotte
operates on its own designated carter but everything else, all the other
passenger trains you see are operating on freight lines. They typically
operate at higher speeds than freight trains so the tracks have to be
maintained

  —a higher level than they might otherwise be.
The corporate history? The railroad company—your railroad company—was
chartered in 1849 with both Providence and state stockholders. It
operated under a longterm lease for 99 years; it expired in 1995. Our
current BLET Agreement with Norfolk Southern runs until 2044. It has a
couple of renewal options that Norfolk Southern&#39;s optioned over that
period. It&#39;s always been operated as a part of that Southern
Railway-Norfolk and Western Network under these longterm agreements.
Through continued cap investment, in coöperation with the state and the
economic development community, we work to use this railroad to attract
business to the state, to foster development for all the citizens of the
state. We try to maximize the value of the asset for that purpose. This
includes protection and management of the irreplaceable 200 foot wide
corridor that we&#39;re responsible for. We have a thirteen member board
of directors. They&#39;re elected to four year staggered terms. As I
mentioned earlier, the agreement with Norfolk Southern runs until 2044.
It generates about twelve- to fourteen-million dollars a year in working
capital. We fund our own expenses in engineering, design, and planning
out of those revenues as well. We don&#39;t receive any state
appropriations.
In 2013, a provision was passed to have us pay dividends to the state.
This gives you a summary of those. We&#39;ve paid over about 23 million
dollars. I signed a check a couple of weeks ago for the
three-point-seven million dollars [$3.7M] that you see, here, for this
year&#39;s dividend. [pause] You&#39;re welcome.
We also have no debt. We haven&#39;t had any debt since the 1800s except
for the note— the demand note that was done for the buyout in 1998.
The assets that are part of the railroad are the corridor, of course. We
have a few stations and buildings along the corridor, some additional
properties for yards and maintenance facilities, other land and property
that&#39;s been acquired, or, in some cases, re-aligned over the years.
The original corridor totals about 7600 acres, or roughly the same
acreage as Research Triangle Park. But ours is 200 feet wide and 317
miles long. So we have 630 miles of neighbors. And protection of that
corridor, as I said earlier, is a key part of what we do. That includes
all the utility agreements, crossing improvements that we work on with
DOT, track expansions, try to keep those trains running, keep them
running a long time.
So managing this combination of these assets, which creates a reliable
non-taxpayer funded revenue stream as well, is what we do, and that— the
goal there— the ultimate goal there is to create jobs. Last year we had
the Research Triangle Institute try and measure the economic value—and I
know you all see lots of these numbers—but just quickly here: It
generates about $800 million dollars of economic benefit to the state
every year, when you total it up. If you didn&#39;t have it, you&#39;d
have $800 million dollars less of economic value for the state.
[edi note: i&#39;m -pretty- sure he said &quot;BLET agreement.&quot; i
looked up all the belownoted stuff that i did not previously know &amp;
the rest of it&#39;s correct— it sounds like he&#39;s saying &quot;NET
agreement&quot; but it doesnt make any sense, while &quot;BLET
agreement&quot; really does. over &amp; out, &amp; look out below.]
--cut here--
This is a new map that we&#39;ve done to try to reflect a little better,
geographically, where the freight business is— and, more importantly,
where the jobs are that are served by the North Carolina railroads. So,
there are about 110 freight customers served directly by this line. This
includes— you can see a little bit down south of New Bern, near Camp
Lejeune, is served on a line that&#39;s actually owned by the federal
government, and the trains carrying equipment come up to our line at
Havelock. Another important dot on the map, if you look to the north, is
PCS Phosphate. PCS Phosphate&#39;s the largest freight customer east of
I-95 on the railroad. They have over twenty miles of track just on their
property. They employee about 1500 people in that region of our state.
It&#39;s very important to the economic health of that region.
A couple more numbers here. As I said, over a hundred North Carolina
employers, customers on the railroad served directly, if you count
containers, over three hundred thousand [300,000] rail cars a year on
the railroad. That includes the mainline, and from a tonnage standpoint
the heaviest part of the railroad is between Greensboro and Charlotte,
because it&#39;s part of the mainline going from Washington to Atlanta.
To a lesser extent, the traffic, which—

  <p id="10:00">
  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Between Raleigh and Greensboro falls off because you
don&#39;t have the overhead traffic, and as you go east of Raleigh,
it&#39;s less than the middle part. So think of it as tapering from a
traffic standpoint to the total traffic standpoint, it goes down a
little bit as you go east. Since 2001 we&#39;ve put $80 million of
capital in the railroad to bring it up to par. That does not include the
investments of our partners. Those partners include Norfolk Southern,
they include North Carolina Department of Transportation, who, who takes
care of administering the federal funds that come to the state through
rail grants. So, a little bit more about what we have in store for the
future. A big one on our list is freight, customer access. The main line
is in pretty good shape, but when you have a capital-intensive
manufacturer come to the state, we need a spur track that might need to
be 200 feet long, it might need to be 2000 feet long. It&#39;s a very
capital-intensive investment, but once you get that customer, oftentimes
they stay a long time because that infrastructure is hard to replicate.
Partnerships with economic development entities to protect rail-served
site, this is very important, because as the state grows, I know you all
see what the population issues are, and the budget issues you face
because of that growth. It creates a lot of pressure on all that land
around the corridor, so there are fewer and fewer sites available for
manufacturing companies who need rail. And thirdly, planning for
infrastructure expansion for the long term on the main corridor.
We&#39;ve had double track, mostly double track on the main line for 70
years. At some point it&#39;ll need to be triple-tracked. That sounds a
little bit easier maybe than it is. Laying another track alongside,
there&#39;s a lot more to it than that because you have bridges,
underpasses, overpasses, signal systems that all have to be integrated
in that. It&#39;s not inexpensive. So it&#39;s a very capital-intensive
business. The track can cost two to three million miles to build if you
already own the right of way. Bridges can cost between five and thirty
million dollars depending of course on the magnitude of the bridges. Got
a give you a picture of some of the partners that are important, the
folks that we work with. Obviously the North Carolina Department of
Commerce and now the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina
are recruiting companies, manufacturing companies, the high value job
that come to the state. About 5% maybe, in a given year, 10% of their
projects are rail projects. But they tend to be the bigger projects. You
?? here, including CSX, CSX is the other Class I carrier, operates on
eight miles of our track between Raleigh and Cary because of a very old
agreement. We also cross CSX in six locations, so we have a relationship
with them as well. Then you see CATS, the Charlotte Area Transit is
going to build three miles of light rail in the corridor. And then of
course Amtrak and some of the other parties that we work with a lot.
Current committed investments, we have about $96 million on the slate
through 2019. As I mentioned a minute ago, we put about $80 million in
in the last 10 to 12 years, partnering with other folks. That&#39;s what
our capital program, our investment program looks like today. This tank
that you see here is in Raleigh heading to Camp Lejeune. That&#39;s the
same track that your Amtrak trains run on, they&#39;re, they&#39;re
sharing track in the same corridor. I&#39;m proud to say that recently,
there was an announcement last week that Sanderson Farms-you all have
heard this, because I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen the announcements, is
expanding into Robeson County. What&#39;s important about that to us is
about seven years ago, they built some railroad infrastructure in
Kinston and that plant is going to serve, that facility is going to
serve the Robeson County operation. So just on our railroad, with this
one customer, you&#39;re talking about 2600 jobs now. We started out
grading that line in Lenoir County about ten years ago, part of that 80
million, a lot of it went into Lenoir County because it was the worst
spot on the railroad where we had some old rail and some old bridges
that need to be replaced. So we&#39;re proud of that investment and
these types of announcements are what we&#39;re looking for. One more
example, this is a project that started last year, Cambro is going to
employ about 100 people in Alamance County. The track that we&#39;re
building there, we&#39;re putting $750,000 in, DOT&#39;s putting in
about 200,000 out of the dividend funds that we pay to them, to drive a
lead track into a 500 acre industrial park that can serve not just
Cambro, but other manufacturers as they look at Alamance County. This
site&#39;s particularly attractive because the railroad as you all know,
runs parallel to I-85

  so that these customers have great transportation resource here, great
strategic location for them, because they have both good highway access
and a pretty good railroad. For 2014, we approved for 2015 about $13
Million new economic development investments, you have a list in your
materials that are also posted online to give you that list of projects
and over what time frame. Time frame was important to us and something
that&#39;s capital intensive because it takes three to five years,
typically, to do a main project if it&#39;s a track project or a bridge
project, spur track you can do in less than that but from design through
construction can take that long. So here&#39;s the target under the
strategic plan, to collaborate with our partners, particularly including
the economic development community statewide, not necessarily on our
railroad. We get called now for help in projects that are off the cart
or that have a lot of value to the state, whether or not it&#39;s
physically on our line. Creating new partnerships with the state,
economic development partnership, Department of Commerce, to create that
brand, that strategic advantage that we want to offer the state, because
we own a railroad company, some states don&#39;t own railroad companies,
in fact most of them don&#39;t. Committing to a new focus on capital
investment in freight, spurring that kind of growth, and then working
with our DOT. I know Paul [??] said, I want to say too, that we in this
state are blessed with a really good safety program at DOT, it is a
national leader in great crossing protection and safety and a lot  of
that is because of Paul. We do a lot of projects with them, whether it
be a crossing improvement or a bridge and that sort of things because of
the emphasis on safety here. So, thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, and I&quot;m available for any questions to the extent you
have time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chairman Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Back on slide eight, you [??] to the state-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, but it goes, I see, is [??] to the freight and rail crossing
safety improvement fund, [??],  that&#39;s good, is that the total use
of that [??] as far as you know or does any of it go to one of your
larger companion assets, I guess you&#39;d call it, the port that you
serve in [??] city, [??] working on port expansions, port dredging and
things like that. Any of that dividend, as far as you know, being used
to enhance the ports?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand, I think most of the projects have been freight access or
safety but I believe there were some grants to the ports but I would
refer you to DOT on that to make sure you get a good answer. I don&#39;t
know the details of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, one follow-up. On slide ten, the term roadways in the corridor,
460.1 acres, is that, you&#39;re not talking about railroad ways
you&#39;re talking about other kinds of highways or secondary roads or
something?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s correct, we have a lot of parallel encroachments where the
roads go up along parallel to the tracks and now the roads were paved
and they&#39;re in the right-of-way, about 460 acres of that
encroachment, if you will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questinos? Representative Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. You know, we&#39;ve gone back to the double track in the
various lowlands and southern lowlands and it&#39;s [??] and straighten
out the curves of the track, and no we&#39;ve talked about three tracks
and I&#39;ve seen plans for four tracks, I don&#39;t know what we&#39;re
going to do, the whole downtown of the little town of China Grove is
within ten feet of the track [??], you just wipe out all of downtown?
That&#39;s just one of many examples, including businesses and homes
that aren&#39;t ten feet from the track. So what are we going to do
going forward?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Representative, I understand. That&#39;s the reason for the
planning. You typically wouldn&#39;t triple track the whole line at the
same time, it may not even be required, but what we try to do is plan
enough in advance so that we can avoid those kinds of disruptions like I
know you&#39;ve had and other counties have had with this project that
came on sort of fast. Good planning is the way I think we can mitigate
that to the best extent we can. There are no current triple track plans.
The busiest tonnage part of the railroads is between Salibury and
Davidson County. It is the heaviest part in the entire Piedmont Division
of Norfolk Southern. South of Salisbury, less so, but still a busy
mainline, in part because it&#39;s a heavy intermodal corridor with the
container operation. But

  understand the question. We have that issue all over the State where the
railroad is through the center of the town and trying manage around that
so we don&#39;t disrupt downtowns. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, follow up. If most of these businesses that are located
that I&#39;m talking about ?? were built in the 1950&#39;s and I&#39;m
hearing that possibly ?? and other maybe some I don&#39;t know, that
folks were actually selling property that didn&#39;t belong to them and
that&#39;s how we ended up with this. Is that true because almost
everyone of them was built in the 1950&#39;s. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes it
is true particularly in Eastern Gilford county, Northern Cabarrus county
and part of ?? counties. There were older surveys which didn&#39;t show
the entire 200 foot right of way. There were surveyor errors, inaccurate
information and we tried to rectify as much of that as we can to share
information with the surveyors to get it right when they can. But there
have been problems about, dimensionally, making sure that the right of
way is correctly shown in surveys, including the tax maps. That&#39;s
been another problem is the tax maps you can&#39;t rely on for title
purposes but a lot of people use those as guidance and in many cases the
tax maps are incorrect. Does that answer your question representative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks Chairman and thank you for coming out this morning and sharing
this information. I&#39;m try to understand a couple of different
slides. Slide seven and slide eight. What I&#39;m trying to determine is
for you and your staff in the way that you manage, is there a formula
that you use to determine, based on the revenues received to the North
Carolina Railroad Company for investments to dividends. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, there&#39;s a formula for the dividends set in the
statutes, it&#39;s not discretionary, it&#39;s 25 percent of what
Norfolk Southern pays in the lease agreement to the North Carolina
Railroad. So it&#39;s 25 percent of that lease which currently is at
about 14 and a half million dollars a year. So it&#39;s 25 percent of
that amount and the residual is what we have available as working
capital. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, follow up. And that is
approximately what on an annualized basis? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It would be
about 3.8 currently and will go up slightly with inflation each year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. ?? The last time this formula was updated
was when? [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a brand new provision. We didn&#39;t
have a dividend provision until 2013. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions? You&#39;re done Scott,
thank you so much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Thank you for your
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Our next presenter and before you get up hang on
one second we&#39;re going to do a little segue. I want to make sure
people understand what the next gentleman is going to present to you.
And let me give you a little background. Had it not been for the efforts
of some people in this room, the Secretary of Transportation, the
Governor of the great state of North Carolina, member of the U. S. House
of Representatives and two U. S. Senators this State&#39;s port at
Morehead City more than likely would have been closed to all inbound and
outbound in three months. Does that mean anything to you all? If not it
should. That means that the revenue generated by all inbound and
outbound shipments coming into the port of Morehead would no longer have
existed. When I say about the efforts of those individuals from writing
letters and knocking on doors and pounding desks and face to face
meetings in D. C. they were able to cobble together out of the Army Corp
of Engineers just enough money to have the dredging issues taken care of
one time. Is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
One time. So we have a problem definitely on our horizon that we&#39;re
going to have to deal with. To share that message with us today Tom
Reeder, Assistant Secretary for Environment, Department of Environment
and Natural Resources and I hope you give him a very strong listen. And
please take the message back to your friends and foes alike to let them
know that we have an issue on our coast with our ports and we need to
address the modernization of our ports. And let me also add while
you&#39;re here, in addition to that at Morehead at Wilmington we have
birth eight, remember that number. Birth eight. That for years

  And it&#39;s been known for years its been slowly, slowly, ever subtly
sinking into the ?? River, making it virtually inaccessible or not
available to either unload or offload container ships. So needless to
say there&#39;s the correct amount of emphasis has not been placed on
revenue generators for this state. Two of those critical revenue
generators are the Port of Wilma and the Port of Morehead City and
it&#39;s high time they be addressed. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good
morning everybody, thanks for inviting me here today. I&#39;m Tom Reeder
the Assistant Secretary of the Environment and I am going to talk about
dredging for abut the next fifteen minutes or so in North Carolina. And
if you are wondering why ?? is involved in dredging it&#39;s because our
division of Water Resources is the primary partner that works with the
Army Corps of Engineers out of Wilmington district to get this dredging
accomplished so that why we&#39;re here talking about this today. So
this is what I am going to talk about. First of all I am going to give
you some brief background about the types of inlets we have here in
North Carolina, the types of channels. I talk a little bit about the
State and Federal funding that we have for dredging operations. I&#39;ll
talk about memorandums of agreement we have with the Army Corps, how you
get those in place and why they&#39;re so important. Then I&#39;ll talk
about some of the other issues and alternatives we&#39;re facing today
in the dredging arena. So why do we need dredging in the first place?
Well this is really simplistic but just a starting point. These inlets
and channels, like the Chair just said, are vital to our economy.
Unfortunately the coast is a very dynamic system and they constantly
fill in with sand, they shoal as they call it, with sand. So only with
this routine maintenance can we keep these channels and inlets and
costal highways open to support North Carolina&#39;s economy. So
there&#39;s two types of Federally authorized inlets in North Carolina
and the word Federally authorized is key because the Feds can&#39;t
spend any money on an inlet or channel unless it&#39;s Federally
authorized. So the only way you get the feds to spend money on dredging
your inlets and channels is to have those inlets and channels be
Federally authorized. Otherwise it&#39;s State money alone. So we have
two types of Federally authorized channels. You&#39;ve got your shallow
draft inlets, which are inlets of fifteen feet or less. Most of the
inlets in North Carolina are shallow draft. And those have historically
been the biggest problem in North Carolina. But you also have deep draft
inlets that are Federally authorized. And we have two of these in North
Carolina. One in Wilmington Harbor and one in Morehead City. Wilmington
Harbor is authorized to 42 feet in depth, Morehead City is authorized to
45 feet in depth and right now it&#39;s around 30 some odd feet. Maybe
30, 31, 32 feet in depth until it gets dredged and that&#39;s why were
having the crisis there right now. Historically this has not been as big
of problem in North Carolina as the shallow draft channels, however the
Morehead City channel has be come a real crisis this year. And I&#39;m
going to talk about that a little more later. This is a map of the
shallow draft inlets, they go all the way from Oregon inlet in the North
down to Lockwood&#39;s Folly in the South. But just to give you an idea,
if you are a charter fisherman or a commercial fisherman, and you depend
upon the New River inlet to get out to the ocean and the Coast Guard
takes the buoys out of that which they do when it shoals too much, then
you have to go to either New Topsail inlet or Bogue inlet to get out to
the ocean to do your business. So you can imagine what a strain that is
for somebody that depends on these inlets when they close up. The extra
fuel cost, the extra time lost, the fact that you might lost some of
your charter fishing business because the inlets closed, these thing
have to remain open. We have so much of our economy that depends on
these shallow draft inlets. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me ask you a question.
Are any of those currently closed? [SPEAKER CHANGES] All of them are
currently open now but we are having a problem with New River inlet, it
does need to be dredged. And they&#39;re open because of our shallow
draft MOA and the dedicated funding source that you all put into place
about a year ago. And I want to talk a little more about that. Yes sir,
representative Tine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oregon inlet, [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You&#39;re saying, [SPEAKER CHANGES] I forgot about Oregon, I&#39;m
sorry. Oregon inlet is closed. Right, yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] How
long has Oregon inlet been closed? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don&#39;t know,
probably, what would you say representative Tine, about a year now?
Maybe nine months. Six months. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, probably for all
intents and purposes at least six months steady. Before that off and on
40 percent of the time the last five years. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Right the
problem with Oregon inlet is it&#39;s such a unique location, it needs
about 340 days of dredging a year to stay full open year round. And
I&#39;ll talk a little more about that. That is a real problem for that
part of the state. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Second question on the fly if you
don&#39;t mind. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don&#39;t mind. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? I appreciate that Mr. Chairmen you started something here from a

  guy who&#39;s inland and who is learning about dredging, I want to make
sure I understand this, this is a natural occurrence?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, these inlets are federally authorized channels, they were there
naturally, basically, to begin with and then in order to maintain those
so we can keep them there open for the boat traffic, they shoal in with
sand, we have to continually dredge those out or they become unusable to
boat traffic
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So this is a natural occurance in our oceans, along our coast, and
because we want to use it for recreation and commerce we&#39;re going to
have to continously dredge in order for it to be used in a recreational
and in a commercial matter? Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct, sir. All channels have to be dredged no matter where
you are. If you&#39;re up in Norfolk, if you&#39;re in Savannagh,
Georgia, Charleston, all ports have to have dredging to remain open.
That&#39;s why the feds have traditionally provided so much money to
keep these channels open beause you just have to do it, there&#39;s no
other way around it. Just like you have to maintain highways, you have
to re-asphalt highways and things like that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s not exactly right, today in time, yes, we have three issues
with dredging and I always appreciate my friend from Mecklenburg, his
constant concern for my district. There&#39;s three issues that we have,
short term and long term. Short term is caused by the fact that we
haven&#39;t been able to replace Bonner Bridge. The span is currently in
the wrong place because it was built in the sixties and that&#39;s where
the channel was. The new bridge actually spans deep water than you can
get boats in and out without any problem. But since we&#39;re about 20
years behind on Bonner Bridge because of the lawsuit from the Southern
Environmental Law Center, we can&#39;t actually access that deep water
portion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You seem like I brought the lawsuit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, no, I love you, that&#39;s why I&#39;m looking right at you. So,
that&#39;s the short term, the mid term, even when  we get it moved over
we&#39;re going to have some time that we are going to have to do some
maintenance dredging, just like you would do any other, not the 340 days
a year as time changes. The long term, then we need to do some sort of
stabilization as we have in many other ports that allow us to protect
that movement. Just for your reference, because you made it seem like
there wasn&#39;t much commerce going on there, we&#39;re looking at
about a $550 Million economic impact and 450 jobs today, which
that&#39;s only open at 40%. If we&#39;re able to open it much longer,
then of course that impact goes up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s called maximizing one&#39;s assets, Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, may I?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, maybe, perhaps Senator Tine should be giving the presentation
since he has so much information. So I want to thank him personally for
giving me that lesson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He&#39;s our [??] of the coastal area. Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
While we&#39;re on this issue, I&#39;d like to point out that this
naturally occurring phrase, if you&#39;ll confirm this, is not 100%
true. Isn&#39;t some of this a result of the dredging of the
intercoastal waterway by the federal government back in the day?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly the intercoastal waterway fills in the landward portion of
these inlets, yes sir, there&#39;s not doubt about that. So when the
feds dredge the intercoastal waterway, we have to go in a clean up what
they put into the inlet channels that connect to that intercoastal
waterway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As one who&#39;s relative goes up and down the waterway frequently,
Lockwood Folly, that is the biggest problem in Lockwood Folly is the
landward side.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, definitely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Along that coastal waterway you can hardly get down past that inlet on
the waterway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When the feds dredge the intercoastal waterway, Lockwood Folly, the
landward side of that, it can go down to two, maybe even one feet in
depth, so you have to go in and clean that out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The map showing Lockwood Folly is only, you said federally-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
These are the federally authorized shallow-draft inlets in North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There&#39;s only one in my district and we have the Shallotte River and
a couple of others that are used heavily by particular recreational and
commercial fishermen, so they&#39;re not federally authorized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, they are. This map isn&#39;t meant to be all inclusive, I should
mention that. We have a lot of other channels in North Carolina,
particularly in the southern part of the state that are also federally
authorized, including the Shallotte River. So they&#39;re able to access
the shallow-draft MOA and the state dredging fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, didn&#39;t mean to interrupt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No problem, sir. So this is Morehead City Harbor

our deep draft channels and as the Chairmen referenced earlier we have
really sever problems with that. Originally the Feds only authorized
four million dollars this year to keep that channel open. You probably
need at least 10 million dollars a year to keep that channel open and
operating to it&#39;s maximum level of efficiency. This is so bad right
now, the Morehead City channel. PCS Phosphate alone is losing two
million dollars a month because they have to light load their ships to
get them out of the harbor. Nucor also heavily depends on this Morehead
City harbor and they are also having the same problems. In fact it&#39;s
gotten so bad that PCS says that if we don&#39;t fix the problem
they&#39;re going to ship all of their shipping business to Norfolk
which stays open all the time because the feds put a lot of money into
it. So Morehead City we&#39;ve got a real problem there and we still
haven&#39;t dredged it yet. In fact I just got an email as I was sitting
in my chair over there that the Corps finally found a dredger to come
and dredge for the amount of money we have, but they haven&#39;t awarded
a contract yet. So we&#39;re still looking at maybe another month or two
before we get a contractor on site and get Morehead City dredged. So
that&#39;s a real serious problem right there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I
interject something? I just happened to be on site one day at Morehead
City when the phone call came in and it essentially went like this. It
was the US Army Corps of Engineers making the call to our port saying,
you need to call your customers and tell them they can&#39;t bring you
as much stuff, simply because of the shoaling and they had to light load
their ships coming in. Those of you in the business world can you
imagine having to call your customers and saying by the way, you
can&#39;t order as much. Some of these things are just fascinating. But
it&#39;s high time we talk the helm and get it corrected.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] This is Wilmington Harbor of course and as the Chairman said
the biggest problem we have there right now is we have a lot of shoaling
in the ?? areas that are making those inaccessible or inefficient to
operate. So there&#39;s also dredging problems there although the main
channel has been maintained by the Army Corp so that&#39;s in pretty
good shape. We don&#39;t have the same problems there we&#39;re having
in Morehead right now. And then we have some other dredging requirement
in North Carolina and these are your not Federally authorized channels.
The Feds don&#39;t provide any money at all for this type of dredging.
You have your ferry channels, those are maintained pretty much
exclusively by NC DOT. ?? hasn&#39;t really had much of a role in there,
we&#39;ve passed through from DOT to the Corps sometimes, for the Corps
to do the dredging. The connecting channels from the Federally
authorized inlets to the ferry channels also are federally authorized,
so we&#39;ve done dredging in those in the past. And then the ?? areas
which the Chairman mentioned earlier, those are exclusively maintained
by State Ports Authority and NC DOT, I believe on a 50/50 basis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me ask something right here. To bring that into
perspective, the State has been keeping the port area dredged and clean
for ship depth. The Feds have not been keeping access to that area
clean. So although we were keeping our depth it would do absolutely no
good if the Feds allow the channel to fill up. So this is how comical
some of these issues have become. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So where do we get
all the money for this dredging that we have to do. Well like I said
earlier if the inlets are Federally authorized the Feds give us money if
they have it available. We used to receive substantial Federal funding
to maintain our shallow draft and deep depth inlets in North Carolina,
maybe up in the 40 to 50 million dollars a year range. We don&#39;t get
that money any more. We&#39;ve supplemented in the past for the shallow
draft channels and now we&#39;re finding that we have to supplement it
for the deep draft channels. This is a snapshot of the last five years.
This really doesn&#39;t tell you the whole problem though because if you
go back into the 2005, 2007 range we were probably getting 40 million to
50 million dollars a year for dredging and you can see we&#39;re getting
no where near that. As you can see that 8.9 million for Morehead City
actually, that was 4.9 million until like the Chairman said, we had all
these people raise a ruckus up in Washington D.C. and the Feds kicked in
an extra four million. So you have a channel in Morehead City that takes
about 10 million dollars to maintain and the Feds were giving us about
four and a half million dollars to maintain that for 2015. There&#39;s
just no way that was going to work. In fact we couldn&#39;t even get a
contractor to come to North Carolina to dredge the channel for that
amount of money. No contractor would take the contract to come and
dredge for 4.5 million dollars. So until we got that extra four million
dollars we were completely out. We weren&#39;t going to get it dredged
at all.

  <p id="40:00">
  Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How much of that was actually, I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chairman Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. How much of that was actually budgeted and then how much
of those were part of emergency response, I know in &#39;13 that was
Isabel response money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right, right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A lot of this is response money, do you have a breakdown-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We&#39;ve been getting, well in general, on the shallow draft inlet
side, we&#39;ve probably been getting budgeted anywhere from $2-3
Million a year. And for Oregon Inlet, you&#39;re looking at, until we
get that bridge replaced, in Oregon Inlet you&#39;re looking at $7-10
Million a year to maintain that and then for the other shallow-draft
inlets you need about $5 Million a year. So you can imagine, if the feds
are giving us $2-3 M, we have to make up that difference somehow. So
that&#39;s the kind of problems we&#39;re facing right now. So what
alternatives do you have to federal funding? Well, the primary
alternative is you develop an  MOA, a memorandum of agreement with the
army corps and then you provide them state funding and they get the
dredging done for you. Why do you use the army corps? Well, there&#39;s
a couple reasons. They have a lot of experience and they have a
management team in place to do this. So you don&#39;t have to do any
project management, all you have to do is write them a check. So
it&#39;s a really easy way to get this done. The flip side of that is,
of course, the state needs a funding source for the funds to get all
this done. A memorandum of agreement with the army corps, the corps can
not accept federal funding without an MOA, so you usually draft an MOA
with the corps for either a specific project or you can draft it over a
number of years. In fact, North Carolina was the first state to ever
draft a long term, what we call a long term MOA with the corps that
covers multiple years. The big problem with MOA&#39;s is they have to go
through this extremely byzantine bureaucratic process at Washington D.C.
that takes a minimum of six months and in the case of our long-term MOA
it actually took us two years to get that approved by the federal
government, so it&#39;s a long process,  you can&#39;t just develop
these things over night. Like I said, we do have a shallow draft
dredging, a long-term MOA with the army corps. The reason we did that is
we realized we could no longer depend on the Feds to keep our
shallow-draft inlets open. So we developed this long-term MOA, the first
of its kind in the country. We provide the corps $4 Million a year,
that&#39;s made up of state and local funds, 50/50 match, and they keep,
basically with that $4 Million a year, they can keep our shallow draft
inlets open, except for Oregon Inlet. There&#39;s not enough funding
availability in the shallow-draft MOA for Oregon Inlet. You need about
$7 Million a year to keep Oregon Inlet open until we get that bridge
moved. The dredging is normally performed by corps dredges but we can
also hire private contractors at our discretion. The big thing is we
needed a dedicated funding source to support this MOA, and we got it
about two years ago from the General Assembly when they established a
shallow-draft navigation channel and lake dredging fund. Basically, what
we use that money for is to meet the local match 50/50 so we can get
this dredging done in shallow-draft inlets. We get about $6 Million a
year from that, we get deposits quarterly, it&#39;s about $1.5 Million
per quarter. So we&#39;ve gotten about $8.7 Million in that since its
establishment, $6.7 Million is encumbered right now. We have pending
requests for about another $800,000 worth, plus we have outstanding
requests. So all that money&#39;s being put to good use and I will say
that we have not denied a single request for the use of this money to
date and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have to because it&#39;s a very
well-funded, successful program that&#39;s up and running now for our
shallow-draft channels, excluding Oregon Inlet. So what are our
outstanding issues? Well, we have a couple, really. One is, if we
can&#39;t depend upon the Feds to dredge Morehead City or Wilmington
Harbor anymore, we&#39;re going to have to develop some sort of strategy
to do that at the state level. We may have to develop a long-term MOA
for the dredging of those channels and we may have to come up with a
potential funding source to keep those inlets open. Also, we have the
problem, as Representative Tine noted, with Oregon Inlet. Right now,
until we get the bridge moved, we need about $7 Million a year to keep
that open, that&#39;s $3.6 Million in local, $3.6 Million in state match
and we need to find a funding source to support that. We&#39;re in the
process right now of developing another MOA with the corps that will
provide 340 days of dredging a year at Oregon Inlet to keep it fully
open. Some of the other things we have, you know, when you talk about
future funding gaps, that&#39;s very difficult to predict because a lot
of it is dependent upon what kind of storms do we have? Do we have a
hurricane that year? What&#39;s the rate shoaling? The rates of shoaling
are constantly changing

  <p id="45:00">
  do we have a hurricane that year, what&#39;s the rate of showing? The
rates of showing are constantly changing on the coast, so some inlets
that didn&#39;t fill in as fast in the past are filling in faster now.
Federal funding, we can never depend on federal funding, we never know
how much we&#39;re going to get and we&#39;re always disappointed by the
amount we do get. And then other issue is about coupling these projects
with beach nourishment. We always do that where it&#39;s practicable but
the big issues there is the dredge sand has to be what&#39;s called
beach compatible. You can&#39;t have a lot of big rocks in it and things
like that. Some of the other alternatives you have besides doing an MOA
with the core is you can obtain the federal dredge authorizations, get
those permits yourself, and the state can go out and enact private
contracts with private dredgers to do the dredging. The problem with
that is somebody has to manage those contracts,k the core does that for
us now. And then, one thing that&#39;s always talked about is what if
North Carolina procured its own dredges? That was studied extensively in
2005 and they said that it was not a cost-effective alternative and some
of the problems with that were the O&amp;M costs of maintaining a
dredge, the cost of hiring and maintaining a crew, and all the other
overhead and management that goes with a the dredging operations. So
that&#39;s it, unless you have any more questions, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the match money that we did last session, you kept saying,
&quot;except for Oregon Inlet,&quot; that it&#39;s not included, I
thought we made corrective language in there that allowed Oregon Inlet
to participate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, Oregon Inlet is participating and we have $300,000 set aside
for that right now, for some work up there, as soon as the locals want
us to move forward with that. The issue is that we only get $4 Million a
year, well we get $6 Million from the state, the MOA&#39;s only
authorize a $4 Million a year so we could not keep Oregon Inlet open
under that MOA because Oregon Inlet needs about $7 Million a year worth
of dredging.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So the county has asked, and I&#39;ll be bringing legislation to
authorize the quarter cent that exists to use towards dredging, which
then that would provide around $3.7 Million and looking for the match on
the other side.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are you saying the fund is not big enough for the $3.7 Million?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What we&#39;re going to do to accommodate that is we&#39;re in the
process, right now, of developing a specific MOA, a specific long-term
MOA just for Oregon Inlet. That will allow us to spend up to $7-8
Million for Oregon Inlet alone. So if we get the $3.6 Million from the
locals, the $3.6 Million from the state, then we could just dedicate it,
all move it to that inlet and keep the Oregon Inlet open, so that&#39;s
what we&#39;re doing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And this is more of a comment and I&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t have many
in the room to hear it, but
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the record
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What? Yeah. We have, this is how we move goods, this is how we do
commerce, it&#39;s like roads and trains and everything else across the
state for transportation and that impact that I said about 548 was
around 900 million about ten years ago, I believe it was, when they last
had an independent study on its impact. So I appreciate your willingness
to look at it and this is something that we need to make sure, and
I&#39;ve got the phosphate company, too, in my district, trying to move
out of Morehead City, so it&#39;s an up-and-down, the entire coast, so I
appreciate your participation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ve got a question, and I apologize for the attendance this morning
but it is on the record, but a question that continuously comes up in
discussions where I&#39;m from, what other states do to address this
issue, I know that lots of them use jetties or terminal groins and so
forth, has there ever been any study of what terminal growing&#39;s
impact would be on a one-time investment, lowering the maintenance cost
of these inlets has there ever been any kind of study done on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well we have that pilot study that the General Assembly authorized a
couple years ago where we&#39;re putting in those four terminal groins
around North Carolina and the Bald Head Islands, one of them. A groin,
in my opinion, some sort of jetty or groin would probably help in the
Morehead City case, I think it would help in Oregon Inlet, too, but the
problem is is that the closest let where the shoaling&#39;s coming from
is federal land, like Shackleford Banks in the case of Morehead City. So
you got to get the fed permission to build a groin or an inlet or a
jetty, I mean a groin or a jetty there, and that&#39;s next to
impossible to get. So that&#39;s the big hurdle, and I think it&#39;s
the same case in Oregon Inlet, I think the feds own the property where
