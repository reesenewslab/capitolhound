Substitute number 2 for Senate Bill 744, a bill to ?? enact to make a
base budget appropriations for current operations of state departments,
institutions and agencies and for other purposes. General Assembly of
North Carolina unites. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker and members of the House, we had I believe a debate
yesterday that on all sides does credit to this great chamber. We
dispensed with in the time we took yesterday some 37 amendments in a
variety of ways. We heard a lot of passion on a lot of issues very
wide-ranging. We were very pleased, Mr. Speaker and members of the
House, to conclude that debate with a strong bipartisan vote for this
budget, and if memory serves me correctly, we had the largest number of
votes for a budget since I believe 2008, when a number of us on the
Republican side joined with the Democrat majority in supporting their
budget. We would appreciate everyone’s support again for the budget this
morning, and thank you for all of your hard work. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker, first of all I have an inquiry to the Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are we going to
be able to introduce any other amendments today on this budget? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We will allow amendments to be presented for the next 15
minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well that’s fine because I really… Let me say
this, Mr. Speaker, and I’m speaking on… I’m having an amendment drawn
right now. Folks stayed up part of last night trying to do it; I think
will enhance even what you all are trying to do. Representative Dollar
indicated last night that we’re sitting over here sitting on our hands
and probably not doing anything. I just want to show you that we are
trying to do something whether you take it or not, but I think it’s
something that you can… you all will be able to live with as well as
what we can live with. If I can be given an opportunity for them to
finish up that amendment, it’s one that… [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, do you have any idea how long it will take?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just left from over there. They are putting the
final touches on it right now. It shouldn’t take any more than 15 or 20
minutes, if I could. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair… the Clerk will take
any amendments that have already been made or a request has been made by
staff, no additional amendments that have not already been made by
staff, and therefore that provides you the time, Representative Michaux,
to get it done because you indicated you did make the request last
night, so we will consider your amendment. Ladies and gentlemen, since
there do appear to be some amendments being prepared, the Chair would
like to temporarily displace Senate Bill 744. There is a matter that we
would like to bring before the body.</p>

Speaker: And it's senate bill 574 without objection the chair would like
to add immediate consideration  for senate rule 36 representative ? this
bill will relates to ground water contamination and based on the
modification of supreme court decision statue that oppose.Getting better
in betting a question i think so without objection,
Speaker Changes: so order senate bill 574 the ??,
Speaker Changes: House committee ?? for bill 574 ?? the certain civil
acts regarding the ground water contamination or not subject to ten year
statue ?? said for NGS 1-52 ??,
Speaker Changes: Representative ?? please state your purpose,
Speaker Changes: To debate the bill the gentlemen is recognized to
debate the bill,
Speaker Changes: Thank you this very important and emotional issue and i
do hope that you support what we are trying to do,Monday the us supreme
court made a decision that families exposed to contaminate the ground
water in the southern ash bill area from their right to fall a claim
against ?? they determined that our statue of ?? limited to imposed to
contaminate the people in ground water to maximum of ten years to fall a
claim even though people exposed to contaminate the ground water may not
know it,
Speaker Changes: For decades that was never our intend,this legislation
clarifies that i will say that i give you an example of serious this
could be  ?? one of them i know is master surgeon whose daughter
Jany,What was when she was 8 years old.After being exposed to
contaminated ground water for her entire he did 't not found out that
they have been drinking contaminated ground water for another twelve
years to hold anybody responsible for a ten year limitation in that
situation is wrong so this state changes the ten years statue the
reforms that ?? prior to our ?? well education and we past last session

should have been interpreted ?? i guess somewhat 20 or 30 years ago.Most
of you that were hear most them would have recall the fact that we
formed a committee  to investigate the CTS hazardous wastes in issue in
my district as well as to restrict currently represented by
representative ??.An we discovered a lot of things that was quite
alarming in regards to facts that ?? the case.This is the issue that we
are aced with daily,ti is the case that made all way to the u.s supreme

of this step that we take today. As I said before on the floor of this
House probably the most shameful episode in the history of the proud
traditions of the United States Marine Corps has been what happened at
Camp Lejeune and our failure to protect and act for our own and this
bill will help address that to some extent. And again, I'd appreciate
your support on the bill and your past support on the amendment in the
budget. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I'm following Representative Ramsey's amendment. I have a
perfecting amendment that we've been working on and I'll hold until
then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ramsey, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ramsey moves to amend the bill on page 1, line 2 by
substituting the word &quot;clarifying&quot; for the word
&quot;providing&quot; and
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. This is, as it says, a
clarifying amendment. It's a technical amendment. I've spoken with
Representative Glazier and I think he's going to send, Representative
Glazier's going to send forth perhaps an amendment to make a few
additional changes but this just clarifies this law. We're clarifying
our existing statute of repose and providing what the legislature has
intended all along and would ask the members of the body to support this
amendment. If you have any questions be glad to answer those now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, just a note, this amendment does change the title which would
not make it eligible for third reading without a suspension of the
rules. The Chair would ask that if we do amend this that we get support
to suspend the rules so that we can take third reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To, well if there's going to be another clarifying amendment perhaps I
ought to go after that, when we get back on the bill as amended Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment. If not the question
before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by
Representative Ramsey for the House Committee Substitute of Senate Bill
574. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. All members wishing to record please do so. The clerk will let the
machine record the vote, 109 having voted affirmative, none in the
negative, the amendment passes. Representative Glazier is recognized to
send forth an amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier moves to amend the bill on page 2, lines 3-8 by
rewriting those lines to read:
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Representative is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and working with Representative Ramsey
and Representative Moffitt and your staff this morning, it adds a couple
of changes that I think are important. The Supreme Court, in a way it
makes a final decision, decides cases but then there's a 30 day pending
time frame afterwards before a mandate issues which becomes the critical
trigger date. So this adds in no final disposition with prejudice and
the mandate issues. And secondly it makes it clear that it's trigger is
where the final court, the highest court that's heard the case, has that
decision. And in this case or other cases it may be the Supreme Court or
the North Carolina Supreme Court but it makes sure that we're talking
about that and that this couldn't be read to just say when there's final
disposition in a trial court. Now I think it clears up and does exactly
what everyone wants it to and perhaps will help later on. I would urge
adoption. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment. If not the question

To speak on the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Colleagues, I'm no longer much of a lawyer and so I'm not going to try
to get into the bleeds[?] on the law here but I do want to observe. We
oft times, on the floor, rail at how the Federal Government is jumping
into this, that, and the other thing and here we've got a U.S. Supreme
Court decision where the U.S. Supreme Court was</p>

<p id="020:00">
On to interpret North Carolina law. Well, ultimately that's our role, to
determine what the law is. Based on the 4th Circuit decision earlier,
they decided it in a different way than the US Supreme Court. So
obviously a bunch of lawyers are interpreting North Carolina law in
different ways, and what I'd suggest to you is we are acting
appropriately in our role where there apparently is an ambiguity that
probably most of us didn't recognize, certainly the folks that passed
this law wouldn't ever have anticipated, and weigh in to provide some
clarity with respect to a North Carolina law that has had to be
interpreted by a Federal court. I would recommend the bill as amended to
you both on policy reasons as my colleagues Representative Catlin and
Moffitt and Hall have suggested, but also in terms of the role that we
have here in terms of just putting forth the laws and making sure they
are interpreted appropriately. So I recommend the bill to you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative McNeill, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yea, Mr. Speaker, I have a question of Representative Ramsey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That may be tough. Representative Ramsey, would you
please return to your seat? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I
yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ramsey, your amendment took out the expiration date and
Representative Glazier's put it back in. Was that y'all's intention?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Sheriff, Representative, the old saying is you
can't fool a sheriff, and you have proven that to be true. That's just
what we were talking about. I think that's a question from staff, and
maybe Representative Glazier may want to add some more to your question.
That was about whether we intended to pull out that last language and
how we're going to deal with that, so my amendment did intend to pull
that out. I think Representative Glazier's amendment did add that back.
We can argue whether that was appropriate or not, and if Representative
Glazier has anything to add, if you want to address that to him, he may
be able to answer that question better than I can. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McNeill, with your approval we will redirect to
Representative Glazier. And Representative Glazier, does the gentleman
yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, and good question Representative McNeill.
We actually caught it and I think that the answer is that it is
something that the two amendments can be reconciled by staff or dealt
with in technical corrections and it was not my intent to add that back
in, but in the drafting, in the hurry to get the other changes in the
old language was put in there. So I think the intent will be to
reconcile that by the staff between the two amendments and if that's not
able to be done, then in a technical corrections or in another bill. But
the answer is that I think that Representative Ramsey's pulling it out
is fine and correct and that should happen at some point. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the bill as amended? If
not, the question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute to Senate Bill 574 as Amended on its second reading. All in
favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will out machine record the vote. 109 having voted in
the affirmative, none in the negative. The House Committee Substitute to
Senate Bill 574 has passed its second reading. Representative Moore is
recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we should suspend the
rules so that third reading may be had on the bill at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the motion? If
not, the question before the House is the motion to suspend the rules so
that, for consideration of the House Committee Substitute to Senate Bill
574 on its third reading today. All in favor will vote aye, all opposed
will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will out machine
record the vote. 108 having voted in the affirmative, none in the
negative. House Committee Substitute, the motion passes. House Committee

CHANGES] Representative Blackwell moves to amend the bill on page 75 by
inserting the following between lines 45 and 46. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. There were some sincere concerns
expressed here yesterday with reference to Elizabeth City State
University, and Representative Horn and McGrady and I have conferred and
agreed that we felt that it was appropriate in this budget to take some
action now in order to address some of those concerns so that we might
be in a position next year in January to take some further action. So
I’ve discussed this amendment with Representative Mobley and I
understand that this is agreeable with her and a number of others who’ve
expressed concerns yesterday, and basically what this would do is direct
joint ed. oversight during the interim, with a report to the General
Assembly when we convene next year to consult with the Board of Trustees
of Elizabeth City State, and to engage in a study of plans and
strategies to address financial and enrollment concerns at that
university, and I would ask the House to join in adding this t our
budget and adopting this amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Mobley, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady’s recognized
to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I
certainly want to thank my fellow colleague for this effort, this
gesture, and I want to ensure you that the Alumni Association, along
with the staff and all, are beginning to address the major concerns that
we have about what direction the university’s moving, so strategies are
already being put in place and worked on, and I ask you to support this
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Steinburg, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To speak on the
amendment please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, I concur with the remarks from Representative Mobley. Elizabeth
City State University, which she and I both share Pasquotank County, is
a vital economic engine to all of northeastern North Carolina, and I
have been trying to, along with Representative Mobley, stay on top of
this situation as it has been developing out there, and I can assure you
that there are some very, very good people that are involved in trying
to get this situation turned around. I’m going to be meeting next week
with some of the board of Governors and with the folks from UNC…</p>

… to discuss this a little further. We’ve had many, many folks coming by
the office to express their concern as well, so this is indeed a very
timely and wonderful amendment that I support enthusiastically, and I
ask all my friends and colleagues to join me in doing so. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pierce, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to make a statement or two. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just wanted to thank the member Representative Blackwell for
just a very positive response this morning to the issue we were
discussing yesterday. Thank you for coming forth with that. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before the House is the
passage of the amendment sent forth by Representative Blackwell to the
House Committee Substitute number 2 of Senate Bill 744. All in favor
vote aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk

Representative Larry Hall is recognized to send forth AMD-79. The Clerk
will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall moves to amend
the bill on page 169, line 43, by rewriting the line to read… [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House. I’d like to
direct your attention to this amendment. This is an amendment that as
you know we dealt with yesterday – the question of moves of the lab and
other things – and this amendment would allow us to do something that
would preserve the integrity and the confidence of the citizens of North
Carolina in our government. Now we know that everyone is human who
serves in the House and Senate and throughout state government, and
sometimes they yield to those temptations and the forces that swirl
around us, and it’s important for the public to know that that will be
examined and their interests will be safeguarded. As I indicated
yesterday, since 2009, the SBI have conducted 260 public corruption
investigations. I think I said 290, so please correct that in the
record. This would allow us to keep this function – the financial crimes
unit, the special investigations until, and ten additional SBI agents
with the Department of Justice – to ensure that function stays with the
Department of Justice. It allows the transfer of the other functions, as
is indicated in the current budget bill. I think we’ve seen maybe a
glaring example as to why we would want to do this, and you can see it
right now as the saga plays out in Texas. As you know, the governor is
in a situation there where despite whatever his best intentions might
be, it appears that he is intentionally defunding the investigatory
agency because he has control of their budget, and we don’t want the
people of North Carolina to have to have those kinds of questions as to
whether or not investigations are being influenced to prevent corruption
in public service from being uncovered and discovered, and so I’d ask
that you support the amendment, and this will allow us to maintain the
confidence of the citizens in our investigations, in the level of
integrity we have in public service. It also ensures that our other
elected officials know that they have to uphold the standards to which
their sworn when they take office, so I’d ask for your support on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I was just going to see if
Representative Hall would yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Hall, you were
indicating that you wanted to make sure we had politics out of these
investigation procedures, but isn’t Roy Cooper’s position political?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I can respond, Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, every position is
political, and the question is who is going to be responsible and have
influence over the investigatory process, and so if we have the
executive branch investigating itself, having basically employees who
depend upon the same people that they’re going to be investigating…</p>

<p id="035:00">
it would be a chilling effect on the investigation and the performance
of these individual agents and other persons assigned. That is what
we're concerned about. Again, looking at the number of investigations
that's happened since 2009, 260, we know there are continuing situations
and if you look at the record of the investigations that have happened
they have not been partisan. They've been on both sides of the aisle. As
a matter of fact some of the biggest investigations have involved
democrats during the period of time that Roy Cooper has been attorney
general so I don't think we can say that he has politicized the process
or any undue influence has been exercised by his office. I think, if you
look, the investigations have been fair across the board regarding
public officials.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yield to a follow-up? Representative Hall?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Thank you, Representative Hall. But what you're saying is
that we're trying to take the politics out of it and we all know that
Attorney General Cooper is getting ready to perhaps run for office so
that him a little bit more of a political creature out there. Aren't you
providing your best argument for having an independent director who's
given an eight year term no matter who's in office? Isn't that a better
defense for making sure these are non-political?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I don't think it's a better defense. I think, again, the process we
have in place has already proven itself. You're saying let's try to move
to a new process that exposes us to that undue influence of the
executive branch controlling investigations of itself, whether or not
they appoint one person and then go around with a lower level
appointments that they do do, or does the history show us that the
system we have in place has been effective, it's been non-partisan, and
we don't need to change this part of it and sacrifice the public's
confidence in our system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I'll share from personal experience
something that may impact your vote on this and I won't say whether I'm
for it or against it but I'll tell you a little autobiographical stuff.
In college I specialized in criminal justice, School of Criminal
Justice, Michigan State. Law school, I specialized in that as well with
the professor teaching criminal law and I was hired at work for summer
for the elected solicitor of Guilford County, Doug Albright, a well
known democrat. It didn't bother him that I was republican and I was
very naive, didn't think it was an issue. After law school I was
recommended to clerk with a elected democrat, Justice Exum, I'm sure
many of you all know him, a very well known democrat. He knew I was
republican and so I was very naive. I thought politics had nothing to do
with it. So I walked, at the end of my clerkship, I walked across the
hall to where the Attorney General's Special Prosecution Office was to
see if I could work in Special Prosecutions for the Attorney General.
And the Chief Deputy, I won't call his name that-, a very well known
person, said, &quot;hey, you're very well qualified for this position
but the then Attorney General, Robert Morgan, hires no
republicans.&quot; So my life started on a separate path. If the
Attorney General's Office was not political I might not have been here
to bother any of you all for the last ten years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The irony.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now the Attorney General's Office now does hire republicans but the idea
that the Attorney General's office is non-political is rather a shocking
concept to me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Faircloth, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think that we, first of all JPS Chairs would
ask that you vote no on this amendment and let the real organization
that we're talking about take place and then as we get a new director in
then that person can have input on how assignments would be made to
investigators to various departments or for various cases and
what-have-you. That is a part of the purpose of this organization. It
also, I feel from experience having worked in the Department of Justice
and from my law enforcement career, that it would work much better if
the attorney general had an investigation that he wanted to conduct and
he could contact the law enforcement unit, the SBI, the director of the
SBI, who will not be an elected official</p>

<p id="040:00">
And request an agent or a group of agents to investigate that particular
item for him at his direction, at the Attorney General's direction. This
makes sense to me just as does the situation where a department within
the state would have a legal situation in the office and the Attorney
General would assign an attorney. So I think it's good organization. I
think it gives us a chance to have a new model for direction of the
agency. It gets law enforcement together so that they can work using
their resources and using their expertise and putting the best agent in
the best place for that particular investigation. So I'd ask you to vote
no on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a second
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I appreciate
Representative Faircloth's observations. I think it's clear, though,
from the record you have in front of you that the process we have in
place now through the Attorney General's Office works. We can't say it
doesn't work. We don't have any founded complaints of any political
shenanigans going on. We have the record of the number of investigations
that have been done or are being done and have been completed and what
we're saying now is this extremely large bureaucracy we're creating over
at the Department of Public Safety is going to now also consume this.
When we create this large organization in the budget and it starts to
try to get its budget efficiencies, the temptation again is going to be
where do we make the cuts and where do we sacrifice and, of course, the
concern would be that we would lose the Integrity Unit and its
effectiveness as part of that process. And were that to happen, people
would rightfully say, here we go again, politicians with their hands in
the cookie jar, and they want to make the organizations that are
supposed to investigate them and keep them honest, they want to defund
them, reduce them in size, make them ineffective and so they can do
business behind closed doors. So I think it's in our best interest, it's
in the best interest of the integrity of this House and this state
government to say we have something that works, we have something that's
proven to be bipartisan and we should keep what we have that works. So
again, I'd ask your support on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
question before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by
Representative Larry Hall to the House Committee Substitute Number 2 of
Senate Bill 744. All in favor, vote aye. All opposed, vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. The clerk will out machine record the vote, 42
having voted in the affirmative, 69 in the negative. The amendment
fails. Representative Michaux is recognized to send forth an amendment.
The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux moves to
amend the bill on page 4 line 27 by decreasing the amount by and.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the
House. I have heard a lot about this whole budget going through and what
it's doing and how it's helping teachers and everything else involved.
Yesterday, I was struck by Representative Dollar's indication that we
were sitting over here on our hands, basically doing nothing, not making
any contributions. I've heard arguments also on both sides about using
the $106 million that is allegedly, and I say allegedly, coming from the
lottery. Let me tell you a little bit about that having had some
experience with that. When we came in in 2007 there was a shortfall in
the lottery budget for which money had been spent of $205 million. We
did make that money up, but we had to do some hard stuff on top of being
in the midst of a recession. Right now the force is now trying to pull
me back from offering this amendment because of that particular, but I'm
not going to argue with you about the gambling part about it. I think
that if you all wanted to get rid of the lottery than you had an
opportunity and you still have</p>

<p id="045:00">
opportunity to get rid of it but you're building on it and I'm not
building on it with this amendment. What this amendment simply does, it
takes 102 million dollars and increases, it increases the amount of
teachers from the average of 5% that you have put in there to an average
of 7.4%, 7.4% with 102 million dollars added. To give an example, if you
look at the schedule that you have on that, on the budget, if you look
to year 9 where it says, your budget says $3445 on the monthly basis it
shifts that $3445 to item number 4, actually item number 6 to $3445. In
other words it moves it up and as you go down that schedule the largest
increase for any step in there would be 17.2%, the lowest would be 4.6%.
Now, you ask me, &quot;well, it's going to cost 102 million dollars
more. Where is the money coming from?&quot; First of all we take 17
million from the Medicaid fund that you've set up. That 117 million,
which is a guesstimate as to what you're doing there, you're leaving 100
million there. The Governor didn't have but 50 million in his budget for
that. So we're taking 17 million from there. We are taking approximately
21 million dollars from JDIG by, very simply, back failing JDIG, making
what's there now, which is recurring money, making that nonrecurring,
putting that 21 million in there and then the money is still there but
it becomes nonrecurring money and when you come back you can put that
money back in there. Also, let me remind you that things could have been
done even now because you're looking at, you put 36 million dollars in
the rainy day fund which runs that fund up to approximately 749 million
dollars in the rainy day fund. Some of that, you don't need that much
money in the rainy day fund. We haven't spent that kind of money since I
don't know when on the rainy day fund. The big chairs could have really
taken some of that money and put it in to raise these teachers pay more
with basically recurring money. But, here again, I digress. There are
other items in here but the bottom line is that what this amendment does
is simply raises the teachers to an average of 7.4% with only 102
million dollars added to what you've already got there. I move the
adoption of the amendment. Mr. Speaker, just as an addition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.

Mr. Speaker, members of the House, in reviewing this amendment I
certainly can appreciate the skill and the creativity of a former Senior
Chair of the Appropriations Committee. It is well evident in this
amendment but I would point out a couple of items to your attention.
One, as the gentleman correctly stated, this does continue to build on
what this House has adopted with respect to additional revenues from the
lottery and I appreciate that but it concerns me deeply. This amendment
would take needed funds from conservation. It would take needed funds
from pending legislation in this House so I don't know how we would fund
bills that we intend to pass in this House without this money. And there
are four particular areas that concern me that this bill would take
money from. It would take it from our emergency funds. It would take all
the funds from the emergency fund. It would take 17 million dollars from
risk reserve which is there to make</p>

sure that we can pay the bills, medical bills, for our most vulnerable
citizens in this state. It would take 13.6 million dollars from
unemployment insurance. As you know those are funds that we use to pay
people who are unemployed and it would take 21 million dollars from jobs
and JDIG. Mr. Speaker, if I might be recognized for a motion.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
After that vote I was hoping I'd get to vote on something that was
really going to make a difference but I want to say I do appreciate what
this body has done to restore some important items back in our budget.
Teaching fellows, I appreciate that. Masters pay, I appreciate that.
MCAT[?], I appreciate that. Restoring the historic renovation tax
credits, I appreciate that. Much good is in this budget. What's missing
is jobs, a focus on jobs and real recovery. The budget we're under now
that we're hear in this short session to fix cut over 5200 teaching
positions, over 3800 teaching assistants positions. This fix doesn't cut
any more teaching assistants, unlike the Senate's budget, but it does
cut 788 teachers. Tens of thousands of education jobs have been cut by
this General Assembly. I'm thankful we're stopping the hemorrhage but
we're a long way from fixing the problem. What's the real situation in
jobs in this state? We heard a lot about the unemployment numbers. There
are 33,000 fewer jobs today, in this state, than there were a year ago.
The jobs we have are lower wage. Lower wage jobs that have been created
by a vast majority. Fewer jobs and lower wage jobs. That's a long way
from home. But the elephant in the room is that this General Assembly
continues to deny 2 billion dollars of our citizens' federal tax dollars
to come back into our state, into our economy, to help our people, by
expanding Medicaid. These are our tax dollars for our people. That's a
loss of 20,000 good healthcare jobs, 400 of them in my district. My
district, Haywood, Jackson, and Swain. I would love to vote for this
budget if we could focus on our people, on our jobs, and real recovery.
I would love to work with each and every one of you for that. This

I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen, I may have misheard you but, as I believe you're
aware, are you not aware that this budget makes no cuts to teaching
assistants and makes no cuts to teachers, in fact raises average teacher
salary by 5%? Did I mishear what you said earlier?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate your efforts in that direction. What I said was we cut 788
teaching positions. I refer to, what is it, I have to put my glasses on,
F3, page F3, number 13, revise adjustments made in the 2013 to reduce
the classroom teacher allocations in the second and third grade from one
teacher per 18 students to one per 17. This adjustment will forego an
additional 788 new teaching positions added.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield for another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You realize that that provision does not reduce the number of actual
teachers in the classroom it forestalls an increase in the number of
teaching positions but it does not, in any way, cut existing teacher
positions in the classroom. Are you not aware of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I listened to you and others brag on adding 788 teachers last year while
we cut 5200 and now cut those 788 we added. So I'm just letting the

I have a heavy heart today because you've just been offered by a master,
a master at appropriations, an opportunity to incorporate at least part
of this substantial things and items into this budget. Instead we choose
to gamble on gambling. We're not just gambling but we are gambling on
gambling. Now I got two lottery tickets that cook a house but didn't pay
off. I used to live in Washington, D.C. when they first implemented the
lottery for education. Within three years I watched the appropriations
budget diminish. The line approp-, it was supposed to be for all the
extras that were going to happen in the school system and I watched
every year the decrease in the money from the general budget going in to
it to the point that it was almost solely relying upon the lottery. Then
I saw the lottery make no money one year and I saw the scrambling and
everybody trying to figure, &quot;oh, what we gonna do, what we gonna
do, what we gonna do?&quot; But even D.C.</p>

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm looking at Mason's Legislative Manual, section 253, number 5, which
says the presiding officer should never permit a speaker to be heckled

Dollar, is edging mighty close to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair would observe that over the course of the last seven hours of

mightily close to that. Representative Insko, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If we compare the House budget to the Senate
budget we all can come up with a lot of things that are a lot better.
I'm not comparing the House budget to the Senate budget. I'm comparing
the House budget to what could have been. I'm comparing the House budget
to what should have been. You all talk a lot about living within our
means. We have to live within our means. The problem is you gave away
our means. You cut taxes too fast, too much too fast, and to balance
that out what you did was cut into the very bones and meat of our
society. You made unprecedented cuts to education, pre-K through the
university system. The future of our state. The future of our children.
You precipitated an unprecedented exodus of our best teachers from the
state and from the profession of teaching. This budget doesn't fix that.
It will take us a long time to fix that. Not only did you make
unprecedented cuts in our programs and in our revenue stream in order to
give tax breaks to our wealthiest, who are already privileged, you
raised taxes on the neediest. You did that by repealing the earned
income tax credit. That's a tax increase on our poor people. You did it
by changing the tax code so that you are now taxing services that effect
our middle and low income families, it won't bother wealthy people. You
also took the unprecedented step of uncoupling our state income tax from
the federal tax. You took away the deduction for medical expenses. It
impacts our poor and our seniors the most. I got Grover's letter this
year. I have opposition. I read that letter. It asked me to pledge not
to raise taxes. It didn't ask me to pledge to cut taxes. I'm going to
vote no on this budget because we can do better.

No thank you. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. May I ask a couple questions first of
Representative Dollar, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, if the
lady would please restate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to ask a couple
questions of Representative Dollar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Dollar, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative Dollar. You say that the average increase is 5% and I’ve
had a number of calls from teachers including my daughter who’s been
teaching a while. And I have a chart which shows basically the more
years, the less increase. So how is the 5% an average? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
When you average all of the increases together, those increases come to
an average of 5%. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So there are some cases where
teachers who have been teaching longer will actually get less than 5%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Depending on where an individual is on the scale, you
can look on the scale and see is that above 5%, below 5%. Obviously one
of the things that we have done in this budget is to increase starting
salaries for teachers. We decided and made a commitment several months
ago to address one of the most pressing problems that we have in
education in this state, and that is we have been observing for a while
that our schools of education have been dropping in terms of folks
coming into those schools of education. We’re very concerned about
starting teachers’ salaries being low in this state. And we knew that
that needed to be moved up. So the governor and the president pro
tempore of the senate and the speaker joined together and did a lot of
work and we made a commitment that over the next two years we are moving
starting teacher pay up to $35,000 and obviously since it had been
frozen previously as you recall because I believe you were part of the
appropriations committee at the time it was frozen, they had an impact
over a number of years, so there’s a number of years they have to be
caught up, not simply the first year that a teacher would be brought in.
So what this budget does is it moves the first step of two steps to move
starting teacher pay up and we next year we’ll get it up, when we do our
budget we’ll get it up to the minimum of $35,000 a year. And we will
also be moving up other steps as well and we’ll have the scale that
moves up and as you obviously the representative is well aware this is
the teacher pay scale that you all had frozen and that we are
unfreezing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Another question, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, when you look at the proposal for funding the
salaries, the lottery, what happens if, if we don’t, if that bet doesn’t
come through? If we don’t raise those moneys? How do we pay for it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I thank the lady for the question, because it allows
me to clarify something. We put the figure in the budget and the lottery
has to turn that money over. This is not speculative with respect to the
state’s budget. We already rely on and have for many, many years as
again, as an appropriations person you are well aware of this, up to
right now at 220 million dollars in salaries of teachers are paid for
year after year after year from the lottery. So we have taken the
numbers from them. We ask the lottery the question, how can we maximize
the education dollars to the state of North Carolina, and this was the
proposal after their professional consideration that they came back to
us with. But we will have that money. It is recurring money. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] One final question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In terms of the
advanced degrees, and I’ve read this budget and I’ve asked questions in
the appropriations committee but I’m still not clear about a person who
pursues a Masters degree or even beyond that and if it’s not in their
area of teaching, whether or not</p>

Speaker 1: They will be paid. It is not clear to me.
Speaker 2: One of the concerns that had been raised for some time was
that an individual, let’s say a teacher in Mathematics, if that teacher
is pursuing a general education Master’s, the concern was how does that
truly impact the students, the children, in the classroom. What our
provision proposes to do is to ensure that an individual is getting paid
for an expertise that they can actually bring back into the subject area
in the classroom. So, we want a Mathematics teacher to get a Master’s in
Math, because we believe that if they pursue a Master’s in Math, we
should pay them more because we know they can take those additional
skills, that additional knowledge and bring it into the classroom to
benefit the students, because it is really about the students.
Speaker 1: Thank you for your answers. Representative Dolman, speak on
the Bill.
Speaker 3: The lady has the floor to debate on the Bill.
Speaker 4: Thank you and I still have these concerns. I thank
Representative Dolof for responding to my questions. Yes I did serve
under Representative Shore on the appropriations committee. So, I do
understand the hard work that goes into this. So I just want to thank
those who worked on the budget because I have been there, and I know
what it takes. It was a long day yesterday. I do not intend to prolong
the discussion, but I did have to ask those questions because I have had
teachers talking to me, especially my daughter, who has been teaching
now for 17 years.  So, listening to the response from Representative
Dolof, she is not going to benefit much 2% for her. So, I just want to
talk a little about the details of the budget because, as far as I am
concerned, the devil is in the details. I have heard from a lot of
teachers, a lot of educators, who want a competitive, including our
state employees. They want to return to the original steps. They want
career status, technology, and all those things, but they want their
tenure too, and they need it. While the budget does provide for raises,
which is a good thing, it still concerns me that they are not
sustainable. There are a lot of refunds and if they are not raised, the
result may be that they will not be given. We have to honor the promises
we make to our teachers, to our state employees, so I suspect that the
plan will be that the needed services that our citizens have right now,
some they don’t have, will be cut. So, it gives me concern as to how
exactly the state will address this. I have not heard anything
definitive, other than the fact that the lottery commission stated that
they could do this, but we do not know because that will depend on the
people who will invest. I never bought a lottery ticket – I have no
interest. Yes, I voted for the lottery – for those who want to do it. I
just believe that people ought to make decisions themselves about what
they want to do, including what they want to do with their bodies – as
it relates to women. Now, Representative Michelle had a good proposal
before us. We talk about the emergency fund, but I think what we have
before us is an emergency. Now, several of the details concern me,
particularly as it relates to due process. First year teachers, yes they
will get a raise, but I think that when you go into a job, yes you look
for salary, but you also look for benefits. They are going to be looking
for whether or not there is going to be some longevity for them. We
have, basically, removed a due process for those beginning teachers, who
not only deserve a raise, like other teachers, but they deserve due
process as well. We tried to present an amendment on yesterday, and it
is on the table with a lot of other stuff. So the table is pretty heavy
right now. Minimally, we did not do what we could have done, even for
the beginning teachers. You shouldn’t have to exchange your tenure for a
raise, having recently retired just two years ago, I cannot think of any
job or business where you work and gain years of experience, and those
things are not counted…
Speaker 5: Mr. Speaker…
Speaker 4: I will yield when I…
Chairman: The chair will redirect…</p>

<p id="075:00">
To the floor, for what purpose does this lady rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady may serve point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is tenure mentioned in the budget as being given up in
succession for a raise? I think she may be arguing the Senate budget
instead of the House budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady's point is well
taken. That particular point is not in the budget. The lady still has
the floor. Representative Adams. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. I also have raised the point about advanced degrees, master's
degrees, PhD degrees, etc., and what it really means in this budget, and
from what I've seen and from the answers that I have received, you
don't, if you don't get the degree in your teaching area, you still
don't get paid. Now let me give you an example. My daughter teaches
second grade. She's been teaching for 17 years and just pursued her,
well, she got her master's degree in reading a couple of years ago. Now,
she's not going to be impacted here because she already has it, but I'm
thinking about the beginning teachers that may want to do this. Teachers
who are just going into the field who may teach for a while in one of
the earlier grades and who may want to pursue a master's degree outside
of that. But I don't think we should be dictating that, because, for
example, even if they're teaching second or third grade and then they
decide that they want to be a reading specialist, for example, they
should have an opportunity to do that. And the last disturbing detail,
and it appears that we may have addressed some of that today, but again
I'm really concerned about not only what we say, but what we do, so I'm
hoping the amendment that passed, Representative Blackwell's amendment,
relative to Fayetteville State, Elizabeth City State, excuse me, is
really going to serve that university well. I just want to remind all
the members of this body and those who will be working on that
particular issue that student debt has increased over 400% over the past
25 years, and there's a national problem, there's a problem in our
state. The outstanding student loan debt now amounts to more than $1.2
trillion, so it's not just an education issue, it's an economic issue
for them. Whether or not they can buy a home or do other kind of things
that we expect our young people to do once they leave school. And for
students who attend HBCUs, and I have special concern because I'm a
graduate twice of one, I spent 40 years on the campus, I've been at
college and I can tell you that students that attend HBCUs in this state
accumulate more than $6,400 a year in debt, leaving college with about
$25,000. So that debt should at least say to us that they need financial
aid, because a large number of these students are first generation
college students, a large number of them, 80 to 90% at these schools,
are on financial aid. So I just wanted to make these comments today and
to just clarify so that we are not misleading our teachers and other
folk who think that they are going to get a 5% raise, all of them will
get that. And I'm not sure that this in incentive enough to not only
attract them, but to keep them, especially our teachers that are
experienced. Why would they stay? You've put 17, 18 years in the system.
You still aren't going to get a decent raise. They want you to give up
your tenure, and I know that's maybe not worded in this bill, but that's
what it means. Job security, that's what it's about. We all have it. We
all want it. We all need it. Thank you very much for the work that
you've done on this bill, but I'm not going to be able to support it
again today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the lady would yield. If
Representative Adams would yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, I'll
yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative Adams. Are you aware or recall back in 2009, between 2009
and 2010, that the money in the lottery that was going to teacher's
salaries was increased from $99 million to the $220 million, an increase
of $121 million. I believe you were one of the chairs of the
Appropriations Committee when that happened. Are you aware of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Thank you for reminding
me of that, but also let me say that there was a recession, and I'm sure
you know that. Thanks very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And a follow up
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield to a follow up. [SPEAKER

<p id="080:00">
Yes I will. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
appreciate the lady’s recollection. I also would like to ask another
point here. Are you aware that if you go all the way back to 2001, the
beginning of this century, that there’s only been one raise – one raise
– for teachers in the last 14 years, in which the average exceeded five
percent? And I believe that was ’06, ’07. So you’re aware that our raise
in this budget is as high as any raise in the last 14, 15 years except
for one year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate that. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative
Adams would yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Adams, does the lady yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I’ll yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, I
listened to the interesting exchange between you and Representative
Dollar, and let’s… I’m just wondering from the same experience, are you
aware that throughout most of the time in the 2000s until the recession,
each and every year there were teacher raises? Is that not accurate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is accurate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In fact, the last
three years there’s only been a 1.2 percent raise one time. Is that
correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You are correct again. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And
so that it would be unfair at the extreme to make a comparison about a
one year five percent raise when there were decades of three, four and
five percent raises. Would that be accurate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is
accurate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Glazier would yield
for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, does the
gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] He does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Glazier.
In speaking of being aware of a lot of things, you’re aware… or how much
do you recall? Let’s see if you recall how many hundreds of millions of
dollars were cut out of the education budget that you voted for in 2009.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, I’m really glad you asked that
question. There were literally close to a billion dollars as I recall
that we cut because we were facing, as you’ll recall, within a month and
a half of the global recession that nearly put this country into a
depression, a 40 percent cut in the revenue of this state, and the only
thing that made this state survive was a balanced approach of filling
that gap by making cuts, by adding temporary revenue, and by the
stimulus money from Washington, and that combination was done to save
the state. That combination was done when the entire country and the
entire world were in a global recession of unprecedented magnitude –
something that does not exist now and has not existed the last several
years to anything like the approach that existed in 2009 and 2010, and I
can tell you Representative Dollar, if you wish me to, every single line
item we cut back then in the 80 days we spent going through it because
of what had to be done. No one knows more or hurt more than what we had
to do, but what we had to do as a body in 2009 bears no resemblance to
choices we make today in 2014. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to a follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Be
delighted to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is delighted to. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And so you are also aware that those funds from the federal
government were temporary then and are no longer available to the state
of North Carolina? [SPEAKER CHANGES] They have not been available to the
state of North Carolina for several years – I think a two-year period.
That’s correct, and so there was a need to begin preparing and filling
in that gap with funds from the state of North Carolina. By the same
token, the revenue has increased substantially since then compared to
what we were facing with a 40 percent drop in 2009. I don’t recall there
being a 40 percent drop in revenue in March and April of 2014. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] One final follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do, Representative. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, I will make this the…
I will attempt to make this my last follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s
fine, Representative Dollar, and I apologize for my tone. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No, no. You’re perfectly fine; you do quite well. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair is enjoying this
chitchat but we’d prefer that the chitchat is directed through the
Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, motion for a group hug? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields
for a follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. So Representative Glazier,
your solution would be, and as I recall a couple of years ago, your
solution was, and so your solution a couple of years…</p>

<p id="085:00">
Here’s a guy who was to retain the one cent sales tax, to retain the
increase in the sale tax. Is that still your position that you would
raise sales taxes or raise other taxes for the purposes of the budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. Actually my position then was a combination, as you’ll recall. And
it wasn't mine. It was the body’s position. We did a number of things.
There was a temporary sales tax raised. There was a temporary raise on
the high income bracket. There was, as I said, close to $1.8 billion one
year in cuts, and over $1.3 billion in cuts the next year. There was the
Obama stimulus package, which was, as I recall, the majority was opposed
to, but which probably saved the state, that we incorporated in. And we
planned ahead for the following year, as well.
As to what existed then versus what I would do now, I think
Representative Insko talked about that. And I think I talked about it on
the floor last night. Now, my caucus hasn’t adopted the approach I would
adopt, but one of the things that seems utterly clear is the tax package
that was enacted last year created an enormous gap, more than the
majority prepared for, and that’s fine. These things are hard to
predict. But sometimes you have to admit that. And in my case, I
certainly would have looked back, at least, at rolling back, to some
degree, a portion of that in order to deal with what we were having to
do this year, because the numbers have come in showing that you had that
500 million dollar gap.
So, sometimes you have to react in the governances you know to the
circumstances that you have on things that you didn’t predict and maybe
couldn’t have predicted. And so, my plan would have been very different.
But the one thing I know I wouldn’t do, in this case, is what was done
in terms of the sustainability of the key component of our economy and
that is paying our teachers and our work force on a recurring manner and
getting them up to the national average within four years. There is
nothing in this budget that steers us fully in that direction. And that
is what concerns me the most, as I stated. But if you wanted to know,
and tried to compare what we did in 2009, I will be glad to talk about
that all day long, but it is different circumstances today. Then, almost
no choice. And, by the way, if you look back at the budget, not a bit of
help from the other side. In our committees we did. But when it came to
the floor, you’ll remember, and go back and look. And so, when you’re
trying to deal with a $3 to $4 billion deficit, with no help from the
other side, you do the best you possibly can. And that was what was
done. Today is different. Today we make choices. Then, there were
limited choices.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have the floor, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor unless the gentleman is making a point, a
point of order inquiry. The gentleman may say this inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I was wondering if, just because the Speaker’s enjoying
this chitchat, does that require me, as a member of the House, to also
enjoy it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not by any means. Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, would Representative Glazier yield for another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, I’m not going to yield, but not because, but
because I’m trying to listen to what Representative Dixon just had to
say. And I think our discussion about what happened in 2009 and trying
to compare it to what’s happening in 2014 really
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The only, Representative Glazier, the question is whether or not the
gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may speak on the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Just to put things in perspective. Let’s go back before the
recession, 2003, 4, 5, 6, 7, all pre-recession. And the basic structural
problem that we have now corrected, but was there in 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 is
that for those five budgets in a row this assembly passed budgets that
doubled the increase in population plus inflation. So, if that increase
in a particular year was 4%, the assembly decided that we would increase
spending 8%. When it was 5% population plus inflation, we increased it
10%. And when you do that five years in a row, you get yourself in a
mess. And, thank goodness, the last three years we have taken prudent,
fiscal steps to build our reserves, to get spending in line, and to get
our tax policy where it’s not based where it was for those 5, 6, 7, 8
years on inordinate taxes on the poor through the sales tax.

sixth term i don't think that i have actually spoken on that passage of
the budget before  but as i listened to this debate it occurred to me we
often talk about the glass b and half full vs glass b and half empty and
i have listened to the ?? of the budget.It seems that the only thing
that they can criticize is the glass shape it's not even in there it's
few little small things that we may have chosen to do a little bit
differently i do think it's worth and i try to respect the fact that
speaker has assigned me and i ll take the responsibilities on finance
house of the side very seriously ?? there are things needs to be
addressed.The gentlemen from Haywood stood up and he talked about jobs
and now the jobs have changed,i just wanna share you a number.According
to  the bureau of labor statistics ?? North Carolinian's went to work
which is the highest number in the history of state of North Carolina
were people working in any time of the history of state in North
Carolina ?? currents of these remarks would say were the labor forces is
smaller.According to the bureau of labor statistics that's correct,I
don't know why i guess people from substantial ?? they may actually
retire ?? yes that's unfortunate.This history of assembly in the past
four years ?? getting people what they needs in orders of able to live
up to their fullest ?? again this ill end up this part of remarks.The
gentlemen from Haywood talked about more folks go to work in this budget
and our priority ?? going to work.I just shared the April 2011
unemployment rate and Haywood county was 9.8 percent,the most recent
number showing up 5 percent,Jackson county with 9 percent and in 2011
it's 5.2 percent and ? county was 14.3 percent it's 8 and a half person
today,
Speaker Changes: Before allowed to talk about ?? because we do not let
the extend the ?? credit.Let me talk little bit about that.In 2007 a
different majority of the house in substitute ?? and i think they have
good prohibitions when they did so.One of those intentions was to
address the North Carolina fax code was ??  provided success,provided B
in able to move ahead because the more you earn and listen i m talking
about my rich folks here because our tax break was in so where near 20
mark started painting tax rate higher in state we did have earned income
tax credit.In 2012 because we not have addressed the tax,
Speaker Changes: Mr.Speaker,
Speaker Changes: Representative ?? please state you purpose,
Speaker Changes: ?? this gentlemen makes status point,
Speaker Changes: By earning some tax credit in this budget,
Speaker Changes: The underlying tax policy i thing it has been debated
by several people on the floor.The income tax credit has been brought up
by almost 2 dozen over the course  across last 8 hours of debate,the
gentlemen may proceed,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.Speaker and quickly proceed what we have
done is to make steps to make sure  that you can earn more income in the
state and ever before,before your subject happened to have any other tax
by the state  even increased the child's credit lower income.We tried to
take steps that is appropriate to help citizens regardless of their
economic conditions i wont even the speaker was ?? let me personally

To vote on. This budget which sets the minimum starting salary for
teachers at $33,000 per year and does provide an average of 5% raise for
school teachers, one of my very distinguished colleague points out, not
everybody gets 5%, that's what average means. Some get more, some get
less. This budget provides $1,000 salary increase, not a one time bonus,
a salary increase for most state employees, and there's benefits on top
of that, which puts it somewhere around $1,250. Is that enough for many
of our state employees, how hard they work? And as Representative Dobson
pointed out yesterday, that many are in harm's way. No. But is it more
than they've been getting? Yes. It's a step in the right direction. I
could go through a long list of things, but I wanted to stand up on the
floor and let Representative Dollar and Representative Burr and
Representative Johnson and all the chairs of the Appropriations
Committee and all the members that have worked, both sides of the aisle.
This is a good budget, this is a manageable budget, this is a budget
that shows that we have priorities on educating our citizens and on
lifting our state up and moving forward. I would urge you. I would urge
you not to peek around the corners hoping you can find something bad,
but to look at this good bill that's before you and vote for it. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you ladies and gentlemen of the House. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Wilkins, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the budget bill, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the budget as amended. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday, Representative Duane Hall
said this is your budget, and I was watching him and noted that he was
clearly looking toward the other side of the aisle, and that meant to me
that I thought he was talking to the entire majority. I'm not sure that
was who he needed to be talking with. I believe he should have been
talking with the Senior Appropriations Chair and the other big chairs.
Make not mistake about it, this is not a committee function budget, and
I can speak to it mainly from the point of view of NER since that's the
subcommittee on which I serve. We had one meeting, we partially reviewed
the Senate budget, we were told we would meet the next day to continue
our budget work and we didn't meet. And day three we me and we were
presented the Cliff Notes version of the budget, that part pertains to
NER. We met a good portion of that day and had a chance to offer
amendments and then the budget was voted out of committee. I will never
say that that process was something brought on us by Chairs Murry and
West. It's my full belief that the budget product came down from the big
chairs and was handed over with the instruction to move it. Now, I don't
know what that meant in your Appropriations Subcommittee, but I'll tell
you what it meant in NER. For one thing, it meant that Representative
Langdon, with his 10 years of NER experience, didn't get much of a
chance to input what was in that portion of the budget. It meant that
Representative Reives, 10 years NER experience, no chance. It meant that</p>

Representative Wilkins, with probably much less thinking capacity than
those other two, didn't get a chance to really input the NER budget. And
then yesterday on the floor Chairman Dollar, a friend of mine, a

for this budget. Well, I was ready to start soldiering a few days back

never got that opportunity. So Representative Dollar, if I may, and to
all the big chairs, I will tell you that your process from my point of
view was poor but you didn't invent it. I arrived here in 2005 and I've
got to tell you that with democrats in charge in 2007 the process was
just as bad and I got just as little opportunity to input that budget in
NER as I did this one. To another point, some folks in my caucus have
chosen to support this budget and I've heard it and you've heard it,
everybody-, not everybody, some folks around the building say, &quot;oh
they are a totally divided caucus.&quot; No, I'll tell you what we are.
We're a totally diverse caucus and I will defend every one of those
folks who cast a yea vote yesterday and I will defend their right to do
exactly what they did. Now, to our big chairs, I say it's your turn to
soldier on. You know what comes next. You've got to be more than
obstinate Senate. Please get in there and soldier on and represent this
House. No I didn't vote for this yesterday, I don't plan to vote for it
today, but I have the right to ask you to soldier on. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Representative Wilkins yield for one quick question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Wilkins, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You do not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I speak a second time on the-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the budget as amended a second
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A couple points. First, the process is what the process is. We have 87
amendments in the full Appropriations Committee. A few were withdrawn, a
few were ruled out of order, a few, many passed. To say that there is no
process for changing the budget is just, doesn't fit the facts. But I
want to ask you to do a thought experiment. I would like to appeal to
those who voted no to consider this thought experiment. Suppose,
counter-factually, that we had a republican senate that had adopted the
budget they had adopted. That wasn't counter-factual, that's true. But
suppose that this body was majority democratic. And suppose you had to
come up with a budget to submit to the Senate in a divided House. I
submit that the budget that you have before right today, with a few
minor exceptions on social policy, is probably exactly the budget you
would have presented if you were in the majority today. Please admit it
and vote for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Dollar a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, you said something a few minutes ago about the
lottery money and I want to be clear on this. I got from what you said
that the funds, that 106 million dollars will be coming from the lottery
whether they raise it or not. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, let me explain it. The funds that are put into the budget from the
lottery are committed from the lottery to the budget. So if their sales
do not</p>

<p id="105:00">
Grow quite as much as they anticipate that those sales will grow based
on their formulas, based on their professional judgement that they have
given to us, then we, the state, will still take its dollar figure from
the lottery. And that is currently the way it operates, it is operating
no different than the way it has operated. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Another
question, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] From what I'm hearing then, is that
in effect if that money is not raised because of the increase in
advertising, that the money is still coming to support the teachers in
the amount that you put in the budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is
correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Another follow up, then. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
how is that money made up if it doesn't come in at the amount that was
supposed to have been raised was not raised. What's going to be cut as a
result of that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] They would have to take it out of
their prizes at some point in time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But, as you know,
you've looked at, I'm sure you've looked at the lottery, and
particularly if you've looked at it in detail, you know that for a
number of years we've actually been getting, you know we always get
these extras that come in. Particularly over the past number of years
we've kind of gotten a low figure. We have, we are very confident, in
fact there was some thought to say, OK let's just tell the lottery we
want another $100 million and do it that way, but we felt that it was
appropriate to talk to the lottery and say give us your professional
assessment, your professional judgement on what you could do to increase
revenues from the lottery for education because it is supposed to be the
education lottery. And I think a number of our members have expressed
concern over the years that, as you recall when the lottery was first
passed, I believe the promise was 34, 35% of the gross revenues of the
lottery would come to education in the state, and of course as you are
well aware, we're now down in the mid-20's in terms of the actual
percentage of gross receipts that are coming to education, and I think
that has concerned a number of people that if we are going to have the
lottery and it is going to be sold as an education lottery then it
should be, we should have those funds coming in. It should be going to
education. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the budget a second time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You did the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair apologizes,
this is the first time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And this will probably be the
only time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the
House, this has been a long and grueling fight and I will admit to you
that you have done a great job on the other side because you took what
came to you and sort of tried to straighten folks out on the other side.
I just hope maybe some way you can stick with it, but that remains to be
seen. But let me correct two things before I get into that.
Representative Dollar in his remarks on laying my amendment on the table
stated that I had rated the money from Jdig and that had taken it out. I
did not take the money out, Representative Dollar. That money was
changed from non-recurring, from recurring to non-recurring, which left
the money in there for this year, which meant that the money was still
there and that you'd have to come back and put it back in next year. So
we didn't take the money out there. The second thing, the other thing
was the $17 million comes from your estimate of the monies needed ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Shaw the Chair would remind the member that he is
debating an amendment that has already been disposed of and should get
back to ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm doing that to get to my point in the
budget, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Speaker. I'm just trying to get that cleared
up because I don't want. But let me say this about this budget. It's a
budget that could have been much better had we had the opportunity to do
the things that we needed to do on that on this side. The budget could
have been much better if there had been total cooperation between both
sides of this. There has been no way that we could've put</p>

… to things unless we came in and there was an idea that we have got
what we need, we don’t need any more ideas on this, and basically every
amendment except some amendments that really didn’t affect the budget to
that extent were really ruled out of order or were really voted down or
laid on the table, all of these things, and that’s one of the reasons I
think when we talk about the process, the process has not been… The one
thing I liked about the process that we had when we did it, we kept it
open. We really kept it open. The committees met, they got their targets
and they went within their targets. We had the full appropriations
committee meetings. If we had to run over, we ran over. We didn’t rush
anything at all and that’s how we worked at it. This wasn’t done that
way. I walked in one morning and found the budget on my chair, then I
went to committee meeting and we talked about it in committee, and then
we came to the floor on it. I don’t think we had really enough time to
come back and really do the things that we needed to do. I’m going to
right now – I did it yesterday – I’m going to vote against this budget
and see what happens. We know that you’re going to pass it. There’s no
question about it. Even if we had folks on our side who ??, there’s no
question in my mind that you’re going to pass this budget with or
without us, so what I’m doing is I’m going to vote against the budget to
give you an opportunity to try to do something a little bit better than
what you’ve already got out there, for you might be able to get a little
bit more money for the teachers, you might be able to get a little bit
more money for state employees, so in the conference committee that’s
coming up, you have that opportunity to do it. I’m going to vote no
right now and see what comes out of that conference committee, and if
anything comes out of that conference committee, there’s the possibility
that some of us over here who are voting no may change our minds, but
right now we are just not satisfied with the process, we are not
satisfied with the fact that better things could have been done, and we
are moving from that point. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Iler,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Normally I don’t
speak on the budget but I heard a lot of information thrown around. I
want very briefly to give you two numbers – little math problems. If
you’ll divide the amount of lottery funds that apparently appear in the
budget, the maximum amount, you’ll see it’s three quarters of one
percent of the budget. All this debate about the lottery is over three
quarters of one percent of the budget, and the funds apparently are
guaranteed. Another math problem, we talked about tax increases, tax
decreases. I got here just in time, 2009. In fact next week
Representative Gill and I have an anniversary of five years. I got here
just in time to vote on the final – vote on the budget – and I voted
against that budget. It had a tax increase to hardworking families and
to middle class families – one percent sales tax increase – and a
surcharge on anyone who paid income taxes. Someone said “high rollers”
but I think it was anyone who paid income taxes in my recollection,
which five years at my age could be faulty. Since then, in 2011, in
three years, that sales tax expired in 2011, much to the consternation
of then the minority and the Governor at that time, and a family of
four, you take the billion dollars a year and save the families across
this state, divide that by somewhat less than ten million people, you
get 100 dollars a person. If the average family of four in three years
has saves 12 hundred dollars on that one penny – 12 hundred dollars – so
keep that in mind when you’re talking about a hundred dollar problem for
families or whatever, it’s 12 hundred dollars, it’s divided out over
three years, and that’s the savings an average family of four, everybody
that buys anything, the average is 12 hundred dollars. Just two little
math problems, perspective. That three quarter of one percent is the
lottery we’re talking about. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Avila, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill
as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill

then send us to do battle with the senate. It would be much, much easier
for us to do battle with the senate if we had you with us, because you
could reinforce with the senate what you feel is important, the part
that you do like, and by all means be vocal on the part that you don't
like. But for us to go to support our budget against the senate would
not carry quite the power if you would guarantee that you're interested
in what we're trying to do, in the approach and direction that we're
trying to take for the citizens of North Carolina, and I would implore
you to go to battle with us.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the House. We've had
a tremendous debate and I will keep this very short. I do want to remind
the body that we have utilized lottery funds before for teacher pay as
we had mentioned in 2010, the amount increased from the lottery to
teacher salaries was 121 million dollars that year, and no one seemed to
raise a question about that. I would also note that as has been
mentioned previously we've had some challenging years in the past, that
members of the then-majority had to deal with. I would also remind them
of course that in 2011 we had to deal with a 2.5 billion dollar hole in
our budget, and we dealt with that, Didn't complain, we dealt with it.
But I want to turn to where we are today, and here is where we are
today. I believe that in all of the debate that I've heard on all sides,
that the fundamental truth is that this is a sound budget. This budget
does provide for the needs of our citizens. This budget does fund our
highest priorities. This budget does provide a five percent increase for
teachers and career pathways to move forward in how we're gonna
compensate teachers in the future. This budget does provide salary
increases for employees, risk reserves for Medicaid, expansions in
critical areas that had been identified from guardianship on over to
coal ash. You name it, we've tried to address the needs of our state.
And I thought it was very interesting a non-partisan group, Public
School Form, in analyzing the three budgets before the state at this
time, the governor's, the Senate and the House, said that the House's
budget was the most promising path forward. Members of this House, I
believe that this budget before you today is the most promising path
forward. I appreciate deeply the bipartisan support that we received
yesterday on this budget, and I'd ask for everyone's vote again, on our
budget today. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and once again I appreciate the
opportunity to speak and I think we have about, we may finish about five
minutes early if I'm the last speaker than what we projected, so I
appreciate the speaker making sure we had a second day to debate, and we
got some other bills done, and also some other amendments done. But I
wanted to tell you a story about four people, and they're four people
you probably know, and they're probably important in all of our lives,
and we probably all met them and worked with them and had them work for
us. This is a story about four people named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody
and Nobody. There was an important job to be done, the budget, and
everybody was asked to do it, the legislature. Everybody was sure
Somebody would do it. Anybody could've done it. Did</p>

?? do it. Somebody got angry about that, because it was everybody's job.
Everybody thought anybody could do it, but nobody realized that
everybody wouldn't do it. It ended up that everybody blamed somebody
when nobody did what everybody could do. We're not at the end of this
process, and so we all still have an opportunity to do what we should do
to make these provisions in this budget that are better than the senate
be adopted. And representative Wilkins I already talked about the hope,
and I talked about it yesterday, that after going through a better
process than the senate, that you would stand fast on what you worked,
and the product that you created, as opposed to what the senate sent
over here. A lot of ways to describe what came in here, but again, at
least we had a process. I hope that everybody does what they can do,
anybody will do what they're supposed to do, and that somebody will
stand up for what we did in this conference committee. Although I'm not
voting for this budget today, and I can't recommend people to vote for
it: it's not the final product and I don't want to send the wrong
signal: that I'm satisfied. I do know it's better than what the senate
did, but there's a lot of work to be done and we don't want to send the
wrong message. But again, I do ask that you value the work you've done
and work hard in the conference committee to make improvements on what
we have so it'll be something that comes back that I could support.

 Regrettably no, mister speaker.  [Speaker Changes] The gentleman
probably received bipartisan support for that position. Further
discussion, further debate. Have now the question before the house is

opposed vote 'no'. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lot

will be no skeleton session, it's not necessary, we will reconvene.
