under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh say can you see, by the dawn&#39;s early light. What so proudly we
hailed at the twilight&#39;s last gleaming. Who&#39;s broad stripes and
bright stars through the perilous fight, o&#39;er the ramparts we
watched were so gallantly streaming. And the rockets red glare, the
bomb&#39;s bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag
was still there. Oh say, does that start-spangled banner yet wave,
o&#39;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

of the United States, and do you solemnly and sincerely swear of affirm
that you will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the state of North
Carolina and to the Constitutional Powers and authorities which are or

Congratulations. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Congratulations to each and every one
of you, Senators. You and your guests may now be seated. 39 Senators
being present and having taken the Oath of Office, I declare a quorum
present and qualified. The Senate will now proceed with the election of
a President Pro Tempore, established by the Constitution of North
Carolina, and who shall serve until the expiration of the term of office
as Senator. The Chair declares nominations are in order for the office
of President Pro Tempore of the 2015 Senate. Senator Apodaca, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Make a nomination. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, you have the floor for your nomination.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members, I’d like to take
this time to nominate Phil Berger for President Pro Tempore of the North
Carolina Senate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Senator Brown,
for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, to second
a nomination and make a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor,
Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President,
members, it’s with great honor for me for the third time to rise and
second a nomination of Senator Phil Berger to the President Pro Tempore
of the 2015 North Carolina Senate. I further move that the nominations
be closed and Senator Berger’s nomination be accepted by acclamation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion is that the nominations be closed and that
the nomination of Senator Philip E. Berger as President Pro Tempore of
the 2015 Senate be accepted for acclamation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Apodaca, you have the floor to speak on the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, members. Today is a day many of us that have
been here sometime all think back to our first time here, and I look
around and I see so many new faces, and I see a few old faces like
Rucho, Hartsell, and they keep getting older as time goes on, but it is
always assuring to look over to my right and when he’s here see Senator
Berger. Senator Berger has been with us since, goodness, what was it?
2001, Bob, he came in? He’s been a fixture here, and it’s a pleasure for
me to nominate him for our President Pro Tempore for the third time, and
somebody was talking to me about “Well what are you going to say when
you nominate Phil?” and I said “Well after the third time, I’m running
out of things to say, but one thing…” and they said “Well how is Phil
Berger to work with?” I have never worked with someone as steady as Phil
Berger. What you see is what you get, and he never changes, and you know
where you stand, and he’ll listen to what anybody has to say, and many
times he’ll keep listening and listening and listening, and then he’ll
speak and he’ll speak, speak and speak, but that’s another story… but
the most fascinating thing I thought of over the last two years are the
Monday night events we have seen occasionally held here at the building,
and it was one particular Monday night we had a group of school
teachers, and they really weren’t happy. I’m used to that though. I’m
married to a teacher; I know how that goes. But we sat down… and we were
going to dinner that night, as a matter of fact… but we sat down with
those teachers for

  <p id="20:00">Well over an hour and Senator Berger sat right there and listened to
every word they had to say, as a gentleman, calmly, much more so than I,
he spoke with them and he continued to talk with them and they left that
meeting, maybe they didn&#39;t agree with what was said, but they left
that meeting feeling like they had been heard, and I don&#39;t think we
can give a complement more than that to the leader of North Carolina
Senate. I think every member in this room either have or will have the
opportunity to sit down with Senator Berger and you&#39;ll have his
undivided attention and he&#39;ll have a conversation with you, but as
you look at Phil Berger the man, he represents family and his family
means more to him than anything else in the world and I can attest to
that, and these beautiful grandchildren. I don&#39;t know how many they
have now, they seem to have one every couple of years, so I think
they&#39;re up to a dozen, but anyway, and he&#39;s looking forward to
more children. But I have formed a special bond with Senator
Berger&#39;s wife, Pat. Pat&#39;s a lovely person, but Pat and I have
this in common, we do all the work, he gets all the glory, so we do have
that special bond, but all that being said, there&#39;s no greater man
in this building and no better person for this job than Phil Berger, Sr.
and it&#39;s with pleasure and honor I nominate him today to be our
President Pro Tempore. Thank you, Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Senator Apodaca. Is there any further discussion or debate? If not,
those in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, no. The ayes have it and the chair declares Senator Phillip E.
Berger of Rockingham County unanimously elected to the office of
President Pro Tempore of the 2015 Senate. Senator Apodaca, Senator
Brown, Senator Harrington, Senator Rucho, Senator Blue and Senator
McKissick are appointed as a committee to escort President Pro Tempore
elect Phillip E. Berger to the well of the Senate to receive the oath of
office. [Blank audio - 02:21-02:50] [Applause] Senator Apodaca, you have
the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President,
members of the Senate, it is my pleasure to present to you the President
Pro Tempore elect of the 2015 Senate, Phillip E. Berger. [Applause]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Apodaca. The escort committee may
return to your seats. The sergeant at arms may escort Senator
Berger&#39;s son Kevin and his granddaughter Emily and grandson Jackson
to the well of the Senate to stand with the President Pro Tempore elect.
The Chief Justice Mark Martin will administer the oath. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Do you, Phil Berger, solemnly swear that you will support the
Constitution and laws of the United States so help you God? Do you
solemnly and sincerely swear that you will be faithful and bear true
allegiance to the state of North Carolina and to the constitutional
powers and authorities that are and may be established to the government
thereof, and that you will endeavor to support, maintain and defend the
Constitution and laws of said state, not inconsistent with the
Constitution of the United States to the best of your ability? Do you
solemnly and sincerely swear that you will faithfully discharge your
duties as President Pro Tempore of the 2015 General Assembly to the best
of your skill and ability so help you God. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do, so
help me God. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Congratulations. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank

  <p id="25:00">[Applause] Senators and guests you may be seated. Congratulations,
Senator Berger, the chair has the great honor of recognizing you to
address the Senate and our guests. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman, Mr. President. Thank you ladies and gentlemen for the warm
welcome. Thank you to my colleagues for once again entrusting me to
serve as the President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate. I look
forward to working with each and every one of you as we go forward
today, committed to do great things for the people of this state. To the
families of our members, I think you for sharing your loved ones with
us. It is a great sacrifice for family members, for you to have someone
serving the state of North Carolina in this chamber, and we appreciate
it more than you know. I&#39;d also like to thank a few other folks.
First I&#39;d like to thank my family, Pat, my wife, Kevin, my son,
Jackson and Emily, my grandchildren, for being here today. Like many of
you they have had to sacrifice a great deal for the time away from home,
the time away from family, so I thank them for that and they know how
much I appreciate it. Chief Justice Martin, thank you for participating
in our ceremony today. This is one of the really nice things about
serving in public office and it&#39;s a good thing to have the Chief
Justice of our state Supreme Court help participate in the ceremony.
Lieutenant Governer Forrest, thank you for presiding over the Senate and
thank you for your actions over the past two years and what you&#39;ll
do with us over the next couple of year. I would also like to thank some
folks that were in here but are not here now. Beth Stovall, Miss North
Carolina, I would like to thank her for that wonderful rendition of that
national anthem. I don&#39;t know that there are that many folks in the
state or in the country that can hit those notes, but she did it
magnificently. I&#39;d like to thank Junior Army ROTC Color Guard from
John Modley Morehead High School for participating in the ceremony. It
is gratifying I think for many of us, I know for me, to see young people
that are dedicated to improving their skills in many things, but to see
the precision that those young people were able to march in and handle
the flags the way they did is something that&#39;s great, and they
happen to be from my hometown in Eden, so a good thing. Today marks the
third occasion that I&#39;ve had the honor and the privilege to stand
before you to offer a vision for the work of this body at the start of
the legislative session, and today North Carolina&#39;s future sounds
brighter than it did when I stood before you two years ago and brighter
still than when I stood before you four years ago. Back then when
republicans assumed leadership of the General Assembly for the first
time in more than a century, North Carolina&#39;s unemployment rate
stood at over 10%, the fifth highest in the nation. We faced stagnant
job growth, record multi-billion dollar budget deficits and the
region&#39;s highest tax rates, but in the four years since I first
addressed you, thanks in large part to the hard work of so many people
in this room, we&#39;re seeing positive results. The unemployment rate
has dropped nearly in half, North Carolina businesses have created more
than 263,000 new jobs and the number of people working in North Carolina
has climbed to historic highs and reductions in state income and sales
taxes have put more money in the pockets of hardworking families across
the state. We&#39;re proud of these results from policies driven by what
voters elected us to do. They elected us to balance the state budget,
control the growth of government spending, they elected us to reform our
tax code, reduce the tax burden on families and small businesses. They
elected us to reform public education to improve student outcomes. These
decisions, made in partnership with our House colleagues over the past
four years and with Governor McCrory over the past two years have helped
turn North Carolina around. The changes we have implemented over the
past four years are making our state a better place to build a business
and a better place to live and raise a family. But make no mistake,
there is more to be done.

  <p id="30:00">Be done. Voters have seen the positive direction our state is headed and
have again returned us to continue along the new path we&#39;ve forged.
It&#39;s a great responsibility as we enter our third full session of
implementing a new direction for North Carolina and as we do that we
remain just as dedicated to affecting positive change and every bit as
committed to fulfilling our promises as we were four years ago. In the
coming session, we&#39;ll continue to develop policies that create a
stronger education system, a stronger business climate, with the goal of
sustaining North Carolina&#39;s strong job growth. We&#39;ll continue
working to improve our public schools because we recognize that a great
education not only opens the door to a great future for our children, it
also builds a capable workforce and will attract business to our state,
and we&#39;ll fulfill our important promise to raise starting teacher
pay to $35,000 so that we can attract and retain the best talent in our
classrooms. We&#39;ll explore even more ways to improve the business tax
climate so more jobs can be created and ways to make taxes less
burdensome for our families so regular folks can keep more of their own
money. We&#39;ll renew our efforts to reduce regulatory burdens that
misdirect time and energy toward red tape and bureaucracy and away from
growing businesses and getting people back to work. We&#39;ll continue
to examine ways to make state government smarter and more efficient and
we&#39;ll explore other conservative, common sense policy changes that
will keep North Carolina on the path to prosperity. To my colleagues,
our experience has shown that we can accomplish a great deal when we
work together. Certainly we won&#39;t always agree on every issue and
we&#39;ll have many spirited debates in this chamber in the weeks and
the months ahead, but the most important thing to remember is why each
of us is here. We&#39;re here to increase opportunity for those who are
working hard and doing the best they can to provide for their families.
We&#39;re here to support the entrepreneurs, innovators, small business
owners and job creators who are fueling our economic recovery. We&#39;re
here to provide responsible solutions that improve state government for
our citizens and we&#39;re here to come together to do what&#39;s bets
for North Carolina. If we bear these goals in mind, there&#39;s no doubt
that the change we bring about for our constituents and our state will
be real, will be positive and will be lasting. To the people of North
Carolina, thank you for your support and for the opportunity to serve.
My God bless this body and the people of our state. Thank you.
[Applause] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Berger. We thank you and
your family for the sacrifice that you make for the people of North
Carolina. We thank you for your leadership here in the Senate. Senators,
each day when we&#39;re in session here in the Senate we have a nurse of
the day and today is no exception. Our nurse of the day is Mary Graff or
Raleigh, North Carolina. Nurse Graff, please stand and be recognized.
Thank you for your service to the Senate today. [Applause] The next
order of business to come before the Senate is the adoption of the rules
of procedure by which this body shall govern itself. Senator Apodaca,
for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, to
present a resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I&#39;ve given a draft of the 2015
Permanent Senate Rules to the clerk for filing. The resolution will be
Senate Resolution 1. I move that Senate Resolution 1 be brought before
the Senate for first reading and immediate consideration by the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, so ordered. First reading of the
Senate Resolution, let&#39;s see, do we have a copy up, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a copy up front? First
reading of Senate Resolution 1, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

  <p id="35:00">Is recognized to explain the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. President. Members, new members, this is the first order of business
we always do when we meet on the first day of a session. This year the
rules are pretty much identical to what they have been last year and the
term before. There have been a few minor changes I&#39;d like to go
over, rule two, the change allows the principal clerk to convene the
session in order to recess the session, so what this means is that we
all do not have to be here for the session to go in and we go into
recess, just a simple move to hopefully save us time and be a little
more efficient. Second change, rule 24.1, allows the standard
stipulations when we adjourn or recess so we do not have to repeat each
time the famous saying pursuant to the introduction of bills, the
referral, re-referral of bills, the reading of senatorial statements and
messages from the governor. This will make it, anytime we adjourn that
will be part of the adjournment resolution. You will not get to hear it
each time we adjourn. Item 3, rule 38 is defining what the word bill
means. It applies to resolutions and other filings, as in petitions and
memorials, so it&#39;s just clarifying what bill means. Item 4, it&#39;s
rule 40, this says that we&#39;re not allowed to file bills today on the
first day of session to give us time to get ready. Fifth change, well,
it&#39;s not a change, it&#39;s what&#39;s important to many of us,
local bills will have to be in to staff for drafting before March 3,
2015, they must be filed for introduction by March 11th. Public bills
must go to staff for drafting by March 15, 2015 and they must be filed
for introduction by March 25, 2015. The all important crossover date for
this year will be May 7, 2015. There was another one, Rule 44, item 6,
provides that unless a member of the Senate really wants to object, a
bill may be referred to and presented to the Senate by the bill number
and the short title. If you want to hear it read out in a three page
title, feel free to do that, we&#39;ll stay after session or you can
stay after session and hear it, but that is rule 44, another efficiency
measure, and rule 63 addresses the employment of Senate staff, changes
that conform to the law and practice as they are now employed, and we
had good debate on that, long debate yesterday and I think
everybody&#39;s in good shape with this. Those are the changes to the
rules from last term, and I&#39;ll be happy to try to answer any
questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Blue, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yield
for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If he calls me gentleman, absolutely. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We pull for the same basketball teams. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s not going too well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, on rule
32 it is, we&#39;re adding a committee, the workforce and economic
development committee. Will members be able to man the committee
requests, those who have an interest in serving on this new committee,
before the finalized committee assignments? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
We&#39;ll be happy to hear any requests. Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And let me mention along those lines on committee
requests, we&#39;ll get those out late this afternoon to everybody by
email, the current committee structure, and any questions of anything
thereof feel free to call myself or Elaine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have
any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the adoption of Senate Resolution number 1. We will have one
electronic vote, green button means aye, red button means no. All those
in favor of adoption of Senate Resolution number 1 will vote aye,
opposed will vote no. Ten seconds will be allowed for the voting and the
clerk will record the vote.

Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I rise to place in nomination for Senate President Pro
Tem, Senator Louis Pate&#39;s name. Senator Pate is a man that I
consider a friend, a man that is about duty and about service to others,
duty to the Lord, duty to his wife and family, duty as a father and a
grandfather, and also duty to his country, having flown multiple combat
missions over Vietnam during his tenure in the military. Louis Pate is a
humble man, as we all know, a kind man, and an individual that quietly
speaks his mind, and again, I&#39;m glad to call him friend. He served
his country and he served his state many years over in the House until
he saw the light to come to the Senate and I&#39;m glad he did because
he and I have shared many discussions over the last four years and
I&#39;ve grown to respect this man greatly. So with that, sir, Deputy
Senate Pro Tem nomination, I formally nominate Senator Pate to serve as
the Deputy President Pro Tem in the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Senator Tucker. Senator Wade, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Pate to serve as our Deputy President Pro Tem. I further move that the

elected to the office of Deputy President Pro Tempore of the 2015
Senate. Senator Bingham, Senator Cooke, Senator Rabin, and Senator
Tucker are appointed to escort the Deputy President Pro Tempore elect,
Louis Pate, to the well of the Senate to receive the oath of office.

Yesterday we had a revenue laws meeting, committee, good meeting. In a
great act of bipartisanship and love, one of our minority friends,
Senator Ford, where does he sit now? I know he&#39;s moved up in the
pecking, ??. Senator Ford had on a very good looking tie. I wondered
where he got his class but I met his wife, who is, by the way, from the
southern part of the state, down east really, around Wilson somewhere.
But he always dresses nice. I used to think Senator Daniel, he was the
best dressed but Senator Ford, you&#39;re actually probably a little bit
ahead of Daniel. He had on a great looking tie, not this one, and I told
him that my tie did not look too well with that wonderful pin-striped
Joseph Bank suit that I had on and how good it looked on him, and he had
a similar pin-striped suit yesterday. He took it off right there. I took
that little K-Mart tie off and I laid it down and he put it on, and I
tried to read the label last night, folks, I couldn&#39;t even tell if
it was British or French or German. I don&#39;t know, it was some uptown
place. It certainly wasn&#39;t Joseph Bank, it wasn&#39;t down in that
level and I thought that was a pretty good level but it wasn&#39;t.
Anyway, I want to thank him for this great bipartisan move yesterday and
later on though, Senator, I heard you talking. I overheard you saying,
&quot;Kevin don&#39;t know this but he owes me,&quot; and

will say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no.
The ayes have it. House Joint Resolution 2 passes its third reading and
it will be enrolled. Visitors and guests, it was an honor to be with you
today. It is an honor to be able to stand before you as Lieutenant
Governor of North Carolina and as the President of the Senate and
it&#39;s an honor to serve you on a daily basis in this great state. Two
years ago as we celebrated the 50th anniversary of this legislative
building, I shared my passion with you as an architect for great design
and that this building we stand in today is a modern architectural
masterpiece designed by world-renowned architect Edward Burrel Stone. To
understand the importance that our forefathers placed in the design of
this building, the building&#39;s architect also designed the Kennedy
Center in Washington, DC, Radio City Music Hall and the Museum of Modern
Art in New York City. Many of you, especially the new members here,
today will find yourselves engaged in the frustrating verbal battles
with this building as you sit in tiny block wall offices and as you try
to differentiate one corridor from the next. As an architect, my
appreciation lies in the contextual framework within which it was
designed. To appreciate any building or work of art, we must place
ourselves within the context of its creation. Sometimes within that
context we can understand the story and discover the beauty. This large,
modern was placed amongst a sea of Victorian homes in a small southern
town 50 years ago. The aerial view of it today looks like a spaceship
invaded the capital city, but it was bold and it was courageous and it
was innovative for its time. Other bold and courageous moves of the day
included a scientific and political race to place a man on the moon that
captured America&#39;s imagination and Martin Luther King, Jr.&#39;s I
have a dream speech that captured America&#39;s heart. We all dream big

  <p id="70:00">Dreams.
We all conjure up both courageous and innovative ideas, but those dreams
and ideas must rest upon a solid foundation, just like this building, if
they are to stand the test of time.  What does that foundation look like
in North Carolina?
Two years ago I mentioned that there was much work to be done to relieve
our citizens of the burden of taxation in our great state.  You made the
bold moves and did the hard work to improve our tax foundation.  You
placed more money in the pockets of every tax paying citizen in North
Carolina and you moved our state from 44th in the nation in the business
tax climate to 17th in the nation... Letting the world know that North
Carolina is open for business.
Two years ago I shared the unemployment rate was 9.1% on that day.  You
did the hard work that needed to be done to reduce that unemployment
rate to 6.3% today.  Because of your bold leadership over the past 2
years, oil and natural gas exploration and production are much closer to
reality in North Carolina than they have ever been before.
Two years ago I mentioned that for the first time in modern history, we
have the opportunity to take advantage of technology to transform the
world of education.  Through your leadership, we are right on the verge
of making North Carolina a leader in education innovation.  You followed
through with your prompt promise to increase teacher pay for the first
time in a number of years.  You created the North Carolina education
endowment so that we could invest in excellent teaching. So that we
could strive towards an inspirational goal of having our highest
performing teachers be amongst the highest paid in the nation.  You
focused on the importance of reading for third graders because if our
children can&#39;t read by the third grade, the hill before them is just
too high to climb to succeed in life.  You realized the importance of
the highest standards of education for America so that our students
could compete for jobs anywhere in the world.  You began the process of
investing in digital technology, transformation in our schools. Because
of your innovative leadership and the work with many passionate
education professionals, teachers, parents, businesses, and non-profits,
I believe North Carolina will be the first state in the country to have
every classroom connected to high-speed broadband internet, connected
devices in the hands of every child, and teachers who know how to
leverage this technology to our kids for new frontiers.  When you place
that connected device in the hands of that child you have placed all the
knowledge in the world at their fingertips.  You have placed every book
in the world in their hands.  You have opened up the world of
opportunity and possibility to a child, who perhaps, had no hope.  You
have effectively begun to bridge the socio-economic education divide for
the first time in the history of our nation.
The North Carolina, digital learning plan will enable us to move from a
one size fits all approach to education to customized education for
every child.  To make the transition away from extensive high-stakes
testing to mastering base learning.  To move from static teaching tools
to dynamic digital tools.  To move from class time learning to anywhere,
anytime learning.  To reach children in each and every school in North
Carolina with content and curriculum they have never had access to
before.
My friends, Senators, this plan is not a dream, it is a reality because
of you.  In fact, your bold leadership created the love that established
this transformation and the digital learning plan is a work in progress.
I have a copy of the digital learning plan with me today and when you
leave here today you will all have a copy of that on your desk.  I hope
you will take it and read it.
In order for this plan to be successful, it will take continued courage,
leadership, and investment for the building of a strong foundation.  An
architect knows that a great building starts with a solid foundation.
And a solid foundation starts with a well thought out plan.  And that
plan starts with a vision.
I thank you for being visionaries.   The design of this building
envisions the future where the leader of our state would come together,
despite their differences, to work for the common good.  They designed a
building open to the people, slowly diverted to the legislative branch
in government.  So Senators and Representatives can work along side each
other in close proximity to solve these challenges of our state.  We
have new challenges that face us in North Carolina in 2015. But as
designers of North Carolina&#39;s future, we will tackle these
challenges with boldness and courage.  We will build a strong foundation
for our future in design in North Carolina that our children and
grandchildren will be proud of for many years.  A great trust has been
placed in you by the people of our state and I know each of you are up
to the task of ensuring that that trust is not breached.  I look forward
to working with you and getting to know the new Senators over the next 2
years.  And as always, you have my word that I will preside over this
body with all...
