Good morning. We’ll call our meeting to order. First we’ll recognize the
pages. Representing the Senate, Caine Brown, sponsored by Senator
Meredith. Libby Dalton, sponsored by Senator Jackson. The House pages we
have Justin  Smith, Ardale County, Brawley; William Jenkins,
Mecklenburg, Schaffer; Daniel Keith, Wake County, Murry; Erin McDonald,
Mecklenburg, Alexander; and Melissa Pulley, Nash County, sponsored by
Representative Richardson. Are Sergeant at Arms are Priat Heinz from the
House, and Charles Goodwin. From the Senate is Leslie Wright and Steve
Wilson.
If you’re looking at your agenda you’ll see we have a lot of speakers
today. If we would, write down your questions or hold your questions
‘til the end of the presentation. At this time, I’ll call on Mr. Allen
Briggs. Allen. If you will hold on a minute...Sorry about that. It’s
still early. Donny Charleston. Donny was all ready to go and he couldn’t
hardly wait. Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair and good morning members of the committee. Today my
comments refer to the presentation you’ll be hearing throughout the week
on non-profits that received ?? from the Department of Health and Human
Services. Today you’ll primarily be hearing presentations from North
Carolina food banks. In your packets you have a handout that’s
approximately three pages long. The front page is title the Joint
Conference Committee Report. This handout is essentially an excerpt from
two different documents, one being the Joint Conference Committee Report
and the second being an actual excerpt from the 2012 Appropriations Act.
If you look at page two of that document, it lists the 18 agencies that
are identified of being recipients of appropriations through special
provisions. These are agencies that received funding as past...i’m
sorry, received pass through funding through the Department of Health
and Human Services and does not include all agencies that DHHS has a
relationship with. It only includes agencies that have or received
funding as a function of special provisions that were inserted in the
budget at some point in time. AS you can see, the total amount these
agencies received in totals about $9.1 million. If you turn to the next
page of that handout, it actually show the actual special provisions
from last year’s 2012 Appropriations Act. Section 10.19A, the purpose of
the special provision was to move these appropriations from the
recurring budget to the non recurring budget in an effort to ensure
annual review of these special appropriations by the General Assembly.
Additionally, the special provision requires a 10% by these entities to
the state funding they receive and require annual reporting on those
funds to the General Assembly. You have those reports in your binders
and they should follow this handout. Those reports include information
about the mission of these entities, the services they provide, the
outcome measures, budget information and the description of the 10%
match for the state funds that they receive. As I indicated earlier,
today you’ll be hearing from the North Carolina food banks regarding the
funding that they receive as pass through through the Department of
Health and Human Services. Mr. Chairman, that concludes my remarks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Donny. Now we’re ready for Allen Briggs.</p>

North Carolina not going to be helpful if you look into materials that
shows the territories and a member object to members of the association
of Food Banks and then during the fiscal year 2011 &amp; 12 North
Carolina is the American Food Banks distributed more than 133,000,000
pounds of nutritious food and other Christian clubs equivalent of nearly
911,000,000 meals that banks provide this valuable community service to
our network which surged almost 1.6 million north Carolinians in every
county in the state we have a network of over 2700 agency partners
throughout the state in the sense if your vision us were more like a
wholesaler and looking a business model where the Sam's club and Costco
we're gonna make sense to you when receiving food from these various
sources and they believed by the city out that your local communities to
large network of faith based nonprofit orders the soup kitchens and
shelters are dead trees are a burden to shelters and so forth all aware
that food is distributed in your community max  or the product response
to homer we're valuable businesses in our local communities collectively
our members employ over 300 employees around the state we maintain large
fleets of vehicles warehouses we do have the infrastructure is already
in place thanks for their efforts and support from our local businesses
and communities where most important facets of my work is if we utilized
volunteers officially singing group you'll ever see last year we had
over 66,000 north Carolinian volunteer our Food Banks but contributed
nearly 370,000 hours of volunteer time to support our work to schools
from across the state cleans out some like the school's science and math
and German soldiers or leg as relationship with Arthur bank in
Fayetteville businesses that the system, Springer management teams in
the volunteer to Food Banks have led collaborative effort shared
activity and get to know each other better churches all across the state
we couldn't survive without getting the ball and cheers becoming just
not initiate slides and source you can imagine the promise that uttered
generously introduced the motion, money at a different set of the year
in your state funding leverage those that support and maybe the best
example of public private partnerships you'll see our banks use the
spider race but small that cares to get the food purchased the state
funds are approaching the is that work of corporate partners donors and
volunteers breaks from banks extremely efficient approximately 95¢ of
every dollar that comes into the bank is correctly including final table
for those of our neighbors should be a quick history of state funding
and 2011 &amp; 12 fiscal year that also only appropriate in $5.77
million to the states Food Banks with reports of last year and 2012

provided courts and legislatures Credit Wire Food Banks will send four
we rely on donated food that comes in many shapes and forms may not
always be what we're lacking an individual food and we can only scalpel
most basic staples to those donations in particular that state funding
allows us to buy really valuable products such as high quality protein
and fresh produce which are usually order to get in more expensive the
benefits are many full of feeding are malnourished children are you sure
they come to school they learn and make good use of tax dollars go to
the education writers and meals to seniors reduces health problems for
them investment means lower healthcare costs are estimates state funding
is just one part of the funding stream for fruit ranch but effectively
leverage as corporate and private funds increase our capacity and

[Speaker changes.]...with that, Mister Chairman, I would recognize Peter
???????, the CEO and President of the Food Bank of central and eastern
North Carolina. We may need a little technical help here. Peter has a
brief video to give you a look inside of a food bank.
[Speaker changes.]  Thank you, Alan.
[Speaker changes.] Good mornin'...my name is Peter ???????, I'm
President and CEO of the Food Bank of central and eastern North
Carolina. Actually alongside me is board member, Barbara
Morales-Burke?????, Vice President of Health Policy and Chief Compliance
Officer with Blue Cross/Blue Shield North Carolina...who will be making
some remarks later. I'd like to thank the committee for this opportunity
for myself and my colleagues to share our work.  The majority of my
presentation actually will be in the form of a video, which I'd like to
show shortly.  Before doing so, I'd like to perhaps provide what I think
would best describe the value of the monies from the state through one
of the partner agencies, a member agency...a quote that I received from
them. Chatham Outreach Alliance, a food pantry in Chatham County has
seen a dramatic increase in the number of families needing our services.
 &quot;The food that we receive through the state has been a tremendous
help to us. We are always looking for ways to stretch our resources and
donor's dollars.  The food received from this program allows us to
concentrate our funds elsewhere. A cut in this program would cause us to
look at cutting back not only the choices we provide but the amount of
food we can distribute. This, in turn, would hurt the nutritional needs
of our families, especially the children and elderly...46% of our client
load.&quot; That's sort of perhaps a typical story of one of our partner
agencies for our colleagues here in terms of again the value of the
monies provided by the state. The video I'm about to show highlights the
work of The Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina and our
operations in the 34 counties that we service; however, we believe that
it's fairly transferable to a number of the food banks in the state and
perhaps will give you an opportunity...a sense and feel and visual of
what goes on daily at our facilities and certainly if you have not
visited one of our facilities, we'd gladly like to host you and
encourage you to come along to see our work.  With that, I'd like to
show the video. (INAUDIBLE.)

Peter, if you don't mind, we need to move to the next until we get our
audio straightened out. At this time, Food Bank of Albemarle, Liz [??].
Turn your mic on, Liz.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There we go. I brought some of the examples of the products that our
food banks use your state appropriation funds for that help augment the
diets of the hungry people that we serve each and every day. Something
that is tangible for them because, without this food, they would have to
skip more meals than they're already sacrificing and for the Food Bank
of the Albemarle these resources would have to be made up elsewhere as
with our peers. But how do you make up a million meals just for 15
counties in Northeastern North Carolina? We're constantly looking at the
resources that we have and looking to identify new resources to replace
existing opportunities because there are more people to feed on a daily
basis than we have the resources to meet. So when we look at this
funding, we look at it as helping us maintain the resources that we can
continue to provide the most basic form of food to bridge the gap for
the people that seek assistance. In our region, we serve over 61,000
food insecure people, and that represents, 33% of the people who seek
assistance from our food bank and our partner agencies are children
under the age of five, 8% of those are seniors over the age of 65, and
44% of the people who are seeking assistance from a poverty relief
partner and the Food Bank of the Albemarle are actually working poor.
They're not making enough money to pay the bills and buy groceries
consistently to put on the table. Putting gas in the car to go to work
is becoming more and more of a struggle for folks. So how do they
balance, when their income is not increasing and keeping pace with the
need to provide groceries? They, in turn, will go to lesser, unhealthy
choices in order to maintain a full belly when their dollars have to
stretch as far as they can. Your dollars enable the food bank to be able
to augment those diets with healthy, nutritious food so that they have a
choice and can provide balanced, nutritional food for their families.
We're not using your funds to provide candy. We're not using your funds
to provide soda-pop. We are providing resources in a nutritional
balanced diet, trying to address the issues of hunger as well as
nutritional health. We partner with many, we have many collaborations
outside of the State Association. We work with community partners such
as Cooperative Extension Service, we work with our local health
departments to provide screening and opportunities to educate the
clientele that are coming in to help them gain access to federal
programs, educate them about food stamps and WICK and other resources
that might benefit their family and help lift them up and help them
survive and thrive. With your resources, we help bridge the gap of those
missing meals. So as I look to you and I look to our sister food banks,
your one piece of the pie for us. We look to the private sector for
contributions, we look</p>

to purchase about finding accounts for only 10% of the food industry as
Alan said 70% of the disputed a stunning and but it's a critique of 10%

Joe Sam Queen was there to make a visit. I want to take a side bar just
to say if you haven't had an opportunity to visit either your food bank
or one of the pantries that's in your area, please do so. We would be
happy to help arrange that visit for you. It is incredibly inspirational
for two reasons. One is to watch the people who are walking through
those doors and knowing that they're doing so with having to—as we call
the mountain pride—having to put it aside to realize that if you need
the help you need to go forward to get it for the sake of your family.
And the other, again, is to see the incredible volunteer effort that
goes into helping their neighbors. The numbers that we're giving you
today only tell part of the story. I wanna tell you a short story about
a pantry director who was sitting in her office one day, and she was
looking out the window, and she noticed a man pull into the parking lot.
He parked his car, got out, walked partway up to the door, hesitated,
turned back, went back and sat in his car. He did that twice. So she
finally got up from her desk and she went out into the parking lot and
she said, &quot;Sir, is there something I can do to help you?&quot; The
man broke down into tears and he said, &quot;I used to walk through
those doors as a volunteer and as a donor. Four months ago, I lost my
job. I've run through my entire savings. I just paid my mortgage, so I
won't lose my home, and I have  no money left to put food on the table
for my kids. Walking through those doors to ask you for help is the
hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.&quot; Those are the kind
of people that are depending on us, people who, when they're back on
their feet, will walk through those doors again as a volunteer and as a
donor. But right now, until this economy improves, they're depending on
us. We have a responsibility to them. We are appreciative that the state
legislature has been our partner alongside us. That ten percent that you
provide to us through those funds leverages 70% of the donations that we
receive. So, thank you very much for partnering with us and we hope we
can count on you to continue to do so. Thank you for the opportunity to
speak today. That concludes my remarks, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you [INAUDIBLE]  Today [INAUDIBLE]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning everybody and thank you very much for the opportunity to be
here today. Second Harvest Food Bank in Charlotte serves 19 counties, 14
of which are located in North Carolina. To be sure I don't miss any of
them, I've listed them, so bear with me, but we have Anson, Burke,
Cabarrus, Catawba, Cleveland, Gaston, the southern part of Ardale,
Lincoln, Mecklenburg, , Montgomery, Rowan, Rutherford, Stanley and
Union. And then we also have five counties in South Carolina.  Within
our service territory last year, we distributed over 38 million pounds
of food and other essential household items. Almost 30 million of those
pounds were in North Carolina. The state funds that you all provided to
us are very, very important because they're used to purchase highly
nutritious foods that are not always donated in the quantities we need
to meet all of the needs of our region. This past year, with your help
in our service territory, we were able to purchase 1.2 million pounds of
nutritious food, and we are very, very grateful for that. Within our
14-county region in North Carolina, we have almost 378,000 people living
at or below the poverty level. The saddest part of that for me every
day, day in and day out, is that number includes over 132,000 children
and almost 28,000 seniors. So, we have set about at Second Harvest
making our primary goals to end child and senior hunger in our region.
We have a number of counties with extremely high child poverty rates,
including Anson, Cleveland, Montgomery and Rutherford, where one in
three children live in poverty, and Gaston, Rowan and Burke, where one
in four children live in poverty. A number of our counties also have
very high senior poverty rates as well, with Anson, Cleveland and
Montgomery posting the highest rates. Our programs at Second Harvest
focus strongly on these areas and include the following: Agency shopping
- our agencies can come to any of our five branches that are scattered
throughout our service territory once a week to acquire food. Our
branches in North Carolina include our main branch in Charlotte. We also
have satellites in Catawba County, Gaston County and Montgomery County.
One thing that I think is kind of important and interesting about our
branches is that they're all in</p>

?? spice, Kataba in Gaston exists through private donor sponsorship
through Food Lion, and the Alex Lee company, which is the parent company
for MDI and Lowe's Foods. We currently serve 550 partner agencies,
including pantries, soup kitchens, homeless shelters and so on. Of our
560, 60% are faith based. We are heavily dependent on our faith based
communities, predominantly for our emergency pantries. Our child hunger
programs include 102 backpack programs, 72 of which are located in North
Carolina. These backpacks represent a life-line for children going home
on the weekends who don't have enough food to eat, and their school
meals are suddenly no longer available. We also have 42 kids cafe sites,
which are meal sites, 36 of which are located in North Carolina. Like
the backpack program, these sites are providing nutritious meals and
snacks to children that are at risk of hunger. Almost all of our
backpack programs and kids cafe sites are sponsored by corporate
partners in our region. These include Morgan Stanley, Bank of America,
American Tar, US Airways, The Carolina Panthers, and I could go on and
on. One of the most unique partnerships we have with our backpack
program is through Carolina's health care system. Every week Carolina's
health care system starts an average of 75 new employees to work. And
they decided recently that at their new employee orientation they were
going to pack 200 backpacks every week for our food night. And we're
using that now as a model to look out to other corporations and say,
&quot;Couldn't you do something similar?&quot; We also have our second
helping program, which is much like the backpack program but designed to
serve seniors. We also have mobile pantry programs that take food
directly to rural areas where the poverty rates are very high, resources
are very low. Our corporate sponsors for that program include the
Charlotte Bobcats - who last year purchased a new mobile pantry truck
and 150,000 pounds of food - as well as Target and Walmart. Our
philosophy at Second Harvest is to be the best community resource we can
possibly be. To do that we feel like we have to place a very high
emphasis on efficiency measures, and we operate our food bank on a
business mode. While we definitely serve people from our hearts, we also
believe our donors deserve to know that the money they donate is being
used efficiently and for it's intended purpose. We strive to be the best
possible stewards of the funds that companies and people entrust to us.
We think the reason that we have such a high level of corporate support
is because we represent an excellent return on the investments made in
our food bank. I'm proud to say that our food bank in Charlotte is one
of the most efficient in the 200 food bank network called Feeding
America. According to the last network activity report we had the lowest
cost per pound distributed of all 24 large food banks, and we're the 9th
lowest of over 200 food banks. We have a very small staff, and that
makes us highly dependent on volunteers. We welcome 31,000 volunteers
last year - who provided over 90,000 hours of free labor - which more
than doubled our existing staff. We also place a high value on donor
service. Our top priority - because we are so dependent on food donation
- is to ensure premium service to our donors. Finally, we believe
strongly in supporting business in our service territory and within the
state of North Carolina. In 2012 we spent $4.2 million with North
Carolina businesses. So thank you from the bottom of our hearts for
everything you do. Thank you for every hungry child and every hungry
senior you help us feed, and we certainly hope you'll considering
funding us again this year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Kay, and now we hear from Clyde Fitzgerald,
Northwest part of the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
It's a privilege to be here to speak to you today. I represent Second
Harvest Food Bank of Northwest North Carolina based in Winston-Salem. My
name is Clyde Fitzgerald and I'm the executive director. Hunger is a
very serious, very pervasive, and unfortunately growing problem in our
part of the state.</p>

<p id="40:00">
Our mission, like that of my colleagues across the state, is to bring
hope to those who have none, food to those who have too little, and the
certain knowledge that someone really cares to untold hundreds of
thousands of our fellow northwest North Carolinians and North
Carolinians that struggle every day for the basics inf life. And I
believe that on this Earth there is nothing more basic than the need for
nutritious food. We're gratefeul for the state funding that allows us to
leverage, as you've heard from my other colleagues, the donations of
both food and money that we get from a variety of sources -- the
corporate world, foundations, civic clubs, individuals, the faith
community. We enjoy a very good public/private partnership. We're proud
to partner with the state of North Carolina to bring food assistance to
our neighbors in this state that are in dire need of it. With the
funding that we received in our food bank, we have been able to last
year to purchase and distribute over 1.7 million pounds of food. That's
nearly 1.5 million meals to those in need in our area. Over the last
three to four years, a period of tough economic times in our region, the
need for food assistance across all of our eighteen counties is a
hundred percent plus. Very very strong. The driving force in that is
chronically high levels of unemployment and very significant of
under-employment, uh, that take folks that during this period of time
that used to be our donors, that used to be able to take care of their
family, their children that now, through no fault of their own in most
cases, find themselves without a job, lacking the financial resources
for even the basics in life. And so they turn to us and our
partner-agency network. In northwest North Carolina we have about 300
partner agencies, all 501(c)3 like we are, that operate over 400
programs that provide food assistance to those in need. The numbers of
people that we serve during this period of time has increased from about
135,000 people today over 300,000 people, and sadly 100,000 of those
we're serving are children. Now we don't that anyone should be hungry in
this state. We certainly don't believe that a child should be hungry.
But we appreciate the partnership that we enjoy with the state of North
Carolina, uh, collectively and from our food bank especially for what
we're able to do. The amount of food that we have obtained with your
funding equates to about 8 percent of our total distribution, but as
you've heard from my colleagues, the percentage of that distribution is
vitally important because of the high quality, highly nutritious of the
food that we're able selectively purchase to add to all of the food that
comes from a variety of sources that's donated to us. The types of
programs that we operate in this regard focus, as you've heard from many
of my colleagues, on childhood hunger and senior hunger. And of course
there's folks of all ages in between that find themselves in great need.
In just the last three years, we've doubled the number of our Kids'
Cafes programs in Winston-Salem, Greensborough and High Point. We have
dramatically expanded our backpack program, which my colleagues have
explained what that is. We've gone from seven programs three years ago
to having 76 in operation today, and next month we will have 80 such
programs across the 18 counties that we service, and our counties go
from Caswell and Alamance to our east all the way through Wautauga to
our west, over 8,500 square miles of territory that we cover.
Winston-Salem and its, and Greensborough and the metropolitan area,
which many people say well, surely you don't have a problem there, it
must be in some rural county. Well, one out of every six people in
Forsyth county and one out of every six people and Guilford county need
food assistance every week. And in other counties that we service, that
gets even worse, a very severe problem. And we're on the front lines,
and we're partnering with you in being on the front lines [CUTS OFF]</p>

<p id="45:00">
providing food assistance to those who so desparately need it. We
provide mobile pantry distributions of high quality food and fresh
produce in all 18 of our counties, and we are very actrive in summer
feeding programs for children. This past summer we identified through
our partners and provided food to over 19,000 childrean that would have
otherwise fallen through the cracks during the summer that did not have
access to food assistance programs through the various counties. That's
on top of all the children we serve  every day through our core food
distribution program.  We have unfortunately some statistics in our area
that as Allan spoke to in his opening comments, are not on the right end
of the stick where we'd like to be. Being number 1 in basketball is a
good thing, but being number one on the worst end of having the highest
percentage of households with children that are suffering from hunger in
your back yard is not a good thing and we're doing everything we can to
change that picture with the programs that we putin place. Certainly
using the food that we obtained through the state appropriation. Those
kind of things  are extremely important to us.
Many times think that well there are food stamp programs and other
things, free and reduced price meals in schools and surely that takes
care of this need. Well it tkaes care of some of that need, but
certainly not all of that need. And another statistic I'd like to bring
to your attention is that in our service area of our 18 counties, 35% of
all of the people who need food assistance make just a little too much
money to qualify for a government assitance program. They don't qualify
for food stamps. They don't qualify for the free and reduced meals in
the  schools for their children. So charitable sources like Second
Harvest food bank, and our partner agencies and my colleagues across the
state are the only hope for people that are in that type of need. And
that's why we're there to serve them, and to try to bring some relief
til they get back on their feet. I always like to talk about the face of
hunger. It's the 82 year old widow that called me one day and said I'm
in need, I saw you on television, found your name and can you help me?
And I said I'd like to, please tell me your problem. And she said I'm an
82 year old widow, I live in a very small apartment, social security is
all that I have. The last week of every month, I have to eat my dog's
food until my next check comes. Can you help me? I said Yes ma'am, and
that very day we had one of our partner agencies deliver food to that
lady, and she shared some with her friends in the same situation. That's
part of the face of hunger that we don't hear about. We see many
children every week that will look me in the eye and tell me they're not
having a bad day because it's not their day to eat. No child should ever
have to say It's not their day to eat.  I think of recently a 9 year old
child. I have grandchildren older than that, that said that his mother
and father both work, he has a brother  and sister so there's 5 of them
in the household, but they don't have enough money to have food and so
they take turns eating and that's another face of hunger. So we're
deeply grateful for what you do for us, we thank you very much for that,
we are good stewards of your investment. 92% of all the revenues we get
go to our programs, less than 4% to admin and fundraising and we're very
grateful for that support, I hope you will continue to partner with the
state's food banks to bring food relief to those in our state. Mr.
Chairman, that concludes my comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Clyde, and now from the Southeast, David Griffin.

<p id="50:00">
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: A partnership and your assistance and helping us to
?? in South and in North Carolina. My colleagues got up this morning and
they all spoke very eloquently on and they put out a whole list of
statistics where that I can let of to you now. I can continue to tell
you that we serve over a 102,000 families each and every month. I can go
on to tell you that in our South East and South East, North Carolina
there are over 127,000 children who suffer, who are on at risk and a on
free and we do select.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative ?? I can also tell you in Blaine
County alone 79% of those children are on free ?? lunch, but I think
both of us will also tell you and also my colleagues that one child go
on hungry it's one to men and that's why each of us are in this for long
hour. This is why we are here asking for your assistance once again
because we understand that it's not always about big government, but
it's about communities helping communities. This is how we end hunger.
Each of our programs with the help of your funding, we are able to build
unique programs within communities specifically for that particular
community. Understanding this is not a copy right solution to any
community, but we are able to take food with our mobile pantry program
into food desserts that there are no grocery stores, that individuals
cannot get to the inter cities were able to establish ?? programs, and
ensure that a child has a healthy nutritious food that they can access
themselves over the course of a weekend, so that way they show up to
work to school on Monday morning ready to learn. That's what your
assistance does, and one child having to show up to school on Monday
morning and we label a trouble maker are always in the Principal office
because they are labelled unruly just because they had no food all
weekend it's one too many.
My point here to date is to let you know that the program works. Your
assistance is needed because the program works. Had it not been for a
program such as an after school kids cafe program, had it not been for a
?? pack program, then I would not be able to stand before a group of you
today and representing those, some of those children that you would
never meet, but I can go back to them and tell them that they have your
support. I can go back and let them know that they are not in this fight
alone.
I found myself as a young child, my mother passed away at a very young
age, and when she passed away my father had 4 kids and no job after 17
years with one company, found himself with no job. But luckily, I had a
grandmother who knew of the food bank, and she was able to go to the
food bank and provide food, help my father provide food for his 4
children and for that reason alone I never knew what hunger was, because
I always had food on the table.
But I talked to one of our children now in our ?? program or in our
after school kids cafe program, and you ask them what would you do if I
were to give you million dollars, and the first thing out of their mouth
is, I would buy a grocery store or I would buy some food, and so think,
the first thing from most of mouths would be to buy something that we
could not ordinarily afford ourselves. This is their reality. Food is
one thing that bring us around the table, food is one thing that we come
together around the table, families are able to sit, talk about their
day, talk about home work, talk about hopes, talk about drinks, talk
about opportunities, but without this basic product something as simple
as rice these individuals or at least families have no need to come
around the table. Well that sound to look like, It looks just like you,
and it looks just like me.
Individual societies in board room last year made the tough decisions
are now finding themselves ?? to our doors, who had the downs as their
homes, who have lost their homes still ?? same fancy corridor they can't
get out of hoping that not one comes to take it, puling open our drab
ways asking how can they benefit from our services.</p>

That’s the reality of what we see each and every day. But we are
grateful for you, we are grateful for your commitment, your friendship
and your continued support. Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Now, Peter, I think we might have you ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We are the food bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina, a non-profit
hunger relief organization that has provided food in 34 counties for
over 30 years. Sadly, hunger remains a serious problem in North
Carolina. There are over 560,000 in these 34 counties who live at or
below the poverty line. But even more who are at risk for hunger. Who
are these people? It’s not just the homeless. Some are the unemployed or
underemployed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Many of those that we serve are working families. People whose income
runs out by the end of the month and they find themselves in an
emergency situation without food.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I am hungry. This is my first meal of the day. Hopefully I’ll get
to eat again later this evening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Additionally, within those families, we are looking at ⅓ being children.
Statistics tell the story. The most vulnerable populations in our 34
counties are seniors and children. We supply more than 150,000 pounds of
food every day through our six locations in Durham, Greenville, New
Bern, Raleigh, Sandhills, and Wilmington. But we don’t do it alone, we
service a network of more than 800 non-profit partner organizations.
These community based emergency feeding programs are soup kitchens, food
pantries, rescue missions, shelters, group homes, senior and child
nutrition programs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Almost 200,000 that we serve are children who are living in poverty with
their parents or their single mother. This makes up for the largest
demographic of those that we serve.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We specifically address childhood hunger with special programs. Kids
Cafe is our after school program. The weekend power pack program sends
kids home with backpacks filled with nutritious food. And our kids
summer meals provides breakfast and lunch during the summer months. The
dry goods, fresh produce, dairy and meats we distribute come from many
sources. They come from food drives, retailers, wholesalers and local
farmers. Our fleet of food bank trucks drives more than a half million
miles a year to distribute much of this donated food to our regional
branches to select food for their programs. They collect food based on
their needs and availability in our warehouses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What I’m looking for in here is for things for our soup, hot dogs,
hamburgers, anything that we can serve 375 people a day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now that you know how great the need, you can help the food bank
operations in three ways.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The most important thing you can do is donate money. For every dollar
you give us, we can turn it into five meals, or ten dollars worth of
food. We are proud to be an efficient organization where 97% of every
dollar donated goes out to the community in food to feed our hungry
neighbors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second, you can donate time as a volunteer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You come to volunteer, that means you’re giving your time, energy, and
effort to help somebody who is struggling during hard times. It’s
important if everybody does a little bit then it makes a huge impact,
especially for the food bank because they need so many resources.</p>

?? do it without helping other volunteers. Ultimately you get the
satisfaction of knowing that your impact whether its sorting potatoes or
donating food or sorting food drive food ultimately goes to help someone
else who's having hard times for whatever reason, and you may have fed a
child today, you may have fed a senior citizen, and ultimately your
helping somebody else. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And third you can donate food
by starting a food drive. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We work really hard every
year to get as much food as we possibly can for the food drive we get
really exited for just raising food for people its such a good cause its
really easy to just get your whole school involved, and get a lot of
pounds that way. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The food bank is supported by the
community for the community. We greatly appreciate your support. We
greatly need your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Because of the food bank
you know we're able to feed all these people and if wasn't for then you
know we wouldn't be able to feed them this is so important to so many
people that its not a resource its a life source. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much ?? hopefully that gave you some perspective of ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning my name is Barbara Moralis Bertka and I
work for Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina and I'm on the board of
the food bank in Central and Eastern North Carolina. Blue Cross is a
long time supporter of the food bank of central and eastern North
Carolina, and we share the organizations commitment to serving the
communities of our state. We're proud to be counted as a friend of the
food bank our employees enthusiastically participate in the annual food
drive that we hold every year to benefit the 34 counties that our food
bank serves, and they participate in other food bank related events that
we sponsor. We believe that reducing hunger makes our state a better
place to live and work, and maintaining a healthy population is one key
to making healthcare better for North Carolina. The food bank is a great
investment of our corporate community investment dollars for several
reasons including the focus on getting nutritional food to the people
who are served by the food bank, the fact that it partners with many
agencies and programs to distribute food at the community level, the
fact that it fills in the gaps when peoples incomes fall short or when
other kinds of assistance have been exhausted, and finally the
relationships it has with local food producers, and retailers. All of
these factors motivate me personally as a board member, and make me very
proud to be affiliated with that organization. Hunger is a tragedy that
is entirely preventable. Beyond the charitable motives for feeding the
hungry it's a true statement that the businesses of North Carolina, the
not for profit agencies, the governmental agencies, their fortunes are
really tide to having a healthy vibrant population in our state. During
this period of slow economic recovery theirs so many North Carolinians
who are on the bubble, and I think that everyone deserves a fair chance
of prosperity part of ensuring that chance is to make sure that no one
goes hungry. So thank you for the couple of minutes to speak with you
this morning, and the commitment that you show everyday to serving the
people of our great state with compassion. I just wanna mention one
thing that I think shows a lot about how Blue Cross regards the food
bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina we provide funds to sponsor
the cost of operating a truck that picks up and delivers food across the
state, and our company name and logos on that truck, and I think that
says a lot when were willing to pay to have our name on the same truck
as the food bank. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am. Questions or
comments ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would say wow thank you all for the fine
presentation. This is probably a question for Mr. Briggs and I think for
the number of questions Ima try to limit it to one. You mentioned the
state funding reduction. Give us some idea of what your overall funding
situations been over the last couple of years, and how you have had to
deal with this funding reductions in terms of budget cutbacks, and other
ways you've had to balance your budgets. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Lutenant

I think staff will probably have some statistics to back up. One of the
things that happened two years ago was, because North Carolina's
unemployment rates were so high, the state received additional TANF
funding through the federal block grant and at that time the 2011-12
budget reflected diversion of additional funds for that. But I would
note that we've been pretty much at that three million mark now for
about ten years. And as you've heard this morning, we would really love
an opportunity to work with you to identify additional sources of money
because you've seen how that leverages, you've seen how our work has
grown and, honestly, we need to find, I know how difficult that is and
it probably, you look at me a little funny today to talk about
additional funding but I would like the opportunity for us to work with
you to identify sources and make additional funding available. Because
we're having to pick that up in other ways but we're simply not able to
keep pace.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've always, just trying to look at, for the
association as a whole, looking at the past through funds that were
spent to this state. From the presentations today we saw a lot of
variety in sizes of organizations and in populations they serve,
however, at least last year as is consideration of the state that we
distribute funds in an equal manner, 1/6th of the two million
appropriated to each of the six. My question, first, is is that an
appropriate distribution of funds, not necessarily the question of how
much overall, but should there, something else be done with how those
funds are distributed from the state. And secondly, does the association
itself accept donations, currently, and distribute it to its members?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, that is a question that has arisen a great deal. The honest
answer, initially, is that 20 years ago, or so, when the state initially
started funding food banks it was policy choice by the General Assembly
to distribute the funds on an equal basis. What we've done, and I hope
we've demonstrated today, is how we collaborate. I think, I won't speak
for Charlotte and Raleigh, they want to ask them directly but we
collaborate tremendously. We recognize that the resources available in
the Western North Carolina and Eastern North Carolina are not the same.
The larger food banks accept the fact that they have some resources that
others don't and we have it very workable to share those resources to
ensure those food banks covering areas with greater need and less
resources are able to meet their needs as well. As far as the State
Association, we actually all, we do not get direct funding. We are, our
members pay dues to the State Association and any, we don't actively
solicit donations, but what donations we receive are distributed among
our members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Earle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I would just like to thank the food banks for coming and for
sharing with us what you do. What, the challenge that they face and have
always faced has been great. They do an excellent job with the resources
and I'm just, some of the stories that have been shared, I think, ought
to make us all feel a little bad about how critical this situation is
with folk, especially children and the elderly, not having sufficient
food. I've been involved with the food banks for a while. I've visited
mine in Charlotte and I've visited one in Winston, Salem and I think,
like I say, they do an excellent job. I'm hoping that we can at least
increase the funding for this year. I think the challenge is going to be
even greater when you take into consideration the unemployment bill that
we just passed. In three to five months, without a job, you're going to
have more people knocking on the doors and showing up for food at one of
these agencies. With the not expanding Medicaid, which could possibly be
a safety net for some of these people, that's going to create an even
greater challenge and I'm just hoping that</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess this question could be directed to Mr.
Briggs or some of the others, but I noticed in several of your
presentations there was a breakdown regarding the level of poverty in
each of your counties. Then in one of the gentleman’s presentations, he
mentioned the fact of people not qualifying for food stamps. If you
could clarify for me the levels of eligibility that are applied when
people don’t qualify for food bank, or rather the food stamps and they
go to food banks or your affiliates in terms of meeting the needs of the
total level of people living in poverty in your county or your service
area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m going to look for a little assistance from folks who have boots on
the ground there. One of the things to note is that, as we mentioned, we
have 2700 different partner agencies. All of them have slightly
different rules about who’s eligible. Some shelters are geared for
families or women and children only, those types of things. There’s not
a universal standard, but I would defer for folks, as far as where those
eligibility requirements shift in terms of eligibility for other food
assistance.
We’re basically, Representative Avila, we’re an emergency relief group
of organizations. We are fingers in the dike. These other programs,
rules are set by the federal government for food stamp eligibility, the
income levels, the asset determinations. We have no role in that. It
certainly supplements that we’re doing, but we’re dealing with that
basic emergency relief in the work that we do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robertson, I might mention we are running a little short of
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m going to be very short with this and simply say that I really
appreciate the work that the banks are doing across our state. I want
to, however, and I’ve volunteered with Kids’ Cafe and I’ve visited and a
lot of the people that we serve in our area benefit greatly from Second
Harvest, so when we talk about the volunteer power in the contributions
of North Carolina, they are tremendous. Recently in Guilford County we
had a halt in the food stamp system and I wanted to know from Clyde, Mr.
Fitzgerald, I imagine that a lot of those people had to come to Second
Harvest for assistance. Can you share any information on that in terms
of the impact that had on Second Harvest?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am. It certainly had an impact. We were away that a delay was
going to be necessary outside of any control that we had, but what we
did was we was we worked with our retail partners to obtain additional
food so that we could distribute additional food, especially to the
folks who were impacted negatively by having to wait longer than they
normally would in that transition. I can’t say that we were able to
resolve the problem for everyone, but we made a significant impact and I
believe across our state, we all did the same things to try to equalize
that situation so that people would not find themselves in an even worse
situation than they already were in.

Representative Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Question for Mr. Briggs. I was wondering about
the current structure of the donation situation with the tax credits or
what kind of treatment does the state have in regards to that as far

credit for food donations, if it's provided directly by farmers and
other producers. That will be a significant question, Dr. Foreman, as
you go forward looking at tax policies because, obviously, we would be
impacted a great deal by changes in our state sales tax on food or on
franchise taxes, which currently do not affect non-profits. At the
national level, we are, through the Feeding America Network, very
concerned about trying to expand those donation credits for food and,
currently, most of that's impacted apparently by federal tax laws.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. On behalf of the legislature and the Health and Human
Services Committee, thank each of you for being here today and thank you
for the work you do. I don't know of another more important thing that
we could be doing. Thank you so much for the time that you dedicated to
the people that we take for granted every day, when we sit down and eat.
I'm sure that all of us, in every district, have people who are not
eating every meal. Thank you so much for what you're doing. Just a
reminder for in the morning: the meeting has been moved to 9:00, here in
this room. If you'll make a note of that. Thank you so much for
attending and the meeting is adjourned.</p>
