Speaker 1: … cannot slip out to the restroom; meanwhile, the poor
teaching assistant is running room to room when they call them, just so
they can take a bathroom break. And he goes on to say that he is having
all kind of trouble with his home mortgage: trying to get it modified,
and sort of leaves the impression of being very disappointed in what we
are trying to – this is one of the people that you say you are aiming
the raise at. Abe Lincoln, I think, is the one who said that – you can
fool some of the people some of the time, all of the people some of the
time, but you cannot fool all of the people, all of the time. If we
think we are fooling these teachers, who are demoralized already, by
these tricks and shannigans and this budget, then the only ones we are
fooling are ourselves. I hope that, at some point, you will take up the
offer that ??? – that let’s sit together and reason and figure how we
are going to deal with this crisis that threatens to undermine what we
were busy building this state into, because if we do not deal with this
teacher crisis, systems all over the state, and especially at the
borders, will continue to lose good teachers. We are losing 900 teachers
from the Wade county school system this year – experienced teachers.
Maybe you can, but we cannot afford to keep that up. So these teachers
are being more persuaded to stay in the classrooms when they figure out
these games we are playing. And if you truly believe that we ought to
give them an 11% increase this year, if you truly do believe that, let’s
say that 11% is the baseline, and let’s guarantee that this raise is
going to continue past this year, and let’s take some of this language
out of the budget bill that makes reasonable people know that it is just
a game that you are playing - you are not raising a salary that is being
sustained. It has to be something that can be sustained, and that is
comprehensive. This bill does not do it. The one highlight of it was
aimed at trying to fool teachers and I hope you will vote against it.
Speaker 2: Mr. President?
Speaker 3: For what purpose do you rise?
Senator Apodaca: Let’s see. Let’s do a couple of amendments first. The
minority leader threw us off here, getting up, because that is usually
the sign of ending debate. So, I would like to set forth an amendment.
Speaker 3: Set forth your amendment, the clerk will read.
Speaker 2: Senator Apodaca moves to amend the bill.
Speaker 3: Senator Apodaca you have the floor.
Senator Apodaca: Mr. President, Members, thank you. All this does is
correct language instructing Deener to use $250,000 to hire a consultant
to study state culture sites, instead, it deposits those funds
appropriated into a savings reserve fund. It also instructs Department
Culture Resources to report to the oversight committee of general gov as
to any conclusions or recommendations as to this task force. I ask for
your support.
Speaker 2: Further discussion or debate on Amendment 13? Hearing none.
Question before the Senate is the passage of Amendment 13 to Senate Bill
744, all in favor vote aye, all opposed, vote not. Five seconds will be
allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote. Curtis, aye.
Forty seven having voted in the affirmative, zero in the negative,
Amendment 13 passes, and the bill is back before you for discussion or
debate.
Senator Brown: Mr. President?
Speaker 2: Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
Brown: To set forth an amendment.
Speaker 2: Set forth your amendment, the clerk will read.
Brown: Senator Brown moves to amend the bill.
Speaker 2: You have the floor.
Brown: Thank you Mr. President. I have been told that most of this, if
not all of this, is technical. I will be glad to ask any questions, but
it fixes some things we needed to just fix basically.
Speaker 2: Is there further debate on amendment 14? Senator Stein for
what purpose so you rise?
Stein: This is a 5 page amendment, is there any way we can just take one
moment to skim through it to see what is in it?
Speaker 2: Senate will stand at ease for 5 minutes.
Stein: Thank you Sir.
Speaker 2: Senator Bryant you may want to turn your microphone off.</p>
