Senate will come to order. Sergeant-at-Arms close the doors. Members,
please go to your seats. Members and guests of the gallery, please
silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is Reverend
Peter Milner, Senate chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery,
please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let’s pray together. Heavenly father, thank you so much for this day. As
we come to you on this hot, sticky day we need you, as only you can do,
to sustain us as we pray. Our prayer today is that we might follow you
as Simon Peter was asked to do some 2,000 years ago. We know that
there’s a cost to discipleship, Lord. We also know that you will carry
us as we remain faithful to your commands. Come now, Lord Jesus, help us
as we follow you. It’s in your name we pray. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. The journal of Wednesday, July 9th, 2014 has
been examined and is found to be correct. I move that we dispense with
the reading of the journal and that it stand approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, the journal for July 9th stands approved as written.
Senators, we have leaves of absence granted today for Senators Allran,
Parmon, Jenkins, Ford and Robinson. We do have a nurse of the day with
us today. Septina Florimonte from Raleigh, North Carolina is with us.
Nurse Florimonte, please stand and be recognized. Thank you for your
service to the Senate. Senator McLaurin, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Point of personal privilege out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Members of the Senate, Mr. President, it’s a real
honor for me today to introduce to you someone from my district, a
constituent, someone I’ve known for many years who is here today with
her family. I want to issue a senatorial statement in her honor. Her
name is Mary O’Neal. Mary grew up in California, graduated from
California Lutheran College, later earned a Master’s degree from East
Carolina University. After college, Mary volunteered with the Lutheran
World Brotherhood Exchange in Ethiopia and held several positions before
marrying her husband Ed, who was later assigned to Fort Bragg. Her
husband Ed served five tours of duty in Vietnam. Command sergeant major.
He passed away in May, just a couple of months ago. Mary participated in
many organizations through the years. She managed the local branch of
the Employment Security Commission after working her way up through the
ranks, starting as an interviewer at the ESC, later managing the
facility in Richmond County, and in Anson County if I remember
correctly. Through the years, Mary participated in a number of
organizations dedicated to providing service to our veterans, including
the VFW Post 4203 Auxiliary, Disabled American Veterans Auxiliary and
AMVETS Ladies Auxiliary 316, of which she has been the president since
2006. Last year, Mary served as the state president of the AMVETS
Auxiliary and this year she serves on the national executive committee
as a representative for the North Carolina AMVETS Auxiliary. She’s
worked to improve the lives of those in our community through her
church, through various other boards, involvement councils, vocational
advisory councils, literacy councils, social ministries and food
ministries but today I honor, and ask you to join with me in honoring,
Mary O’Neal for the service that she has rendered to our community and
to our state, on behalf of veterans all across North Carolina. She is a
true leader. She’s been a tireless advocate for veterans and I’m very
proud that she is with us today. She was accompanied today by, and drove
here from her home in Richmond County, by Mr. Lacy Shepherd, who was the</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, and members, I move we concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. This basically goes back to the Senate version
and it will replace the common core standards with the North Carolina
standards set up by a North Carolina standards commission. 11 members to
be named by the President Pro Tempore and by the Speaker and a couple of
the appointments by the State Board of Education and it will put these
standards in North Carolina’s hands and take them out of the federal
conglomeration of states. That’s basically what it does. I ask you</p>

vote for the conference report to adopt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman asks that you vote to adopt. Senator Stein, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Senator Tillman for prevailing
in the conference negotiations, because the House bill was worse than
the Senate bill. It is a backhanded compliment. I don’t think that we
need to be voting for something that’s less bad, however, so for the
reason I opposed the bill when it came through the first time, I’m going
to be opposing it again this time. I think it introduces instability to
our educators at precisely the wrong time and I don’t think we need to
fear high standards for our kids and for our teachers. I think they can
meet them. I think this is legislation based on fear and will therefore
be voting against it, just as I did the time before.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Tillman, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one brief reply to my good friend, Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you like what we have, and about 55% of the people do not--who
finally woke up after about 3 years of not knowing what those standards
said--and, if you choose to read those standards, you’ll find they’re
too weak in upper-level math and highly inappropriate for lower-level
math. If you like Senator Stein’s idea then you’ll love the federal
approach, but I like the North Carolina brand and I trust this
commission that was set up to make these more rigorous in most places,
and certainly more appropriate for North Carolina. You will see other
states, as we have seen five were pretty smart and knew what they were
doing to start with and didn’t choose to go this route. You’ve got about
ten more that are, right now, in the process of getting out. Some
already have: Indiana, Tennessee is getting out, Florida has changed it,
and South Carolina, so there are many others now that will be doing this
and I believe that we’re going in a better direction for North Carolina.
I think it’s a good bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McLaurin, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. To see if Senator Tillman would yield to a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Tillman, I understand your point, and I think we all
agree we need certain standards, but, unfortunately, this has kind of
become somewhat of a political football going back and forth. You
mentioned, and this is for point of clarification, my question is, are
we repealing the standards? Is that what we’re doing in this case, or
are we just saying that some of the standards may stay in place after
this commission reviews them? If you could elaborate and give some
clarification on whether this is a repeal or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good question, senator. Section 3A, it’s clearly stated that it repeals
the common core standards. What we do have is not the harsher ban that
the House had, where you couldn’t consider one single standard from the
common core, they’ve got some good and rigorous standards and I’m sure
that we probably will adopt some. This keeps those standards in place
until the commission, which will be appointed and seated by September
and make a report by December. I hope early in the spring for the
‘15-’16 school year we’ll have standards in place, but, yes, repeal.
Now, the title says replace but, either one, we’re putting it in our
hands and taking it out of the federal hands. Everything will continue
just like it has until we get the new set of more rigorous standards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question for the
Senate is the motion to adopt the Conference Committee substitute to
Senate Bill 812. There will be one electronic vote. All in favor will
vote aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting and the clerk will record the vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? aye. 34 having voting in the affirmative and 11 in the negative, the
Senate does adopt the Conference Committee substitute to Senate Bill 812
and the House will be notified. That wraps up our calendar for today,
senators. If we have any notices or announcements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I’d like to change my vote on
Senate Bill 846 from aye to no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith changed from aye to no. Final count is 44 to 1. Senator
Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to change my vote on Senate Bill 812 from aye to no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant changes from aye to no.</p>

today? Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members, I want to let you know that next
week, starting Tuesday morning, Rules Committee will be meeting every
morning at 9 a.m. of next week. We’ll be starting our end of the session
time, running bills through as quickly as possible to get out of here,
to hear them thoroughly and then get out of here. Senator Stein, I hope
you’re there to help us, so I want everybody to get rested this weekend
and come back next week. Get ready to work. Have a good weekend and a
safe one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I would also like to change my vote on Senate Bill 846
from aye to nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho from aye to nay on 846. Final count 43 to 2. Senator
Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, appropriate moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I just want to remind you to be
prayerful about our friends in Israel. Israel is under attack from
Hamas. In the Gaza there is a missile launched every 10 minutes at the
Jewish population in Israel. They’re our only ally in the Middle East
and I ask for your prayers, consideration and support for those people
who are enduring this, on either side of the border. There’s a current
operation for a ground attack to go deep into Gaza. Obviously men, women
and children will be at risk on both sides of the border. It’s a time of
solemn thoughts on being able to support Israel to be able to defend
themselves. As many of you know, Israel is no bigger than the state of
New Jersey and totally surrounded by people who want to eliminate the
state of Israel and I, as a senator from North Carolina, stand in
staunch support for those people. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Do we have any other notices or announcements? Is
there any further business to come before the Senate? If not, the Chair
recognizes Senator Berger.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate do now adjourn, subject
to messages from the House and the governor, the referral and
re-referral of bills and resolution, ratification of bills, and the
appointment of conferees, to reconvene on Monday, July 14th, 2014 at 7
p.m.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn, subject to the
stipulations stated by Senator Berger, to reconvene Monday, July 14th at
7 p.m, seconded by Senator Goolsby. All in favor say aye, opposed no.
The ayes have it. The Senate stands adjourned.</p>
