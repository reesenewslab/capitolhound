<p id="00:00">

Lewis, Justin Owens, Ed Kessler, and Steve McCone. Our pages today,
we'll run through the pages all the signed and show this through them.
Areve Shewston from ?? Senator Raymond. McKenzie Lancer Burlington,
Senator Gunn. Ann Marujo, Greensborough, Senator Berger, Candy Holland,
Greensborough, Senator Berger. Welcome. Matt Murphy ?? we got a
hyphenated name there is that right, out of Durham. Senator Woodard. Can
Knowlen, Charlotte, Senator Clodfelter. Trip Cali, from Davy, Senator
Brock, I guess that's Davy County, maybe not. Mark Damacon the 2nd from
Enfield, Senator Bryant. Welcome. Keep your ears wide open we're going
to move through this pretty quickly today. I hope you see good
government at work. Members we have a pretty hefty calendar today so
we're going to move through it rather rapidly. Please pay attention. If
you have questions makes sure they're germane. As we go forward please
let's get the answers that we need &lt;h3&gt;properly ?? and move along.
Our first bill today will be House bill 409, Shelby de-annexation.
Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. This is a bill
requested by our county commission. Our city council in Shelby requested
a de-annexed piece of property sent to ?? in agreement on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I hope the Durham delegation -
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Moore. Good job, we have a motion from…yes
Ma'am. You are recognized. Senator ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. Chair, I need you to recluse myself from commenting or
voting on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator is recognized as not taking part in this bill. Senator
Tillmann. Thank you. There's a motion for a favorable report from
Senator Tillmann. Any discussion or debate? Hearing none, all those in
favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed No. Ayes have it, motion carried, then who's going to run it?
Thank you. House Bill 334, Bunkham County Sale Tax Use Expansion
Representative Ramsey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a PCS, we need a motion to entertain the PCS please. By Senator
Brown, all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed? Motion carries you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee thank you so much. This is a
PCS centered ?? came up with some very good suggestions so we
incorporated his recommendations and I think everyone's in agreement,
the county the school system would be welcome to any questions committee
may have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, questions? Or debates. Senator Tillmann.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe this is a bill that Senator ?? called me about and tell me
exactly what you're trying to do by I remember parts of it, this may not
be the same bill but I believe it is. Could you explain a little bit
more about what it does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Schools were involved in this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir they were. The initial bill Malcolm county in 1983, is called
article 39. A portion of our sales tax is dedicated for K12 construction
projects in the state. The initial bill would have allowed them to use
some of those funds for digital education beyond just bricks and mortar.
Upon consulting with Senator Nesbitt and leadership of our school system
we feel perhaps we found a better way. Our county has 5 million dollars
in undesignated lottery funds that they currently cannot use for
anything but bricks and mortar projects. The article 39 finding is more
than sufficient to provide any of the capital needs of our school system
so what this PCS does would allow them to use that money on a one time
basis so this is not money that will be accumulated in the future, for
digital education porpoises, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions?
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p id="05:00">
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I know this is a good compromise and I've told
Representative Ramsey it's been awhile since we got together on
something down here in Raleigh and his presence his welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Hallelujah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do I hear motion for favorable report? Thank you. We
have a motion from Senator Curtis. Favorable to the PCS, unfavorable to
the original. All those in favor say aye, opposed no. Ayes have it.
Motion carried. Who will be running this on the floor? Senator Nesbitt?
OK. And do you have another bill? Are you going to run? House Bill 418.
If you would, please, sir. This is a PCS also. A motion to hear the PCS,
please. Motion by Senator Curtis. All in favor say aye, opposed? Motion
carries. You have the floor, Representative Ramsey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, so much, Mr. Chairman. Senator, members of
the committee, this is a bill that will allow our county to enact a
parks and recreation authority and it's requested by the county
government and I would ask the committee to support that. It does not
involve additional taxing authority for the county. It just allows them
to place parks and rec cultural facilities in this authority and their
hope is within several years they'll be able to incorporate
municipalities in the county in this, as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick question. Is everybody on board with this bill
and secondly, I notice there was language in here saying that the county
can transfer employees to the authority and they would no longer be
subject to the Buncombe County personnel ordinance. I take it county
employees are OK with this, too? I mean, what kind of protections are
they losing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First, the county does support this and has requested
that this bill be passed in its current form. Certainly, as far as the
employees, one of the reasons the county had asked for the two year time
period was to get the authority up and running and to address their
employee situation. They're not contemplating terminating any employees.
They would still be included in the local government retiree system, so
they'll have to just transition them to just to that entity. The only
controversy in our community regarding this bill is City of Asheville,
perhaps some other municipalities wanted to join this at this time and
this bill, as written, does not provide for this at this time, but it
would allow for that in two years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Ramsey. I'm sure you have a
follow up, Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick follow up. So the delegation of Buncombe is all
on board with this, or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. It passed the House unanimously. The PCS
was at the request of the county. So the county is asking us, they're
trying to do their budget right now and so they would like to be able to
proceed and go forward. Certainly, Senator Nesbitt's here and
Representative Fisher, I think understand the dynamic in our community.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Nesbitt?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Chairman. And I think yes, I'm in concurrence
with it. The city wanted to be included but they thought the county was
going to increase tax rates about two or three cents to pay for all
their facilities. It ain't going to happen. So this lets the county move
ahead. The votes just aren't there on county commission right now, I
don't think, to pay for city services. So I think this allows them to
move ahead and then the city can move into it and hopefully they can
make peace over time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Soucek?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry. I'm looking at the 7 cents per $100 tax. It
says that they currently have the authority to do this? What does this
bill actually authorizing? Just where it's dedicated? Can't they make,
are we giving them the authority to do something they don't have the
authority to do right now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would defer to staff. It would be my contention that
they can do much of what's in this bill under existing law but there is
a provision that would allow, and the reason the 7 cents number was
mentioned, that's a cap. Currently, the county commissioners have a
taxing authority, I think, up to a dollar and a half and so this is not
expanding their existing taxing authority in Buncombe County. But we
currently have fire districts, city school district, that you have a
separate tax itemized on your tax bill. And so this bill would allow the
county to dedicate existing funding to that parks and rec feature, but
at the end of the day, the county has fiscal responsibility. We're not
giving them authority to raise taxes or cut...</p>

...taxes, any more than they currently have. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. ?? The county has authority to levee taxes for Parks and Recreation
but that would be subject to the county's ability to amend the
(ph)organs during the fiscal year. If it was a levee it was a separate
tax under this bill and the commissioners could not move that money
during the year or any time in the future to some other purpose. It
would be... It would be allocated specifically for that purpose and
could not be transferred to some other county function. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Do I hear a motion to head out? Thank you. Motion
from Senator Woodard to adopt P.C.S., favorable to the P.C.S.,
unfavorable to the original; all in favor, say, &quot;aye.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You guys have it. Thank you
sir, and who will be running this? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Senator ?? .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Our final local bill will be House 404,
Representative Steinberg. While he's coming up, Senator Sanderson, do
you have someone you'd like to review today? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Frankly,
I ?? Senator ?? my grandson, Caleb. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Take a vow.
Welcome to the Senate. [APPLAUSE] Representative Steinberg. ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I thank you, Mr. Chairman. The bill in front of you now is
House Bill 404 and it can be best described very simply in its summary:
House Bill would authorize Camden County to bill storm water fees in the
same manner as property taxes and handle non-payment instances as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a motion from Senator Hise. Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, they can foreclose on real property now and
collect these fees? Is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If it's... If it
can be done as it relates to everything else and these other counties
have already... We, we've passed this for these other counties. You can
see in the ?? of other municipalities who already have this. The answer
to that would be, &quot;yes.&quot; [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It's not a precedent. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Of the questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Move for favorable
report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion for favorable report from Senator Hise,
is there any more discussion or debate? All those in favor, please say,
&quot;Aye.&quot; [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye, to have it, motion carried, and who will be running...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator, Senator Crook, Please, Senator
Crook. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He will be running for Senator. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Your welcome. Thank you. Appreciate it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] OK. We're going to move to the public bills. Senate Bill 488,
Men Nursing Home Administrative Fees. Senator Tucker. One more call,
Senator Tucker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You're
welcome. ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee. This is a bill that amends the Nursing Home Administrators'
Act and fees. Mr. Chairman, do you want me to explain it? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That's why you're here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, thank you.
Currently to change... Currently the change in this bill requires a four
year degree for licensure for Nursing Home Administrator. Those that
have an Associate degree with five years of nursing experience can still
apply and be granted licensure. All those people who do not have four
year degrees or two year degrees and or currently involved in the
nursing home industry as a manager can continue on; they're
grandfathered in. It allows them to change some fees up to: The sudden
?? fees are gonna be changed right away, fees have not been changed
since 2004, so they're requesting that we go through with this bill and
do that and I'm be glad to answer any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you sir Tucker. Are there any questions from the committees? Senator
Raben. Senator Raben moves for a favorable report. Is there any
discussion or debate? Hearing none, all those in favor of the motion
please say, &quot;Aye.&quot; [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, &quot;no.&quot; You guys have it. Motion carried. [SPEAKER

<p id="15:00">
...see if I can get a 1 page bill passed without containing 40 something
pages. No, in all seriousness, this is an issue that arose last session
with our Department of Revenue. When the H2A's were required several
years ago to get I10 numbers, and then they were later required in the
last couple of years to get social security numbers, that's when it
became an issue for the North Carolina Department of Revenue as a grey
area. The federal law does not require any withholding because these are
all contractual employees. Each is given a contract. So federal law
requires no withholding whatsoever on these but because of them having a
social security number, there is a little grey area in our State code
and I worked with Secretary Hall at the time and have also worked with
the current secretary and this is something that we recommended needed
changing and so I would appreciate your support and will be glad to
answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Jackson. Senator Allran?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If we pass this then is there
then a blanket provision that if you're an illegal alien working that
you don't pay these income taxes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Allran? First of all H2A workers are not
illegal aliens. They're here with a passport and a work visa for a
duration of time. So no, this has no bearing on illegal aliens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion? Senator Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Jackson, I know
they're here for a certain amount of time. What happens if they stay a
little longer than permitted and stay employed? Is there any checks on
how that would proceed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If they stay longer than their contracted period
without having a waiver from the U.S. Consulate in Mexico, they're
illegal and to do that, they would have to, in our case, leave our farm
without us knowing it. And once that happens, we have so many hours, I'm
not sure if it's 24 or 48 hours to report that to the U.S. Department of
Labor, also to the Employment Security Commission here in North Carolina
who oversees this, as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow up. So what you're saying basically is they
couldn't go get another job or somewhere else without some type of
authorization? OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not in this ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Unless somebody just hires them under a different
program, I guess.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Hunt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to check and make sure
you're warm enough.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Perfect today. I'm sure the air conditioner is not
working again. It doesn't work here on Tuesday or Wednesday. Senator
Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to check on these H2A's, have no tax liability
ultimately with the State, is that correct? So if we were to do the
withhold, then all they have to do is file at the end of the year and
they would get all those funds back, is that the understand? Or are
there H2A's that could ultimately have a tax liability in this State but
now we're not doing a withhold?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's a two part question, Senator Hise. Mr.Chairman,
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Give him a two part answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry to short circuit you there, but one, the
simple answer is the federal laws do not require any withholding. If
they're contracted and I think the current contract's $9.76 per hour and
they make 10 hours today, they get $97 and whatever that works out.
Nothing is withheld. So the federal are not requiring any to withhold.
The State it's grey. It's a grey area that you could withhold and yes,
they could file for a tax return and get it back, assuming they're here
at the end of the year, but most of them are gone out of this country by
November 1st, December 1st. There is just a slight few that's left until
the middle of December.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's the core of the question I'm trying to get at is
whether or not we do a withhold is separate. Would an individual on an
H2A have a tax liability to the State?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not to my knowledge they would. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Walters?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Senator Jackson.
I just say that the H2A worker program was probably the most stringent
program that we have in North Carolina that allows workers, seasonal
workers, to come to this State and we have to follow, from the time they
get here until they're released from or farms or wherever they're
working. I appreciate this and I think this here adds clarity to our
Department of Revenue. Thank you, Mr. Chair.</p>

Thank you, members any further discussion or debate?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr.
Chair[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Nesbitt[SPEAKER CHANGES]to Senator Jackson
Isn't this being done really for the benefit of the people that are
hiring these people so they don't have to keep up with the paperwork,
and do all the filings or withhold and Senator Riley etc when it's
absolutely not required[SPEAKER CHANGES]that's part of this[SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman I'm sorry[SPEAKER CHANGES]go right ahead [SPEAKER
CHANGES]that's part of the issue the other part is none of us knew about
this until after the fact and so we in 2012 had some really aggressive
auditors that were doing an audit on a farm not even in my district but
I do know the growers and we've all just put these down as wages I mean
just because that's the way we do it on the federal returns but when
they looked at that and there was no one there to pay it guess who they
looked to pay that four percent tax? and so yes this will help the
grower but also clarify our language that even the Department of Revenue
realizes it's a gray area and needs to be clarified[SPEAKER

Speaker: Hearing none. All those in favor of the motion say aye [aye],
all opposed, no [silence]. Motion carries. House 343, course procedure
and fee amendment. Representative Turner, I believe you have an
amendment, or there is an amendment?
Representative: Yes there is an amendment.
Speaker: Ms. Abrams is willing to explain the amendment. It is in the
packet.
Representative: The amendment you have before you, has three – two
technical changes and one – three technical changes. The first one
begins on page 7, line 13, of the bill. You already enacted a change to
this statute which has become session law. So we are going to conforming
the change in this bill with the change you have done already. Also, we
need to add to the effective date, that this section will become
effective August 1st instead of July 1st. Then, beginning on line 15 of
the amendment, it is just conforming the bill to a provision that is in
the house and senate bill. On the second page of the amendment,
beginning around line 5, is a recommendation made by the revenue study
committee that is just taking out language for a sunset on a register of
deeds fees because it needs to pass before July 1 – there is no
controversy with that. That is the amendment.
Speaker: Thank you. Motion to adopt the amendment by Senator Meredith.
Any further discussion on the amendment? If not, all those in favor of
the motion say aye [aye], all opposed, no [silence]. Amendment passes.
If you will go back and explain the bill please.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. This bill is entitled court fees
and procedures but there are no new court fees. This is clarifying who
pays what fees when, and begins with the arbitration caps. There is a
business fee clarification as to when it should be paid.
Speaker: Thank you. Senator Hartsville? Senator, the adoption of the
bill as amended, I don’t know if you want it rolled into a committee
substitute or not. Any discussion or debate?
Representative: What determines a complex business case and is the $1000
fee for taking it to an additional judiciary process in the court? Is
that fee already in current law, or is this a new fee?
Representative: Mr. Chairman, Susan Sites is here, and she works with
the judiciary committees, and may be able to answer that question.
Representative: That fee is already in current law, this is just
clarifying at what point in the process, and by whom, it is paid.
Representative; Follow up Mr. Chair? So somebody define for me a complex
business case please.
Representative: Sorry I cannot do that. I did not bring the definition
in front of me. it is really what it sounds like. We have business
courts in certain areas that are designed to deal with cases that deal
with complex issues in business law that are civil litigation. So this
is when they seek that designation, it goes to the business court. There
is a fee for that because there are designated judges that do that in a
business court, and all that.
Representative: Okay, so, never mind… I just want to understand what a
business court…. You are saying it is well defined, and if it is well
defined, then we are okay – is that what you are saying? Maybe Senator
Hartsville can add something to that MR. Chair?
Representative: It’s like a class action to certify certain things where
a court will determine if those criteria are met, and if so, they can
proceed to a business court, and if not, it will probably continue in
the superior court.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair.
Speaker: Thank you.</p>

Mr. Chair, yes, I'm sorry, I was able to pull it up. There is a
definition and basically I am going to paraphrase a little bit because
there is a list of things but a mandatory complex business cases and
action that involves a material issue related to one of seven things.
The law governing corporations except charitable and religious
organizations, securities law, anti-trust law, state trademark or unfair
competition law, intellectual property law, the internet electronic
commerce and biotechnology or tax law. I can give you the exact statutes
but that is kind of a quick summary of what it includes.

Thank you and we have a representative here from AOC if you would like
to speak on that.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Susan is exactly right.  It is a statutory
definition so it is something very well defined.

?? We have your name for the record that will be fine. Any further
discussion or debate?  Senator McKissick?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, I was just curious.  I noticed there are some provisions here
dealing with cites and counties paying costs and fees and it gives
certain time frames within which I guess, 45 days within which they need
to be paid and then there are other exemptions which are provided for,
could you provide a little more explanation as to what we are doing
there and how we are changing it just so I'll be very clear.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
There are, excuse me, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Go right ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
There are cases that Department of Social Services files on behalf of
their clients and we have waived the motion fee, $20 motion fee that
helps counties considerably and we have worked with their association.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you ma'am, so everybody is on board with this?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]

Thank you.  House Bill 754 Lease Purchase of Real Property Community
College.
Representative Starnes.  Glad you could make it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, ladies and gentlemen of the committee.  House Bill
754 is a bill to allow community colleges to acquire real property
through a lease purchase contract with their counties.  It makes a
technical change that basically says that only local funds can be used
for the lease purchase agreements, they have to be for contracts of more
than $100,000 and more than three years and is paid for with only local
funds as we have done with resolution of approval by the County
Commissioners.  It comes at the request of the community college system
and I would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, sir.  I believe we have an amendment. Senator Tucker, do you
wish to send forward an amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes sir. Any element of surprise from Representative Starnes is
wonderful.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman, I would be glad to?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
And Senator if you would explain the amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The amendment simply changes the effective date from July 1 to effective
when it becomes law.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay, we have a motion before us to accept the amendment by Senator
Meredith.
All those in favor please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Opposed no.  The amendment passes.  Okay, we are back to the original
bill.  Discussion or debate on the bill as amended?  Recommendation or
motion from Senator Cook to adopt the bill as amended.  All those in
favor please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Opposed No. The ayes have it.  Motion carries.  Thank you,
Representative Starnes and who will be running this?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]

Curtis.
All those is favor, please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Aye.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Committee.  This is an agency bill for the
Department of Public Safety.  I'll run through the sections of it.  It
is pretty cut and dry for the most part.  The first section just
substitutes Department of Public Safety for Department of Corrections
there</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me, Senator Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion for favorable report to the PCF ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is getting ?? Senator Hise, I was expecting that at
any moment. We have a motion by Senator Hise, unfavorable to the
original, favorable to the PCF. Any discussion or debate? Hearing none,
all those in favor...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair? Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. I do. Senator Nesbitt?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, I just caught something, saw something that
caught my eye. Section 9 of the bill, Highway Patrol enforcement
personnel hired after July 1st shall retire not later than their 62nd
birthday. Does that do anything to the retirement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator...excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, you may answer that or have, Heather, would
you like to answer? Either or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The policy has been to retire at 62. Some went over
with permission. This would establish 62 as the retirement date for any
of those that are hired after July 1st of this year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Senator Nesbitt?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I would assume that's alright, as long as they can
get in their full retirement. That's probably why they were letting some
of them run over if they needed another year or two. But I understand
what it is now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any further discussion? If not, we have a
motion before the committee. All those in favor of the motion please say
aye, opposed no. Motion carries. Thank you, sir. OK. Senator Sanderson
will be running it on the floor. Thank you.
A final bill for the day will be House Bill 371, Chiropractic Assistant
Certification. Welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senators, I have been before a
number of you already. This bill is a simple bill to amend the
chiropractic...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ...practice act. I'll be glad to take a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, very much. Senator Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion for favorable report. We ?? this in healthcare.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, we have a motion for favorable report from
Senator Hise? Any discussion or debate? Hearing none, all those in favor
please say aye, opposed...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have one quick question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does this mean we...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're a little late.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does this mean we won't get any more massages and ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I ?? are good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. Ayes have it. Motion carries. Thank you,
very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And if I were you I wouldn't admit to the last one.
Indeed.
