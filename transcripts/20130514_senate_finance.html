we have a stated goal in the North Carolina statutes to encourage
private investment in renewable energy and economic, and energy
efficiency. I would like to see it say encourage private investment in
economically competitive renewable energy and energy efficiency. Germany
is the one country which has achieved our 12.5 percent goal of
renewables from wind and solar. The cost, the electricity there now is 3
times what it costs us. We need to pay attention to that if we're going
to remain competitive in the region with other states that don't have
these kind of requirements. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Brad Ives, Assistant Secretary of DENR, you care to comment please,
sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. DENR fully supports this bill. We've
worked a lot to try and balance the needs of the military and
environmental groups on one side with the needs of wind farm developers
on the other hand. I think you've heard from the representative of the
economic development group how important these projects can be.
Especially for rural areas in North Carolina. We think what we've ended
up with here is a very good proposal that allows wind farms to move
forward, yet takes into account a lot of environmental and military
concerns. So we are fully in support of the bill as it's been presented
to this committee. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, sir.
Attila Neme- Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you for allowing me to speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Please, yes. Please state your name and who you represent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
My name is Attila Nemecz, and I am with, on the board of Friends of
Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge. I am in support of the bill, but
there is one important change that I would like to see in it, and that
would be to see an independent assessment of the wildlife concerns. As
it stands right now, same as the other speaker had, that wind companies
can cherry-pick data, and so they can take data from other parts of the
country. At this point, we do not have any wind facilities in the
coastal southeast at all, so comparable data is hard to come by. A few
years ago Invenergy signed contracts with private farmers and had a
project in place before the public was made aware of the project, The
Pantego Wind Project. This massive project would have put 500 foot
towers across 11,000 acres of farm land that were feeding grounds for
wintering tundra swans and snow geese, and is also prime habitat for
nesting bald eagles. Adjacent landowners were not informed of this
because there was no federal money involved, there was no state
permitting process involved, so there was no environmental review of the
process. A thorough permitting process would prevent such mistakes in
the future and would also prevent energy companies from investing a lot
of money into a project that will then be taken off the table for
environmental concerns. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Nemecz.
Mrs. Morris. Please identify yourself and pull the mic down a little bit
so we can see who you are. There you go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes. I'm Doris Morris, the Vice-President from the Friends of Pocosin
Lakes. Thank you from allowing me this time to speak. I'd also like to
say that we are very much in favor of DENR being in control of getting a
proper environmental impact study done for our state. We feel like they
have a much stronger interest in protecting our state than a wind
industry that comes in not really knowing what our surroundings are and
what we have to offer, as to prime example, Pantego Wind Energy. This
devastation here, between the bats, the water fowl, the bald eagles, and
with the bat lost here is actually harmful for the farmers ?? Even
though they would get the revenue, the bats would create a huge loss to
the farmers from the insects that normally would be eaten by the bats.
The farmers would have to be buying additional chemicals, which the
Agriculture Department has put out a release saying how expensive this
would really proceed further for our farmers, and they're already
struggling as it is also. And then you also have the trickle-down effect
on that. When the rain comes, then these chemicals are going into our
waters and then we've got additional water pollution. So we would kindly
appreciate any consideration that you would on amending this bill. Thank
you again for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mrs. Morris.
Senator Brown. Do you have a motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I think Senator Apodaca made...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Apodaca, did you make that motion?
I sincerely apologize. We have a motion by Senator Apodaca for a
favorable report. All in favor, please say aye. Opposed, no. Ayes have
it, motion carried.
Thank you, gentlemen, very much.

<p id="15:00">
I certainly appreciate your work. The next bill we're going to hear
today is a PCS Senate Bill 523 motion to hear the PCS by Senator Brock.
All in favor say aye. Thank you Senator Rucho. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you mister chairman and members of the finance committee. We had a
discussion before about this bill and working with the department of
revenue and a number of other folks regarding and trying to make this
confusing piece of legislation a little simpler. What we do in PCS is we
separate out the personal income tax from the remaining taxes and that
is personal income tax from franchise, corporate and sales tax. For a
person who does not file or fails to file which is a penalty, whether
you owed or not owed a refund a refund is due is a 100 dollar flat fee.
If the person is due a refund there is no additional cost and in reality
the cost of letting the department of revenue sit on your money is more
than sufficient. If it is owed taxes there is a 5% per month for a 10
month maximum failure to pay penalty. That is straight forward and
solves the problem. The other part of the problem that has proven to be
very difficult and challenging are there are a number of businesses
especially in the sales tax area that do submit their sales tax money
but never file their sales tax remittance slips and that poses a problem
with the department of revenue because as long as that money is not tied
with a the filed documents there's no ?? to distribute that money to the
municipalities in the counties and therefore there will be a as in all
of these taxes a failure to file penalty of 5% per month with a maximum
of 25% that is on the franchise tax, corporate tax and sales tax. That
should solve everyone's dilemma, that should clarify it so the
department of revenue fully understands what their responsibility is and
the same thing with the taxpayers. Mister chairman, the department of
revenue is here and they may want to explain. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Senator Rucho. If we could have a brief explanation please from the
department. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Tom Dixon I'm assistant secretary with the
department of revenue. We came to the chair a few months ago with a
problem where we have been administering the fail to file penalty for a
number of years incorrectly and back in the 90's when we had a new
computer system that system was programmed in essence to administer the
fail to file penalty like a fail to pay penalty. That was a programming
problem with that system and we have used that system for the past 18
years. We are now in the process of implementing a new computer system
called TIMS many of you know about that system and have heard about it.
The new system will have all 28 tax schedules that we administer in it
and so when we became aware of the problem with the fail to file penalty
and how it was being administered we approached the chair and explained
the problem and how the current law would affect tax payers. We knew
that there would be a significant adverse effect if it continued without
legislative change. There has been much discussion about this and this
bill I believe addresses much of that discussion in having a flat fee in
carving out individual income tax and allowing the other tax schedules
to continue to be administered as we administered them in the past.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Yes sir do I hear a motion coming?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir I think it's a wonderful bill now. Senator
Rucho doesn't pay his taxes anymore so it doesn't apply to him but to
the rest of us that do I think it is more than fair. Favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Apodaca. Motion has been made for a
favorable report. All in favor please say Aye. Oppose no. Aye is habit.
Thank you Senator Rucho.</p>

Speaker: Our next looks like it is going to be Senator Brock, since he
is up and jumping in line. Senate bill 269, just come forward at your
leisure or pleasure sir and start.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Sorry, I thought my name was
next on the agenda. Actually, I have an amendment to send forth.
Speaker: Members, have their copy?
Representative: They should, it is relatively simple.
Speaker: Does Senator Apodaka have his laptop?
Representative: He did not bring it, but if you look on page 1, section
3, it just changes the effective date to a date that is certain so
everybody can get their ducks in a row. Cindy had a copy.
Speaker: Would you like to….?
Representative: The amendment is in your packed and it just makes
certain that at the end of the fiscal year, so that you do not have to
worry about prorating taxes at some point midyear.
Speaker: Okay, Senator Brock do you want to discuss that any further or
would we entertain a motion for the amendment?
Representative: So moved.
Speaker: Thank you Senator Tillman, we do not need a speech from you
either. We will entertain that motion. [laughter]. So, all in favor
please say aye [aye], opposed, no [silence]. The aye’s have it. Thank
you sir. That’s the amendment, yeah. Senator Brock?
Representative: Just like to …. This simply DNX’s the part of the
airport that was annexed by the city many years ago, just to annex the
airplane to get the tax revenue off of, since that time the city has not
put any money into and if we get it back to where to the county has
lowered taxes on the planes.
Speaker: Thank you Senator Brock. Senator Tillman, without comment, I
believe you move for a favorable report as amended. Thank you. All in
favor please say aye [aye], opposed, no [silence]. The aye’s have it.
Thank you Senator Brock.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair, members of the committee.
Speaker: Next we have senate bill 103. Senator Hartsville?
Representative: This is a PCS. Do I hear a motion to accept a PCS?
Speaker: All in favor please say aye [aye]. Thank you it passes, Senator
Hartsville.
Representative: Thank you present members, senate, the committee. We are
getting all confused. The bill does essentially two things. You may or
may not know what special assessment bonds are because, while they are
available for a few years, they have not been used until fairly
recently, largely because of the economy. There is a project in Southern
Airdale County that is planning to use these but there is a current
expiration on the availability of this bonding mechanism as of July 1st
of this year. The bill does two things. It spells out an extension of
that, or the committee substitute. It extends the sunset for two years.
It also, more specifically, identifies the eligibility of the person in
the area that can adopt the assessment. It identifies – it has to be a
majority of property owners who own at least 2/3 of the property by
value, of the property in the zone. It is a voluntary kind of thing. It
is a supplemental assessment and is entered into. I will be glad to go
into any of the specific – to answer any specific questions.
Speaker: Thank you Senator Hartsville. Any questions from the committee?
Hearing none, motion for a favorable report from Senator Tillman. All in
favor please say aye [aye], opposed, no [silence]. The aye’s have it.
Motion carries. Thank you sir. Don’t go anywhere. Do you not have
another? Taking a senate pause here folks. Are you ready? Okay, let’s
see we are going to senate bill 248, and we have an amendment. Is it in
the packet? Okay. there is a motion to adopt the amendment. Any
discussion? Those in favor please say aye [aye], opposed, no [silence].
Amendment passes…
Representative: Mr. Chairman? I am a little concerned under rule 29, the
chairman may have a conflict with this next bill, since he does not
participate</p>

Maybe Senator Rucho ?? to handle this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I think I heard you say. Thank you for your concerns, Senator
Apodaca.  Senator Hartsell, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well said, Senator Pate.  The Financial implications of this bill,
actually on the Health side it adds hearing aid specialists to a group
that folks can chose. On the finance side, some of you may recall that
we had what I call the Treaty of Versailles that  was adopted in the
last session which separated the hearing aid specialists from the
audiologists.  Not an inconsequential fight. However, now that they are
separated, since there are fewer audiologists, they desire an increase
in the fee. Which isn’t terribly surprising and they have requested this
as at least for their license and so that’s what his bill does is it
increases that and spells out in very nauseating detail, the application
of the situation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions or comments from the, Senator Hise has a motion for a
favorable report as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, all those in favor please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oppose, no.  Ayes have it.  Thank you.  Our final bill for the day is
Senate Bill 463. Senator Woodard. Thank you, Senator Woodard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the committee.  Before
you’s a statute that outlines the standards for jail dormitories of 64
beds. This bills will simply lower the threshold for such facilities
from counties of 300,000 population to 250,000 population. I’d be happy
to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions from the Committee?  Senator Allran.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What effect does that have money wise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There’s no affect at all on this. It simply moves the threshold down and
allows currently 1 county is eligible, is in the
250,000-300,000threshold.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, it’s local funding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ve noted that you put it in for counties
with populations in excess of 250,000 and you’ve left out the other
counties. Tell me why if it’s good for some it’s not for the others
then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This was a request from Durham county. Which falls in that.  If there
are other counties that would like to do that I’d certainly be amenable
to lowering that threshold or doing away with the threshold.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and we may come to you with an amendment to take care of some
others. This is a public bill isn’t it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct, this is a general statute so it had to be a public bill.
So we’d be amenable to that maybe staff could help me. I think the
concern of why this threshold was placed in there was for counties who
may overextend their debt service if they wanted to have a larger
facility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? would you like to respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, enlighten us a little bit on the debt limits of some of those
counties and why we might be doing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I actually don’t have that specific information about the debt limit, I
can say it just applies to the larger counties at this point. It just
applies to Wake, Mecklenburg, Cumberland, Guilford and Forsythe at this
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I still haven’t heard a good explanation of why we’re doing the
threshold this way and since debt limits and so forth don’t seem to be
the factor involved here at least I’m not hearing that it is, the
response from either or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m not sure why the policy was adopted in the first place, why they
limited it to just the large counties in the first place. What this do
would increase the number of counties can use that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chairman, I won’t hold the bill up I want to make a motion for
favorable, we’ll work on this if we need to I’ll check with a couple of
them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Tillman.  Senator Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May just be a technical question but the title of the bill says that
counties that have an excess population of 250,000 inmates, and the bill
itself says population of 250,000. I hope we do not have a county with
more than 250,000 inmates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In spite of the fact that it’s Senator Apodaca’s home county, it does
not apply to Durham county I can assure you.  That’s a typo.</p>
