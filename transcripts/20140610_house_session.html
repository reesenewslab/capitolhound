[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would everyone please bow their heads and pray with
me? Heavenly father, thank you for allowing us to live in a country
where we have the freedom to choose those individuals who would
represent us in government and those elected officials have the freedom

carry on the duties of our office, give each one of us the courage to do
the right thing and not base our decisions on where the political wind
might be blowing at that particular moment. Help us to put our political
differences aside and give us the strength and the patience to work
together – Democrats and Republicans for the benefit of our constituents
and the preservation of our great state as a wonderful place to live and
raise our families. I humbly ask these things, lord, in the holy name of
your son ?? Jesus Christ.

Chairman: Representative West, please state your purpose.
Representative West: To debate the resolution.
Chairman: Okay, the gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution
West: Thank you Mr. Speaker and Members of the House. It is a great
honor for me to be here today to speak about not only my friend, but I
venture to say a friend of everyone on this floor and in the gallery
today. Zeb was a true friend: if you had an issue, Zeb had an issue –
that was the kind of friend he was. Zeb was a very proud man. He was
proud of his Cherokee heritage. He use to come into my office and tell
the story of his grandmother Percell, who was raised on the Indian
Nation, on what is now Oklahoma. When Zeb was a young man, his
grandmother Percell came back to Waynesville and was visiting everyone.
Zeb did not know what to talk to her about and so he went up to her and
said, “Grandmother Percell, I guess you have been a life long Democrat.”
And she said, “Well no Zeb, I am a registered Republican.” Zeb did not
know what to say – his head kind of dropped. His grandmother looked at
him and told him not to worry as she would always vote for the man. Zeb
said, “she’s a Repbulican.” Zeb was very proud of being a veteran. He
was instrumental in creating the rest home for the veterans. He secured
some of the first money for that project. Zeb was very proud of his
mountain heritage. He use to love to tell the story about his uncle,
Felix Eugene Alley, who was a judge in Waynesville and was a….</p>

<p id="010:00">
He came to be a judge and later on he served in this body, and he loved
to tell the story, Zeb loved to tell the story about when Judge Alley
was a young man up in Cashiers Valley there was this lady that came in
with her parents in the summer. People came to Cashiers Valley in the
summer to spend the summer in Cashiers valley. And they were all trying
to court this girl. And so when Judge Alley got a little older he wrote
a book and in that book he told the story about his courtship in
Cashiers Valley and it was called the Ballad of Kidder Cole. And Zeb
would love to come to my office and he could recite that ballad word for
word. I can't do that, but I want to read that Ballad for Zeb. It's
called A Ballad of Kidder Cole. My name is Felix Eugene Alley, My best
girl lives in Cashiers Valley; She's the joy of my soul, And her name is
Kidder Cole. Oh, my sweet little Kidder girl, you cause my head to spin
and whirl. I'm yours and you're mine, long as the sun and stars still
shine. I don't know, it must have been by chance. Excuse me. Way last
fall when I went to a dance, I was to dance with Kidder the live-long
night but I got my time beat by Charlie Wright. If I ever have to have a
fight, I hope it will be with Charlie Wright, for he was the ruin of my
soul when he beat my time with Kidder Cole. When the dance was over I
went away to bide my time till another day when I could cause trouble
and pain and blight to sadden the soul of Charlie Wright. But she came
back the following spring, and oh, how I made my banjo ring. It helped
me get my spirit right, to beat the time of Charlie Wright. Kidder came
home the first of June, and I sang my song and played my tune. I
commenced trying with all my might to put one over on Charlie Wright.
When the speaking was over we had a dance, and then and there I found my
chance to make my peace with Kidder Cole, and beat Charlie Wright;
confound his soul. Charlie came in an hour or so, but when he saw me
with Kidder he turned to go back to his home with a saddened soul, for
I'd beat his time with Kidder Cole. I've always heard the old folks say
that every dog will have his day. And now all of Charlie's joy has
passed for I've succeeded in beating him at last. Oh, yes Kidder is
sweet, and it won't be long until we meet, at her home in Cashiers
Valley and she'll change her name to Alley. Zeb loved that poem, or that
ballad, he always would recite it. And when we were out of session,
there was not a weekend went by that I didn't get a call from Zeb. He
would talk and he would talk and he would bring me up to speed on
everything in Raleigh. And when he'd get ready to go, he'd always say
Roger, I love you. And I would always say back I love you too, Zeb. I
commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Daughtry, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can't speak any, I can't carry anything,
I couldn't say anything that could beat what Roger just told you about
Zeb, but I had known him for so many years even before I got to the
legislator, he was famous for his lobbying ability. He was the only guy
I know that was a, he was a solid democrat, but he was a lobbyist in
such a way that if he told you something, he would tell you the truth
about an issue and you could take it to the bank. You could vote your
conscience, but Zeb would be as truthful as he could be to whoever he
was lobbying. I think he's the best lobbyist that's ever been in this
building. He was well liked not only by people in his party, but by
everybody that knew him. You couldn't help but like him. And I can't
remember any jokes that he told me that I could tell in this chamber,
but I enjoyed going to his house. He cooked wonderful meals for many
people in those days when lobbyists could cook meals for you. That was a
long time ago. Wish they could now. But I can only say that I have never
met anyone that I enjoy his company as much as I did Zeb and I certainly
would also commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak on the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized

<p id="015:00">
Very much that could be said 'cause most of you knew Zeb one way or the
other. I remember many of the things he talked about. Particularly his
days with the Young Democrats and how they went to all these conventions
and things like that. And I think the thing I remember, one of the
things I remember most about him is sittin' down there in the snack bar
with Roger West and giving Roger West more than he could ask for. And it
amazed me because Roger being of the stripe that he is, that is a
Republican, and Zeb being of the stripe he was, which was a Democrat, I
never saw two folks who got along so well together. It always gave me
hope that one day, it would rub off on a whole lot of us. But be that as
it may, one thing about Zeb, Zeb always, always came to me and said,
&quot; Now you, were in the Korean Conflict.&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah,
Zeb, I was there too.&quot; He said, &quot;But I was over there.&quot; I
said, &quot;Yeah, Zeb, and I was over here.&quot; In the meantime
though, if you ever wanted to know anything about anything going on, Zeb
was the person to do it. Most of the lobbyist that we have around here
are very honest people and you can count on their word. Zeb was more
than extraordinary in that he always knew his subject, he always knew
what he was talking about, he always was truthful, and he never let you
down. This body and this state will miss Zeb Alley and we should all pay
honor and homage to him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Wilkins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the resolution, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. If you never received a US Flag Lapel Pin from
Zeb Alley, the only reason you didn't was that you never walked into
this building. I have no idea, Representative West may know, how many
flag pins Zeb gave away. A million? You make your guess. But he was, he
was quite proud of his time in the military. He was quite proud that he
was able to give back to a country that had given so much to him. Zeb
had a cat named Wilkins. The cat was not named for this Representative
Wilkins. It was named for former Representative Mike Wilkins who gave
Zeb the cat. So, Wilkins sort of ruled the house and the fact is Wilkins
was always rather ornery. Zeb never was. He was the perfect gentleman.
And I commend this resolution in his memory to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Members of the House. Zeb Alley is a man who you
can truly say that you never heard someone say a bad word about. I think
he was universally liked by everyone, admired by everyone. I knew him
fairly well through Roger West, who he hung out with a lot. But I also
had some kinship with him because he was a Korean War Veteran. Now I was
too young to be a Korean War Veteran but I did serve in Korea, but not
'til 30 years after the conflict had ended. But Zeb was probably most
proud of his service to this country. He was an American first. And to
have been wounded in that conflict and to do what he did, he pretty much
personifies what we talk about when we have our resolutions
commemorating our veterans. And you may not know this, the Korean War's
known as the forgotten war. And history really hasn't given it the
coverage that it perhaps should have because it was still people like
Zeb Alley who went over there and bled and died and suffered and I can
tell you Korea[RECORDING ENDS]</p>

Harsh environment. In the winter it's weather is dominated by Siberia,
and in the winter the cold just eats right through you. I cannot imagine
being out and having to fight in that kind of weather day after day. It
was so cold. I remember when I was up on the DMZ, in a bunker for a
time, the PX truck would come once a day and I could get a Coke off a
that, leave it outside for a minute, and drink it with ice in it. I've
never seen such cold. In the summer, it was brutally hot. Monsoons, they
do have monsoon rain there. And you'll have a little creek, and it will
become a raging river within minutes of the rain starting to pour down.
Korea has come a long way. They've had great GDP growth, but back then
it had been denuded by the Japanese during World War II, and prior to,
there were no big trees. You could be walking across country and
suddenly the most vile odor would almost overcome you. They had rice
paddies for centuries. It was just an incredible place for me. I used to
think about how do the people that actually fought there, like Zeb
Alley, how do they make it? Their sacrifice, his sacrifice, can never be
repaid. And he was a forward observer. If you don't know what a forward
observer is that's an artillery spotter who is up on the front in the
most dangerous areas, sometimes maybe before the front, trying to find
targets to radio back to the guns to shoot at. And there's nobody the
enemy soldier wants to kill more than a forward observer, because the
forward observer is the one that reigns that steel and explosions down
on them. So they are, they are sought out by snipers and enemy soldiers.
And to have survived such an ordeal, and come back here, and still have
been the man he was is just inspiring to me. And I would just say this
to pages and young people, I hope you will take the time to educate
yourself, because nobody can really give you an education. It's
something you have to give yourself. That you will take the time to seek
out and learn about some of the people who have preceded you as great
Americans. And to understand what you have to breathe free in America.
And people like Zeb Alley are the ones that gave this to us, and I
cannot support this resolution any greater. Thank you Mr. Speaker.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Davis please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Gentleman's recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, this bill
addresses the payment of the $60 fee that is charged for criminal
mediation. Under the present system that we have, when this fee is
implemented, a judge has the authority to excuse the fee, but the judge
doesn't have any authority to enforce the payment of the fee. And a lot
of times what happens is somebody might go through mediation and it goes
on, it goes on, it goes on and then finally if the mediation doesn't
work out, then it's supposed to go back to the District Attorney for
prosecution and the District Attorney tries to contact the witness. The
witness is either forgotten about it, doesn't care about it, died,
moved. So, the bottom line is, they can't get the $60. So, in an effort
to give some sort of 'meat' to the statute, to allow the collection of
that money, this statute provides that when they enter the mediation,
before they sign on, they are told, &quot;You are gonna have to pay this
$60 fee as part of the mediation process.&quot; And then if the
mediation is completed and is successful then they will be charged the
$60 fee, which has to be done within 45 days of when the mediation has
been completed. If they don't pay the money, then it will go back to the
District Attorney's office, and they will prosecute it. So, hopefully
this will give what is not there now, and that is something to encourage
people to pay the mediation fee, and I would ask you to support that.
The second section of the bill was a [?] amendment offered by
Representative Rick Glazier, which I can send it to you during the
judiciary subcommittee where this was heard. This has to deal with the
child support guidelines that are in effect with our statutes. And as it
stands now, the child support guidelines deal with presumptions of
amount of child support that a parent, a non-custodial parent, will pay
for his children, taking into consideration, their income and the
mother's income. What this does is it also gives the judges the
authority to consider the amount of retroactive child support. There is
some discrepancy in how it's handled now in that the case law says that
when it comes to retroactive child support you're really supposed to
have a hearing. You're supposed to go into how much money is really
spent on that child for their needs and a judge makes a determination of
what the retro amount should be. But after the guidelines went into
effect, most judges simply say, &quot;OK. I have found your obligation
to be X. It's been Y number of months since the action was brought. So,
you multiply Y times X and that's gonna be your child support
arrearage.&quot; So, it really kind of left it in limbo about how a
court would compute that. But this will add clarity to that and it'll
specify that the judge will determine that amount, based upon the child
support determination. And I commend you that you support that as well.
I'll be happy to answer any questions, if there are any.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. Members of the body, we had a
very thorough debate on this bill last week. I went home over the
weekend and had a lot of phone calls and lot of questions and I expected
a lot of questions to be sitting around the fare. However, my reference
to Rick Flair, the wrestler, prompted a bunch of questions. And folks,
before asking me they said you in a very enduring way referred some of
your colleagues to Rick Flair and his little cast of wiley characters
that he ran around with. They say which one of them is Rick Flair. So I
scratched my head and I thought for a minute and I said, well it had to
be Representative Edgar Starnes because he had me in a real good figure
for leg lock which was Rick Flair’s special move, but then I got to look
at his hair.</p>

<p id="045:00">
And I realized he couldn’t be Rick Flair, he doesn’t have the hair for
it. So, Edgar you’re gonna have to get your wig out if you want to be
the nature boy. But on a serious note, folks this is a very important
issue to us, particularly in rural counties and these fairs provide an
opportunity as was pointed out last week to allow kids to see farm
animals, to have ?? groups to get involved and these groups are run by
Lions clubs, Rotary clubs, American legions. I wanna point out, these
folks don’t have paid employees and the money that they raise from these
act fares, where’s that money invested? They’re invested back in the
community. There are no full profit companies that are gonna be getting
these exemptions and this is just really big for us, folks in the rural
parks of North Carolina. Will some of these fares go by the wayside? My
answer to that is, absolutely. And I don’t wanna see these fares fall by
the wayside. I just ask you to just vote and in the words of Weiss, we
had a good vote last week. I hope we get a good vote today and be glad
to take any questions. Thank You so much.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We’ve had a lot of debate on

really benefits a lot of us who are in the chamber today. ?? comes from
?? county steal a statement those communities and the young people along
with other groups get a chance to experience a farm life and all that
goes on in our rural communities. And we just asked if a chance today to
give these fairs an opportunity to continue to operate and I wanna thank
Representatives Holloway, ?? and Dobson for their words last week and we
just ask you all just to work on this today, we know another day is
coming but for today, let’s just focus on this and give us a chance to
move this piece forward and I really appreciate that. Thank You, Mr.

Representative Stone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen, I rise
to speak in support of the bill. It brings back so many memories growing
up and opportunities that so many kids in my community may not had had
we not had the Lee County fair. I can remember in Kindergarten walking
from our New ?? School going all the way to the fair grounds to see the
animals and bring back the memories of going through and looking at the
jams, the jellies and all the animals that live in the city we would
never see. It was important because as I look back there was a lot of
kids that would never have the opportunity to go at all. What are the
things our fairs have always done is we allowed all the kids to come in
for free, our handicapped are allowed to come in for free, and our
seniors have been allowed to come in for free. So we, as the Lee County
community really accepted our community to come and take a look. We do a
demonstration every year of how tobacco is cured, we actually have a ??
mill to show the youngsters how we actually cut wood from many year ago.
The other things is, so much has already been said is our Lions Club
members are all volunteers, there is no full profit. There are all
retired business community leaders that come together to donate their
time and work hard. All that money goes back to our community. So, I’m
not saying there’s no other non-profits that are deserving. I’ll just
say that this non-profit has a higher standard than any other
non-profits that I’m aware of. So I wanna ask you to support this bill
today so our community fairs can go forth and continue to provide the
great services to all of our community citizens who may not have that
opportunity if we didn’t have this once a year event. We had a great
vote last week, and I’d ask you to support this bill today as well.
Thank You.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I won’t tell my normal South Carolina education joke. But, as I read
this bill, we’re talking about an exemption of the sales tax imposed
upon an admission charge to a county fair. So, if that’s what we’re
talking about, let’s say its a ten dollar ticket to a county fair. I
believe Mecklenburg County probably has the highest sales tax in the
state. About seven and a half percent. So that means on a ten dollar
ticket we’re talking about a sales tax of seventy-five cents. If you can
sit here and honestly tell me we’re going to close agricultural affairs
because of a surcharge for twenty-five to fifty cents per ticket, this
sales tax isn’t the problem with that agricultural affairs. This body
made a decision, good, bad, or indifferent, of where we were going to go
with tax policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if the gentleman will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d be happy to yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you there. My question relates to if you give the ticket to
someone, as we give so many away in our community, you still have to pay
the sales tax. So the question becomes when you’re helping your
community as we help so many youngsters in school, with so many seniors
in our community, so many people with disabilities, the blind, who pays
the sales tax on a ticket that’s given away for free because in North
Carolina you still have to pay the sales tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is my understanding, Representative Stone, that tickets given away
free of charge do not have to pay sales tax. That is what my
understanding is from the finance group. I can be wrong but that’s my
understanding. There has to be an actual cash transaction to implement a
sales tax. I go back to my point though, we’ve made a decision, good,
bad, or indifferent, if went to undo, start pulling the string on a
shirt, and say, “Hey, you know what. This is important to my group. Hey
I got an idea, let’s start not charging sales tax to truckers because
that’s real important to me, too. And then next week we’re going to do
it for lawyers because I know there’s a bunch of lawyers here. Every
time we start talking about legal fees, they start talking like they’re
billing by the hour in here.” You know, we’ve got to decide are we going
to do this or are we not going to do this. And, to me, this is a prime
case where we have to say no. We’ve made a decision, we have to say no.
I’d ask us to honor a tax policy we implemented last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman, we’re going to take a vote on this bill at 4 pm.
But please be respectful of other people’s time that would like to speak
to the bill. Representative Charles Graham, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister Speaker. I just want to stand up and support what
we’re doing here today. And I’m going to support it because it’s the
thing we need to do to support our rural, agricultural affairs in the
state of North Carolina. We have an opportunity here to show good will
to our rural counties, to our poor ?? communities, and to children,
senior citizens, the disabled, the blind, all those individuals who
would not have this opportunity if, in my opinion,  we don’t support
this legislation. Here’s an opportunity to say, to our rural counties,
“We support you.” This is rural vs. urban. Our rural counties need this.
I encourage you to support it. Give our folks, who had this opportunity,
one time a year to go experience the opportunities that are provided at
these events. And I ask you to seriously consider this and I encourage
your support. Thank you.

Representative Warren, please state your purpose.

Yes I do.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway, I came to Raleigh to try to do the right thing.
And sometimes it gets clouded, am I’m very clouded on this issue.
Because I almost hate to admit Representative Jeter took the words right
out of my mouth. I don’t understand apparently the bill because, in my
mind, not to reiterate everything he said, this is a part of a tax
revision plan. And if you give away a ticket there is no financial
transaction. So a tax on nothing would be nothing. But I keep hearing
people say this is going to prevent kids coming into the…</p>

<p id="055:00">
Fair for free, this is going to close down the fairs. I really don't
understand, are we talking about a tax on the financial transaction of
the purchase of a ticket or is there something more extenuating that I
don't understand because I would like to support the bill, I voted
against it. But if I am missing something here you need to clarify that
for me because I would like to do right thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for the question, Representative Warren. I
want to just first start off by saying that if folks in here believe
that this will be only exemption that will be floating out there in the
land of exemptions, they are wrong. The Senate just gave one,
Representative Stone to the law house. You might be getting ready to
vote for some more exemptions, so you better read your bills really
closely. The reason this is really gonna hurt communities is you have
got rural area that are not making much money on these fairs, you got
groups like the lion's club, the rotary club, the American legions -
these guys, it's all volunteer, they are not set up to have to do the
paper work, to do all the things that has to go into collecting these
sale taxes remitted into the state and when you have to start increasing
ticket process and they will to make up for the tax. It could start to
turn people, even though I realize Mecklenburg County has got a big
bunch of sales tax, if they wanna donate a portion out of the state to
pay for us rural countess we will be happy to let him do that, but these
folks are not the most wealthy folks. It’s once a year, I respect ?? tax
bill, I respect our tax reform bill, I respect other non-profits but I
would argue that these non-profits are little bit different, again
volunteers put the money right back in the community, these are not
folks waking out carrying cash out by the bags. They are not at all and
what they do carry out they give back to the community and I do agree
this is kind of Urban vs Rural and I understand from an urban county,
you don't come to the Stokes County fair, you don't come to fairs like
in Representative stone’s district. We love to have you but it’s
probably too far for you to drive but it's just really big for our
communities and I would really hate to see these go by the wayside and
we keep hearing this to open up the gates. Gates aren't open, it’s got
to go through the Senate and I would think this body would really wanna
know which wrestler I can pair Senator Rucho to, I mean he’s got to be
somebody really cool and but anyway that's what I think it does. I think
it will shut these fares down and may only be 70 cents but that's a lot
and advertising’s key.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, please state you purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the
house. Last Thursday when this bill came up it wasn't the first time
that exemptions have been talked about and you know that we have talked
about it a couple of years here to exempt or not to exempt, exempt them
all or exempt some. Representative Holloway is correct, there will be
exemptions coming forth, there are now, throughout this budget process
as the papers fly back and forth from the both chambers. But what we
don't do enough of up here is talk among ourselves when we are not in
our community because we are not all in the communities. I don't think
that we do enough of realizing the ?? that spread out across the state
from when we pass legislation quickly. Whether it's tax reform, what are
those ??  what are their impacts to the human aspect of what we do when
we are developing policy. I said here that I had drawn up an amendment
last Thursday that would open this up for all the arts, historical
organizations and all the cultural organizations because I still believe
that this is a good bill today. This is a bill about North Carolina, yes
you’ve passed the tax reform, we voted on the ?? tax bill that all of
these non-profits were losing their exemptions but it's never over and
just because we voted and you probably gonna hear a lot more between now
and next year. I chose to withdraw that amendment while I never
submitted it but I had it drawn up. I wanted the debate and the talk to
go on.</p>

I have heard from many of you on the other side, over the weekend, this
is an issue that I don't think we have all realized the tentacle impact
and the human aspect of the non-profits and what they contribute to this
state, and I believe that conversation has to be ongoing. We can start
it today in a small way, by saying, &quot;Yes, we voted for tax reform
in this state, but we also recognize that sometimes you come back and
you correct something that was wrong.&quot; So this is a small start,
and I hope that we all, in here, can look at this from our conscience
side. It isn't all about the big businesses and the for-profits, that's
not what's made North Carolina in the past.  It will grow us in the
future, but it will not take away that human aspect of what goes on
throughout this state with non-profits. I'm asking you today to support
this one step, that we're listening, and we are getting the human side
of what we do up here, in a far greater way than one, huge tax reform
bill.  We're always reforming; if we're not, we're not doing our job.
Let's keep talking, let's keep working across the aisle, let's do what
we heard with the lobbyist who was a Democrat and a member who was a
Republican for years here.  We listened, we talked, and we acted.  So
I'm asking you today to put it all aside, please vote yes on this and
let's keep the conversation going for our non-profits in this state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady's recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House, I did not stand last
week and speak against this bill, but you've heard several of the other
members, Representative Jeter, started a very strong conversation, and
he's exactly right.  We all debated, and worked for many, many months on
the tax reform issue, and this is the first string that starts the
unraveling of that bill.  There'll be many other amendments; there will
be some in the morning, in Finance, I'm sure of that. If you want to
keep the tax reform package in place, you cannot begin to unravel it.
Now this is only $400,000, that's not a huge amount of money in the
concept of what the budget is doing.  But there's a fix to this, a
pretty easy fix.  There is no requirement that there has to be a gate
admission charge.  So all of these agricultural fairs, if they opted to
do so, could literally do a free admission to all of these children that
come to the fairs.  Or, free admission on a certain day.  I know there's
provisions made at the Dixie Classic Fair, for families, and so there's
all kind of options there.  No requirement that there is admission
charged.  If you charge no admission, there is no sales tax.  So, that's
a fix that should be probably considered.  I just ask you, with pain in
my heart, don't start unraveling what we all proudly supported last
time.  And, yes, things change, and circumstances change, but this bill,

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes this gentleman wish to debate
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill for a
period ?? take 3 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Than you Mr. Speaker ladies and gentlemen of house
this is an important issue and I voted for the bill last Thursday. I
realize that there were some problems with it but that I think if we
continue to let this bill advance we create a bigger problem than the
one we are trying to solve. When we did tax reform, there was something
in there that people didn't like but whether you like it didn't like it,
it was fair. It treated all people equally and that was a very important
platform that we use in going forward when we did tax reform. Now this
year tax reform and the personal income tax set to go from 5.8% 5.75%
there is gonna be another drop in personal income tax. So how we are
going to pay for that, if revenue hits the trigger than the cooperative
income tax will drop how we gonna pay for that we love to be able to
give everybody a tax break or tax credit or some tax incentive but at
some point in time we have to pay for, we have to do things in this body
that are rational that are well thought out and that makes sense and
that what we did last year with tax reform now we come and we decide
where we got barish remorse so I am gonna undo it, we can't do that we
just had the budget that came out today, there are some painful cuts in
there, we are working to live within our means we would never be able to
live within our means if we continue to take money off the table. I have
a fair as it gonna hurt our people but in spite of that we have to look
at the big picture that we promise to the public wet would deliver, I
hope we will not no on this bill today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before the house is to pass the house
bill 1201 on its third grading. All in favor vote aye all oppose vote
no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will let the machine record

Speaker 1:  …areas, and I would ask your support. Mr. President I have
an amendment that I would like to set forth at this time.
Chairman: The gentleman is recognized to set forth an amendment. The
clerk will read.
Clerk: Rep. [xx] moves to amend the bill on page 2, line 20, by amending
the line to read.
Rep.: Thank you Mr. President. This amendment was requested by the state
auditor’s office and various versions of this bill. We want to make sure
that the state auditor is not expressly prohibited from being able to
audit this entity. So, this just includes that OSBM, the state auditor,
or any internal auditors, can audit the books of this entity. I would
move for adoption and ask for your support.
Chairman: Discussion or debate on the amendment? If not, the question
before the House is the amendment, as set forth by Representative
Murray, for the house committee substitute of House Bill 1031. All in
favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
[brief silence] The clerk will now record the vote. 113 having voted in
the affirmative, 1 in the negative, the amendment passes. We are now
back on the Bill. Representative Wilkens is recognized to set forth an
amendment. The clerk will read.
Clerk: Rep. Wilkens moves to amend the bill on page 4, line 13, by
rewriting the line to read.
Rep. Wilkens: Thank you Mr. Speaker. This does take you to page 4, it
takes you to the reporting section of the bill. If you recall, last
Thursday, I had some qualms about the affect of the changes brought
about by this bill – the effect on our rural communities. I still have
those same qualms, those same misgivings. Hopefully, the edge of that
can be reduced with the passage of this amendment. This piece is going
to put the data, the reported data, into certain categories which will
give a better picture of what we are doing, and how we are doing it, and
where we are doing it. Essentially, what this does, in two different
places, is add collection and reporting of data by tier. I really think
this will be important to your rural areas and representatives, and I
ask you to support the amendment.
Chairman: Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
Rep. Moore: For a motion.
Chairman: The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
Rep. Moore: Move that the amendment is on the table.
Chairman: Motion having been made by Representative Moore, seconded by
Representative Cleveland. The motion is not debatable. The question
before the House is to lie upon the table the amendment set forth by
Representative Wilkens for the house committee substitute of House Bill
1031. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote. The clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will record the vote. 62 having voted in the
affirmative, 53 in the negative, the motion passes. Representative
Wydell has motioned to set forth an amendment. The clerk will now read.
Cler: Rep. Wydell moves to amend the bill on page 2, lines 46 and 47, by
deleting.
Rep. Wydell : Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and Gentleman of the
House, many of you heard me stand up and talk about disparity between
the rural and urban areas of North Carolina. This amendment is pretty
simple. It just gives some representation from the Tier 1 and 2 counties
in the state. It doesn’t change anything else about who to go to
appoint, you still have no more than two members in the prosperity zone,
as laid out in the Bill, it allows the president, pro tim of the senate,
and speaker of the house to make their appointments, but requires that
at least one of their appointees be from a tier 1 area and a tier 2
county, it makes sure that no two appointees come from the same
prosperity zone. I am concerned, just as Representative Wilkens said, in
that sometimes our focus is more on the urban areas seems like…</p>

The Gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Baskerville, moves to amend the bill on page nine, lines
37, 38, by inserting between the lines the following.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Gentleman is recognized to the debate the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have not been in the Legislature as long as
some but just in the short period I've been here, I've noticed a trend
and that is dealing with prestigious boards. Political appointees to
those prestigious boards and commissions are often the same folks that's
major political donors to candidates. And my amendment simply requires
more disclosure from political appointees so that the public will have
more information about who is going on these boards. My amendment
requires that for political appointees, they have to disclose if they've
raised money for candidates. If they have gathered political
contributions for others for candidates. If they are participating in a
political action committee that has engaged in political contribution
activity. It requires those disclosures upon that appointee being
notified that they are going to be appointed to a board. And that is so
very important so that the public will feel like we are committed to
providing transparency to our state government dealings. Now, when I was
doing some research to try to figure out how to best present this to my
colleagues here, I found a bill back from the 2009 session that was
entitled, &quot;Disclosure of Campaign Contribution Activity by
Appointees to Positions in State Government&quot;. This was a bill that
was filed in 2009, the primary sponsors were the gentleman from
Fayetteville, Mr. Glazier, the gentleman from Wake County, Mr. Stam,
gentleman from Mecklenburg County, our Speaker, Mr. Tillis. And I pulled
the language of my amendment, straight from that bill that passed in
2009, 115 to zero. Now this, you might say that, &quot;We already have
rules or laws that govern this sort of thing.&quot; Well, we don't. When
I looked at the State Ethics Act, there is no requirement of disclosure
of the political contributions that appointees to boards give. Merely a
simple yes or no statement on the Statement of Economic Activity
[SPEAKER INTERRUPTS: Mr. Speaker] as to whether or not that person
engaged in political engineering.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker?

Please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I wondered if the gentleman
would yield for a quick question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Baskerville, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you have
that bill number from 2009, sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, that is 944.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. And once again, it passed 115 to zero.
Speaker Tillis, Representative Stam were the primary sponsors of this,
and the chamber thought it was good to have transparency with the
political appointees back in 2009 and I think the same is necessary
today as well. I urge your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Stam, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I promise, Representative Baskerville,
I had my light on before he mentioned my name or the bill. I thought we
passed that bill. [LAUGHTER] But I think it had an unusual fate in the
senate. But let’s try it again. Let’s send it back to them again, and
maybe they’ll include it in the bill. I support the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Collins, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Or the amendment sponsor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just reading on
the, I believe it’s the first page, about line 26-27, under subsection,
it’s number 4 under whatever section that is. When it says something
about any 501c3 or 501c4, does that mean the reporting would go right on
down to whatever, if I’m in one of those positions and I contribute to
my church or any other tax-free organization? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you
repeat that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think I’m on, well maybe I’m not on
page 1. Hang on a minute, let me see. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think I’m on page, about line 27. It says any
organization that’s a 501c3 or 501c4, wouldn’t that include, I think
that includes my church. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If your church is engaging in
political activity, yes sir. But this deals with political action
committees. Political 501c3s and 4s. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As I read it,
it says any organization that is a 501c3 or 501c4 organization under the
Internal Revenue code. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If, let’s look at the title of
the bill. This is dealing with political contributions, fund raising.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative, if you read the language there of my
amendment, it’s dealing with political contributions. It’s dealing with
fund raising in a political capacity, not religious contributions or
scientific contributions or anything like that might be associated with
some of those other not-for-profits. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would Representative Baskerville yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Baskerville, I’d like to follow up on the questions that the gentleman
from Nash just propounded to you, and specifically would refer you to
that same section of your bill, excuse me of your amendment. That would
be lines 26 through 28 of the first page. And where it reads, because I
see where we have any political party in North Carolina, and then I
think this is the operative language I’m asking you about. Or any
organization that is a 501c3 or 501c4 organization under the Internal
Revenue code. First of all, does the gentleman acknowledge that that is
the way the language reads? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will acknowledge that
the amendment says a candidate for the office with authority to make an
appointment or a political committee controlled by a candidate with the
authority is to make that appointment a political action committee,
registered with the state board of elections. Any political party in
North Carolina, or any organization that is a 501c3 or 501c4
organization. Yes, I will acknowledge that is the language. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can the gentleman not clearly see from the way that this was written,
that if this was passed in the manner the gentleman has drafted, that
this would in fact require disclosures to any charitable foundation. The
way your wording of your amendment, it is not limited to political. Does
the gentleman see that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, I don’t.</p>

<p id="085:00">
What I see, I’m just going to engage a little statutory interpretation,
the header of the section is relevant political committee. Now if my
colleague and fellow attorney is going to interpret the statute, you
have to look at the preceding language before that to give some context
or to define what the terms are to come after that. So if you want to
define a relevant political committee, which is the title of that
section, as a church group, you’re free to do that. I don’t read it that
way. But I would certainly accept any amendment to clarify that, because
that’s not my issue with that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Moore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to debate the
amendment, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may be
recognized unless someone is rising to put a question to Representative
Moore? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I would ask Representative Moore a
question, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, I wonder, I
think that there is an intent that everyone has but maybe the language
needs to be tweaked just a bit, and I wonder if instead of debating the
amendment, if you would allow and if Representative Baskerville would
allow, for a quick two-minute meeting and perhaps we could do a
perfecting amendment that would take care of everyone’s problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well as they say I don’t have a dog in this fight. I
was just reading this and you know how it is when one lawyer starts
talking a lot of other ones stand up and speak and I’m guilty of that as
much as the others. I certainly if the gentleman wishes to withdraw his
amendment, that’s between the gentleman and the speaker, but I certainly
do Representative Glazier think there’s a pretty big problem with this
language as it is. I believe it certainly goes beyond the scope of what
the gentleman is preparing. But I would also respond as well, that the
other issue I think that may be problematic even if you fix that, is
that putting this provision in that applies only to the department of
commerce, and I believe the bill from 2008 and the other bills were
general bills meant to apply across state-wide. And the problem that I
would see also is why would we treat these appointments any differently
than we would any other kind of appointments where folks are concerned
about politics? Should that not be something that we do across the
board, and not specific to one area? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore again, I wonder if you
would agree and if the speaker would allow and Representative would, to
temporary displace this amendment and let’s see if we can’t get it, the
one concern, at least the one concern, before we vote on it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I think that would be up to the member to ask that of the
speaker. I have no call on that. That’s the speaker’s call. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment, then to
make a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If it had been the bill we passed in
2009 I would have supported it. I was too quick. It’s not. It added
stuff. Therefore, I move that this be displaced to the end of today’s
calendar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Don’t we have one more bill? We do not have
another bill to take up, so we’re pretty much here. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER
CHANGES] May I change my motion? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to restate his motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That we displace it
until tomorrow’s calendar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The house be at ease.
[PAUSE] Ladies and gentlemen, it is the intent of the chair to take the
final vote on this bill today. We do have another amendment, if the bill
sponsor wishes to temporarily displace this amendment. Representative
Baskerville? Representative Baskerville. If the gentleman wishes to
temporarily displace his amendment, we have another amendment that we
can consider. But the chair intends to take a vote on this today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, may we temporarily displace my amendment?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. speaker. Members of the house this is a simple amendment,
it just assures that twenty five percent of the funds raised through
personnel that are used in this public/private partnership will be
focused on tier one and two counties. These are the more economically
distressed communities in our state, and assures that the rural areas
will not get left behind in this commerce reorganization.  The state
funds are already designated in that way and this just makes sure that
the private funds that are raised will be allocated with the opportunity
for those to go to rural communities. I want to thank Representative
Tine from Dare county for his work on this amendment as well as the bill
sponsor, Representative Murry for his work and let's stand for any
questions the body may have.

Representative Murry, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This amendment has been a work in progress since Thursday and as
Representative Ramsey did state, Representative Tine really put in a lot
of effort and had a great conversation about this.  We want to make sure
that rural areas in our state get their fiar share of the effort put
forth by this public/private partnership.  This amendment gets us closer
to that, I think there's still a little bit of language that needs to be
worked out to make sure that we're not disproportionately, cause not all
regions and that's why I wanted to, I also wanted to stand up to make
sure everybody looks really hard at this beautiful, colorful map of the
prosperity zones, so you can see where your counties are, where it is
and you can kind of mental check on what tier one counties are in our
region, what tier two counties, what tier three counties are in our
region and start to think about how this amendment would affect the
operations of economic development in your regions and help us get this
right as this bill continues to move forward.  Talk to your senators to
make sure that there's, its fair and balanced, so that we make sure that
rural areas in our state have the appropriate attention they deserve.
Decentralize, get folks out of Raleigh, get them into your communities
and get them working for you.

tier one tier two counties, I looked at your map, Representative Murry,
and its a good map go south in my region down there and that's where the
tier one counties are, Bladen, Columbus, Robeson county.  So I hope ??
support this amendment, I hope you'll pass it, its a good move in the

We’ve made an effort to try and make the bill fairer and more equitable
for North Carolina. As you might know, when the bill first came to the
floor here, and maybe this is where work should have been done earlier,
but when the bill came to the floor a lot of the protections we sought
were not in it and some of the protections were adopted yet even still
others were denied even a vote or discussion or full discussion. Now as
we just had an accommodation on this last motion to amend, on this last
amendment, we still had several instances where we did not even discuss
the help rural North Carolina could have received and we all agree needs
in this bill. The transparency for doing business this new way is
essential not just for the people to know what’s going on but for them
to be able to get the results that this is purportedly going to provide
for North Carolina. I think it’s a good thing that we did ensure more
participation in the decision making process. I am disappointed that we
weren’t able to ensure disclosure by members of the board that would be
appointed. I don’t think we made enough progress on the bill for us to
fully support it and for that reason I’ll be voting against the bill as
Representative Stam would often say, even though he made it better it’s
still a bad bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the house is the passage of the house committee
substitute for house bill 1031 on its third reading. Those in favor of
the passage of the bill will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the
vote. Eighty-one having voted in the affirmative and thirty-six in the
negative, the bill passes on its third reading. It’s ordered engrossed
and will be sent to the senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Notices and announcements.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does the gentleman from Columbus,
Representative Waddell rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to speak up to three
minutes for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
house I stand here proudly tonight, I sometimes think that I probably
wouldn’t have done this in my younger years, but Columbus County, the
Whiteville Wolfpack are the state 1A baseball champs and I stand here to
congratulate them on the floor of the house and also from the same
school in Whiteville, we have the state runners up in girls’ softball in
1A. It’s a proud accomplishment for my rural area and certainly since I
went to a rival school a little bit further down the road, we didn’t
always think to highly of Whiteville but in this case you come to find
out that things change over time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does the lady from Surry,
Representative Stevens rise?</p>
