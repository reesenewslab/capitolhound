<p id="00:00">
Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we’ll bring this meeting of the
House Health and Human Services Committee to order. I want to begin by
welcoming our pages that are with us today. We have Christina Stone from
Wake County sponsored by Representative Dollar. If you would stand and
let them know who you are. We also have Jake Thomason from Davidson
County sponsored by Representative Rayne Brown. Good to have you all
with us today and I hope that your week is a very good one here at the
General Assembly. Our House Sergeant at Arms today are Fred Heinz, Barry
Moore, John Brandon, and Reggie Sills.
Now, Ladies and gentlemen, our meeting today will adjourn by 10:50.
There’s another meeting in this room so we’re going to move right along
and we’re going to begin with House Bill 29. Representative Horn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Is it cool
or what that I get to present a bill that was in the Governor’s speech
last night. This hopefully will go very quickly. House Bill 29 creates a
new offense for possession of pseudoephedrine by someone that’s been
previously convicted of a meth related charge. As you all know,
pseudoephedrine is the only ingredient that you have to have in order to
make methamphetamine, so if someone that’s been making meth has
pseudophedrine on them, there’s a pretty good reason to believe that
they have no good purpose. Second part of the bill is to extend the
incarceration for meth cookers that do it in the presence of children or
the aged or infirmed. With that I ask for your support of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions from members of the committee? Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t know if this is for you, Representative Horn, or for staff. It’s
sort of a picky question in a way. In the portion of the bill that deals
with the presence on the property or where the meth is being
manufactured of a minor or a disabled or elder adult, what difference,
if any, does it make if the minor, the disabled, or elder adult is the
person charged with the crime itself or is somehow engaged in the
manufacturing process themselves as opposed to being sort of like an
innocent resident or person that’s present. Do we make any distinction
for that situation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the intent is if they’re the person making the meth, they’re
going to be sentenced. But we’re talking if there are innocent persons
there while the meth is being made. The fume are, of course, the  most
toxic part of the meth anyway. It’s to aggravate the punishment for
exposing those infirmed, elderly or children who have no option to get
out. That’s the purpose of the aggravation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Other questions for the committee, Representative Earle?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What is the pseudoephedrine product?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sudafed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So that means that you can not have Sudafed, else you would be charged
with something?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the chair might respond. I know that some of the products that you’re
probably familiar with that would be considered, and I believe would be,
and you can help me with this if you like. Sudafed, Claritin, Zyrtec,
Benadryl, Actifed. Those are… Representative Horn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry, Mr. Chairman. There are 15 branded medications that contain
sudafed that are available behind the counter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you’re saying that you cannot have one of these products if you have
been, I’m just reading the summary here, if you have been convicted of
possession, you cannot have one of these products for a cold or for
anything else you would, what would happen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct, and it would be a specific separate felony. However, we
have been assured</p>

<p id="05:00">
as we study this throughout the interim session, that there are various
other medications that do not contain sudafed that would be able to be
used for colds and allergies. Pediatricians especially said that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions from the chair, I’ll say while Representative Stevens, you’re
an attorney and some of these folks are probably not. You might want to
explain a little bit about a class H felony. I’ve a little bit of
research. I think that might include things such as maybe arson, bomb
threat, breaking and entering, embezzlement. Those are things that would
be considered class H felonies I do believe. Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
...and they were okay with it. The citizen commission found this to be
appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But this...excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Earle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I ask you why the legislation? It just seems to me if for whatever
reason that you had this for a cold or whatever, or whatever reason
other than doing drugs, then it seems to be kind of harsh to have
somebody to be a felon because they happen to have some medication that
would be kind of for innocent reason.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is an attempt to get at the manufacturers of methamphetamine who
are continuing to do this. If we don’t cut off their supply of the one
ingredient they have to have to make this drug, then it’s very difficult
to slow them down, and this simply doesn’t affect anybody except those
who are in the business of manufacturing methamphetamine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions. Representative Horn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to also add that this bill has the support of the Attorney
General, the FBI and the North Carolina Sheriff’s Association. It’s been
pretty well vetted across the board and I’d go back to point out as I
said in the beginning, the only one ingredient you have to have to make
methamphetamine, you have to have pseudoephedrine, everything else, for
the most part, everything else can be substituted out. It’s fairly clear
to law enforcement and to many that if you’re...let me add one more
thing. Methamphetamine is the singular most addictive drug presently
known. It’s a one and done. If you try it, you’re hooked. It’s fairly
clear to many that if you’ve been making meth, and you have
pseudophedrine on you, the odds are pretty good it’s not there because
you’ve got a headache. Now, is there a guarantee? Of course not, but my
guess as anecdotally is that’s the price you pay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any question, Representative Hurley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just have a comment. A few years ago, the bill was done that when we
go to buy that, we have to sign, we have to show our driver’s license
and everything. This would not include someone who was using this and it
was on record that we had bought it legitimately.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that a question or comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Earle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question. My question, I guess, is based on what you just said
about having to sign for it, so this is having it and you didn’t sign
for it? Is this what this is doing? Or is this if you even go and sign
for it, it’s stil...and I’m not encouraging drug use or any of this, I’m
just trying to look at the thing of innocent people that may end up
having it that went and signed for it. If it’s that addictive, then why
don’t we ban the whole drug from being…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We tried that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate that question much more than you may realize. As they say
in some parts of the world, one step at a time, but in this particular
case, we are dealing with those people that have a track record of
making methamphetamine. We’re zeroing in on those that have been
convicted of making methamphetamine and we’re saying to them that you
are no longer allowed to possess the one ingredient that we know you
have to have to make methamphetamine. In addition,</p>

<p id="10:00">
If you make Methamphetamine in the presence of those that have no
choice; children the elderly and the disabled, your sentence will be
aggravated.  That's the two parts to this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murray
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a question for the bill sponsor.  Are the
individuals who are convicted of these Methamphetamine offenses in the
implex[??]system to prevent them from purchasing at the retail level?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To my knowledge that was not part of the implex system
that has been implemented.  I've asked that question of the implex
operators to whether that can be added...I don't...I hate to tell you I
don't remember the answer, I don't remember I got an answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could continue Mr. Chairman, the reason I ask
that because the implex system is set up to prevent over-purchasing of
pseudo-ephedrine beyond what would be needed for an individuals use.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The reason why I ask the question that way is because
this is a situation and what this bill targets in my opinion is when
someone else goes to purchase pseudo-ephedrine properly and it's a legal
transaction, and then takes that pseudo-ephedrine and gives it to
someone who is intending to make Chrystal-meth amphetamine out of it.
So that's what this bill seeks to target  is someone who gets the active
ingredient to make Chrystal-meth from another person who purchased it
legally.  That is the way I see this legislation and it is an
un-addressed area in the current penalties for Chrystal-meth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Horn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely correct, Representative Murry.  The term
'Smurfers&quot; is very popular these days.  And that's   someone that
buys their legal limit of pseudo-ephedrine containing medication and
sells it...either gives it or sells it to someone who should not be
having it, and they'll make Meth-amphetamine out of it.  So this bill is
to those people that are caught making meth-amphetamine or have made
Meth-amphetamine; they've got pseudo-ephedrine regardless of how they
got it.  Shame on you, we're gonna get'cha.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As I said earlier there was a interim study committee
that looked at Meth, and it started with exactly what you are talking
about; trying to make the purchase of Meth illegal or make it a
prescription drug and there were lots of impediments to that.  As a
result the committee...this was one of the recommendations that
committee looked at and recommended.
Specifically the committee recommends the General Assembly enact
legislation that creates a criminal offence for the purchase of
pseudo-ephedrine by a person who had a prior conviction and requires the
attempted purchase of pseudo-ephedrine to be blocked on the National
precursor log.  The person whose been convicted of Meth.  So again there
are alternative medications they can get, this is otherwise a lawful
medication.  But for those people who have gone to the trouble to make
Meth, this is the one ingredient that stops them from making it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Dollar is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  It does seem to me...you know
section one applies to a very very narrow group of individuals.  I'm not
quite sure how that would be enforced but you know the bulk of the bill
is really seems to me strengthening the penalties on a policy that has
already been well established in the General Assembly.  And it looks
like a lot of the language, particularly on page two, is more in the
realm of what the judiciary committee needs to look at.  And with that
Mr. Chairman I would make a motion for a favorable report for house bill
twenty-nine with a referral to the judiciary sub-committee C.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Dollar, if you would hold
that message just for a second, I've got one question.  Representative
Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh thank you Mr. Chairman.  I actually have a series
of questions.  We've got pretty far down into the weeds with that
last...so I think this is a question for staff.  Partly to help educate
me.  Could you tell me what drugs...what is the implex system and what
drugs to people currently have to sign for? What drugs to people
currently have to sign for and what drugs have  we mentioned that
are....</p>

<p id="15:00">
Based that people don't have to sign for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is directed that to staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If Representative Horn wanted to answer that, that was something that
was discussed. There was a special agent from the SBI who came and gave
several presentations. I did not staff the methamphetamine select
committee, but I know there was a special agent from the SBI who gave
several presentations or at two presentations on the IMPEX systems. It
has to do with, with the registration of pharmaceutical drugs and
prescriptions and Representative Horn's indicated he can answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The IMPEX system's a national precursor log exchange. It's a industry
funded program that, that is on, that is contemporaneously, I don't know
if the word contemporaneously is right, but it's online, instantly
before a pharmacist can dispense certain medications, they are required
to check the IMPEX system. The law establishes a limit as to how much an
individual may purchase of these medications, in this case
pseudoephedrine containing medications. I indicated earlier that there
were fifteen of them. There's a limit on what one is able to purchase.
Should you request or attempt to purchase beyond that limit, the IMPEX
system says, refuses the sale and the pharmacist is not allowed to
consummate the sale. You don't get the stuff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This doesn't have anything to do with the control substance reporting
system?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So there, if I understand it correctly, all of the drugs that contain
pseudoephed, you don't have to sign for everything, all of those.
There's only, there are only.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well there are fifteen medications involved in, in restricted sale. The
liquid and or, no the gel cap and, the gel cap and liquid
pseudoephedrine containing medications are not restricted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, I think it's time for your motion, and this has
already been to judiciary C, so I believe we're moving to the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll revise the motion for a favorable report for House bill 29.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And the motion has been made by Representative Dollar for a favorable
report for House bill 29. All members in favor say aye. All opposed no.
The ayes have it. Thank you gentlemen. Thank you, Representative
Stevens. House bill 18, we have a proposed committee substitute and
would entertain a motion that we take up the PCS for HB 18. Moved by
Representative Murry, seconded by Representative Cotham. Representative
Holloway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Good morning. House bill 18 titled Youth
Skincare Prevention Act. It's a bill that came out of the child fatality
task force. It simply moves to change the law that no one less than
fourteen years of age can use a tanning bed to no one less than eighteen
years of age. It's a public health bill. It's a public safety bill.
Altered by the light of a tanning bed may be fifteen times stronger than
natural sunlight. UV radiation is one of the primary causes in
development of skin cancers, including melanoma, a particularly
aggressive skin cancer. Incidents of skin cancer is increasing.
Radiation is cumulative over your lifetime. The earlier the exposure,
the higher the risk of developing skin cancer. Mister Chairman, I'd like
to have Dr. Kelly Nelson come forward for a presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dr. Nelson? If you would please, for the record, if you would state your
name and who you are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning everyone. I'm Dr. Kelly Nelson. I'm the director of the
melanoma clinic at Duke University.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You do have a powerpoint? Okay. Committee will be at ease. All right,
you may proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. Let me just try out my maneuverability here. I really
appreciate the opportunity to speak to you all today. My entire practice
at Duke focuses on patients who have personally had melanoma, or if  you
are at very high risk for</p>

<p id="20:00">
developing melanoma.  And unfortunately, an entirely too large portion
of my practice involves the care of you people, and specifically the
care of young people who have used tanning beds.  I'm very, very
grateful to have the opportunity to share my thoughts with you this
morning about this very important bill.  I want to make clear that there
is no debate in the scientific community that UV exposure is related to
skin cancer, but I want to make sure we're on the same page.  The vast
majority of skin cancer are basal cell skin cancer and squamous cell
skin cancer, that you can see pictures up here from 2 of my patients.
Most of the time, these are fairly easily managed, but particularly in
places on the body that don't have a whole lot of extra geography, they
can be challenging.  I want to give you a fair warning, the next slides
may be a little difficult to look at, but these are surgical defects
from 2 young people who used tanning beds in their teen.  These are the
holes in their faces left after a specialized skin cancer surgeon cut
out the skin cancer.  You can imagine that even in the most skilled
surgical hands, the repair of these holes is going to leave a permanent
scar on their face.  But, most likely, these patients are not going to
pass a way from their skin cancer.  Melanoma is an entirely different
story.  these are all pictures from my patients who had advanced
melanoma.  The delay in diagnosis was for various reason, but these are
all very significant threats to their lives.  The gentleman in the
middle passed away about 4 months after I saw him as a new patient, the
other 2 patients are still under my longitudinal care.   And so this is
really why I feel so strongly about support of this bill, because this
patient died from melanoma.  and not only do patients die from melanoma,
but patients who are entirely too you to die, die from melanoma.  But,
what we're talking about here today, is the difference between tanning
bends and sun exposure for young people.  Obviously we can't put a bill
forth that would prohibit all children from protecting themselves from
the sun, but we can try to protect them from using tanning beds at too
young of an age.  And so I wanted to give you some context at how
tanning beds  are different from regular sun exposure.  The radiation
produced from the sun incorporates a broad spectrum of radiation, or
energy.  And the spectrum range from X-rays, which are at the far left
hand of the scale, which you see on the screen, to visible light, which
is at the far right hand of the scale.  What we're really here to talk
about today is ultraviolet radiation, which is what is at hand when
we're talking about tanning bed exposure.  And there is very significant
differences between the UV radiation that your skin sees in the tanning
bed, compared to what happens when you're laying out on Myrtle Beach.
Specifically, natural sunlight is predominately UV-B.  UV-B radiation
enables your skin to produce vitamin D, It also generates the sunburn
response, that many of us are all too familiar with for not used to
being out in the sun.  UV-A exposure, on the other hand, is what you
predominately get  when you get you're in a tanning bed.  And as we
heard earlier, tanning beds give you about 15 times more UV-A you'd get
from sunlight.  UV-A  is more tightly linked to the development of skin
cancer.  So just to be sure we're clear, natural sunlight is UV-B,
tanning beds is UV-A.   Natural sunlight helps you skin produce vitamin
D, it also produces a protective sunburn response, UV-A does not.  So
those are the differences in terms of what we're talking about.  But
most importantly, not many of us would choose to take off our clothes
and lay outside on a fine February morning like today.  However, it
would not take you too far to find a tanning bed to get that same amount
of exposure.  So children have access to tanning beds throughout the
entire year.  What does this mean for your skin?  I'm going to go
through this a little bit quickly, but do you see the blue cell there in
the enlarged box?  That's a mole</p>

<p id="25:00">
…melanocyte, and what the melanocytes when your skins exposed to the
sun, it produces little packets of pigmentation called melanin and your
melanocytes are intimately linked to about 15 or 20 keratinocytes and
when your sun, when your skin is exposed to the sun your cells say I’m
getting exposure to something I don’t like and I need to protect myself.
And so, when your melanocytes make those packets of pigment, your
keratinocytes which make up the predominant part of your skin they take
that melanin and they put it on top of their little heads to protect
their nuclei which is where all your genetic information is stored.
That’s what a tan is. That’s why we say there is no safe tan, because
your skin is responding to radiation damage and trying desperately to
protect itself. This is what happens to your skin over time. Over time
your skin texture changes, you can see that the texture becomes more
rough, the pigmentation becomes more irregular and it gets wrinkly. This
is a gentleman who was a truck driver for many years and the light, the
glass of the driver’s side window blocked the UVB rays but it didn’t
block the UVA rays so you can see that one half of his face is
profoundly photo aged while the other has been relatively protected. So,
there’s a great twin study, identical twins, the twin on the right
tanned regularly, the twin on the left protected her skin from the sun,
so you can see the difference. We’re really not here to talk about
cosmetic implications; we’re here more to talk about saving lives.  When
you look at the SEER registry which is a National Melanoma Cancer
Registry, you can see that the rate of melanoma diagnoses is going up
for young women. The graph on the left, young women are the open
circles, whereas young men are the closed circles and you can see that
the rates have gone up dramatically from 2000. That corresponds to the
same shift in terms of utilization of tanning devices, the figure on the
right with the red line. What you see is that over time the use of these
high speed intensity and high pressure tanning bed devices has increased
over the same time scale. This is what it means for our patients when
they’re diagnosed with melanoma. We need to take out a safety margin of
about an inch of skin down to the underlying tissue and the 17 year old
girl who used tanning beds that was down to the bone here on her temple.
I reached out to several of my patients who had used tanning beds at a
young age and asked their permission to share their stories with you
today and they were all incredibly passionate about being able to share
their experiences. These are images from Gretchen; she’s a woman in her
early 40s who began using tanning beds as soon as she could drive when
she was 16. On the upper left you can see two well healed scars, and
here. These are both from previous melanomas that were diagnosed before
I started taking care of her. Although these look subtle, these were
both invasive melanomas on her that if left unchecked could have caused
threat to her life. Each of these required surgery in my office on the
day they were diagnosed and then an additional safety margin surgery
just like you saw on that young women’s scalp that left her with two
additional scars that were about 5 inches in length. This is Abby, she
began using tanning beds in high school before prom and continued using
tanning beds in college and before her wedding. The large scar there on
her left is from her first invasive melanoma which she also needs
surgery on her lymph nodes. The first day that I saw her I diagnosed an
additional invasive melanoma there on her right upper back. Thankfully
she’s doing well but she was very, very excited for me to be able to
share her story with you. And this is, these are pictures from Melissa.
These are all melanomas. She started using tanning beds when she was 15
and she went basically every day during the winter and summer months
from the time she was 15 and these are all melanomas and I still take
care of her. She said every time I diagnose a new melanoma on her, her
mother cries because her mother drove her to the tanning bed when she
was young before she got her license. To wrap it up, tanning beds are
different than sunlight. It means different things when young skin is
exposed to tanning bed radiation. They offer no health benefit,
especially to young people. We have many other tools at our disposal to
care for patients who have medical conditions that may need UV exposure.
Tanning beds do not typically fall</p>

Top of our list for the care of young people, which is who we're talking
about today. Tanning beds have been linked to melanoma. Melanoma can be
deadly, particularly if it's not diagnosed early. Young people really
need protection, and that's what this bill is about. So we hope that
you'll help them by approving HB18. Thank you.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank
you, Dr. Nelson. Representative Hollo.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Dr.
Nelson. I'd also like to call Anne Bowman to also speak.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Anne Bowman, representing Aim at Melanoma, I believe. If you
would, identify yourself for the record, and you may proceed.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Hi, my name is Anne Bowman. I'm a 34-year old melanoma survivor,
and I'm also the Charlotte chapter president of Aim at Melanoma. I first
used a tanning bed when I was 16 years old. I went occasionally before
spring break to get a base tan or i went before a prom or a sorority
formal because I thought I would look prettier with a healthy glow. In
December 2010 my dermatologist removed a mole and three days later I
found out that it was melanoma, that I had cancer. I was 32 years old.
My children were 2 1/2 and 9 months old. I saw an oncologist who
performed a wide local excision to remove the melanoma. And I have a
picture of my surgery scar. My mole was the size of a pencil eraser, and
it was only .86 millimeters in depth. So it was considered very small in
terms of melanoma. And you can see I've got one more picture. I've got a
6-inch incision scar on my lower back. I also had to have lymph nodes
removed from my groin to see if the cancer had spread. I was very
fortunate. The cancer had not spread and I'm Stage 1B. But I will live
with melanoma every day for the rest of my life. I will never be
considered cured of melanoma, and the worry that it will spread will
never leave. In the past two years, I've had an EKG, a chest X-ray, lung
function tests, a mammogram, an ultrasound, two MRIs of my spine, an MRI
of my liver, and a colonoscopy, all to rule out the spread of melanoma.
Those procedures were not only incredibly expensive, they were
incredibly worrisome as I awaited test results. But even with all of
that, I know that I'm incredibly fortunate to be Stage 1B. A lot of the
people that I've met through my work with Aim at Melanoma are facing
Stage 3 and Stage 4 melanoma. And I watch the devastation that this
disease causes every day. In this past week, two women that I was
connected with both lost their battle with melanoma. They were both in
their early 30s. They both leave behind small families. And they both
had a tanning bed history. I can't go back to my 16 year old self and
tell her to stay out of the tanning bed. But I can and I will be an
advocate for our youth and their health. I have no doubt that this bill
will save lives. And I'd love to answer any questions, if you have any,
about my experience as a melanoma patient or in the melanoma
community.[SPEAKER CHANGES]If you'll hold your questions at this time.
Chair has been advised that there might be a couple of public speakers
that would like to speak against. If that's the case, if you would, come
forward at this time. I've not been given any specifics about that. And
if you would, would ask that you try to limit your comments to two
minutes or less.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman, since we just heard a 15
minute presentation that I feel needs to be refuted, I would ask for a
few more moments please? I will be as brief as I possibly can.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]This was part of the presentation, these were not public
speakers. But the Chair will try to be lenient. But I do ask that you be
respectful. We do need to be out of here in 15 minutes.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Very good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee.
I'm Joseph Levy. I'm Scientific Advisor to the American Suntanning
Association and Executive Director of International Smart Tan Network,
which is the educational institute that trains professional tanning
facilities in North America. For 21 years I've developed those training
materials. And I am our industry's representative to the American
Society for Photobiology. We're here as a constructive force in this
issue. We believe strongly that the parental consent standard that is in
place in North Carolina works and should be continued. That is the
spirit of what brings us in here today. Dermatology Professor Dr.
Jonathan Reese of England once stated that melanoma is an issue where
politics and science have become intertwined, sadly, that an amicable
separation is desired. We just heard a tremendous amount of
misinformation about melanoma and about photobiology, about UV light.
The doctor who just testified, Dr. Kelly Nelson, said that natural
sunlight is predominantly UV</p>

be and that just isn’t the case. Sunlight is 95% UVA and about 5% UVB
during the summer. The UV portion of it. The UV portion changes
throughout the day because of the solar angle. It is all UVA at dawn and
dusk. It is about 5% UVB in the middle of the day in the summer. That is
what a sunbed is. A sunbed you heard was 15 times stronger, a typical is
about 10 to 12 milliwatts per square centimeter in intensity, sunlight
is about 4 to 5 milliwatts per square centimeter in intensity. A sunbed
is 2 to 3 times as intense, but intensity is not what you measure. It’s
intensity multiplied by the duration of exposure equals the total
numbers of photons. In the United States we have exposure schedules for
tanning equipment that we’ve worked with the government to produce that
delivers three quarters or less of what would induce a sunburn. It is
the most conservative exposure schedule in the world.
They’re using misinformation to advocate this bill. You heard it said
that melanoma is increasing implied particularly in young women. This is
the National Cancer Institute’s date, and I believe I’ve sent this to
all of you. In 1975, men over the age of 50 and women under the age of
50 had virtually identical incidence rates of melanoma. Since that
point, men over the age of 50 have increased  500%, much faster than
women under the age of 50. In fact, melanoma incidents, according to the
National Cancer Institute, for women under the age of 18 is 0.5 per
hundred thousand and hasn’t increased greatly. The study that is mostly
used to suggest that there is a 75% increase in risk from sunbed users
actually doesn’t study tanning salons. It studies the three different
types of sunbeds that are out there. There is medical applications of
sunbeds, because sunbeds are used by dermatologists to treat psoriasis
in their offices. There is home units. And then there are professional
tanning salon units. If you separate that data, the tanning salons don’t
increase risk in a significant fashion. The medical use of phototherapy,
which doctors are lobbying right now to increase the access to calling
it safe, doubles the risk of melanoma and in fact, the National Cancer
Institute considered dermatological use of sunbeds a class one
carcinogen. You’ve heard sunlight called a carcinogen and UV called a
carcinogen. What you need to understand is that list includes substances
like birth control pills, red wine, salted fish, sawdust, many other
items. Calling UV a carcinogen and dangerous is incredibly misleading
because as a carcinogen, it is the only item that we need in order to
live and be healthy. It also is the only item in that list that doesn’t
have a direct increasing relationship with melanoma and with cancer.
Melanoma is more common in people who work indoors than in those who
work outdoors. People who work outdoors get 3 to 9 times more UV. It
occurs most commonly on parts of the body that don’t get regular sun
exposure. You saw one of the slides was a melanoma on the bottom of the
foot. In African-Americans, melanoma occurs most commonly on the bottom
of feet. It does not have a direct relationship with sunlight. It is a
complex relationship with UV if at all. That is why Dr. Bernard Ackerman
who founded the field of pathology in dermatology and has trained most
of the pathologists in the United States today, has written two books.
One of the books he says, and I’ll quote right out of it, and I’ve never
met Dr. Ackerman. He say, paradoxically business is sometimes more
academic than academia. That Smart Tan got it, but the skin cancer
foundations like the American Cancer Society, the American Academy of
Dermatology does not get it. Ackerman promoted sunburn prevention, not
sun avoidance, not sun hysteria, and he’s not alone. I’ve also sent you
a, sorry I’m fumbling aound for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? if I can just intervene for just a moment. I want to give you about
30 seconds to wrap up and I’m sorry if that seems unfair, I had no
knowledge, the chair had no knowledge that you had a presentation to
make and I do want to allow time for our committee members to ask
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that is exactly the point. This discussion needs to take place on a
higher level. The American Suntanning Association would like to have
this discussion on higher level to discuss the science. We believe the
science merits a balanced perspective. Dr. Arthur Roads, melanoma
researcher from Chicago, I’ll close with this, wrote an essay called
Melanoma’s Public Message that says we need to stop concentrating on
these anti-sun dogmatic campaigns. Rhodes had a colleague that was a
doctor, whose wife was a doctor, and the colleague had a lesion that was
on his back and figured, I don't’ tan, I don't’ take my shirt off, this
can’t possibly be melanoma because I’m not a tanner. His wife, who is a
doctor, concurred. It was a melanoma. He died of the melanoma. Melanoma
is increasing most commonly in older men, not in younger women, and I
will share that with you from the National Cancer Institute and anybody
who</p>

studying this in earnest, so this deserves much broader discussion.  It
is not a slam dunk.  The scientific community is not all in unison on
this issue, as you've heard earlier.  That's why we'd like to have a
broader discussion on this.  Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you sir.  And I will open it to the committee
members at this time.  Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And I would like to use what
ever parliamentary process there is to postpone the vote on this bill,
in order for us to have a more clear and in-depth discussion.  As a
scientist, the next hour would not give me enough time to evaluate the
information from both sides of these issues.  And I would propose that
postponement until the next committee meeting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Noted.  Representative Holley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]This bill came out of the Child Fatality Task Force, so
it's had time to be aired in public.   This is a public health bill.
This is a public safety bill.  The longer we delay, the more potential
for more cancers, including melanoma, which will kill children.  Now the
science is contradictory, if you want to call it that, but this bill is
supported by the American Cancer Society, the North Carolina Advisory
Committee on Cancer Coordination and Control, the North Carolin Child
Fatality Task Force, the North Carolin Dermatology Association, the
North Carolina Medical Society, the North Carolina Oncology Association,
the North Carolina Pediatrics Association aimed at melanoma, and the
American Society for Dermatological Surgery Association.  I ask for your
support of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman, I respectfully ask for a vote on my
motion, to postpone for further discussion at the next meeting.
Okay.  Motion on the floor to postpone the vote until the next meeting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Inquire in the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]What time do we need to move to vacate this room?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The chair's plan was to vacate about 10:50.  We've got
another meeting at 11 o'clock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]This is about the motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes it is.  I likely will vote for this bill, I'm in
support of it, but it is very  disturbing to me to hear testimony from
people I believe have legitimate credentials that is so contradictory.
You don't vote on these kinds of data to find out what's right.  This is
not something we need to argue about, and I agree, we need more time.  I
want us to take responsible votes, so I would support Representative
Avila's motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We'll take a vote on Representative Avila's motion.
All in favor of postponing a vote until the next meeting will signify by
saying Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Opposed no.  The ayes have it.  This meeting's
adjourned.</p>
