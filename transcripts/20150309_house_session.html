  The House will come to order. Members will take their seats; visitors
will retire from the chamber. The Sergeant-At-Arms will close the doors.
Members and visitors in the gallery are asked to please silence all
electronic devices. The prayer this evening will be offered by
Representative Pittman. Members and all visitors in the gallery are
asked to please stand during the prayer and to remain standing for the
Pledge of Allegiance that will occur directly after the prayer.
Representative Pittman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let us pray. Great are you, oh
God, beyond all our imagining, and we thank you, Lord, that you’ve not
left us to the darkness of our misunderstanding and our lack of
knowledge, but you’ve chosen to make yourself known. How we rejoice, oh
God, in your self-revelation. How we love the very thought of you – your
goodness, your greatness, your infinite majesty, Lord, and love. Father,
fill us with that love, we pray. Help us, oh God, to be aware wherever
we are that you are present with us. Lord, cover us with your grace.
Fill us with your compassion. Lord, fill us with your spirit that we
might have understanding and wisdom. Show us, oh God, in the midst of
all the many different voices and many different directions that we
sometimes feel pulled to find the right way – the way that pleases you.
Tonight, oh God, be with those who have special need of you. Lord, I
don’t know the details, but I heard of an Amtrak derailment today. Lord,
I don’t know who may be hurt, who may be dead, or just what the
situation is. Maybe some here know better than I do, but Lord, you know
it all, and we just pray, oh God, that you would be very real for those
who are needing you from that incident today, and many other things all
across the world. We may or may not be aware of them, but you know it
all, and we just pray, oh God, that those who are in need in any way
will find you sufficient. God, grant us the assurance of your presence,
your love and your purpose for each and every one, for all are precious
in your sight, and we thank you for that. We thank you that you show us
that in your son Jesus Christ in whose name we pray. Amen. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Amen. I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of
America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God,

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can tell you from personal experience
they&#39;ve-they&#39;ve saved my bacon many a time, so I want to thank
you all for being here. If you&#39;d please stand and let us welcome you
to the House of Representatives today. And I want you all to know that
your individual members, just about every one of you -your members sent
forth the recognition to recognize individually and we decided so we
wouldn&#39;t be an hour, just to recognize you as a group. But we are
pleased to have you here this evening and welcome you to come. I know
you will all be here today and tomorrow. I hope you&#39;ll come visit us
and again, thank you for the service you provide to the citizens of our
state. Calendar, House Bill 41 the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representatives Howard, Brawley, Lewis, Setzer. House
Bill 41, a bill to be entitled An Act to Make Technical and Clarifying
Changes to various revenue laws as recommended by the Revenue Laws Study
Committee. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg,
Representative Brawley rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, this bill came out of revenue
laws, the iteration of the committee that began in 2013 and reported to
the 2014 short session where the bill did pass the House, alas had some
additional things added to it. It came back from the Senate in the guise
of House Bill 1224. It has gone back through Revenue Laws Study
Committee beginning in 2014 and was reported out earlier this year and
has gone through finance. Rather than explain the whole bill since it
has passed us once before, I would like to point out two changes. One
was a recommendation of the Revenue Laws Study Committee. That is in
Section 4 where it clarifies the intent of the General Assembly
regarding the impact of the Tax Simplification and Tax Rate Reduction
Act on utility rates. The second one is a new section added in Section
24. This relates to a federal provision that is allowing employees of a
qualified airline, which is going bankrupt, and they have Roth IRAs and
they will be allowed to roll their contributions over into a traditional
IRA. And that will get them a refund of the Roth taxes. This change
ensures rollover contributions will be taxed only once and that the
application of tax for state tax purposes would conform to federal tax
treatment. I have the full seven page explanation of the bill if anybody
needs it, and staff on the floor. But Mr. Speaker these are technical
changes and I would request that the House go ahead and approve it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Harnett,
Representative Salmon rise? For what purpose does the gentleman from
Cumberland, Representative Glazier rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Brawley would yield for one
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Mecklenburg yield to the
gentleman from Cumberland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you Representative, I
apologize, I probably should have read ahead of time but I didn&#39;t.
Section 5A, could you explain that section briefly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I&#39;ll be happy to, in fact the explanation
that was presented I have, I may just read that. I think that will
probably be the best answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be great, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. State law 14-3 enacted a new tax on vapor products as
part of the current tax on other tobacco products. This section makes a
technical change that allows North Carolina manufacturers of vapor
products to collect the new vapor tax on internet retail sales while
allowing the manufacturers continue to the current practice of applying
the Secretary of Revenue to be relieved of the tax on vapor products
shipped to wholesale and retail dealers. The secretary allows
manufacturers to be relieved of paying the tax on OTP when the tax is
paid by the wholesale or retail dealer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
substitute for the House Bill 41 on its second reading. All those in
favor of the bill will vote aye, all those opposed will vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record

  The vote, 114 having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative,
the House Committee Substitute for House Bill 41 passes its second
reading and will remain on the calendar. House Bill 31, the clerk will
read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jackson, House Bill 31, A bill to
be entitled an act to require a 0.00 alcohol concentration restriction
on all restoration of licenses revoked for an impaired driver’s offense,
the General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For
what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Jackson rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, ladies and gentlemen. There’s a real problem of chronic DWI in
this state. It was brought home this weekend when we had another DWI
fatality in Wake County here. I originally came up with the next two
bills you’re going to hear or most of the text of those two bills last
session and both of them flew through here so I won’t take up too much
time. Currently when you have a DWI conviction you’re eligible to get
your license back within a year. For first offenders with a blood
alcohol content of below a 0.15 on that offense your new license comes
with a restriction but instead of saying you can’t have any alcohol to
drink and drive for the next three years like we do for two other
subdivisions of the statute, instead DMV sends you a letter that says
you can drink and drive, just don’t violate a 0.04. I think that’s a bad
public policy. I think the better way to address the issue is to tell
people you made a mistake, we understand that, here’s you license back,
just don’t drive after drinking for the next three years. This bill
passed the Judiciary 2 committee without any stated objection. There is
a fiscal impact, it has to do with the changing of the DMV computer
systems. They say it’s going to take about $54,000 to make the
programming change and they ask for the July 2016 effective date and
that’s why you’ll see that in the bill. Last session we had the support
of the Sheriff’s Association. This time I’m proud to announce that the
Conference of District Attorneys also is in support of the bill. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Surrey,
Representative Stevens rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative
Jackson will yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman
from Wake yield to the lady from Surrey? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative
Jackson. I’ve had some people lately bring some concerns to me about
these alcasensor machines that are on the car, the intoxilizers that are
on the car that on occasion they pick up other substances which is why
0.00 is hard sometimes to maintain. I understand they can pick up strong
onions or they may pick up some other medication or other things will
impact them. How do we get around that when we do a 0.00. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I think you, Representative Stevens, brought over a point that
I meant to make but in my rush I skipped through. This section will
only, the change we are making will only apply to first offenders who
didn’t blow high enough to get an interlock, so they by definition do
not have the interlock in their cars. If you follow under one of the
sections that you have an interlock, we already have a 0.00 tolerance.
It’s actually on the limit to driving privilege to interlock, so that
should not be a problem. My understanding is this bill is designed that
you would not have a different threshold under the change for driving
while impaired, but you would be if you were caught driving after
drinking you would be outside of your restriction of your license and
would be eligible to get a driving while license revoked ticket.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Cabarras,
Representative Johnson rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask a question of the
bill sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to
the lady from Cabarras? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, I yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I was just
wondering if it picks up other odors or registers and the person’s
starting to work and they have to have this apparatus on the car what,
how can you prevent the car from stopping? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Johnson, the part that I am changing actually does not
effect, is not affected by the changes we are making today because you
already, that’s in the interlock. The interlock that you’re talking
about, the blow machine, you already have a 0.00 tolerance. We’ve been
operating that for years and it just, it prevents you from starting

The car and I believe it also notifies DMV if you attempted to start
your car without phone system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yells to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yelled.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So the machine that is in the car doesn’t, will not register 00.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our law currently reads that you have, you cannot have any
&lt;00:28&gt;alcohol in your system for these two other subdivisions. My
understanding is that DMV has chosen to send that 00 to 0.02 for
purposes of whether or not the car would start or whether you will be
reported the DMV but that is not as far as I know in our law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more question Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yell to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we currently have anymore than one manufacturer of these interlocks
systems?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jonathan, I believe we have at least three that are state
wide now that I can think of I have spoken to over the last two years
because we did have Representative Faircloth and I, and Representative
Jordan had an Interlock Bill last year. And I think I have spoke to at
least three manufacturers at that time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? For what purpose does the gentleman
from Guilford, Representative Hardister rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if, the Bill Sponsor yells for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yell to the gentleman from Guildford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative, I like the bill and I plan I’m voting for, but
I have a question, in light of the question that was raised by
Representative Johnson a moment ago. Was there any consideration instead
of going to 0 to go to 0.02?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the question, there are actually was a debate last time
and what we found was—if you have seen the bill I introduced when it
originally came out it was very short because I only laid out what I was
changing but we found that was already a 00 under the Section B and C of
each one. So we just trying to make it consistent, when the bill went
over to the Senate last time there was talk about making the 0.02 that I
understand DMV is using, putting that actually in the law and all three
subsections but that was never done. And as far as I know there was
never any bill language offered to that in fact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Jackson a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yelled to the gentleman from Wake?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do yell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson, as I understood your explanation your bill or
the bill will before us is not really affecting the section where people
have the interlock anyway. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, I apologize I would probably misspoke…So currently,
when you get an interlock, when you are required to an interlock because
you have a prior ??, and this was your second conviction or you blew
0.15 or higher. So you could be required to have an interlock that this
would change the tolerance on that, you are supposed to have an
interlock for a year, some people don’t use that as their limits
traveling privilege a year, they just go a year without having their
licenses, and when they go back to DMV, DMV will still put the interlock
restriction for one year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not the question before the house
is the passage of the House Committee Substitute for House Bill 31 on
its second reading. So many favoring passage of the bill will vote aye,
those oppose will vote no, the clerk will open the vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam Berger the gentleman wish to be recorded on this
vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote, 110 having voted in
the affirmative and four in the negative, the House Committee Substitute
for House Bill 31 passes its second reading and will without objection
be read at third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If no the question before the house
is the passage of the House Committee Substitute for House Bill 31 on
its third reading, so many favoring the passage of this bill will say
aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those oppose will say no. The ayes have it and the House Committee
Substitute for House Bill 31 passes its third reading and will be sent
to the Senate. House Bill 32, the clerk will read.

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Offense of visually impaired driving. The General
Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Wake, Representative Jackson is
recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I apologize to everybody
for monopolizing all your time, and I promise you nobody wants to get
out of here more than I do on this particular day. In 2013, 33% of our
fatal accidents in North Carolina involved an impaired driver. There was
428 DWI fatalities. That was up from the 365 number killed in 2011. If
you start looking at the statutes, one state in particular stands out in
your mind and that&#39;s Utah because they have the lowest fatality rate
of about 20%. They are also one of the only states that makes a second
offense of DWI a felony. However a majority of the states make that
trigger on the third offense. Our current statute makes DWI a felony on
the fourth offense and only if it&#39;s your fourth offense in ten
years. We earlier today had a long caucus meeting and I was bored. Had a
civil file that I was working on and so I have a gentleman&#39;s driving
record here. He basically seriously injured a client of mine. He&#39;s
a, my client&#39;s been in a wheelchair about nine months now. Another
person involved in the accident was killed. The gentleman-the defendant
had five prior DWIs on his record. However, if you look at when he got
them, &#39;92, 2000, 2000, 2007, 2011. He never hit that four times in
ten years, so they were never a felony. And he was never taken off, so
what my bill originally simply did was move that fourth trigger to a
third. Now last session, on the same day, just by chance, Representative
Hurley, Representative Baskerville, Representative McNeill had a bill,
and I&#39;ll let them explain it if they so choose tonight the reason
before that. It would change it, instead of saying in ten year to saying
in your lifetime and saying after you hit the habitual mark, every DWI
you&#39;ve got after that would be another habitual, another felony for
?? more time. And so I spoke to Representative Hurley before the
committee meeting and I asked her if she was going to introduce that
bill again and she had not made her decision. She said she would be
happy for me to take her language and put on my bill and so that&#39;s
what we&#39;ve done. So basically you have both versions of the
statutes, or from the bills from last time in this one. There was some
physical impact, of course they always come up with a null estimate
because they don&#39;t know exactly. I can tell you  they told me last
time this bill would apply to 124 offenders. I don&#39;t know if that
sounds like a lot to you or not, but the way I view it is that&#39;s
another 124 people that would be off the roads and not driving around,
with the likelihood to kill one of us. One of the questions I have
gotten about the bill is how does this impact Laura&#39;s Law from last
session, I believe. The explanation I got from staff is this bill does
not change or contradict Laura&#39;s Law in any way. Nor should it.
There&#39;s some offenders who would currently fall under the aggravated
level one sentence of Laura&#39;s Law that could be charged with DWI but
it does not replace the A1 sentence. The way I view this bill is it
gives the district attorney a hammer, and they often use that. People in
here who practice criminal law know that they use this all the time in
our habitual felon law. What they&#39;ll say is you can plead guilty to
the misdemeanor now and I won&#39;t indict you as a habitual felon. Well
if the DA had this power, then they could charge you with habitual felon
DWI. When someone came in with a record that first court date they could
say you&#39;re an A1 sentence, you take your one year under Laura&#39;s
Law and if you don&#39;t, we&#39;re going to indict you as a fel-a
habitual felon and you&#39;re going to spend more time in jail than
that. I just wanted to point out just, and again I appreciate you
bearing with me. I want to ask you to think about what does it say about
our law that currently you have to have four offenses in ten years to be
considered a felon. I want you to think about some of the crimes that I
know off the top of my head are felonies. If you walk out of the chamber
today and someone slaps you, that&#39;s a felony. It&#39;s an assault on
a legislative officer, it&#39;s a felony. Representative Stam handed out
something last week about mortgage fraud. You look in there, first
offense, that&#39;s a felony. You steal $1000 worth-$1001 worth of
property or write a worthless check for more than $2000 that&#39;s a

  Offense of possessing a slot machine, that&#39;s a felony.  But, so what
does it say to people that you have to have four offenses of driving on
our roads while impaired, possibly risking their lives and our lives,
and we wait till that point to make it a felony?  I&#39;d ask you to
consider making this small change for me.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Randolph,
Representative Hurley, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak briefly on the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  We ran this bill last year because of a
television station interview.  A man had been in prison for over ten
years and when he got out he&#39;d already had three DWIs and he had
killed three people, and he was in prison, they had given him 40 years
but he only served like 17.  So, of course, he didn&#39;t get a ticket
for DWI, he couldn&#39;t, he was in prison.  But when he got out, he got
another one, and they didn&#39;t look back, so he was still, this was
just a misdemeanor.  So, this will take care of that problem, so we need
you to vote yes on this, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Craven,
Representative Speciale, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And, actually to ask a question of the bill&#39;s
sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman
from Craven?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want to make sure I&#39;m understanding what
I&#39;m reading here.  So, when they get to third conviction is actually
when they can be hit for being a habitual offender, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Because they have to already have two previous?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, it would be like baseball, third strike and
you&#39;re out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate?  If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute for House Bill 32 on its second reading.   So many favoring
passage of the bill will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk
will open the vote.  The clerk will lock the machine and record the
vote.  111 having voted in the affirmative, and 3 in the negative, the
House Committee Substitute for House Bill 32 passes its second reading,
and will, without objection be read a third time.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Those opposed will say no.  They ayes have it, and the
House Committee Substitute for House Bill 32 passes its third reading
and will be sent to the Senate.  House Bill 59, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representatives Faircloth, Stam, Glazier, House Bill
59, a bill to be entitled and act to clarify the admissibility of
reports for forensic and chemical analysis.  The General Assembly of
North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Guilford, Representative Faircloth
is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House.  This
bill continues the wrestling match we&#39;ve had for years with the
backlog of tests, forensic tests and chemical analysis in our labs, and
court rulings, of course, guarantees that a person can be faced by their
accuser, and we&#39;re not gaining a lot of ground trying to make up the
time that we lost and consequently we have people who have cases that
are three or four years old waiting to be, still waiting on the evidence
to be presented.  This bill is not designed to cure all of that, but it
is another, as they say, a tool in the box for us to help us a little
bit.  Basically what this says is that there&#39;s several statutes in
current law that allow the admission of a statement or a report of
forensic or chemical analysis in the criminal trial, either without the
personal appearance of the analyst or with the analyst being allowed to
testify remotely.  These admissions are allowed only after notice by the
State of the intent to admit the statement or report, and failure by the
defendant to file an objection to the admission of the report.
What this bill does, would amend each of those statutes, allowing
admission of a statement or report of forensic or chemical analysis by
clarifying that if the State provides the required notice and the
defendant does not object within the required time, then the objection
shall be deemed waived.   Now, this does not in any way take away a
person&#39;s rights to be faced by that analyst if so desired.  But if
the defense for that accused

The report is acceptable to them rather than having the analyst traveler
and testify then this is maybe possible by this bill. I’m sure if you
have technical questions that the two fine Attorneys that work with me
on this bill would be glad to answer those, my job was putting people in
jail and not getting them out. So I will look at those answers, I hope
you support the bill, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Surry, Representative Steven rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if one of the fine cosponsors of the bill would answer a legal
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the lady would please direct your question to a particular member…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Who were the cosponsors?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Cumberland yell to the lady from Surry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Glazier. My question is we have been sort of
talking some of the same issue in the Courts Commission and one of our
concerns was will it be legally sufficient to dean that they have waved
it or not we better of to have them affirmatively way that instead of
treating their reviews or to respond as or are we violating some
constitutionals concerns there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah. Thank you for the question Representative Stevens and I think this
came from the Lab Attorneys to look at and then we went back with staff
and looked at Melinda’s DS which is the Supreme Court case; this
complies with the language of Melinda’s DS, I’m not sure the statue
previously did and this is to make sure that we actually are right on
the language of the Court.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Hall
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of either one of the bill sponsors…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t know everybody get up at one time. Does the gentleman from Wake
yell to the gentleman from Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, Representative Stam and I just have a question
regarding how this is actually gonna work, this is my understanding from
reading it that there is gonna be a 10 day notice presumably by mail to
either to defendants, council, or to the defendants themselves, is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That part is not changed; yes there is notice and demand, yes. What this
does—this was requested by Judge Joe John with the State Crime Lab
apparently somebody in Virginia raised a question if they did not have
these extra words in their statue so they treated it like a loophole, so
he asks us to close the loophole. For those who saw, “Man for All
Seasons”, you are old enough to see that, right. The ?? Law is silence
gives a cent, so here if he ?? that’s a cent. You all are really young
if you haven’t seen that movie.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yell to an additional question from the
gentleman from Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and again Representative Stam and I understand the
part in there, if the notice is attempted to be served on the Attorney
or the defendant there is no mechanism required to show proof that they
in fact served in order for this to operate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it’s mostly civil rather than criminal but whenever we serve
things we conclude a certificate of service of how we served it. So if
it’s in regular order then it’s assumed to be correct and if the notice
was not received and the other person says, “I didn’t get it. ”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yells to an additional question? He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And do you have an opinion as that of five day response time they didn’t
have it after whenever that item is served?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do we have lots of five day response times in court, sometimes we have
three days, sometimes seven but five is plenty.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Durham, Representative Hall has the floor to debate
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and I don’t have an opposition to it, I’m just
concerned about actual working of it after we put it into process and it
certainly seems there maybe some concerns there regarding a timeframe be
and a lot. So although, I support the concept I just had a little
concern about how it was gonna actually work in process and I don’t know
if someone has some of the experience with similar situated requirement
and what the response has bee but that’s my only concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Craven, Representative Speciale
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a problem with this; we guaranteed certain rights under the

lose your right. Those are citizens going into trial or going into court
and we&#39;re telling them if you don&#39;t do this we&#39;re taking
away your right. I think it should be the other way around. I think if
they don&#39;t respond then they should be able to face the accuser
which would be the forensic analysis or whatever you want to call em.
But I don&#39;t think we should be taking a right just because someone
didn&#39;t fill out a piece of paper. And so for that reason I&#39;m not
going to vote for this bill and I ask you not to as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake representative Stam rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To the contrary every single constitutional right that we have can be
waived by the person. The only exception is you cannot sell yourself
into slavery. Every other one can be waived. If I am the government and
I send a condemnation lawsuit to representative Cleveland and I tell him
in that lawsuit what we&#39;re taking and he does nothing about it, and
he doesn&#39;t demand a jury which he has a constitutional right to do,
he has to accept the deposit and he doesn&#39;t get a jury. There&#39;s
nothing unusual about this we have to do this because of Malindas Diaz
which has the affect of keeping our forensic analyst on the road and
sitting in the backs of court rooms instead of analyzing biological
evidence. That&#39;s why the backlog is there.

For what purpose does the lady from Mecklenberg representative
Cunningham rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker I would like to ask the bills sponsor a question
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you could name him, if you want representative Glazier he&#39;s right
behind you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Cumberland yield to the lady from Mecklenberg?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The remote testimony authorization I&#39;ve never seen that
before I don&#39;t know if everybody knows what it is. But I would like
to know what that is and what&#39;s required for that authorization.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes thank you for the question representative. The remote authorization
was passed last year that&#39;s the substance of the bill. To allow that
capacity this bill is just dealing strictly with the capacity on the
objection to the analyst. Remote capacity exists in some pilot districts
not that many yet. It is a technology we&#39;re trying to advance there
are regs that are set up right now for the pilot that are in the pilot
bill in that the department has put in place. So I can&#39;t tell you
which of the districts have the pilot yet but there are very few that
are there. There was some money allowed in last years budget to create a
few of those pilots I&#39;m not sure again whether, I don&#39;t think
Meck is one of them. My recollection is that Forsyth may have been one
of the first ones being looked at representative Faircloth may know
that. But that&#39;s what it is for and it&#39;s exactly well I&#39;ll
speak on the bill I&#39;m just answering your question I do want to
speak to the bill in a minute. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Craven representative Speciale
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My comments had nothing to do with whether we should or shouldn&#39;t be
able to waive our rights we&#39;re free men and free women we should be
able to do what we want to do. That wasn&#39;t the question and that
wasn&#39;t the issue I brought up. And I can also understand the need to
do something here over tying up all the all of our forensic scientists.
I understand that. But because somebody forgets something or neglects to
do something and that is an affirmation that they should waive their
right, I think this is the wrong way to go. I think when a man signs
that paper and says I waive my right then he has the right to do that.
But anything short of that falls on the state and not on the backs of
those going to court. People should not lose their right because they
didn&#39;t fill out a piece of paper or because they forgot to do
something. If they&#39;re going to give away that right they have a
right to do so but it needs to be an intentional give away let me sign
this form given away my right. If I ignore it and I don&#39;t do it by a
certain date then that should say the state has to provide the scientist
there in the courtroom. It should fall on the state. Man shouldn&#39;t
lose his right for that. Thank you.

  Rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative Stam a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman from
Randolph? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If you would look on page 3 at line 3, 4 and 5 where it says
the state notifies the defendant at least 15 days before the proceeding
at which evidence will be used of its intentions to introduce a report
into evidence under this section and provides a copy of the report to
the defendant, would that be the notice that Representative Hall was
talking about. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s right Representative McNeill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Cumberland, Representative Glazier rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
very much, Mr. Speaker. To a couple of the good points that were raised,
first, I agree completely with Representative Stam’s point. There is a
huge problem, and most on the floor know, with SBI analysts and the
capacity to reach these cases, and so the first is sort of the policy
issue and problem issue. There is a desperate need to keep these folks
and the scientists in the lab instead of traveling district to district,
but even that, Representative Speciale makes the point that if that was
really needed and there was a confrontation clause issue that would be
required. The issue here is number one, the court has made it clear that
the confrontation clause allows this procedure, in part because of the
lab problem across the country. So this complies with the law, but
here’s the second thing that isn’t said in the bill but is really
important to know to get from Representative Speciale’s point, nothing
in this bill prohibits the defendant from subpoening the analyst on
their own. They may do that if they want the analyst there all the want
and they would have to comply with that and there is not a problem with
that. This is where the state is going to use this evidence and says do
you really need the analyst and if you’re willing to waive it let’s do
that so we can all get through this without delaying the case solely for
the purposes of delay by having to do this with the analyst being there
when you really don’t need the analyst. So any defendant who wants the
analyst can subpoena them there. This doesn’t stop that in any way. This
is to get at what really could be an abuse of the system and a delay
tactic that’s used when the analyst really isn’t there and the only
thing that’s gonna happen when the analyst finally shows up is the
defendant’s gonna plead, and that’s really what this is trying to get
that. It’s doing it consistent with the confrontation clause, consistent
with the Supreme Court’s ruling on this and we’ll have to see how this
works out, but I think it should answer the problem of anybody who
really wants the analyst there and needs them can absolutely get them
there and will. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman
from Durham, Representative Hall rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a
second time on the bill. I was gonna ask a question but I’ll shorten
this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill a
second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. The point I was
trying to make and, again, I agree with the spirit of what’s trying to
be done here to make evidence available without the testifying
technician or analyst being in court in person and it’s something we
dealt with with the Courts Commission four years ago, and I chaired the
Courts Commission and we talked to the SBI director at the time, etc,
but the problem I see and it may not be a problem but the concern I have
is you get notice within 15 days when normally you have 30 days notice
of what’s going to happen with your trial or witnesses or whatever and
then you have 10 days really within which if you’re either the defendant
or the responding attorney to respond because the notice of your
response has to be with the court five days prior to the hearing data,
so you really have a 10 day window within which either the defendant
himself or the defendant goes and tries to find an attorney if one was
not already appointed by the court or else it automatically functions to
deny you that right. So I’m just saying that that appears to be a
concern. It appears to be a short period. It may not be and again I
asked that question previously to someone who has some experience with
it, so I just point that out for your information. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

and ladies and gentlemen of the House. As a participant in some of the
historic movement that occurred in this country, I could not let this
time pass without having to remind you of something. Yesterday, 50 years
ago yesterday, 600 people gathered in Brown Chapel Church in Selma, AL
in order to march to Montgomery to protest the fact that they could not
vote as the majority community could. They got to the Edmond Pettis
bridge and were met by the Alabama Highway Patrol, the Sheriff’s
deputies, and at that time they were beaten back with billy clubs, with
tear gas and ordered to leave. It got to the point that even the sheriff

  Refused to call or hand alliance to those who were hurt.  On two days
later, there was another march going from Brown Chapel in Selma to
Montgomery.  That march was stopped again with the marchers turned back.
 On two weeks later, after an outcry from all across the world and all
across the country, thousands of people gathered, 67,000 people gathered
in Montgomery to carry out that march.  It took them three days to do
it, it was one of the most historic moments in that period of time,
because it brought to floor some of the things about the way citizens
were being treated in the country.
President Lyndon Johnson got the members of Congress and he introduced a
bill, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which was signed into law some five
months after Bloody Sunday, and it took away some of the restrictions
like literacy tests that were given at the time.
And the reason I speak to this, I can recall John Lewis from the event
rough in, an African American named John Edwards, and myself going into
Eastern North Carolina trying to get folks to register to vote.  And we
were turned away, not by white folks, but by black folks, simply because
they were afraid to go register to vote, afraid because they might lose
their jobs, and we understood that, but we still tried.  And as a
result, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, you have before you now
people who would not be here had it not been for the action that was
taken in 1965 and that historic Act that was passed.
I mention all of this simply to say to you that it appears to me that we
have morphed from the 19th century to the 21st century, because all the
progress that has been made has been passed over.  I looked at the Viva
Act which was passed last year.  For those that don&#39;t know that,
that was House Bill 589 that put back into effect some of those things.
It was an affront to me because I was the one who put in legislation
that loosened up registration in this State, it&#39;s still loose, but
there&#39;s other factors in there.  And so we&#39;re here, again, about
to repeat history, and I want to leave you with the words of my mentor,
my friend, Martin King, Jr., what he said on the steps of Montgomery,
the Alabama capital in Montgomery on March 25th of 1965.  He said, and I
quote, &#39;the end we seek is a society that can live with its
conscience.  I know you are asking today, how long will it take?  I come
to say to you this afternoon, however difficult the moment, however
frustrating the hour, it will not be long.&#39;

cancer that he expected. He felt pretty sure he’d gotten it all. It’s
not going to require any chemo or radiation. I will have to go back
every 3 months for about 3 years to get checked out but it could’ve been
a whole lot worse and I’m grateful it’s as good as it is and appreciate
your support. Thank you. [applause] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Congratulations.
