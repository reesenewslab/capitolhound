House will come to order, members will take their seats. Visitors have
retired from the chamber. The Sergeant at Arms has closed the door,
members and visitors will please silent all electronic devices. The
prayer will be offered by Judy Low, legislative assistant to
Representative Tim Davis. Members and visitors will please stand and
remain standing for the Pledge of Allegiance. Miss Low.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Please bow your heads and we'll go to the Lord in prayer. Our heavenly
Father, thank you for the privilege to be able to come to you in prayer
to open today's session. Thank you, too, for those who are here today
and may you bless all of the men and women who have chosen to be part of
this important place, giving of their time and their talent to
faithfully serve their constituents. Give them them a caring heart and
an open mind to deal wisely in a place fraught with many challenges. Be
with them as they strive to be all inclusive with their decision making.
While understanding and working through their differences, so as one
body they serve every person in this great state. Each member
contributes as they are inclined and gifted, often in unseen ways and
each one is singularly and collectively important to this significant
institution. They are truly valued by us and by you. As this two year
journey draws to a close be with those who will be leaving, they have
served us well, and prepare those who will be joining forces here for
their season of service. I ask all of this in the name of my Lord and
Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.

Petitions, memorials, or papers to address the general assembly or the
house? The clerk advises there are none. Chapter bills will be noted.
Notices and announcements? Before I recognize . . . Are there any?
Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just wanted to get a little clarification on the
14th, if that's available?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Hall, I believe that there will be an actually session on
the 14th at high noon and stay tuned.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
And, of course . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
As I have more information, I'll give it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Then, for an announcement for those who are listening. And, I know we're
going to adjourn to a session for Sunday's, that's my understanding, so

objection.
