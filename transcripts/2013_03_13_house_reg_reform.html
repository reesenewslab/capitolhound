[Speaker changes.]...alright, thank you.  I wondered why when I asked
them to take their seats, no one would listen. Ya'll are usually so
polite. Good morning, a quorum being present, the House Subcommittee on
Regulatory Reform of local government is in session.  Our House
Sargents-at-Arms today are Robert Rossi, Billy Jones, Carmelo Morello
and Doug Harris. Where are my papers?  I don't have a list of the Pages.
 Would you please stand and identify yourselves?
[Speaker changes.] INAUDIBLE
[Speaker changes.] Emily Hatcher...Hedger??? Maya Haynes??? from Wake
County. Sally Hennessey???? from Cabarrus.  Welcome to the House
Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform of local government.  Thank you for
your service. We have one bill on the calendar for today. It is the
intention of the Chair to vote today.  Representative Nelson Dollar is
recognized to present House Bill 150 and I believe we have a PCS.  Is
that in place before us?
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman, I would move that the PCS be
properly before us for discussion purposes.
[Speaker changes.] OK...are you a member of the committee, Nelson? You
are, aren't you? Yeah...OK...motion is in order without objection, so
ordered. Representative is recognized to explain the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Has the PCS been passed out? Thank you, Mister
Chairman and members of the committee.  I will try to keep my
presentation reasonably brief and I know that there are some groups that
wanna speak on this as well as some questions from the committee.
Essentially, all this bill does...or what this bill does, is attempt to
balance the scales between what municipalities in particular want to do
in terms of regulating the aesthetics of an individual's home and the
right of folks building homes and purchasing homes to be able to have
more say in the aesthetics of what they purchase and what is available
in the market place. We have seen, in a number of communities around the
state, a host of evermore restrictive and evermore detailed efforts to
control...you know, what shade of beige your...the cornice is on your
house or what's the design on your front door.  These kinds of things
that have just kinda gone from trying to establish an overall look to a
community to, in some cases, what has amounted to being bizarre or some
sort of 1994 type of scenario, which I don't think we want in this
state.  This bill seeks to, and I believe does, balance out the
interest...the municipality will still have considerable authority...if
they do not want to grant zoning for a particular project, they will
continue to retain that. In the past, there'd been some legislation that
went much further than the bill before you this morning and sought to
both place additional restrictions on municipalities with respect to
commercial and multi-family development. This bill does not do that.
This bill is a narrowly tailored bill that addresses one and two family
dwellings and that's all this bill addresses. If you'll look in section
one, you'll see that down on line 9, addresses one and two family
dwellings.  You'll also see that there are a list of six exceptions and
those go to local historic districts, structures that are on the
National Registry of Historic Places; structures that are individually
designated either by local, state or national historic landmarks.  It
does not effect any regulation that would be put in place for applicable
safety code.....</p>

<p id="05:00">
It does not effect or would not be able to restrict the municipality or
a county in section 2 where they're seeking to regulate manufactured or
modular housing. It also doesn't have an impact in terms of national
flood insurance. I would also add, I guess I'm going to skip for just a
moment, but if you will look in at the top of page 2 under item H and
then also a corresponding section on page 3, excuse me, on page 2 line
36, you will see that it's clearly stated nothing in section G of this
section shall effect the validity or enforcement of private covenants or
other contractual agreements among property owners relating to building
design elements and aesthetics or building design elements, so in other
words if there are covenants in force those will stay in force, there's
no, very clear about not having a scenario where you have covenants and
then somebody's trying to break those with an infield piece of property.
From line on the back on the front page from line 22-29 this is making
sure that the negotiations are balanced between development and the
municipality and then any sort of, what some of us would consider sort
of back door coercion to say OK, well, we can't directly tell you what
to put on your front door but unless you do this you're not going to get
this or we're not going to allow folks to play those kinds of games so
that's addressed, and then if you look down about 2/3 of the way down on
line 29 you actually have building design elements, this is the
aesthetics, this is the heart of the bill, that is defined as meaning
the exterior building color, type and style of exterior cladding,
material style or material of roof structures, porches, exterior,
non-structural architectural ornamentation, location or architectural
styling of windows, doors, including garage doors, the number and type
of rooms in the interior, layout of rooms inside your house, which it
seems to me the city shouldn't be concerned about how you want to design
your house inside. We also have again a couple of more restrictions to
what we're doing here. We're clearly laying out that in these building
design elements that this does not include the municipality's ability to
regulate height, bulk, orientation or location of a structure on a
zoning lot and it does not in any way impede the ability of a
municipality to address buffering/screening issues, light impacts, noise
impacts, to protect the privacy of other neighbors or neighborhoods, so
Mr. Chairman, I believe this is a very narrowly tailored bill. On the
second page if you look at section 2 that is simply a mirror because you
have the codes for municipalities, the statutes for municipalities in
one section of the law and the statutes for counties in one section, so
those are mirrored sections to make sure that we are covered. It's a
narrowly tailored bill and I believe that it helps balance the scales
and it certainly goes a long way to curbing what many people believe are
really not licensed so to speak that a lot of municipalities have taken
and how they address the specific aesthetics on house when it's clear to
many of us that they really don't have the statutory authority to do
this now, but this bill will clarify that. And, Mr. Chairman, I'd be
happy to answer any questions. I know you have a number of people who
want to speak on this issue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative. What I'd like to do is take questions for the bill
sponsor. We then have 10 people that have signed up to speak and I would
like to allow them to speak before we debate the bill. Without
objection, are there any questions for Representative Dollar.
Representative McManus. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I do have a
question. You said that it would not undo any covenants, but it would</p>

<p id="10:00">
so not prevent any homeowner covenants or that kind of thing from being
created, right?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  That's correct.  And just to bridge
off of that, if you look on page two, line 39, the effective date of
this is for development approvals granted on or after the date of
enactment.  So it is forward-looking.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I just wanted
to make sure that if a development, a new development, was choosing to
create those homeowner covenants, that they would still be able to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, absolutely.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Do you have
another follow up, Representative?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I kind of do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow up.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Did I ?? I was
thinking about it?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yeah.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  There
are some small towns that actually do like having these kinds of
restrictions.  I'm curious as to whether an amendment would be possible
that if a town voted to do this, they could still do that?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Well, they have to, municipalities are creatures of the state,
and as we have seen in a number of suits over particularly the last ten
years, we've had a lot of municipalities really attempting to stretch
what they can and can't do in a variety of areas.  And the courts for
the most part have been coming back time and time again saying, you do
not have statutory authority for that.  And many of us believe that a
lot of this that's involved with the aesthetics is municipalities taking
an approach to stretch their authority far beyond what they actually
have a statutory underpinning for.  I'm not sure that answers your
question.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Do you have a follow up?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Yes.  We have a letter from the town of Morrisville, and
they're opposing the bill because they like their restrictions.  If that
township chose to run a, I don't know what it would be called, a
referendum where they let their citizens vote on whether they wish the
town to establish those kinds of regulations, could they still do it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Well that's not in this legislation.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  I'm going to let the staff answer that question.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Representative McManus, right now, referendums are only
allowed as specifically by statute.  There is no statutory authority to
have a referendum on that matter.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative
Terry.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I'm sorry.  I noted on this correspondence
regarding the Morrisville town, something about infill development.  And
I want to know what the impact of the infill development would be in a
municipality where there is an ordinance about design as it relates to,
a lot of our cities have vacant land that is not necessarily zoned
contiguously for new development, but there is a lot of vacant land.
How would this impact, coming into a municipality where you've got
opportunities for development, for infill, in neighborhoods that are
already established?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Well, if it's a zoning matter,
the municipality or the county would continue to have full zoning
authority in terms of how they wanted to zone that piece of property.
What this addresses is the problem that we've run into for which they
really don't have, in many of our views, statutory authority to do,
which is to determine the outside aesthetics of a particular, in this
case, this just applies to one- and two-family residential homes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow up.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  You helped me to
understand exactly what I am trying to drive at.  I'm speaking of areas
that are currently older areas, developed, not anything new like the
Morrisville town is.  And what we're looking at is an ordinance that
does require specific design, build criteria to blend with these old
neighborhoods.  They're large tracts, but they still need to</p>

Improve the property and the area, the neighborhoods. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't think there's anything old in Mooresville anymore, but I'll lay
that aside. I think that your question, if you have a covenant in place
that deals with the design elements of the structures, the residential
homes being built there that would still be in effect and that was what
I was mentioning in terms of at the top of page 2. Those private
covenants and agreements would still be in effect, they would not be
affected by the legislation. If it's an older existing neighborhood,
which you were addressing Innfield, then it would depend on whether or
not there was some covenant for that. If not, they would be free to
build within whatever the restrictions, the zoning restrictions are for
that particular residential area. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Holley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, thank you,
Mr. Chairman. This one is. I'm all over the place on this one, on what
I, can you hear me? Am I coming through? I'm all over the place on this
one. First of all, I have a number of communities in my area that have
protected covenances because they're newer developed neighborhoods but I
also have a very large part of the city that does not have that design
community. Personally, my district just became historic, my neighborhood
became historic, but it would not have become historic had the homes
that had been built there in recent years not adhered to the standards
of the homes that were currently there that allowed us then to get the
historic designation because the community had a level of continuity. I
also understand affordable housing and my community is desperately in
need of affordable housing and a lot of these issues would address some
of the affordable housing by making it a little bit easier, but I'm
concerned about in areas that do not have protected covenances or where
it's not a community that can be built in and I'm just wondering how
flexible are we on this. Can we hear what people have to say? I need
more information. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Well, let me try to
answer part of that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, I'm not sure that
there was a question in there, just a request for more knowledge and I
think our speakers might be able to address some of the issues. With
your indulgence, sir, I'll let you respond if you like, but I think at
this point let's go ahead and hear from the members of the public that
have spoken up. You're going to hear on both sides of that issue. I'd
like to start with, are you ready, with Mark Zimmerman, and Mr.
Zimmerman would you please tell us. I believe you're speaking in favor
and would you tell us who you represent, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman, Representative Dollar and members of the committee, thank you
very much for letting me speak today. My name is Mark Zimmerman, I'm a
realtor in the Triangle and the 2013 Legislative Chair of the North
Carolina association of realtors. I'm here today to ask for your
favorable vote on House Bill 150. The North Carolina Association of
Realtors supports House Bill 150 and asks that you do the same because
there are no public safety or welfare purposes served by regulating
design and aesthetic elements of housing. Many local governments are
mandating arbitrary architectural control through zoning ordinances that
add significant cost to housing construction without providing an
additional financial return to the homeowner. The result is less
affordable housing. That's never a good thing, but its impact is worse
right now as North Carolinians displaced by home ownership by the recent
recession are finally setting their sights on purchasing a home again
for their families. A few examples of design control elements that are
impacting homeowners are the number and types of rooms in a house,
dictating where garage entries may be placed on a house, specifying what
materials can be used to clad the exterior and even minimum window
spacing mandates. These type of design and aesthetic requirements drive
up the cost of  home. In addition, when local governments dictate these
types of design requirements, they displace</p>

<p id="20:00">
The important role the free market plays in building appropriate housing
stock. Homeowners lose the ability and quite frankly their right to
choose the design elements of their home as it fits their individual
needs and desires. Likewise home builders lose their ability and their
right to produce a product that meets market demands and keeps up with
consumer driven trends. Builders and consumers should be allowed to work
together to build homes that best meet their needs in the most cost
effective way possible without interference of a handful of local
officials who desire to replace the efficiency and effectiveness of the
free market with their own personal tastes and preferences. It is
important to mention that House Bill 150 will not hinder a local
government's ability to implement requirements pertaining to the health,
safety and welfare of the citizenry nor will it prevent establishing
requirements pertaining local historic districts, properties on the
national register or historic landmarks. It will also not interfere with
the covenants or private contracts established by homeowner's
associations or similar voluntary private entities. The American dream
of home ownership is such an important part of what makes this country
so great. By unnecessarily increasing the cost of housing we are pricing
people out of home ownership without any valid public purpose. Please
help us preserve that dream for all who aspire to it by voting for a
favorable report on House Bill 150. Thank you very much. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Zimmerman and thank you for keeping your remarks
under 3 minutes and I would ask the speakers to limit their remarks to 3
minutes. Second speaking in opposition is Paul Meyer for the North
Carolina League of Municipalities. Mr. Meyer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I'm Paul Meyer of the North
Carolina League of Municipalities. We appreciate the opportunity to
express opposition of all North Carolina cities and towns and the
taxpayers and residents that we serve to House Bill 150. With me today
are other individuals who can further explain the problems the proposed
legislation creates. Mayor Nancy McFarland, City of Raleigh on behalf of
Wake County Mayors and other Mayors who hold elected office in cities
who use aesthetics controls to enhance economic vitality in cities and
towns. Mayor Jill Swand of Huntersville is here and Chad Meadows, Mr.
Meadows is here representing the planning professionals in our state.
What are aesthetics controls? You've heard Representative Dollar explain
what this is. They are elements of local development codes which enable
existing property owners and communities as a whole to have a say in the
appearance of infield development, redevelopment projects and new
subdivisions some of which are owned and some of which will be rental
properties. These items include the orientation of buildings to the
street, roof pitch on homes, type of materials on the exterior of the
new buildings. Obviously each locality is using these codes in their own
way to establish their own vision for their town, character of a given
city and these development codes are used widely. These are not rare,
ranging from small towns and resort communities all the way up to North
Carolina's largest cities. The say of existing neighborhoods in a
negotiation between the city and the builder of the developer as to what
the aesthetic considerations can feasibly be integrated into the project
to improve its support in a given community which in turn increases its
changes of being approved by the given council and support across the
community. The elimination of these planning tools as proposed in House
Bill 150 will limit those negotiations. This is particularly important
in projects proposing higher densities, where homes are closer together
or even connected to one another. You will here that the authority of
cities to control aesthetics does not exist under current law and why
should builders have to sue cities to prove that that city is acting
illegally. Municipal attorneys across the state disagree with the
attorneys of the North Carolina Homebuilders Association on their
interpretation of the law and not one North Carolina court has ever
directly said elected city officials lack the authority to create
planning and development codes imposing aesthetic controls. You'll also
hear aesthetic controls drive up the cost of housing as to prevent
affordable housing projects such as those created by Habitat for
Humanity and other nonprofits from being built. Cities are the number
one supporters of these type of projects and often times it is the
inclusion of a few minor aesthetic changes in these projects which help
turn the tide of opposition from neighboring property owners.</p>

and encourage City Councils to approve the projects. And you will likely
also hear that local communities should not be involved in these
decisions that the market should make these decisions without input from
locally elected officials. To a large extent that is true, but in the
broad sense mayors and city council members are elected by the people to
enhance economic prospects for communities and to make decisions to
improve the quality of life for city residents and businesses. And if
the people don't like the decisions that are being made by the members
of those City Councils they can be kicked to the curb in the next
election. It's no different than members of the General Assembly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Meyer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you please wind up sir. You're coming up on 4
minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will rap up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm under no illusion there are probably horror
stories out there where builders justifiably feel they have been treated
unfairly. But the policy question facing this committe is whether their
stories warrant a statewide elimination of the ability of cities and
town to promote a vision for local communites and provide a safer city
residents and businesses in the context of esthetic. On behalf of all
North Carolina cities and towns acting through the league of
municipalities we believe the answer should be no. And we ask you not to
not to support or approve House Bill 150. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Myer. Our next speaker will be Carley
Ruff, Master of Social Work with North Carolina Housing Coalition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you members of the
committee. I'm Carley Ruff. I'm with the North Carolina Housing
Coalition. We're a statewide advocacy organization striving to ensure
that all North Carolinians have a safe, decent, affordable place to
live. We've been doing that for 25 years. We're also a membership
organization and we have members that are across the, back from
affordable housing from homeless service providers all the back up to
developers who develop affordable entry level home ownership
opportunities and included in that as Paul said our Habitat For Humanity
affiliates. When this bill was introduced last session and this session
I reached out to our members who are Habitat affiliates and CDCs to see
what their feelings were on this bill. There really was consensus among
those folks that esthetic design controls do drive up the cost of
producing housing affordable housing for folks who are looking to
achieve that dream of ownership. And many of you probably have
participated in habitat bills before. And if you have you know it's a
beautiful thing where families working families come together to buy a
home at 0% interest and provides what equity on their home along side
members of their community. These sort of esthetic controls do drive up
the cost and eventually get passed on to the buyer. In some cases these
kinds of controls can effecitvely zone out effective housing and
organizations like Habitat For Humanity who are looking to provide
housing for working members of the community. So I will be brief and
just say that I hope you will support House Bill 150 and support all of
those working families in your communities that are looking for
affordable home ownership opportunities. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Ms. Ruff. Next will be the Honorable Nancy
McFarlane, Mayor of the City of Raleigh speaking on behalf of the
Metroplitan Mayor's Conference. Welcome Mayor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much and thank you all for allowing me
the time to address this important bill. My name is Nancy McFarlane. I'm
the Mayor of Raleigh. I have with me also Miles Atkins who is the Mayor
of Morrisville. I  have Russell Killen who is the Mayor of Knightdill,
dale. I have Ken Bowers. He is the our Deputy Planning Director who is
also available to answer any questions about impacts on codes and city
development and a representative of the Raleigh City of Commerce. I'm
here, I am also, I'm representing the Wake County Mayor Association who
unanimously passed a resolution and opposition to this bill and the
Metropolitan Mayor's Coalition and Organization. It represents the 28
largest cities in the state. We have serious concerns about House Bill
150. You know the most important part of local government is the input
with its citizens. We work cooperatively to develop our codes and
regulations in direct response to what our community wants. In Raleigh
we just completed our unified development ordinance. This was a three
year collaborative process with developers, the homebuilders, and the
citizens that have come up with a code that will shape how we grow. We
know that there are cities and towns across the state that all work very
hard with their constituents to make sure that they develop their
standards in response to what their community wants. But you're right
there may be a few that have gone too hard. Our concern is that you are
passing a bill that will really take the entire state to the lowest
common denominator</p>

<p id="30:00">
Just for the actions of a few. This bill is in direct conflict from what
we hear from our electric. We all have the same goal in this room and
that is to produce cities and a state that focuses on economic
development and affordable housing. We're just asking that we work
together to make sure that we get the details of this bill right so
there are no unintended consequences. We have some serious concerns
about the restrictions on interior placements of rooms. This opens to
door to a 4 bedroom 4 bathroom single house that could be used as a
rooming house that could be introduced into any single family
neighborhood. We have great concerns about that. We also have great
developers that build quality products. Is it fair to see their
investment damaged because anything can be built adjacent to it? People
work hard their entire lives to buy a home. It's their primary
investment. Is it fair to them to lose their savings because someone
builds a boarding house or something next door? Raleigh, along with Wake
County, and the other cities of this state are excellent examples of how
to do it right. We hope that you will continue the conversation and
allow the mayors the courtesy of being apart of the discussion going
forward. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mayor. Next speaker is
Chad Meadows representing the North Carolina Planning Association.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr Chair, committee members. I am Chad
Meadows. I am representing the North Carolina Planning Association. I've
got 1,500 members who work everyday to create and preserve the great
communities of our state. We are opposed to this bill. I believe you
received just prior to the hearing a letter from the city of Mooresville
along with a pair of photographs. I will talk with you about that for a
minute. On one side of the photographs you see the page house. In fact
it is something old that was built in Mooresville. It was built in 1830.
It's an outstanding structure, good example of North Carolina
architecture. If you flip the page over, you see what was built in an
adjacent lot. Now this white house that you see was built without any
design controls. A jarring contrast, to say the least. Now Mooresville
has adopted design controls to stop this kind of thing from happening in
the future. Those design controls would not be available to the city if
House bill 150 were to pass. That's a source of serious concern for us.
We're also concerned that the bill could reverse progress toward
efficient development patterns that are taking place in the state.
Movements toward homes on smaller lots to reduce sprawl. Compact
development to reduce air pollution. Infill near existing infrastructure
to help us better leverage our investment on infrastructure and higher
tax base now to function as intended, efficient development patterns
depend upon compatibility. Compatibility between new development and
existing development that's already in place. Compatibility hinges upon
good design. If local governments don't have the ability to work with
applicants to get good design that's compatible with existing
development, then the likelihood of getting infill and compact
development approved is diminished. Finally, we think the bill limits
predictability in the review process. One of the things that we find in
efficient development codes are situations where clear standards are
enumerated for all to understand and there's no negotiation necessary to
get the kind of development that's preferred. This bill would call for
local governments to rely on things like conditional zoning and other
negotiation efforts to get the kind of development in their communities.
So, because of these reasons, and for a variety of others, we encourage
you to oppose House bill 150. Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Meadows. Our next speaker is Peter Cieslak. He represents

voice opposition to the bill specifically for the reason of it includes
exterior siding materials, exterior cladding materials as written in the
bill. A reason for mentioning that phrase is that we believe exterior
cladding materials, particularly masonry, bricks, is more than
aesthetics. They have other attributes that are important to
municipalities as they have shown by ordaining mason- putting masonry
ordinances in place. There are economic as well as health and safety. So
our position would be to, if those exterior cladding materials was
removed for the bill, then we would be alright with it. So thanks very
much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Our next speaker is Rick Turner from Ply Gem
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and also committee members for allowing me to be
here today. My name is Rich Turner, and I'm a 30 year resident of
Raleigh, and I work with Ply Gem industries. Ply Gem industries is a
building materials manufacturer with its corporate headquarters based in
Cary, North Carolina. We are one of the leading producers and
manufactures of PVC building materials in the country, employing
approximately 1450 employees. For over 40 years, PVC cladding, more
commonly known as vinyl siding,  has been a cladding of choice for many
homeowners around the country. Currently because of the low maintenance
and because of the affordability cost associated with vinyl siding, 38%
of all housing starts nationally choose vinyl exterior cladding. Our
product line provides many affordable cladding options for homeowners to
choose when making a decision for exterior cladding for their home. Our
product line is designed to assist homeowners, municipalities, and other
jurisdictions to have a great deal of aesthetic control and
determination in the exterior appeal of homes that are built- or
homeowners in cities and towns across the country. The installation of
the products that we produce is very very important and very key, and
because of that our industry works tirelessly through the vinyl siding
institute which my company is a member of, to support and to push to
educate and to train contractors and home builders and jurisdictions in
the certified installation of our products. We're here today in support
of 150, and we'd appreciate your support and I'd be happy to answer any
questions from anyone now or later on if I can be of any help. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir, and just as a notice to members of the committee, there
is not a committee in here following at 11, so we have the room, so
we're not going to run out of time. We'll get ample chance to debate.
Next speaker is Joe Padilla, who represents the Real Estate and Building
Industry Coalition in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Joe
Padilla, I'm the executive director of the Real Estate and Building
Industry Coalition in Charlotte. And I'm here on behalf of our home
builder and realtor members in order to ask you to support HB 150. Our
members are frustrated at being asked to meet arbitrary design
requirements that add thousands to the cost of a home, while providing
little or no value for the consumer. The majority of our local
governments in Mecklinburg county require or are considering illegal
design requirements, and many of our local officials don't currently
understand what they have on the books. I've sat through zoning hearings
in some of our towns watching board members debate whether a requirement
for a full brick home means that the steps leading up to the porch
should be made of brick. Our members have had to suffer patiently in
town board meetings where town board members debated what shade of
yellow can be on a particular set of shutters, where windows or doors
may be located, and other design criteria. None of these requirements
affect public health and safety, but they do add to a cost of a home and
they exclude affordable housing from local communities. Now earlier in
my career I worked for a national home builder, and we spent millions
each year researching home buyer preferences so that we can design plans
perfectly tailored to each local market. We learned that buyers,
especially moving into their first home, are less concerned about
whether their home has brick or hardy plank, and more concerned with
whether they can afford the monthly mortgage payment.</p>

If the local government wants to participate in the building architect
design process perhaps, they should also be willing to participate in
the risk that each individual builder takes to build an affordable
product. We ask you for your support with house bill 150 we, believe it
will help to reign in some of the excessive design criteria that we are
seeing in the local government without compromising the ability of
builders and developers to freely negotiate, for a condition or a
requirement on zoning that everyone would find suitable for that
particular community or product. I thank you for your time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Our next speaker is the the honorable Jill Swain
Mayor of Huntersville. Mayor Swain, welcome to rally. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. I was here last week so it’s nice to be back, and
it’s nice actually to follow Joe. We had a very good conversation
yesterday. Which I think is the prime example of what should be
happening more across this state. More communication between the
builders and the municipalities. I think that we found areas that we
agreed upon, with regard to Huntersville specifically, and I would like
to share those with you. And take the opportunity to advise you of my
town, Huntersville’s opposition. To some of the to some of the
provisions in House Bill 150. Based on the town’s 17 years of experience
with design standards. And, also with the citizen evolvement that
created ordinance that supports affordable housing. Since 1996 the town
of Huntersville, has had design based standards, during which time over
5,300 single family residential homes were built by production builders.
With prices ranging from around $100,000 to $700,000. Even during the
great recession, building did not stop in the town of Huntersville.
Huntersville’s code provides maximum flexibility for development
community by having 7 zoning districts, that have no maximum density, no
minimum lot size, that have no minimum lot width. In fact, these zones
allow single family, duplexes, town homes, apartments, by right, and
even commercial uses in some cases. However, in exchange for this
flexibility allowing the private sector to meet the needs of their
consumers, quality design is expected. Particularly, the garage door
located either flush, or 10 foot behind the front facade. Now, builders
and developers decide on the exterior building materials, brick, vinyl,
etc. And the styling of the architectural features in development. We
allow flexibility in exchange for some design specifics. Current zoning
enabling legislation specifically, provides for regulating the size of
yards, which is the basis of establishing garage set backs. Further, the
State Supreme Court in State vs. Jones, ruled that regulations based on
aesthetics alone is valid when the reduction in property value is
balanced against the corresponding gain to the public. But, the the town
of Huntersville does not support communities using design and aesthetic
controls to increase the cost of housing. Further, my town does not
support establishing design and aesthetic controls without providing
flexibility to the development community. In order that they can meet
the needs of a changing environment. Basically, House Bill 150 as
currently written, would impact, negatively Huntersville’s ability to
protect community character. Which, is a fundamental responsibility of
local government. And, it is essential for us to be able to recruit
economic development opportunities that include that population that
will be looking for affordable housing, that we encourage. Thank you,
for your service to the citizens and your consideration, of those
instances where towns may have exceeded their authority. But, lease
realize, [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mayor you are coming up on four minutes could
you whined it up please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] please realize that there are
unattended consequences for those communities like Huntersville, that
actually do it right. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mayor. Mike
Carpenter.</p>

North Carolina Home Builder's Association. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I want to commend the sponsor
and the co-sponsor for bringing this issue forward. This is not the
first time that this issue has been in front of the general assembly.
This, a predecessor of this legislation has passed the senate both in
the 2009 and in the 2011 sessions, so it is not a new issue for this
general assembly. Let me just summarize, I think I'm not going to repeat
what was said, there have been some eloquent statements made. At the end
of the day, local governments that are opposing aesthetic controls lack
the authority to do that. Now, Mr. Meier says that his municipal
attorneys disagree with that, but I would certainly suggest that they
read the most recent decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court on the
question of adequate public facilities, in which the league petitioned
for rehearing on the very issue and sighted the lack of ability to
control aesthetics as a basis for the Supreme Court to re-hear that
case. So, I think that calls into question whether or not they actually
believe they have the authority to regulate aesthetics. There is little
doubt, however, that aesthetics causes, regulation of aesthetics, makes
it more difficult to build affordable housing. Adds cost, as you have
heard, without corresponding public benefit. So really at the end of the
day, the question is, is this the proper role of government? To decided
and let each jurisdiction that is doing this without any of limits, the
ability to decide in each jurisdiction exactly what ought to be the
shade of yellow on a shutter. Frankly, that is not the role of
government and this legislation will end that while preserving the
necessary things that are appropriate in this area. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Carpenter, he was our last speaker, so at this
point is there discussion and debate on the bill? Representative Ramsey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman could you explain, there was some
discussion of conditional use authority that local governments are
engaging in. Does this impact their ability to use conditional use
zoning, so that where, in some cases you have a use of the property that
is not provided for under the zoning controls but if they go through a
conditional use process that's allowed? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair
recognizes Erica Churchill of research staff to answer the gentleman's
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm going to try, it's a relatively broad
question and the PCS is relatively narrow on its impact on conditional
use zoning. It would, the prohibition or regulation, is only on those
related to design elements with respect to one or two family dwellings.
So, if you're talking about a conditional use zoning issue with
something outside a one or two family dwelling there is no impact. If
it's that one and two family dwelling there may be an impact because the
city would not be allowed to regulate building design elements unless it
happened to be historic district or something of another nature that
Representative Dollar talked about. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman
have a follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No follow up. Thank you Mr.
Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fulghum. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would this bill have any impact on the ability of a municipality to
further regulate the occupancy or density issues in any instance
involving these buildings or any other buildings for that matter,
obviously residential. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe the answer to that is
no, but I would refer to the staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Fulghum, I believe Representative Dollar got it exactly correct, density
is not impacted by this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up? Representative Moffitt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Chair, at the appropriate time I'd like to make a motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Holley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I
still see a lot of problems. I see some good things about it and I
understand why it's happening and I understand why you don't
particularly want all this regulation on aesthetics.</p>

But, I could also see my community ending up with a lot of trailer like
looking infield. Individual lots, areas that are not protected by a
covenant because of the gunning in the particular development. Because
we do not have these developments. I don’t have the answers, I’m just
trying to figure out if there is something that we can do to limit. My
two concerns, one is the areas about the kitchens, and being able to
have so many kitchens and rooming houses because I can tell you now that
there are a number of those in my area, that have become rooming houses.
And the other is, what can we do to protect areas that are prehistoric?
Like I was saying, you know, if you go in to an infield community that
is beautiful right now, but all the sudden you start getting non
aesthetic homes in that area, and in two years that area will no longer
qualify for historic designation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Dollar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A couple of points. One with regard to
manufactured or modular housing that’s one of the exceptions. Looking.
Well the other exception Aye would mention to you, is talking about
local historic districts. So if you’ve got the designation, you know,
that’s an exception thats already in the legislation. The other comment,
and we had talked before the meeting started. If someone using and there
in a residential area, and they’ve got a rooming boarding house
scenario. That’s not legal now and the city needs to enforce that code
currently, that is a current problem, that is not a issue addressed in
this legislation and will not stop them from preventing that from
happening. And, if their not enforcing it, Aye would say go to the city,
and ask them why their allowing a commercial operation like that to go
on when, when it is not legal for that to go on.  The other thing
though, Aye would just, and this isn’t exactly what you said a moment
ago but it did go back to a comment that was made earlier and that is,
in terms of the layouts of the rooms, and the kitchens and stuff, Aye
just, it just sends chills up my spine, to think that my local
government is going to tell me how many bedrooms to have and wether or
not Aye can have a kitchen downstairs, or wether or not, you know my
mother is coming to live with me that Aye can’t, you know fix another
kitchen in there. As long as it meets the codes and all the other
applicable safety codes, which again are not in anyway impacted by this
legislation. The government coming in, and telling me how many bedrooms
to have is just mind boggling to me, and to think that we have gotten to
that point. And, Aye think that this legislation in a very balanced way,
says okay, we need to stop, we need to be reasonable. Cities still have
tremendous powers in terms of zoning and the like. And also again, this
legislation does not effect commercial development. It does not effect
the design elements in your downtown areas, commercial areas in the
like, and it doesn't effect  multi family housing. So, Aye would
encourage your support for the legislation. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman. Aye
just wanted to go over a few things. A very key supreme court case came
out in August called the Landfill Properties Case. That was pretty much
on topic here. Our constitutional structure which was allows the
legislator to delegate two cities, and towns, and counties, zoning
powers. But, the counties don’t have any inherent authority to enact
zoning ordinances, that comes from the general assembly. That’s in
accordance with our constitutional frame work. The case was about wether
a local government had an over reach.</p>

<p id="55:00">
It’s zoning ordinance authority. Basically, the court said, yes, it had
overreached. The basic reason here is the zoning statutes are not
ambiguous. The plain language of the zoning statutes given to the
counties are not ambiguous. There’s no need for the local governments to
try to do all of these other things because they’re set forth exactly
what they are able to do.  The provisions in that articulate basic
zoning concepts and they impose reasonable constraints on how country
governments can impose zoning powers. Architectural design and
aesthetics are not part of what this general assembly has given to our
local governments. This bill is making that absolutely clear because
there are local governments that are overreaching. It’s quite clear. As
far as the question that I know Rep. Hollo and I know some others have
asked. How do we protect certain communities that are not in this bill.
The Supreme Court opinion actually spells out a little about you do
that. That is the subject of specific enabling legislation. The local
government wants to do these kinds of things. They come to the general
assembly. They explain their case. They make their case. They get us to
say aye or naye. That has happened before. It has been allowed in some
places and not in other places, depending on specific situation. That’s
how you handle specific local situations that differ. Not by trying,
like some of our speakers have said today, to let the statewide every
local government go and do anything it wants to add to the current
legislation. They can’t add to our legislation. We have been very clear
in the past, the general assembly. Not me because I wasn’t here. We’ve
been very clear about what they can do. This bill is making that even
more clear based on these current cases that have come out. These
current attempts to overreach. One of our speakers, Mr. Meyer from the
league, who is a friend of mine, said that citizens can kick the
municipal elected officials to the curb if they overreach. Well, there
is something called an ETJ, and that’s for Jericho jurisdiction, where
these same ordinances apply and controls apply on people. Those people
can’t kick them out because they can’t vote in the city. That’s not an
option available to a lot of folks. We’ve heard that current law allows
municipalities to have their say. Actually, it’s more than that, they’re
claiming that it allows them to dictate things. The way certain things
look. They look good to me and not to you. That’s not an appropriate
thing unless the community has come together and taken a look at it.
Specific enabling legislation. That will be the way to handle this kind
of issue. When the defendants who were some local governments were
petitioning to re-hear this case. They spoke out specifically about what
their concern was. Here’s what their petition says. That calling the
Supreme Court opinion, which was a 5-2 opinion by the way. It’s not real
close, 5-2. In their petition the local government said: this overly
restrictive view of the general zoning powers calls into question the
validity of a wide variety of types of regulations commonly contained in
zoning ordinances. Such as, and one of those is, architectural design.
They complained that they can’t do that because it’s not specifically
mentioned in the zoning enabling legislation. That’s exactly the point
we are here today to discuss. Zoning legislation doesn’t allow them to
do this. We’re going to have to make it absolutely crystal clear. If
particular communities that have problems, they can come back with local
bills and take care of it if they have a good case. One of the final
statements in the opinion was really good. It kind of was a good way to
summarize this whole thing. The opinion says, we recognize that counties
enjoy flexibility in enacting ordinances. But, the, and they talk about
the sense and interpretation on certain statutes that aren’t quite clear
on the face, plain language. The interpretation of the descent, carried
to its logical conclusion, would give counties virtual carte blanche to
enact an unlimited range of ordinances affecting the use of real
property. No matter how tenuous the connection between the ordinance and
our zoning statutes. We are not persuaded that the general assembly
intended to give counties such expansive legislative power. We did not.
This bill is making that absolutely clear to those who would argue
otherwise. Who are out there now trying to argue that. Thank you Mr.
Chairman.</p>

the people who have spoken both in favor of and against this proposed
legislation. I would simply like to say that from my perspecive the
devil really is in the details of things like this. And there are two
things in particular that I would like to weigh in on. And that is the
idea of citizens being able to bring their views in as well as community
and neighborhood character. And those two remind me of a process through
which a lot of municipalities have gone through. Particularly the U D O
Process. And with that in mind even though the devil may lie in the
details of this the idea of the legislationw was proposed two sessions
before, and I'm a freshman so I don't know what those bills contained
and why they were left undone. But I would like to have the value of
more or better perspective in order to determine what on Earth were
doing here in terms of not allowing communities to try and move forward
