Messages from the Senate, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Special message from the Senate: Speaker ordered that the message be
sent to the House of Representatives with information the Senate adopts
the report of conferees for Senate bill 734, a bill to be entitled to be
an act to provide further regulatory relief to the citizens of North
Carolina by providing various administrative reforms by eliminating
certain unnecessary, outdated statutes and regulations and modernize,
simplify cumbersome or outdated regulations by making various other
statutory changes. With appropriate action being taken by both chambers,

Mr. Speaker
CHANGE SPEAKER
Member of the Chair would like to recognize an honorary page today, Alex
Tine who is the son of Representative Paul Tine is our sole honorary
page today, Alex we’re glad to have you here, if you all would join me
in welcoming him.
{Applause}
For what purpose does the Gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam,
rise?
CHANGE SPEAKER
For a motion.
CHANGE SPEAKER
The Gentleman is recognized for his motion.
CHANGE SPEAKER
Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules to the end that having voted on
the prevailing side that I could move to reconsider the vote by which
HOUSE BILL 369 failed to we failed to concur in that, and I’d like to
explain the motion.
CHANGE SPEAKER
The Gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
CHANGE SPEAKER
Mr. Speaker, members of the House. This is criminal law changes and most
of the bill is what the House passed overwhelmingly in 594 The Omnibus
Criminal Law Bill a couple of months ago. The Senate sent it back most
of it in 369 and we did not concur in it because it left out some
things. For example a fix to the death penalty mental retardation
language that Representative Glacier and I, and Ted Davis,
Representative Davis worked on. It left out a couple of Representative
Davis, I think maybe Representative Howard’s idea or Cherie Berry’s
idea, Representative Speciale’s provision on expungetion. So that’s why
we failed to concur an appoint a comp. freeze but the Senate never
appointed  comp. freeze, but there’s nothing really wrong with the bill
itself and the D.A.’s, you probably have gotten their letter, have
urgently requested that we pass this bill, it deals for example with
cell phones in prison. And I have shared it with the Minority leader,
shared it with our caucus, asked staff last night to send to your email
both the bill and the committee summary so you have some knowledge of it
before you showed up here today. So my motion right now is to suspend
the rules, the reason we have to suspend the rules is because you have
to make a motion to reconsider the next day and this is a couple, three
or four weeks later.  That’s my motion Mr. Speaker.
CHANGE SPEAKER
For what purpose does the Gentleman from Wake Representative Jackson
rise?
CHANGE SPEAKER
To speak to the motion.
CHANGE SPEAKER
The Gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
CHANGE SPEAKER
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I would just ask the members and my caucuses this
is what we talked about this morning, this bill is really important to
some people here in the Chamber today, and so I’d ask you to support
this motion.
CHANGE SPEAKER
Further discussion, further debate?
CHANGE SPEAKER
For what purpose does the Gentleman from Craven Representative Speciale
rise?
CHANGE SPEAKER
To speak on the, to ask a question of the sponsor.
CHANGE SPEAKER
If the Gentleman would please state his purpose again.
CHANGE SPEAKER
To see if the sponsor will take a question.
CHANGE SPEAKER
Does the Gentleman from Wake yield to the Gentleman from Craven?
CHANGE SPEAKER
I yield.
CHANGE SPEAKER
He yields.
CHANGE SPEAKER
Section 13 talks about getting the local governments and e-verify which
contracts e-verify applies to. Which contracts would it not apply to?
CHANGE SPEAKER
When we get to the Bill itself we will discuss that in greater detail,
but the committee summary says that this requires, this makes these
statutes consistent, that with similar statutes  for other governmental
entities apparently there’s a distinction between city and counties and
other governmental entities and Representative Burr is researching that
particular one for your more detail question, when we get to the bill.
CHANGE SPEAKER
And is Susan Fitts here?
CHANGE SPEAKER
And staff will be here before we get to the merits of the bill.
CHANGE SPEAKER
For what purpose does the Gentleman from Durham Representative Luebke
rise?
CHANGE SPEAKER
To see if Representative Stam would yield for a question.
CHANGE SPEAKER
Does the Gentleman from Wake yield to the Gentleman from Durham?
CHANGE SPEAKER
I do.
CHANGE SPEAKER
He yields.
CHANGE SPEAKER
Representative Stam this is a nice complicated set of maneuvers or
maneuvers perhaps is the wrong word, of actions, that you are talking
and I wonder that if I can ask you this. You are first of all asking for
a suspension of the rules because it more than one day to reconsider. Is
that correct?
CHANGE SPEAKER
Right. Right.
CHANGE SPEAKER
And if we reconsider you are going to move that we do concur in this.</p>

<p id="010:00">
In the Senate changes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. The Senate
refused to appoint conferees. The very important provisions were in the
bill we passed. They’re in this bill, and law enforcement really wants
it and needs it. And I [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does the gentlemen from Wake yield to the gentleman from
Durham? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stam, I appreciate that you sent the bill out
last night, and I did read it. And would just ask you that you would
give the body three or four points about why we should concur after we,
well actually now so we would know whether to vote to reconsider.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. And also, several days also sent it to the
leadership of your caucus as well. Not just last night. The provisions
that are of urgent need are 5, 6 and 8. 5 and 6 deals with penalties for
giving inmates cell phones in prison. That’s for section 5. Section 6
deals with people who assault person in retaliation because of their
exercise of legislative duties. I think in the gallery is Miss Jansen,
the daughter of the person who was held hostage in another state because
of his daughter’s service here as a district attorney. Then section 8 is
very important to the state crime lab. And this is the one I believe we
passed twice from this body, dealing with allowing remote testimony by
video of forensic and chemical analysis. The reason for this is because
it’s an exaggeration but let’s say our forensic scientists were spending
half their time travelling and sitting in court to give in-person
testimony, when they could do it by video. But there’s plenty of
protection for defendants because they can object, and get the actual
testimony. And I would refer you to Representative Jackson, who probably
does more criminal defense than I. And this came up several days ago.
Why has it, the House bill passed, why hasn’t the Senate bill passed?
What can you do about it? We can’t do a thing about the Senate, but by
passing three motions, we can go ahead and pass the parts of the bill
that need to pass. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just, and since [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will mention too, [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to continue responding to the
gentleman’s question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Since you do have a member who
teaches criminal law in law school, he in writing approved it and said
good, please get it done. Representative Glazier. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
the gentleman yield for an additional question from the gentleman from
Durham? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Actually just to, well, okay I’ll put it as a question. Will
you accept my thanks for explaining this to the members of the House?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m glad you asked these questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Michaux, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry to Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may
state his inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We vote to suspend the rules to put
this matter on, and just now pass this, does it now have to go back to
the Senate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that a question to me? The answer is
no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I was going to answer. No, the answer is if
the bill to reconsider comes on, the bill is before us as the Senate
sent it to it, and we can simply adopt it, in which case it goes to the
Governor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But if we don’t adopt it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we don’t adopt it, then it fails. It goes no where. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m trying [SPEAKER CHANGES] In this case, the procedural question is to
suspend the rules to reconsider. If this prevails by the votes of two
thirds, we would come back and vote on the ?? bill thereafter. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Can I follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
There seems to be a question as to actually what was put in that bill.
We sent it over there, they put something in it and sent it back here,
is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may wish to direct that
question as to the substance of the bill to the maker of the motion.
Does the gentleman of Wake yield to the gentleman from Durham? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, not exactly. We sent our Omnibus crime bill in a
different bill, 594. Why they didn’t take that up, I have no idea. They
took an unrelated bill and put 369, what you have before you. But it has
many, if not most of the provisions that we have passed</p>

gentleman from Onslow representative Cleveland rise McConville the
gentleman has for regulation to ask the sponsors of the gentleman from
Wakefield so question from the gentleman from Onslow I did yields
ironist in section 13 of this refers to E-Verify has nothing to do with
the person you are talking about and I thoroughly agree with the changes
your make in the code however in section 13 were basically telling small
governmental you and entities and municipalities that I don't have to
conduct E-Verify is your anyway that that portion can be removed from
this mellitus type automatically will that was one of the reasons we
failed to coalesce medically conferees was the think things like that at
the things we wanted to take the things out generally according to the
staff memo on this makes our cities and counties know are similar to
other governmental unity entities why the Senate decided to do that I
don't know what it's a compared to the magnitude of the rest of the bill
itself small market standard is demolitions (another questions about the
gentleman legitimate promotion I I can understand your magnitude bill
and unfortunately that happens frequently around here but in reality
from I can ascertain is that we passed a law that said municipalities
and governmental amenities would have to use E-Verify and now we're
changing that so that municipalities and other governmental unit
humidities don't have to use E-Verify if the contract is not half $1
million are larger so in entities the right to contract for less than
half $1 million doesn't use E-Verify I know that many guide me folks you
don't like the concept of E-Verify that E-Verify make sure that when
government contracts Glockner any business is doing business that are
hiring citizens of the state providing work for people who are legally
here and doing what they should be doing without this protection

To hire whoever they want at the cheapest labor price they can hire and
continue doing business as they have in the past. We have citizens
looking for jobs, and we have citizens that need jobs, and we as a body
should be doing what we can to help them. When we pass laws such as
this, they [vizierate] a system that is used to make sure citizens are
the ones being employed., we are not helping our constituents. I’m going
to have to vote no on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose the gentleman from Nash,
Representative Collins rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I’m confused, I thought the vote we just
took was to suspend the rules to reconsider our non-concurrence vote
earlier. Could I ask you what we’re current voting on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. The first motion, the motion to reconsider
was not on the legislative, they required a suspension of the rules to
do it on a different day, that motion was adopted.  The motion before
the [??] now; is the motion to reconsider the vote not to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Can I ask you one more question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does that mean we’re still not voting whether we like
this Bill or not? I’m going to read this thing and vote on it regardless
of the outcome of this vote. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For what purpose does the gentleman from Roan,
Representative Warren rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I’d like to ask the Representative from
Wake a question. Also, to make a comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman
from Roan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative [Steele] we failed to concur, or agreed
not to concur on this, on a vote of 112 to 0. So, my question would be.
What was so [egregious] in it in your opinion? That we voted unanimously
not to concur, that we should overlook now, to vote to concur. The
second thing, would you mind if I elaborate a little bit on the verify
question that Representative Cleveland had?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I won’t mind at all. Let me tell you what I know was
missing from it. First of all, the U.S. Supreme Court in Hall vs.
Florida said we had to in all death penalty cases handle retarded
citizens differently. The House Bill had that language, the Senate left
it out, not it’s the law anyway, but we wanted it in there. Second,
there were a couple of provisions that  think came from the Commissioner
of Labor concerning the vices at the State Fair and the penalties for
having unsafe equipment at the State Fair. Third, Representative
Speciale had a provision concerning expunctions that they left out. Now,
this one on E-verify, if we don’t change this, what it literally means
is, if a city worker goes to Kinko’s and gets some copies they’ve got to
get E-verification from the person selling them copies. This just
clarifies that it’s the same for all governmental entities whether it’s
like an actual contract.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I understand that, my second question was, “would you
mind if I explained to Representative Clevelan,” this has nothing to do
with hiring new employees. It simply clarifies the E-verify portion that
we passed last year, so that, as Representative Stam says, if you work
for a company, or you work for the city, or you work for one the
universities and you were to go to Staples to pick [reams] of paper or
whatever, every time you go into the store, by technical interpretation
of what we passed, you would have to get confirmation or affidavit from
the store that all their sub-contractors use E-verify. This correction
actually references an existing statue which sets the limitations or the
guidelines on contract amounts that that part of E-verify would be
applicable to. It a clean verification, its a technical clarification
and it doesn’t change the responsibility of any company being required
to comply with E-verify laws.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
Representative Michaux rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m very much confused, pardon my adult mind in this.
When did we vote not to concur on House Bill 369?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a moment. We voted on that July, 31st.  So,
that’s why the initial vote was to suspend the rules to allow
reconsideration on a different legislative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It was on . . .</p>

<p id="025:00">
The reason.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman have additional inquiry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah. My problem is, I thought we passed Representative Stam's bill by
112 to something, was that what it was? And that that was the bill that
was sent to the Senate and that the Senate took that bill and put it
into House bill 369, and sent it back over here. Or, and hadn't come
back. I'm confused, a little bit confused about that. Please help me
clear my mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, the chair is gonna let, this, Representative Stam's bill, the
chair's gonna let Representative Stam explain the history of his bill
and, if the gentleman is so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. It's not actually my bill. Sourced out of the
Judiciary C committee was House committee substitute for 594 which was a
omnibus criminal law bill. It passed here with many if not most of these
provisions by a large vote. I don't remember exactly. That was 594. The
Senate never took that up. Instead, they took an unrelated bill, 369,
put what you see before you in it, and sent it over here for
concurrence. We did not concur because of the four things missing from
it, but they never appointed conferees. But the underlying bill has
things that are very important and I would ask you to pass this motion
and the next motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Michaux
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To, to ask somebody a question again. If, and I suspect Representative
Stam, if we pass 560 whatever it was, and sent it to them, and then they
put that bill on the side and took another one of our bills and put 560
something into that bill, is that the bill that's just coming back to
us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman from Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They took, Representative Michaux, they took the contents of 594 and
took most of the contents of 594 and put it in 369, but not all of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And then when they put those contents into 369, was it sent back over
here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They did send it over here, yes. The July 31st or about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And what did we vote on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman wish to propound a third question, then does the gentleman
yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Wake yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that was, that was the vote we voted to concur on 369 instead of the
other bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We voted not to concur in consultation with many members of the minority
who wanted to get some of these other provisions in it. And I agreed
with them, and Representative Davis who was handling a lot of that
matters agreed with that, so that's what we did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry to the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to state his inquiry to the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we sent a bill over there, 560 whatever it was, 594. They took
provisions of 594 and put it into 369, sent that back over here, that
should not have been, in my book, a motion to not concur. It should have
been a motion to pass that particular bill and send it back them for
concurrence. That's.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It, it would. The chair would point out that anytime a, a House bill is
returned from the Senate and the other chamber makes changes to that
bill, the question before the House is whether to concur or not concur
because it was originally a House bill. So the motion to concur or not
concur was properly before the body on July 31st as well as the motion
today to reconsider said motion. Further discussion, further debate. If
not, the question before the House is the motion to reconsider the vote
whereby the bill was not concurred with the Senate committee substitute
for House bill 369. So many favoring the motion will vote aye. Those
opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock
the machine and record the vote. Seventy three having voted in the
affirmative and eighteen in the negative, the motion is adopted. Senate
bill, the Senate committee substitute for House bill 369 is now back
before the body. For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Stam rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To make a motion.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam, is recognized for a motion
pertaining to the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, I move that we adopt the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. For what purpose does the gentleman
from Durham, Representative Luebke rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Wondering how many members are still coming in
before we get started on the debate. Members of the House, if you look
at this bill carefully, it is not regulatory reform. It is regulatory
repeal. In this bill are multiple places where our environment is hurt
by the contents of this bill. Just one, for example, in the bill, is
that the state of North Carolina, this general assembly, may not put
through, may not pass an environmental regulation that is stronger than
the federal regulations. Why, members, would we want to handcuff
ourselves? What if the coal ash regulation is weak from our, by our
standards? What this 734 does is says we may not pass tougher coal ash
regulations because the feds have done one thing. We have shackled
ourselves, handcuffed ourselves, with this part of the bill. And the
rest of the bill is full of features like that. You read it carefully,
and you can see how much the bill damages the environment. And I urge
you to vote against the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? For what purpose does the gentleman
from Caldwell, Representative Starnes rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, and I
apologize for my voice, I have, recovering from a cold, but there are a
lot of good things in this bill but sometimes, you'll find one piece
that you just feel like you just can't overlook. And I would be remiss
if I didn't call your attention to the provisions dealing with alcohol
on our community college campuses. I understand and I know that there is
a growing industry in this state dealing with allowing the brewing of
malt beverages. There are a lot of micro-breweries that are springing up
all across the state, and they have a desire to be able to teach people
this. But this goes far and beyond what we ever envisioned. And these
provisions never went through the ABC committee. They were never
considered on the floor of this House. We never had an opportunity to
pass judgment on this provision. So yes, they're gonna be able to teach
brewing at certain community colleges, but it also allows them not only
to retail their malt beverages, but they can wholesale it. Here goes the
three tiered ABC system that we've had established in this state for
decades beginning to crumble. We've had other brewers in this state who
have begged us to be able to come out from under the limits on their
brewing so that they can be immune or exempt from the three tiered
system and we've said no to the private retailers, or to the private
brewers, but we're telling the community colleges, yes you are exempt.
The Umstead act when it was first passed through this general assembly
many, many years ago said that the state of North Carolina will not be
in business in direct competition with private retailers. Well, there's
another exemption here for our community colleges to be exempt from the
Umstead act. It's not the first time, but it's a continued erosion of
the Umstead act which is a bad idea. But the community colleges are
teaching people to be in the brewing business, but then it gives them
the authority to sell their product at below costs, which no other
brewer is gonna be able to do. You, you can't, no brewery can afford to
sell their</p>

cost or blue cost and yet we're gonna do that here at these community
colleges underage drinking is a serious problem in this state and I know
we like to pretend like it's not a problem but if you've read the news
and observer this week you just read on how the tragic accident where a
teenager was killed because he was served alcohol at a wedding party by
adults underage drinking is a serious problem in this state and we're
putting the sale of alcoholic beverages on the community colleges where
the majority of the people that are at these colleges are not even old
enough to purchase this product and yet we were told earlier today where
they had the [??] culture classes they allowed the underage students to
even sample the products as long as they promise to spit it out the same
thing we'll be doing with the breweries and now we laugh at that but
that's how far we have gone in twisting these rules and these
regulations folks this is not good for the state of North Carolina Jim
Gardner who's the chairman of the ABC commission was in my office
earlier this year on several occasions begging for money to start an
underage drinking [??] in this state and we did not fund it we did not
grant him any of the provisions that he asked for so that he could start
an underage drinking program in this state we're burying our heads in
the sand if we don't believe that this is a problem and yet we are the
guilty of putting this alcohol right here on the campus in front of
these students the other provision in this allows them to sell their
self made beer at special events on the campus so whether I don't know
what the special event is it's limited to November I think it's twelve a
year I don't know if that would [??] a ball game a contest a sporting
event or what the special event would constitute but folks this is a bad
provision I know that there are a lot of good things in this bill but we
can do better for the people of North Carolina when the republicans were
elected to this state the majority in this state this is not what we
promised the people that we would do we can do better as a republican
majority this is not good for the state of North Carolina and on that
provision alone we are to vote no on this bill.
for what purpose does the gentleman from actually the chair will the
gentleman from Wake I believe was gonna explain this bill here and kind
of got caught off guard the gentleman from Wake representative Stam is
recognized to debate the conference report.
thank you Mr chair and may I have assistance of staff on the floor.
yeah the chair has previously granted permission for staff for the
balance of the day.
there're about 58 provisions and I'm certainly not gonna go over 58 but
I think the debate from representative Luebke and representative Starnes
illustrates some of the problems for example the what we call the
Hardison of amendment that representative Luebke is complaining about
that's [??] the wall we passed that a couple of years ago what this bill
does is say that if a state agency adopts uses one of the exceptions to
the Hardison amendment that'll automatically come to the general
assembly in the next session as if ten letters of objection had been
filed with regard to the provision that representative Starnes mentioned
and I sympathize with him but we're already doing this at community
college for of [??] culture and I think representative Stevens can speak
to that because it's [??] community college and I understand that just
recently the president of the community college system Scott Rolce has
assured us that they are not gonna be branding brands to start selling
but overall I'd just like to speak overall about the bill most of the
environmental provisions representative Samuelson is prepared to discuss
representative Millis is prepared to discuss many of those environmental
provisions but overall this bill and along with the other regulatory
form from a couple of years ago I think that's more for the economy than
maybe even tax reform certainly more than [??] with that kind of thing
because this overall not every provision sets people free to do business
in a business like way while protecting the environments so I encourage
to vote for it I encourage you to ask.

<p id="050:00">
Questions. Most of the provisions, I think there are 20 provisions in
here that passed the House but not the Senate. I think there are like 8
provisions that passed the Senate but not the House, and then there are
how many does that leave? 20 or 30 provisions that have passed the House
and the Senate. So we’ve seen most of this previously, on this floor,
and passed it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the lady from Mecklenberg, Representative Samuelson, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the
floor to debate the Conference Report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As
Representative Stam said, there are close to 60 provisions in here. Only
11 of them have not come through this body before. So I’m just going to
go over very quickly those 11, because the rest of them I’ve either
already gone over with you or someone else has already gone over with
you. The first one is number 7 and I may need some help with this one
because this is not as much my expertise. Representative of small
business entities and administrative appeals. This is basically saying
if you are a small business owner, you can represent yourself in court
on these types of appeals. And to my understanding while the Bar
Association doesn’t love it, they don’t object to it. The next one would
be on page number 16, which is Permit Choice. This is a measure that the
Senate had passed and then sent over to us. It basically says if you are
seeking a permit on a local level and you’ve already submitted your
permit request and then that local government changes the rules that
impact your particular request for a permit, this gives you a choice to
decide whether you want the rules as they were when you filed your
permit, or whether you’re okay with the rules by the time they go ahead
and rule on your permit. So it gives you a choice and recognizes that
you filed it under one set of rules and you should be able to operate
under those. They did change it from the way they originally had it and
took out zoning cases because they recognized that zoning cases can
cover a bigger area and shouldn’t be caught up in this. Number 10 you’ve
heard a little bit already, is the Community College Brewing waiver. I
will say that I’ve heard and look in your emails and see if you get an
email on this, that there had been conversations with some of the
opponents to this, with the Community College people on an agreement
that this is not going to be used to have Community Colleges create
their own brewing label. And that they’re going to continue to talk
together to figure out and get a better comfort level and I believe
right now that their objection has been removed. Next one is number 18,
the Good Samaritan Law. We did something with this, I think it was a
year ago, so that medical personnel wouldn’t get caught up in liability
issues. This just clarifies that as long as they’re doing it
voluntarily, without expectation of compensation, they’re covered under
the Good Samaritan law. Let’s see. Number 23. This one’s going to be
controversial to some people, Contested Cases for CAMA Permits. This is
only on the Coastal Area Management Plans. And the idea is here that if
you are for instance the developer and you requested a permit. And that
permit, the ruling on the permit comes out, and a third party does not
like that ruling. The way the law is now, that third party wants to
object. They’re not the people being impacted by the permit directly, as
in the people who are doing the work or the people who are having the
work done. That is a third party objects to it, then unless a judge
rules with that third party and puts a stay in place, the project can
continue. And some other coastal people may want to comment on this. It
only applies in the coastal areas. Number 24 is Open Burning. This is
one that we had passed through here that allowed for open burning of
yard debris under certain circumstances. There was a provision that we
did not add, that the Senate had wanted. And that provision had to do
with if you own a fireplace, and you want to burn in your fireplace
right now, local governments may or may not make rules about that. Well
apparently, and I believe it was in San Francisco, they made a rule that
you had to get an air quality permit if you wanted to burn in your
fireplace. So what the Senate added that was different than our other
one was the clarification that local government cannot say you can’t
burn certain things in your fireplace because of air quality issues. You
don’t have to get an air quality permit to use your fireplace. Staff
says I got that one right. Number 25, Coastal Stormwater Grandfathering.
As you know, over the last few years when the economy kind of tanked,
there were a number of local governments who extended permits to certain
permit holders. Then in the meantime, certain rules would change so that
some of the buffer requirements, some of the storm water requirements
would change.</p>

<p id="055:00">
They grandfathered the properties that were immediately covered by that
buffer area or ruling, but if you are the developer you might have owned
a contiguous piece of property that was part of your whole project and
it was not grandfathered. So what this does is grandfather the
contiguous properties. One of the concerns that I had and some others
was that eventually, just like all of us are eventually related, all of
your properties could eventually be contiguous because you’d grandfather
and grandfather and grandfather. So we got it clarified that they can
only grandfather that one contiguous property.  They can’t expand it out
to all of their properties. So that’s what that one’s on.
Alright, then go all the way to 57,the Hartester amendments.  As
Representative Stam mentioned this is already law. All they have done is
clarify that during the rules review process that we put into place in
’74 last year, that during the rules review process  if one of those . .
. there are three categories . . . when the agencies are reviewing their
rules there are three categories that determine what their next step is
in the process. And one of those categories was only in effect if they
got ten letters of objection. And when it got ten letters of objection
it had to go through the whole process and eventually it comes back
here. So what this says is that if one of those rules would have been
caught by the Hartester amendment that we've already passed, then it’s
going to be viewed as having gotten ten letters of objection and it’ll
have to go through the whole process. The net effect of this is that
there will be more of those rules that will have to go through that full
process and more of them will be coming back to you in future
legislations. But in terms of the impact of the Hartester amendment it’s
the same as what it was before.
Number 58 is really a technical correction . . . forestry fees
correction. This has something to do with the budget and it was strictly
a technical correction that needed to be changed.
Number 59,recourse when agency fails to act, some courts have ruled that
if we put in place a requirement for an agency, but we don’t put a
penalty on that requirement, then we didn’t really expect them to
fulfill it because we didn’t put a penalty. Kind of like if your parent
says,“John, you don’t run out the front door,” but Johnny runs out the
front door and nothing happens, well then did you really want Johnny not
to run out the front door.  So what this says is that we do expect
agencies . . . it just says shall. . . we do expect agencies to do what
we said they were supposed to do even if we didn’t put in a penalty for
not doing it.
And I think that’s the last of the ones that are new.  And like I said
of the almost 60 provisions in here, only these eleven have not already
been through this house and already passed.  So it’s not all new stuff.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES:  For what purpose does the gentleman from Person,
Representative Wilkins, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask if Representative Stam would yield to a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman
from Person?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you Representative
Stam.  It’s my understanding and belief that certain portions of Senate
Bill 38 are now part of this omnibus . . . omnibus, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, that is correct.  And the Carl Lake IBT transfer
provision is section . . . it’s in here if you’ll just give me one
second.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker he’s way ahead of me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to propound an additional
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He’s propounding an answer to the anticipated
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. So the gentleman has yielded.  Please
continue on gentleman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s Section 37 which is on page 31 and hopefully will
make everyone in Person County happy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman have a third question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do and will preface it just a moment.  Actually-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to an addition
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually Representative Stam this has great impact on
Granville, Vance and Franklin. But this as you best know, this Section
37 provision would have the sought after IBT effect for that Carl Lake
water system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is my understanding. And I have a summary here,
which. . . if you would like the one paragraph summary I’ll give it to
you: As a petition for certificate to withdraw or transfer water stored
in any multipurpose reservoir - that’d be Carl Lake – by the Corp of
Engineers and partially located in a state adjacent to North Carolina –
I guess that’s Virginia – provided the Corp of Engineers approve the
withdrawal or transfer on or before July 1</p>

2014, for those that are to be considered and a determination made
according to the procedures. There have been anecdotal evidence from
northern counties from the Lake Gaston region, which would be those ones
you mentioned, that they could lose potential economic development
projects currently be considered without this expedited timeline. So I
think this is just what you, just what the doctor ordered, for you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Would the gentleman yield for a further
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to an
additional question from the gentleman from ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, as
you have gone through this, knowing some provisions that were once part
of SB38, have you seen any mention of declassification of any waters of
the Den River? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. That was in an original Senate Bill
that came over, and that has been deleted. It had to do with Caswell
County and Person, and that is not in this Conference Report. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Representative Stam and Mr. Speaker, may I speak
briefly? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Person has the floor to
debate the Conference Report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes
presented a good point to you about omnibus bills. They’ve always got
some stuff you love and some stuff you hate. The thing I hated is now
out of this bill, and the thing I love is in it. And I’ll be supporting
it. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman
from Rowayan, Representative Ford, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the
Conference Report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to
debate the Conference Report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I like every bit of this bill but I’m voting no. Usually when I like 95%
of a bill I say okay. I’m voting no because of 17. These community
colleges and the breweries. I can’t deal with this. I can’t handle that.
At RCCC, we have early college, 15 year olds going into the RCCC. So
we’re going to drop off the kids at the brewery today? Now I understand
some community colleges are already doing this. But this is absolutely
ridiculous and I agree with Representative Starnes. This, we’ve got to
stop this and stop this now. I don’t understand it at all. I cannot
support it and I will not support this bill because of this one
provision. We just can’t do it. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the lady from Surrey, Representative Stevens, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the Conference Report. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the Conference Report. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And I did not intend to speak but I wanted to speak I guess
directly to Representative Ford. Surrey Community College has a
horticulture center. They’re teaching people to grow vineyards, they’re
teaching people to make wine, they’re teaching them to market. And if
you ever though that alcohol needs to be tightly controlled, you should
see how they do it on this campus. It’s not going to be an issue of any
of these kids being able to get any alcohol without showing some kind of
ID. It’s one of the more protected ways of distributing that alcohol.
Second thing is, it has been great for the economy and for the growth.
The students are taught responsibility along with the wine consumption.
So I don’t know that it’s going to be as big an issue by putting it on
colleges or elsewhere. Yes, they spit. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the lady from Orange, Representative Insko, rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor
to debate the Conference Report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, there are several provisions
in this. I agree with other speakers that there are on these omnibus
bills always some provisions you like and some you hate. I think you
have to pick out what’s really important and whether or not the
provisions that are, that weaken the bill are so bad that you need to
vote against it. For me, there are several issues in here that deal with
public health. Specifically there are several issues that deal with
on-site waste water, septic upgrades, number 40 has to do with the
owners upgrading obsolete septic systems. Theses are public health
issues. I think you can’t compromise. You can’t compromise when it comes
to public health. We have a very strong public health tradition in this
state. And as our state grows, those are going to be more and more
important. The other one that bothers me is the isolated wetlands. And
that deals with water too, with public health. We’ve always been a
water-wealthy state, but not anymore. As we’ve grown and as we’ve had
more water pollution</p>

<p id="065:00">
We are no longer the water wealthy state we once were, and we're seeing
more, more droughts come through. So we, we have to be careful about
doing anything that, that increases potential for pollution, and for
those reasons I'll be voting against the bill, and I would urge others
to vote no on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the motion to adopt the conference report to Senate bill 734.
So many favoring the motion will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no.
The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record
the vote. Sixty four having voted in the affirmative and twenty seven in
the negative, the conference report is adopted. The Senate will be
notified by special messenger. And enrolled and sent to the Governor by
special messenger. House will be at ease. House bill 1086, the clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Luebke
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask about 1086. Is this the one that we previously agreed would come
on, without objection would come on? Having to do with the railroad
tracks?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is. That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate committee substitute for House bill 1086, a bill to be entitled
an act to establish North Carolina and South Carolina rail compact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Brunswick, Representative Iler
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. I agree with my colleague, Representative
Waddell, who was scheduled months ago to be out of town to run this bill
for Columbus county. This is a regional, economic development effort to
start talking to South Carolina about an abandoned rail line that
they’re trying to bring back up to class one status and connect with CSX
for freight purposes. It's mostly a study and a five member commission
that will fall under commerce. And there's no additional appropriations
of state money and it'd be mostly private money to build this, and
mostly in South Carolina. There's about twenty miles that come over into
North Carolina around Whitevillle and Chadbourn and will connect to CSX
down near Mullins, South Carolina. So it's economic development for our
area. There's a little concern about the Representatives from Columbus
County, but the Senator from Columbus county, my senator, also support
this. It passed forty five to nothing in the Senate and all we need to
do is pass it in the House and let them start talking to South Carolina
about this rail line. Thank you mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from, is the gentleman from Brunswick making a motion that
the House do concur with the Senate committee substitute for House bill
1086?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, the chair accepts that motion. That's the motion before the body.
For what purpose does the gentleman from Ashe, Representative Jordan
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry of the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Brunswick yield to the gentleman from Ashe?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative for yielding to this question. Here we are on
the last day, presumably, of a long short session, and this is the first
I've heard of this compact that we want to create. Can you explain a
little bit about why this has come up now? If we had not happened to
meet today, it would have just sat in committee? What is the timeliness?
Why do we need to deal with this right now when we're dealing with some
other important things?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, it's economic development, but the timing on it, it left here as
a different bill, and this was PCSed in the House, the Senate
transportation committee and sent back over and came over on July 31st.
And I didn't know much about it, and so it was sidetracked at that time
in the rules committee until we learned more about it. I was contacted
by NC railroad and other stakeholders that they wanted to go ahead with
this and be able to start talking about it with South Carolina. It could
wait until next session, but I think</p>

It’s our job, economic development, I think timeliness is important. The
next session will be at least six months away, before we can take any
action. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
gentleman from Brunswick yield to an additional question from the
gentleman from Ashe? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry. Could you tell me which House
Committee it was looked at in? Did you say Rules? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right. We left here and came out of House Transportation but it was not
the same bill, obviously. It was PCSd in the Senate Transportation, came
back and it’s been to Rules in the House. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to a third question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This issue
has not been dealt with in a House Transportation Committee of any sort?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It has not. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenberg,
Representative Jeter, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is great. This bill deals with my two favorite
things. South Carolina and freight. I’ve been waiting a year for this
bill. Please push green. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Bladen Representative Brisson rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to
debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen, Representative Iler’s absolutely right. This doesn’t pertain
to my district but it deals with my neighboring counties. It’s very
important to small towns. ?? is one of them. The bill has, it’s changed
a lot just like a lot of other things from the Senate. ?? Senate held
onto it. They held onto it for, since it was started. But it finally got
it released and back over here because it’s not something brand new
coming up at the last minute. But it is about a small railroad that
they’re trying to keep existing. It runs from South Carolina, a couple
small towns, over into Columbus County and ?? County. They’re just
trying to hang onto their transportation so they can have a little rail
service to these small towns. Not big business but it’s very important
to the small rural areas in Columbus and Roberson County so I’m just
asking you to support this bill and it’s not going to cost a lot of
money but it would cause the same thing that we’re doing ?? County when
they move that little section out and affected their economy the way it
has and it would have a lot of problems trying to get that little
section put back in. So when you take out the rail section, it’s hard to
ever get it back, so these folks are just trying to hang onto what
they’ve got. So anything we can do to help them, I know that they
appreciate it and thank you for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenberg, Representative Brawley,
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. Having some involvement in
rails through the Virginia-North Carolina high speed rail compact, I did
refer this bill to Department of Transportation and Nick Tennyson and
said tell me what’s going on, make your recommendations. They kept
thoroughly vetted the bill and expressed to me yesterday they were fine
with it the way it is, and were comfortable with the bill going forward.
And at that point, I informed Representative Iler I would support what
he wanted to do on the bill. He is closest to Transportation Chair to
that specific location and I recommend your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston, Representative Torbitt,
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] See if the Representative from Bladen would
yield to a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Bladen
yield to the gentleman from Gaston? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative. You
mention in your comments that it wasn’t going to cost a whole lot of
money. And my question is, do you have any idea where the funding is
coming from? Because I can’t seem to make that determination. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That’s a good question. And I’ve been looking through the
budget and I can’t find a lot of things where the funding’s coming from
so I can’t deal with that one for you either. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Bladen yield
for an additional question from the gentleman from Gaston? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I would. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now
that we’ve determined that we don’t know where it’s coming from, can you
tell me how much might be required? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, not to, I
think it’s kind of a bit more of a study bill. You can ask Mr. Iler ??
but I don’t think it’s going to cost a lot to study it. It’s too small
to be a lot of cost. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you</p>

Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose, does the gentleman wish to debate
or.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He reference, if I might ask Representative Iler a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Brunswick yield to the
gentleman for Gaston?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gladly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you representative. He asked me to ask you this
question. I think in your comments you said mostly private funds and if
you know how much is on the other side of the mostly like is I'm just
trying to get my handle on what's it gonna cost the people in North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually I asked this question to our staff and it
does say in the bill this is for the purpose of the compact and the
commission to come up with the plan. And it says in the bill they can
except funding from South Carolina, from North Carolina and Federal
funding, donations or any kind of contributions from South and/or North
Carolina, local or regional economic development organizations. So that
five different possible sources, but this bill doesn't include any kind
of appropriation to develop a plan as to how to bring up to class 1 and
start the freight moving.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I speak on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Brunswick wishes to debate the
motion a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The subject of timing has come up and one of the last
minute reasons for the last minute bill coming over was that some of the
stakeholders or owners in South Carolina thinking the Myrtle Beach area
that own some of this property and own some of the rail lines just last
two weeks decided that they would cooperate and so. Also I've been told
by a member of the NC Railroad by text a few minutes ago that we could
put this off but that if we pass it before South Carolina passes it we
can control the language. So a little bit of let's go ahead and get
ahead of the curve idea. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For what purpose does the gentleman from Ash
Representative Jordan rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry of Representative Presnell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady from Yancey yield to the gentleman from
Ash?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative it looks like your name was
a primary sponsor, the primary sponsor, on the previous House Bill 1086.
Can you discuss what that was and how it turned into this last minute
North Carolina, South Carolina compact because of some landowners in
South Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This was a bill for signage on the main roads for our
state parks so the people would know how to get to them. And that was
all that was in the bill. Representative McNeill and I were on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Followup.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield to a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did that issue get dealt with elsewhere in legislation
or is it being completed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No not that I'm aware of. It was just a hijacked.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to debate the motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Ash has the floor to debate the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This may be something really good to study and look
into. I just think it's been done here at the last minute. It's gutted a
previous bill from one of our members about something an issue that's
not been dealt with.  And I just question the timing and I question some
of the issues surrounding it and just something probably can wait until
next long session. So I'll be voting red. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion for the debate. If not, the
question before the House is the motion to concur with the city
committees substitute for House Bill 1086. So many favoring the motion
will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 77 having voted in
the affirmative and 13 in the negative, the motion passes. The bill is
ordered and rolled and sent to the Governor by special messenger.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ray please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquire to the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can the speaker give the members any vision of what's
going on for the rest of the day possibly into tomorrow or Monday. We're
hearing different things but could you give us a little input on that
please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Representative Ray that's actually why I've taken
the chair so that I could do that that very thing because the two bills
that we intend to add to the calendar are interrelated. The conference
report for House Bill 1224 and the Senate Bill 718. There's also another
matter that will, a lot of this happens for those of you who are fairly
new to the process when we're this far into</p>

<p id="080:00">
This session] you have to use whatever vehicles are available to move
measures and all 3 of these Bills relate to one another. The House Bill
1224 it’s the Bill that had catalyst funds I think, the project for
JMAC, the fix for UI (unemployment insurance) that bill, it’s the intent
of the Chair to take a vote on that Bill. Senate Bill 718, depending
upon the deposition of House Bill 1224, is a proposal from the Senate
that actually does a couple of things.  One, it fixes the technical
language that was in my opinion an error in the budget that has some of
the TA allocations in limbo. If we do not pass that, then it will be a
problem, particularly for the smaller districts and it’s the intent of
the Chair to try and fix that, to make sure the smaller districts are
able to use the funding and have the flexibility to fund the TA
positions. It also addresses the problem that existed with how funds
could be used and County Commission and the School Boards per view.
We’ll talk about this, I’m not going to go through a debate right now,
I’m trying to give you a general sense. What that effectively does is
correct some language and some of the concerns that we had in 1224.
We’re going to use House Bill 189, which is in conference, I will be
discharging the current conferees momentarily and appointing new ones
and that Bill will have a correction that extends the Wake County
Referendum for the tax referendum to November of 2016. They’re concerns
expressed about the measure in 1214, which provide 94 counties the same
local tax option that only 6 counties have today. This will allow them
to have that, the problem was that there a measure in there that was
effectively going to eliminate Wake County’s ability to do that tax
referendum. This will give Wake County the option to do that tax
referendum and grant the additional ¼ cent up until 2016. That language
will be in the Conference Report 189, which will be read in today and I
have a formal agreement by the Senate that they will pass that measure.
So, were taking those 3 Bills in succession. It could be [moved] because
frankly if Bill 1224 were to fail, then the TA correction will not
happen, nor the local option tax for the 94 counties that currently do
not have it. Having said that, do you have any questions related to
that? So, it would effectively today, depending upon the outcome of
House Bill 1224, we may take the additional vote on 718, which corrects
1224 in a way that I believe is more towards the position of the House
and then House Bill 189 takes it even further with respect to the Wake
County referendum. Representative Wray please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I’m not mistaken, you have rules committtee Senate
Bill 364 for teachers assistance. Is that going to be taken up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That Bill may or may not be taken up today. It
certainly will not be taken up before these other measures. The House
Conference Committee for House Bill 189 current conferees Stevens,
Glacier, Hall, Moore are hereby discharged. New conferees are Lewis
Chair, Stevens, Moore and Tine. The Senate will be so notified.
Representative Moore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I move that House Bill 1224 be removed
from the Committee on rules and added to today’s calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection [haven’t] raised. Representative Moore is
recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank Mr. Speaker, members. House Bill 1224 is the
Bill the Speaker was just explaining, this is the local sales tax option
and economic development changes legislation that we sent to the Rules
Committee a week or two ago. This Bill had been worked on in the
[interim], there’s a Conference Report of course that is set to be dealt
with</p>

And as the chair explained, that conference report is being modified,
assuming it is being adopted, by Senate bill 718 and by, I believe, 198
or 189, whatever the other bill was, to bring it closer to the House's
position. The, and I'm sure folks will want to have a spirited debate on
the actual, on the actual bill, but, and so I won't get into the merits
of the bill right now myself. Although I could, but I don't think it's
proper. The only question right now is to have the bill removed from the
committee. Now as to the procedural posture, it is completely
appropriate to do it. This is a conference report. Traditionally
conference reports are not referred to committee. It's, it does not
require a dip in committee, but we sent it to committee. Wanted to let
the Senate know at the time that we were not agreeable to the language
as it was. I believe that has served its purpose. The Senate's position
has softened. The Senate has, has worked with us and negotiated, I would
say, in good faith to make some other changes to the other legislation
the Speaker has laid out. So regardless of your position on the bill, I
would certainly ask for your vote on this procedural motion that the
bill be brought before us and so that we can tend to the peoples'
business. And I would urge the body's yes vote to at least bring the
bill out of committee and to the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak against the adoption of the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman  is actually debating the motion to add to the calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To the motion, mister speaker, I apologize, to the motion. Members of
the House, this is a bad step that we would be taking right now to even
put this bill on the floor. It was in the rules committee, comes out of
the rules committee, but as members of the finance committee will
remember, there were a huge number of questions that were raised about
this bill when it was heard in the finance committee, the substance of
this bill. Those questions have not been answered. This bill has not
gone back to the finance committee for it to be considered, and really,
it really needs to be. This is a major, major bill, as people remember.
First of all, it was not referenced earlier, but this is a bill that
could raise the sales tax in our counties. And it's important to
recognize that, that as a consequence of this bill, you are allowing
referenda to take place without really firm discussion on the floor or
in the committee about the implications of this sales tax for our
counties. And we just are not having that discussion. The impact on the
rural counties, the poor rural counties and what would be meant if this
sales tax were on, were on the agenda. For these reasons I think the
conference report really ought to be referred to finance. Representative
Moore has said this doesn't happen, or doesn't need to happen. It really
happens whenever many, many members object to the bill going, coming
directly to the floor. In this case I would say, members, we should have
this bill back in finance. It has many pieces in it. It came over
suddenly, the conference report. We did not really know what was in it
when it came over suddenly, and members I would urge you, just on
motion, not to get to the substance of the bill, on the motion, to vote
no because it has not been properly heard in committee. Thank you
members. Vote no.

Representative Wilkins, please state your purpose.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Going back to House bill 1086, something that
we worked on just a few moments ago and Representative Jordan made quite
a point about, what's the sudden rush? Well it seems that we could say
the very same thing about 1224. It's been languishing in the Senate for
about a month, and now Representative Moore tells us that there's really
been some behind the scenes work going on with the Senate and the
Senate's been amenable in them. I tell you folks, if the Senate's been
amenable to anything you've got a news flash. But now we're asked to, as
a House</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker not a long speech, the various ingredients
of 1224, I’ve made long speeches before. Two weeks ago this house would
have defeated that bill 80 to 30, it’s still the same turkey it was
then. I hope you’ll vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the gentleman maybe debating the bill versus
the motion. I think the gentlemen wants him to vote yes on this. Do you
want to add to the calendar today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, then you want to vote no then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeeter please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It seems to me that there is a procedural effort here
so we don’t add this to the calendar. That’s all well and good because
typically we don’t like to add things to the calendar because we think
the outcome of the Bill will be against our wishes. My concern is, as
Representative Stam said, the overwhelming majority of us would have
voted no, adding to the calendar to the calendar, having it fail may
suit your purposes. My guess is, if we vote no and don’t add it to the
calendar, you may win for one day. You may see me tomorrow morning, in
this same suit, voting on this same bill and then procedurally you’ve
accomplished nothing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from [Mclanberg] is correct, if this
motion fails, we will be taking a vote on this tomorrow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar please state purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It may not be a common thing, but there is a reason
why there’s a motion and reason why there is a opportunity to object and
to have a vote. The purpose of that is to determine if it is truly the
will of this body to bring this matter before us here, on what may not
be the last day but close to the last day. I think it is perfectly
appropriate in order to not have to take up 1224, to vote no on this
motion. So, you can vote on this motion and it takes care of al lot of
matters on the calendar and if it comes again tomorrow then a vote can
be taken as well or any subsequent day. So I would encourage you to vote
no on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Millis please state you purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry for the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is my understanding in the response to Mr. Jeeter,
that if this Bill is not added to the calendar, we will be taking a vote
tomorrow. If this bill is actually added to the calendar, and the Bill
is voted upon, and it passes, would we or would we not already have to
be here to vote on it again to anyways?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That is correct, it is a 2 day bill, it simply means
it will come back on Monday as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentlemen may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a clarification for the body, while I think of
Representative Floyd here, no matter what happens here there is a high
potential that we’re going to be here tomorrow, regardless. Correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just make sure I understand, if we vote not to put
this thing out on the floor today, that we’re going to be here tomorrow
to put it on the floor again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, tomorrow it will have been read today and will be
on the on calendar tomorrow by rule without a motion, it will be on the
calendar tomorrow by default. This is simply a matter of whether or not
use today as a productive time versus just coming back and starting the
second reading tomorrow. To the point of the Representative Millis,
should the Bill pass today, we would take second reading tomorrow, it
would be the only matter on the calendar and then we would dispose of it
and sent it to the Senate. Then, there would be no need for a Monday
session. Representative Collins please state you purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Folks, I don’t like this Bill, I didn’t like it when
it left, didn’t like it when it came back, but all we’re doing if we
vote no on this motion, is extending our stay here in Raleigh another
day. So, lets go ahead, if you don’t like, let’s vote on it today and
vote no. So, I would ask you to vote yes on this motion, even if like
me, you’re going to vote no on the Bill</p>

Representative Bob Gardner, please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I agree with Representative Collins that we should have, let's debate
the bill. I'm going to vote yes on the motion to bring the bill forward
today and let's have  a debate and vote on this bill today. Delaying a
vote on the bill, or delaying discussion on the bill is
not the thing to do in my opinion. i think we should go on right now,
let's handle this thing right now that we're here and dispose of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question before the house is the motion by Representative Moore to add
House Bill 1224 to today's calendar. All in favor
vote aye, all opposed vote no. Pro Tempore will open the vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The machine has recorded the vote. 44 have voted in the affirmative, 46
in the negative. The motion fails. The house is
being recessed until 4:30.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Democrats or caucass, right now, regular meeting room.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the house are going to stay in recess until 5:15.
The house have come to order. Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the
delay. I wanted the confer with the senate.
I've decided that, rather than having a session tomorrow, we are going
to ajourn shortly subject to introduction of
bills and resolutions and other provisions. There will be no other
votes. We are going to ajourn with the intent to come
back on Monday at 5. There is a possibility that it would be 2 days.
That the matters that are on the floor will require
2 days of votes. We are sorting out now whether or not those two days
would be Monday and Tuesday, or Wednesday and Thursday.
The chair assumes, that after the matters have been disposed of, one way
or the other, we will then ajourn sign and dive without any provisions
for November session. We've consulted with the senate and we've made it
clear it's the intent of the house to ajourn
and ajourn the session for the remainder of the year. So, for your
purposes now, you need to plan on being here at 5 pm
on Monday. At the moment that we that determine that it may be on
Wednesday, we will let you know. We will give you as much
notice as possible, certainly before Monday morning. It may be as late
as Sunday before we know. Notices and annoucements.
Representative Stars, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The Republicans will caucass at 3:00 pm on Monday

Representative Pipman, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A point personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a point of personal privelege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it's a pretty sad point of personal priveledge. We had a member of
my church named Larry Smith,
an army veteran from Vietnam, who was a victim of Agent Orange. The Vers
administration never acknowledged
his lungs problems as being from Agent Orange. They did acknowledge his
bladder cancer as being from Agent Orange
and then, not too long ago, he also became a victim of Parkinsons. After
a long, courageous battle, they thought he'd been
dead 2, 3 years ago, but because of his loving wife Brenda taking such
good care of him and being so devoted to him,
he lasted a lot longer than they thought he would. Larry was an
excellent Christian, a man who just loved people and went out of
his way to do good for others. He died this morning. I need to get home
to his family as soon as I can. I would appreciate
if you all would be praying for the family of Larry Smith. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, the chair would also remind the members that our
friend and colleague, Langdon's wife,</p>
