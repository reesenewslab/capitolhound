[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 328, solid waste management reform act of
2013. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I’d like to send forth an
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, you can send forward your
amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade moves to
amend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade is recognized to explain
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is actually just a clarifying and
technical change that was put forth by DENR. The department asked us to
make a few clarifying changes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion
or debate? Hearing none, the question before the, Senator Cooke, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m just curious, this,
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you want to ask Senator Wade a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may, sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, do
you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Cooke, you can ask your question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator,
this set of technical changes includes a effective date that is next
year for part of this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, July 1 2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any
further discussion or debate? Hearing none, [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clark, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I ask the bill sponsor to yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, do you yield for a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] During the discussion last week I
was left with the impression it would be about a decade before we really
face any significant problems in terms of landfill capacity. Is my
understanding in that regard correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s what I’m
looking at now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, we’re discussing the
amendment right now, so [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator is your question about
the bill or the amendment? The amendment is before us right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay if you can hold your
question till we get back to the bill before us. Senator McKissick for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you explain with a
little bit more specificity exactly what this amendment would
accomplish? I see there’s language here dealing with a five year type of
limited permit that would deal with closure plans, things of that sort,
financial assurance cost estimates, environmental monitoring plans, and
other applicable plans for facilities. So if you could, since you’re
most familiar with the amendment and how it relates to the overall bill,
provide us with a little more specificity, if you could? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes sir. Senator McKissick, what this does is since it’s a 30
year permit now, depending on when your permit becomes due again, like
right now there’s some with 5 years and there’s some that have had 10
years, if you’ve had 10 years, you’d be granted 20 years. But every 5
year period, you would be subject to a review. And that’s what you see’s
pertaining to. That they will come out and do a limited review every 5
years even though you have a 30 year permit. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, do you yield for a follow up
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In the event
they came out for one of these 5 year review intervals and determined
that things were not compliant or there were things that needed to be
done, how would they be addressed at that time? Would there be
possibility of replication or sanctions or penalties or what in fact
would occur when a review occurred if an operator was found to be in
some respect non-compliant? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, I think
all of the above could be possible and DENR would be able to close the
landfill if they felt necessary. If they’re not in compliance or
anything like that, DENR would still be able to enforce whatever
sanctions they need to enforce. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, one
additional follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, do you yield for a
follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] How do those
provisions and conditions for closure or for sanctions differ from what
may exist under law today? [SPEAKER CHANGES] There’s, Senator McKissick,
there aren’t any differences. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.</p>

For those of you who have asked questions, please turn your microphones
off. I have multiple microphones on right now. Thank you. Is there any
further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question for the Senate
is the passage of Amendment One, all in favor vote aye, opposing vote
no. Five seconds will be allowed for the vote, the clerk will record the
vote. Rabon, Brunswick. Rabon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabon. Senator Rabon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, sorry Senator – wrong Rabon. I'm looking in the
wrong place. Sorry, Senator. Rabon, aye. 36 having voted in the
affirmative and nine in the negative, Amendment One is adopted, the bill
as amended is back before the body. Senator Brown, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To set forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you can send forth your amendment. The clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr President. What the amendment does is
pretty much what we did with the bill previously on windmills, is to
make sure that the landfills wouldn't have a significant adverse impact
on the mission, training or operations of any military installation or
branch of the military. And it also specifies the time period in which
they would have to come up with a reason to argue against the permit. Be
glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade has the floor to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senators, this is a very good amendment, and I hope we
would support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Pate, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Brown would yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Brown. Would this restriction also
apply to birds that flock around landfills and that sort of thing that
might endanger aircraft flying overhead?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Pate, this amendment would not, this pretty
much deals with just the training of the military.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Brock – Senator Pate, did you have another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a follow-up, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you yield for a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you clarify that? You say it just has to do with
military training – I should think that jets flying overhead might be
training.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess you could argue that if the landfill created a
situation where birds would show up and make it an issue for training, I
guess it could be. But you know that's – again, I guess you'd have to
prove that that would be a fact, I would have to think.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator [Brock? Not on list], for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Brown would yield for a quick
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Looking through the amendment, is it referring when it
says “the Department,” the Department of Defense, or of DENR?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock, which section are you looking at? On
the bottom section it talks about DENR, but on the first part it talks
about the military and then it talks about who from the military would
be the point of contact to object to the permit or talk about concerns
of the permit. Then it deals with how many days they have as well. I'm
not sure. Just a quick follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you yield for follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So would DENR speak on behalf of the military?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, there's a designated individual from the military
that would speak on behalf of the military.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the sponsor of the amendment a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, could you tell me how this particular
revision, if it became operational, would differ from our standard
operating procedures, practices and regulations today? I mean it looks
like a good amendment, but how would it differ from what we are required
to do today, either in terms of rules and regulations, or other
provisions that might be applicable to either? It looks like it's
applying to both existing landfills as well as applications for new
landfills.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is not a requirement today. This is a new
requirement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none, the question before the Senate is the passage of Amendment Two,
all in favor vote aye, opposed will vote no, five seconds will be
allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote. [RECORDING ENDS]</p>

44 Having voted in the affirmative and one in the negative. Amendment
two has adopted the bill as amended as back before the body. Is there
any further discussion or debate? Senator Clark, what bugs your eyes?
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Ask the bill of sponsor to yield to a question.
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Senator Wade
, do you?
(SPEAKER CHANGES)I do
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Now, as i stated earlier i was under the impression
from last weeks debate that there was really no sense of urgency in
terms of lack of landfill capactiy in that it would be atleast a decade,
more than a decade for that matter before we would basically have a lack
of landfill capacity in the state, is that correct?
(SPEAKER CHANGES)No Senator that is not correct, if you landfills
closing in the next 5 years, wouyld be bourke county, cleveland county,
davison county, gaston county, halifax, robertson, haywood, orange, i
think there is a long list and there is also another list that is
closing in 10 years. and as you know senator it takes 5-10 years to get
a landfill permited and built in north carolina, so i think we are
somewhat in a rush if we are going to be prepared.
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Follow up
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Senator wade do you yield for follow up?
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Yes I do
(SPEAKER CHANGES) So by reducing the exclusionary zones would that solve
the problem for robertson county
(SPEAKER CHANGES)There may not need to be one in robertson county if
ofcourse there is a landfill nmearby as we found out on the last debate
last week, there are some counties and cities now shipping it to other
areas
(SPEAKER CHANGES)follow up
(SPEAKER CHANGES)senator yields
(SPEAKER CHANGES)So for the counties you have listed it seems to me that
they could take their past other landfills within the state. Is that
correct
(SPEAKER CHANGES) No senator they may can or may not can and it depends
on the franchise agreement with the local government. And that could
stop you from bringing trash in from another municipality or another
county depending on the agreement they reached, if you reach an
agreement with one county or one municipality that you would take in
trash for the next 40 years, then you lim it the amount of trash to
240,000 tons a year now you couldnt take it from somewhere else if you
already worked out that transfer agreement
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Thank you
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Ok well for those counties that are running out of
capacity
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Senator do you have a question?
(SPEAKER CHANGES)I would like to speak
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Senator you have the floor to speak
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Well for those counties that are running out of
capacity hopefully they will be able to come to an agreement with
someone, but i believe we have a sufficient capacity within the state in
order to resolve the problem for now. That being said i would like to
send forth an amendment.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Senator you can send forth your amendment.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Clerk will read
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Senator Clark moves to amend the bill
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Senator Clark is recognized to explain the amendment
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Is it on the dashboard
(SPEAKER CHANGES) It is on the dashboard, senator
(SPEAKER CHANGES) OK, Essentially what this amendment does is 2 things,
it restores iunitial boundries that were in the initial bills for the
exclkusionary zones for their original state, and secondly it provides a
littlwe bit more restrictive prohibition against installing landfills
near military bases. In essence you cant install, put a landfill in
within 5 miles of a military instalation, instalations are defined in
the amendment.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)I support the amendment
(SPEAKER CHANGES)IS there any discussion or debate
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Mr president
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Senator wade, what verbs do you arise.
(SPEAKER CHANGES) to speak on the amendment
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Senator wasde has the floor to speak on the amendment
(SPEAKER CHANGES)I think we have adressed in the original bill, all
these particular issues and we have a good bill and i would urge you to
vote against this amendment
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Senator brown what verbs do you arise.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Speak on the amendment
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Senator brown has the floor to speak on the amendment
(SPEAKER CHANGES)I appreciate the amendment but again i think i hope i
have addressed the issue for the military base, and at the end of the
amendment it alsop puts in the mileage restrictions as far as being
close to the national wildlife refuge, gameland, wildlife resources,
lets see what else, state parks, those are the same restrictions that
have pretty much limited any landfills from being contructed, so if you
put those back in the bill you pretty much kill the bill, so i cant
support the amendment
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Is there any further discussion or debate? hearing
none, question for the senate is the passage of amendment three, all in
favor vote AYE, opposed vote no, 5 seconds will be allowed for the vote</p>

Clerk will record the vote. Bryant, aye. Rabin, no. 13 having voted in
the affirmative and 32 in the negative, amendment three fails. The bill
as amended is back before the body. Is there any further discussion or
debate? Senator Robinson for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, you’re aware of the landfill issue recently in East
Greensboro. How does this bill affect, how does the change in
regulations affect that landfill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, it shouldn’t affect White Street Landfill whatsoever
unless it does somewhere down the line have some other landfills come
into play and then of course, it might lower the cost for Greensboro to
have to ship it out.
It would be more competition, hopefully, if we do get another landfill
sited and they may be able to lower their prices. Instead of paying $8
to $10 million a year in Greensboro, they might be able to get it a
little lower to ship it out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, do you yield for a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does changing the regulations and the rules give the opportunity,
however, for the City Council to determine that that landfill might be
opened and expanded? Is there leeway in this language?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, the City of Greensboro controls the White Street
Landfill. So I guess at any time the City Council could vote to open it.
But there’s nothing in this bill that will open the White Street
Landfill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senate Bill 328 is an attack on the environment in which our
children and citizens must live. You’ve heard about the White Street
Landfill in East Greensboro. That landfill was built in a community that
is almost 100 percent African Americans.
Traditionally landfills have been built in low income and minority
communities. That particular landfill had to garner support from all
across the entire county to get the City Council to decide not to
reopen. Persons in that area have bought houses yet have been diagnosed
with cancers and brown-lung disease, et cetera.
Senate Bill 328 raises the ugly concept of landfills that
disproportionately affect minority, rural and poor people. NIMBY is a
concept of build them but not in my backyard. While Senator Wade has
said that the intent is not to reopen the landfill, rewriting the rules
gives way to multiple probabilities that this could happen.
Amending the transport rules for vehicles to be leak-resistant rather
than leak-proof means that debris and garbage would be leaked onto
streets where children play. It won’t matter that it does not adhere to
the tires of vehicles because it will adhere to the hands and mouths of
children.
You might see it as an opportunity to bring business into North
Carolina, especially for some whose families operate trucking companies.
We in Guilford County and other counties see it as an assault on the
health and well-being of communities that are rural and low-income, that
are mostly minority.
We as a Senate have no right to assign additional disparities to
communities in our state. We should be for the rights to health and
housing for all people. If you’re concerned about this you’ll vote
against the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?  Hearing none, the question
for the Senate is the passage of the Committee substitute number two to
Senate Bill 328 as amended on its third reading. All in favor will vote,
“Aye.” Opposed will vote, “No.” Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting. The Clerk will record the vote. Apodaca, aye.
29 having voted in the affirmative and 16 in the negative, the Committee
substitute number two to Senate Bill 328 as amended passes its third
reading, the amendments will be engrossed and it will be sent to the
House. We have four bills on the calendar for concurrence. Starting with
Senate Bill 231. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 231, “Modify the Duties of the Advisory Council on Indian
Education.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis is recognized.

[Speaker changes.] Moment of personal privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Tillman has the floor for a point of personal
privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Tarte, you don't know a whole lot about
Nascar and you're willin' to share it with all of us and I thank you for
that. (Laughter.) AJ did drive for a brief time for the Pettys
until...well, I won't...well, I'll talk privately about what
happened...but AJ, he is back in good graces on the nationwide circuit
and he did win a race and I pray that he will not have any more problems
with his life and he's certainly a credit to racing; however, the number
9 car...the Petty team owns two cars...43, which is their ??????? for
those that don't know...and the number 9 car is a Marcus Ambrose...the
number 9 car set on the outside pole on Sunday's race and was up at the
top two or three most of the day...had a little problem in the pits and
still finished a very good seventh. That's a little update on the
Pettys. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] You'll think twice about that next time, Senator
Tarte, won't ya?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] And Senator Tarte, maybe one day you'll get old and
know everything like Senator Tillman. Senate Bill 485, UNC Duplicate

removed from Rules and referred to Committee on Finance.
