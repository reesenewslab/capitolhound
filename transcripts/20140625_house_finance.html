Our members will please take their seats. We need to get moving this

you are recognized for the purpose of approval of the minutes, sir. All
in favor will say aye. All opposed, no. Thank you very much, that stands
approved. A little housekeeping: We have a number of pages with us this
morning, and gentlemen and ladies, if you would please stand as we call
your name. Lucy Russell, from Wake County; Lucy, we're glad to have you.
Martina Savage, from Wake County; Lauren Skeins, from Guilford; Elena
Sweat, from Washington; Madison Taylor, from Wake; and Jonathan
Thornburg, from Mecklenburg. Welcome to House Finance, and we hope that
you will learn something today. Sergeant Barnes, our normal staff,
Reggie Sales, Marvin Lee, John Brandon, and Charles Clampett, thank you
very much for always being here and doing good work. First bill up this
morning is going to be House Bill 1033, Representative Goodman.
Representative Holly is recognized to have the PCS before us for the
purposes of discussion. All in favor will say aye. All opposed, no.
Okay. Representative Goodman, welcome back to Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chairman, committee members. I know
you all have heard enough about this dam bill, and it's been here
before, but...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's a dam bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ...I was in favor of...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Pages, it's really a DAM bill. Water's involved.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But I was informed by the Senate on Monday afternoon
that this had to be a statewide bill instead of a local bill, and it
just changes the word “Richmond County” to “a county.” The people of
Richmond County and I would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair, if it's a good dam bill for Richmond
County, it's probably a good dam bill for the whole state. And I'd like
to be recognized for a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis, I believe it's the appropriate
time for the dam bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. I would move that the proposed
committee substitute to House Bill 1033 be given a favorable report
unfavorable to the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Members of the committee, you've heard the
motion. Any further discussion? All in favor will say aye. All opposed,
no. I believe that's unanimous. Take your bill and good luck.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair and committee members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Looking to see who's here.... Our next bill will be
House Bill 1245, Pleasant Garden – Voluntary Annexation. Representative
Harlan, sir, you are welcomed to the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. Good morning—
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan, sir, you are recognized for a
motion on PCS before us for the purposes of the discussion. Thank you.
All in favor will say aye. All opposed, no. You have the floor, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. Good morning, members of the
committee. This bill, it's a local bill, and what it does is, it
authorizes a voluntary annexation for the--
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hardister, if you'll hold just a
minute. Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. I would like to be recognized
for a motion at the proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe it's the appropriate time, if there's no
further discussion. This is a local bill, so. Representative...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke. I'm sorry. I'm trying to see if
I'm going to say Doctor, Mister, or Representative! You are recognized,
sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] “Doctor” is fine, thank you. I wanted to ask...maybe
staff: did we not already deal with the town of Watha? Did we not have a
separate bill on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh. I'll try to answer that if staff.... We did. And
it needs a double ride back and forth to the Senate, because it's had a
couple of issues over at the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. We have a motion before us to give the House
Bill...</p>

eleven fifty one Fayetteville red light changes. Representative Forward

to have a PCS before us for the purpose of discussion. All in favor will

SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you miss. Thank you madame chairmen. (laughter) This is a bill
that comes to the common calen allocation from the city of Fayetteville
county board of commission and the board of education. All three are in
total agreement with this bill and without...when the council was ran in
November they ran off a platform. One of those issues was crime and
safety. This is one of the two that they want to use to provide safety
and it's community. The police chief which come from Charlotte
recommended that he needed fifty eight new staff person and police
officers. The city council gave him two thirds. Right now the council is
in the process of moving one of the substation in order to accommodate
this and to provide a safe community and reduction of crime.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
?? Forward sir I believe if you'll hold up just a minute we might be
able to move a little faster. ?? Bali ?? recognized?

favorable report for the committee substitute unfavorable

SPEAKER CHANGES:
Members of the committee you've heard the motion are there further
questions or concerns? Representative Hall
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you madame chairmen I just ask that we can go ahead and move this
bill so that we can leave for the day.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you. (laughter) Representative ??
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you. It's been several years since we've had one of these bills.
But I know in the past when we've had some of these bills and they're
done with private contractors one thing they ?? to and I believe in the
Roloc the redlight bill and I don't know how cities will still doing it
and how many started and abandoning it but they found out that they
adjusted the yellow light to be shorter and the red light to be longer.
And so they had to put in there a provision that the yellow light stayed
yella for a certain amount of time so it didn't come in the effect of a
trap and I know that might sound like a frivolous question but it really
did become an issue and I just wonder have yaw thought about that and
have you had this discussion with the contractors.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
That's one thing that--...
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Floyd sir you're recognized to respond.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
That's one thing that the city of Fayetteville will do when it talked
with the vendors ?? guiding concerns about the yellow turn the yella
special right hand turns. So that's something that the city's gonna work
with the contractor to make that adjustment because it's mostly
technical.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Stones.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Well it became an issue so I hope that they'll be a discussion with the
contractors so that you don't in fact turn them into red light traps.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Hagar?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I'd like to see if I can see if I can call representative Floyd to call
a question. (laughter)
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I believe he's capable if need be. Ladies and gentlemen of the committee
you have the motion before you from Representative
Barlow to grab the PCSA favorable to the administry bill are there
further questions or comments? Say none all in favor will say aye.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Aye.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
All opposed will say no. Thank you. Representative Hagar so are you
ready on ten fifty four. Spendall cape fear sore fee. Thank you madame
chairwoman if it pleases the chair I'll go 'head and explain the bill.

questions. It is a very simple bill. You look at the summary of the

original bill with cape fear.</p>

Sewer availability fees ?? property taxes. Part of the reason for this
is as we've lost our textile background, our textile foundation in
Spindale, they basically lived on the razor edge as far as their budget
goes. They need to be able to collect these fees just so you would
delinquent taxes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? the committee, are there other
questions or comments or concerns. Representative Rodney Moore, sir,
you're recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In the spirit of bipartisanship at
the proper time I'd like to move for a favorable report. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It is the proper time, Representative Moore. Your motion is
accepted. Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am.
Thank you Madame Chair. I would like to ask staff a question as to
whether this isn't a little stronger than we usually have in terms of
these kinds of collections and particularly on the issue of garnishment
of wages and bank accounts. Is that normal? I'm just not remembering
whether we go that far in most bills? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Greg ?? sir,
you're recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's the same as the prior ones. I
think maybe in other summaries it didn't mention the garnishment was one
of the possible tools, but with all these other sessionals it'll list it
in the background in the summary, it only says collected as property
tax. And that is one of the tools that that phrase means you can use.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You're good. Representatives of the
committee, you've heard the motion by Representative Rodney Moore.
Further questions or concerns. Seeing no hands, all in favor will say
aye. All oppose will say no. Representative Hagar, thank you sir for
being here. Senator Woodard and McKissick, sir if you're ready on 870,
Senate Bill 870 Durham payment for on street parking. Welcome to House
Finance, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a fairly simple local bill
which will grant authority to the city of Durham to place pay stations
along the streets for public parking. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representatives
of the committee, are there questions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Representative Lewis. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just have
an inquiry for the bill sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, you're
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, did I understand you say that
this was a local bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I
follow up, Madame Chair? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, Senator, am I to understand that the Durham
delegation in its entirety supports this bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So may I follow up, Madame Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes sir, you have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame
Chair. So Senator, is it your desire that this committee support this
bill because it is a local bill, supported by the local delegation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized to respond, verbally please,
Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, one follow up, Madame Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You're recognized, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, is it your
practice to support local bills in the Senate when they're supported by
the local delegation ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Lewis, Senator, you are not required to respond
if you are uncomfortable. Representative Grier-Martin. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. ?? make a motion on this bill,
Senator Hamilton, anybody? Representative Hamilton is recognized for a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Move for a favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madame Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, you are
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair. I've been informed
that Senate Bill 870 is a local bill that's supported by the Durham
delegation and as a courtesy to the Durham delegation, as I believe we
should treat each other, I'd like to speak in support of this and will
be voting for this bill because I believe that's how business should be
conducted here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis, I'm sure there's
a point there that the Chair doesn't get yet, but that's okay.
[LAUGHTER] Representative Grier-Martin. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Madame Chair. I'm going to take a little bit of a different approach.
This bill is actually good policy. So I'm going to vote for it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. We have a motion for a good policy bill. So, all in
favor of the motion will say aye. All opposed will say no. I believe
that's unanimous, Senator, and you are welcome to</p>

House finance. Members of the committee, the next bill up is senate bill
84a I believe there’s an amendment that’s being prepared but, senator
heart if you would like to come forward and get started on the original
bill and then we’ll add on the decorations as you go forward. Senator
heart and lynn heart? Infrastructure reimbursement.
[Speaker changes]
Thank you madam chair as representative carny mentioned to me, I’m not
real sure I wanted to come up here, but then again I’ve had a twenty
yearlong fear of being in house finance. It goes back a long way.
Hopefully this is not the case with this particular piece of
legislation. It actually replicates some actions that have been taken in
various and sundry ways as you’ve seen in your, in the bill explanation.
For the town of minthill, which charlottes had and some other folks have
had variations of it over time. Bottom line is it is the culmination
last piece of developing a major project in the mint hill area. It could
be replicated in some parts in other locations, but in this case it is
primarily mint hill. Some of you may know this. I think representative
Brawley is familiar with it. A private entity is very interested in
developing a, what’s in effect a replacement mall type operation in Mint
hill at I485, and lawyers wrote I believe it is. It was originally zoned
by the town and land use plans in 2006 and folks have acquired the land
they’ve done all sorts of other restorations and kinds of things. The
land acquisition alone cost 20 million dollars, the town is fully in
support of this particular project, wants this project, but they need to
have the ability to contract in such a way as to use a small portion of
public funds, that the private developer will actually utilize for
developing infrastructure for, primarily a road that will replace one of
the ten most dangerous intersections in the state and make it a lot
safer for a lot of folks. It will ultimately provide a minimum of 1500
jobs, the construction alone will provide I think around 2000 jobs in
the short term. I would be glad to talk about anything else with regard
to it. It simply permits the town voluntarily to enter into an agreement
to assist in the redevelopment of that, that’s all it does. Currently it
is very difficult for those kind of arrangements to take place, but this
is not a public private partnership its more of a private public
partnership arrangement and I would be glad to answer any questions.
[Speaker Changes]
Members of the committee are there any questions? Representative Brawley
sir?
[Speaker changes]
Well first madam chair at the appropriate time I would like to make a
motion and also to echo what the senator has said, this development will
be fairly unique in that it is stitching together, over some protective
wetlands, a shopping center that would be roughly the equivalent of a
major regional mall. The infrastructure will open up what is currently a
protected basin with pumped sewage and improved roads so the benefit to
the citizens of Mecklenburg country and Union county. Those of us that
are still in North Carolina, it is going to be of great benefit and I
would appreciate the committees support.
[Speaker Changes]
Members of the committee, representative Hagar
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Madam Chair, does Minthill own and operate their own utility
infrastructure, water, sewer electricity?
[Speaker Changes]
No, I am reasonably confident that is operated by CMECK Charlotte
Mecklenburg Utilities. Under contract with MintHill and so forth.
[Speaker Changes]
Members of the committee we will stand at ease for just a minute, I
think we are waiting for an amendment to come up so, if you don’t mind.
Ok let’s go, members of the house the amendment that we have been
waiting for does not properly fit this vehicle so</p>
