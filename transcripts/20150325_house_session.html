Let us pray. Lord, as we recognize that you are sovereign over our
country and state, I ask You to guide our lawmakers to the right path.
We recognize those placed in positions of responsibility and authority
need Your inspiration and guidance to deal with the issues and problems
we face. As they debate the issues of the day using their heads and
hearts, help them to use their spirits to divine Your will for the state
and its people, and let us recognize that despite any political
differences between us we are all united through You. In Jesus&#39; name
I pray. Amen.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representatives Stam, Goodman, Jackson, and Fraley,

[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Dollar rise? Strike that, Representative Stam rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, we had a good,
spirited debate yesterday. Representative Meyer has suggested an
amendment that I take-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will suspend. The House will come to
order. If members could please take any conversations outside and give
the gentleman the attention he deserves. The gentleman has the floor to
continue debating the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Representative Meyer has
suggested an amendment that I think improves the bill, and I would ask
that you take that up first. And then I&#39;m looking at a second
amendment that has been offered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Wake,
Representative Avila, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ll just wait until I hear from Representative
Stam and I&#39;ll ask for recognition at that time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Very well. The, all right. For what purpose does the
gentleman from Orange, Representative Meyer rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Meyer moves to amend the bill on page
2, lines 46 through 47 by inserting the following between those lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Orange has the floor to debate the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, this amendment simply says if
we&#39;re going to abolish the right to protest petition, we should give
adjacent landowners enough time to prepare themselves before rezoning
hearing. So this gets at the counterbalance between the ability of
property developers to marshal all of their formidable forces versus
adjacent landowners to have time to say we want to figure out whether we
should support this or oppose this and how can we get our neighbors to
pay attention to the fact that this is happening. And so what I&#39;ve
asked for in this one additional line to existing statute, is that in
addition to the already statutory, statutory requirement for a ten day
notice of public hearing, that municipalities will be required to give
written notice to all adjacent property owners at least 30 days prior to
the fixed date for the public hearing. So they&#39;d have

  30 days to prepare. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the body would give the Chair one indulgence, the Chair was just
informed that we have representatives from the Big Brothers and Big
Sisters of North Carolina present in the gallery. If you would please
stand so that we can welcome you as well. Thank you for being here and
for what you do. For what purpose does the lady from Wake,
Representative Avila, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady would not be recognized at this time as there is an amendment
before the body at this time. Further debate or discussion on the
amendment sent forth by the gentleman from Orange? Does the bill&#39;s
sponsor desire to debate the amendment? Seeing no lights, further
discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the House is the
adoption of Amendment 2, sent forth by Representative Meyer. So many
favoring adoption of the amendment will vote aye, those opposed will
vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine
and record the vote: 114 having voted in the affirmative and 2 in the
negative, the amendment is adopted. For what purpose now does the lady
from Wake, Representative Avila, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will read
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila moves to amend the bill on page 2, line 48, by
deleting &quot;adopted&quot; and substituting &quot;initiated&quot; on
that line.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady from Wake has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Along the lines of Representative Meyer&#39;s
amendment, this does somewhat the same thing. By changing the wording to
be &quot;initiated,&quot; we do allow those protest petitions that are
currently in the pipeline to work themselves through the system. We feel
like that&#39;s only fair, since the people approached this with the law
as it was existing at the time, and it only stands to reason that we
should let them complete the process, but as of the May 1st deadline,
that option for protest petitions is not going to be available any
longer. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The  gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The amendment doesn&#39;t harm the bill, and it&#39;s sort of like we
often will put on other kinds of bills, &quot;this bill does not affect
pending litigation,&quot; and I agree with her, it should not affect
zoning petitions that are in process right now. I ask you to all vote
for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the
House is the adoption of Amendment 3, sent forth by Representative
Avila. So many favoring adoption of the amendment will vote aye, those
opposed will vote no, the clerk will open the  vote. The clerk will lock
the machine and record the vote: 112 having voted in the affirmative and
1 in the negative, the amendment is adopted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wish to be recorded as having voted aye?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Fat fingers. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Richmond will be recorded as having voted aye.
We&#39;re now back on the bill. For what purpose does the gentleman from
Wilkes, Representative Elmore, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I need my vote changed to a yes on the Meyer amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will be recorded as having voted yes on the Meyer
amendment. Further discussion, further debate on the bill? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of House Committee Substitute
for House Bill 201 on its third reading. So many favoring passage of the
bill will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote: 88 having
voted in the affirmative and 29 in the negative, the House Committee
Substitute for House Bill 201 passes its third reading. The bill is
ordered engrossed as to the amendments and will be sent to the Senate.
House Bill--actually, first I believe there&#39;s a motion from the
Rules chairman, Representative Lewis, the gentleman has requested the
Chair to move House Bill 146 from today&#39;s calendar to tomorrow&#39;s
calendar at the request of the bill sponsor. Is that correct? Without
objection, House Bill 146 will be removed to tomorrow&#39;s calendar. Is
there objection? Hearing none, so ordered. House Bill 16

16, a bill to be entitled An Act to Repeal Outdated and Unnecessary
Insurance Reporting Requirements as Recommended by the Department of
Insurance. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Pendleton,
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This was
recommended to me by the North Carolina Department of Insurance, and
it&#39;s a very technical change. It just changes a number of things in
the general statutes. Just a clean-up bill. Yesterday in our insurance
committee, there was no debate on it. Anybody? So I speak in favor of
it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there further discussion or debate on House
Bill 16? The Chair is aware there&#39;s one. Is there further discussion
or debate on the House Committee Substitute for House Bill 16? Seeing
none, those in favor of House Bill 16 will vote aye. Those opposed will

Retirement Age for Magistrates, Judges and Justices of the General Court
of Justice to Require Retirement on December 31 of the Year the
Magistrate, Judges and Justices ?? the Age of 72. General Assembly of
North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Randolph, Representative McNeill, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this
bill was heard yesterday at pensions and retirement. Received a
favorable report. Basically what this bill does, in the old law when a
person that was a judge or magistrate turns 72, they had to retire in
the month that they would turn 72. This bill would simply move the
retirement to the end of the year. This bill would have avoided the
19-person race that we had on the last ballot where you had the 19
people running for the one office. Waiting for any questions, if you
have any, that&#39;s the bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion, further debate on the House Committee Substitute for House
Bill 50. Seeing none, those who favor the passage of the House Committee
Substitute for House Bill 50 will vote aye. Those opposing will vote no.

Representatives Tine, Setzer, J. Bell, and Jackson, the House Bill 151:
A bill to be entitled an act to increase the fairness and equity of the
property insurance rate-making process by providing for greater
transparency regarding the role of catastrophe modeling in property
insurance rate filings, by providing that modeled losses in a property
rate filing be properly allocable to North Carolina, and by requiring
the rate bureau to designate in a filing that portion of the rate in
each territory allocable to wind and hail.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Dare, Representative Tine
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, this bill is intended to bring better information
to the home owners rate making process and then make that more
consumable to policy makers in the public on the backend. This bill was
passed pretty much the same way last year or two years ago out of the
house, unanimously it went through 18 revisions, it went in front of the
Department Of Insurance, the Rate Bureau, and the insurers and there
were several negotiations that took place, concluding with one more
amendment yesterday brought by Representative Collins to settle a
dispute between the department of insurance and the insurers, and the
department of insurance came to the committee and said, “They didn’t
have a problem with it.” So we pass it and so everybody should be
onboard at this point as far as those folks are concerned. Basically,
what this bill does is, if you bring a model, a computer model to the
rate making process and say that, “We have indicated rates because of
these computer models you have to bring to.” And you will notice on your
desk I passed a picture of different satellite models that are just from
regular weather predictions and you will see a wide variety of
conclusions based on the same sets of information. So that’s why we need
more than one model to compare against each other in order to set good
rates as we go forward. You will also find in the bill that the next
session that it takes out six pieces of information from the models,
makes them separate so that those are also consumable by the
commissioner and the public. We also have annual historical loss status
so we can see what actually happened to maybe indicate those rates so
that are being requested and there is a comparison of that model if the
data does not support the models then the Commission of Insurance can
then ask that additional information that reconcile those things will be
brought forward. And finally, the bill would make all of the wind-inhale
rates available on the Department of Insurance by territory website once
the rate falling is completed. The reason for that is right now only in
the 18 costal counties can you see what they are paying for wind-inhale?
This will allow you to see it all over the state so those in the west
that say that it’s, they are paying for somebody else’s losses and those
are the ones saying they are paying for everybody else’s losses. Well,
actually you know who is paying what based on what looses and have that
information to make better decisions as we move forward. So at this
point, I can amend the bill to you, thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate on the House Committee Substitute for
House Bill 151? Seeing none, the question before the house is the
passage of the House Committee Substitute for House Bill 151, those
favoring the bill will vote aye, those oppose will vote no, the clerk
will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine the record the vote,
114 having voted in the affirmative and one in the negative, the House
Committee Substitute for House Bill 151 has passed its second reading

For what purpose does the gentleman from Union, Representative Horn,

To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized the debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We spend a lot of time, and rightly so, talking
about highly effective teachers in the classroom, but a highly effective
teacher in the classroom needs a highly effective principal in the
school. We have an obligation to not only support them and select them
but to train them and give them the skills and it&#39;s an entirely
different skill set it takes to run a school than it does to be a
teacher in a classroom. Not that the principal doesn&#39;t have to be a
great teacher, very helpful, but as I said a different skill set and
this bill, I commend Representative Cotham for bringing this bill
forward to ensure we put the resources behind training and supporting
our principals. The individual that hires, supervise, evaluates and sets
the tone for every school in our state. Thank you very much, Mr.
Speaker.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the House. The state
of North Carolina has, for a long time, had grand jury functions in its
justice system but the grand jury that we have had for many years, up
until recently, was more or less just a hearing by a group of folks to
see if there was enough evidence to move forward on a prosecution. The
district attorney did not participate in the grand jury hearing. It was
not investigative by any

  <p id="030:00">
  In 2013, House Bill 908 was passed, and we initiated an investigative
grand jury at that time, which had tools to allow for complicated
situations, such as public corruption to be investigated. This
particular bill expands the list of crimes for which an investigated
grand jury can be convened. It’s a bipartisan effort to allow state
prosecutors to convene an investigative grand jury, with permission from
a three judge panel for the specified crimes. Now the crimes that are
addressed in this particular bill are very, very serious crimes, I think
we all would agree, having to do with violations of the drug laws, for
instance, that involve large amounts of importation of drugs, or gang
activity involved with drugs, or things of that nature. This bill also
provides for investigation of incidents involving bribery, obstructing
justice, buying and selling of all offices, and officers or employee
benefiting from contracts, etc. So the nature of this is to get at those
white-collar type crimes that are embarrassing and costly to our
society. An investigative grand jury questions witnesses under oath,
subpoenas records, and deliberates evidence of wrong doing. This compels
witnesses to testify under oath, who might otherwise not cooperate with
an investigation. You all seen the TV programs or movies where the
federal prosecutor has somebody testifying, and trying to use all kinds
of reasons for not offering information. This gives the strength to our
prosecutors to require testimony from those folks who are hiding
information that would help uncover serious crimes. Federal authorities
have this authority. Our state prosecutors have not had the SBI, State
Bureau of Investigation is in favor of this legislation. They’re the
ones who are charged often with investigating particularly public
corruption crimes and matters like that. They are in favor it. It’s an
important tool to help uncover the truth and wrongdoing by public
officials. In 2013, when 908 was passed by this House, by 116-0, the
Attorney General praised that bill. SO I offer this up to you, and hope
that you will favor it, and I also understand that Representative
Glazier probably has an amendment. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Glazier rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, to offer an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment,
the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Glazier moves to amend the bill on page one, line
three, rewriting that line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you Representative
Faircloth. This is an amendment discussed in J2 for which there’s an
agreement, but we had to get the language together last night. It’s been
approved by the District Attorney’s conference, and simply what it does
is say if there is actually a charge as a result of an investigative
grand jury, the grand jury’s findings become part of the prosecutors
record, so they’re part of his or her file, appropriately. I know of no
opposition of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what reason does the gentleman from Guilford,
Representative Faircloth rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The primary sponsors support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman’s recognized to debate the amendment. For
what purpose—further discussion or debate on the amendment? If not, the
question before the House is the adoption of Amendment 1, sent forth by
Representative Glazier. Favoring adoption of the amendment vote aye,
those opposed will vote no, the Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will
lock the machine and record the vote. 115 having voted in the
affirmative, and none in the negative, the House Committee substitute
for House Bill—strike that, the amendment one offered by Representative
Glazier is adopted. We’re now back on the bill. Further discussion,
further debate on the bill as amended?

about the jury service part, it says they don&#39;t have to serve for

  House Bill 152, the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representatives Ross, Hardister, Lewis, and Clazier.
House Bill 152, a bill to be entitled, and act to enact historic
preservation tax credit. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Alamance,
Representative Ross rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, what this bill does is just takes the old tax
credit that we had and totally revamps the program. In looking at a lot
of questions that came up about the old program, and looking for a way
to try to help with the—our economic situation, with historic structures
in North Carolina, we have been about to revise after a lot of work, a
new bill the drastically reduces the credits that were in the old bill.
Specifically in this bill, what it does is it reduces the credit rate on
income producing properties, from 20% to 15% for expenses up to ten
million dollars. It reduces the credit rate on income producing
properties from 20% to 10% for expenses over ten million dollars and
less than twenty. I say less than twenty is because twenty million is
the cap. The old program had no caps. This program is capped here at
twenty million. The next thing that we did was we recognized that there
are some areas of the state where we’re trying to get economic
developments stimulated, in particular Tier 1 and Tier 2 counties. So we
added a bonus, a 5% credit bonus if a project takes place in a Tier 1 or
Tier 2 county. That’s important. The second thing that we did was we
recognized some of the older manufacturing facilities, say a mill, or in
some cases like in Guilford, Alamance, or other counties, we have old
abandoned furniture factories. But an old abandoned historic
manufacturing facilities, there’s a 5% bonus, It also limits the credit
amount to four and a half million dollars total, and we reduced the
credit on non-income producing properties from 30% all the way down to
15% and non-income producing property would be a residential property.
In addition to that, we have limited the credit amount on non-income
producing properties to $22,500. If you do the math, that’s about a
$200,000 house. And we allowed the credit to be taken in the year it was
generated, instead of five installments, and all this does is extends
the program on a reduced basis for five years, until January 1, 2021.
Now what does this really mean? I’ve passed out and on your desk, you
all have a big map. This is not the one with the hurricane on it. What
this means is that this would revive economic development and pretty
much every county in North Carolina, if you look historically at what’s,
these projects have taken place in 90 out of 100 counties. And I say
that because all too often I hear people say, “This only benefits
Raleigh. This will only benefit Charlotte.” I think the map is pretty
explicit. It’s all over North Carolina, and it’s in every one of our
communities, mine and yours. It’s been used, as I said, 90 out of 100
counties, and since 1998—if we go back to 1998, we’ve had off 2,484 tax
credit projects that have been completed state-wide, which brought in
private investment of $1.67 billion. That’s “billion” with a B. That’s a
lot of private investment coming in North Carolina. What this does is
this boosts local economies, creates job, at the same time it preserves
communities, and it preserves the very historic structures that have
made North Carolina great.  Now I’ve got examples I can cite, all over
North Carolina. But what does it do?

  <p id="045:00">
  it was a non-partisan study on a historic tax credit program.  And what
that found was that the historic tax rehabilitation credit program
attracts two and one-half times more jobs at the same cost to the state
treasury as an equivalent across the board tax reduction.  Now, I want
to repeat that.  The tax credit program would bring in two and a half
times more jobs at the same cost to the state treasury as the equivalent
of an across the board tax reduction.  Now, how does it do that?  When
you take these structures and you begin the process of rehabilitation,
it creates jobs.  It creates lots of jobs.  A project going on in my
district right now that just started is gonna [sic] generate about 200
jobs for the first year.  What&#39;s it gonna do after that?  It&#39;s
gonna produce 157 residences that would not have been there.  The third
benefit to that, it&#39;s going to revitalize a town that was dying on
the vine because the very industry that came into that town in the mid
1800&#39;s and started and this town was built around is now gonna be
revived into something that&#39;s gonna reproduce results in this
town--that is gonna make it thrive and come back to life.  It&#39;s
interesting that the structure that I&#39;m talking about was built in
1881, and that&#39;s the same year that this town was incorporated.
I&#39;ll take another example.  Let&#39;s look at a program that took
place over in Durham--the redevelopment of the former Golden Belt
Textile Mill created 400 jobs.  The building is now home to 80
commercial tenants and 37 apartments.  [inaudible] to Mount Airy because
this is more of a rural area.  In Mount Airy, there have been 20
rehabbed historic buildings in the downtown Mount Airy area.  Mount Airy
has a population of about 10,000.  These rehabs now host 42 businesses
and 172 permanent, full-time jobs. I passed out in addition to the map,
another piece--these are some numbers from Mount Airy.  This piece--kind
of looks like this one.  I apologize for the black and white, but you
know how our copy machine is here.  If you look at this particular
project, this is the 225-229 Market Street area of Mount Airy.  Total
developer capital investment into this project was $207 million.
Building cost 45.  If we look at the bottom of the chart you can see
that the state tax credits--now this is based on the old system--was
$5248 a year.  It runs for five years.  If you look at the state tax
receipts that resulted from the rehab of these projects, you can see the
second line, which by the end of the fifth year, the state tax receipts
are $34,713.  Now the third line is the cumulative.  At the end of the
fifth year the state has received back in state revenues--back to the
state treasury--$142,255.  That&#39;s a 26,000 dollar investment by the
state to generate a $142,000 investment.  That&#39;s a 462% five year
return on investment.  Now most of you know, I&#39;m an investment
adviser.    If I could get investments that would return me 462% on a
five-year investment, I&#39;ll take it all day long.  Unfortunately,
they&#39;re hard to find.  But, they are there when you look at
investments of this type in the way that we structured this program.
That&#39;s directly back to the state treasury, and as you all know,
we&#39;re constantly looking for ways to raise revenue.  What better way
to raise revenue than to revitalize communities, bring life back into
communities that have lost that life as manufacturing left North
Carolina, as factories closed down all across the state...whether it was
textiles, whether it was furniture.  They&#39;re everywhere in every one
of our districts you can see these old buildings sitting there.

  By doing this, we&#39;re providing jobs, we&#39;re providing homes,
we&#39;re providing economic opportunity back to our local areas, and at
the same time we&#39;re generating state revenue back to the treasury.
That&#39;s why, to me, this type of a program is a no-brainer because
the return on investment cannot even be calculated, these are just raw
numbers based on the project itself.  You can&#39;t put a calculation on
the other things this does for a community, it&#39;s probably off the
chart.  That&#39;s why this program, the new program has garnered the
support of the North Carolina&#39;s Metro Mayors Coalition, Preservation
North Carolina, the North Carolina League of Municipalities, North
Carolina Association of County Commissioners, downtown development
organizations, economic developers, American Institute of Architects,
Centralina Council for Governments, North Carolina Association of
Realtors, local Chamber of Commerce, North Carolina Bankers Association,
Real Estate and Industry Coalition, North Carolina Chapter of Planning
Association, mortgage bankers, professional engineers, contractors, AGC
Carolinas, your local councils of the government, the list goes on.
It&#39;s a win-win for the local communities, a big win for our historic
structures, and a win for the State of North Carolina.  I think Bob
Steinburg, my colleague here to my right said it best one day in a
committee, we&#39;re one North Carolina, we&#39;re not two separate
entities, the state and local government, we&#39;re actually one North
Carolina, and should all be working together because when we work
together, we rebuild an economy.  You rebuild an economy, and I heard
the Secretary of Commerce say this morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Floyd rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To see if the bill&#39;s sponsor will yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentleman from Alamance yield to the gentleman
from Cumberland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You just read off the number of sponsors that you had
from the industry that you just read, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That was multiple industries, not just one industry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Could you be so nice to read out the sponsors here in
this chamber?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I would love to do that, but in essence of time let me
just say there are, let me just say there are 65 co-sponsors to this
bill, and it just passed through Finance yesterday with a unanimous
vote, and I think that&#39;s my cue from my colleague from the other
side of the aisle that it&#39;s time to put it to rest.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Craven,
Representative Speciale rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Once again, I&#39;m on the other side of the issue, I
don&#39;t know how it happens.  This was something that we took out,
year before last in the budget, so we could give a 2% tax break, and now
we&#39;re trying to unravel it.  This, the fair admissions, we&#39;ve
had several things in front of us trying to unravel what we had done two
years ago.  And I&#39;m not going to speak long, I&#39;m just going to
say, God, were we wrong then, for crying out loud, that we&#39;re ready
to undo it?  Vote against this thing, this should be a county issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Burke,
Representative Blackwell rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I won&#39;t take long either, but I&#39;ll actually
probably echo a little bit of what Representative Speciale just said.  I
voted for the tax reform we did, and I voted to eliminate a lot of other
credits that were very popular, one of which was the medical deduction
for seniors.  And I told my people at home I voted for it and I
eliminated some of their credits because we were doing it so we could
reduce taxes across the board.  As Representative Speciale said

  <p id="055:00">
  We’re now unraveling that. I voted for the unemployment tax reform,
which a lot of people complained was going to hurt them. But that was
going to help all the employers across the state of North Carolina, and
it in fact, has. In fact, I think the Governor’s probably put out press
releases more than once bragging on the improvement in the employment
rate and the economy in North Carolina, and how were are growing faster
relative to most of the states since those reforms. There’s an entity,
and I may not get the name exactly correct, that I think is the National
Tax Foundation that’s been in existence for many years. It’s
non-partisan, as I understand. They released a report, I think in the
last year or last few months, in which they rate the tax climates
attractiveness to business for all the states in the country. And they
cited North Carolina as the example of the greatest improvement in
rating a favorable tax climate it ever had occurred during the history
of the time that they’ve been doing these ratings. And they mentioned
our tax reform, and the elimination of the credits that favor certain
people in certain businesses, and the unemployment tax improvement that
we did. The Governor made a State of the State Address to us, and as I
recall, he made the comment somewhere in there that in North Carolina
and I think this would probably be true across the country, that most
job growth comes from small businesses. And yet here we’re choosing to
give credits to certain developers for certain properties rather than to
stay the course on trying to get to that trigger that lower corporate
taxes, and maybe income taxes for everyone in the state, so they all
have an equal opportunity to invest with Representative Ross. I urge the
House, despite the number of sponsors that are on this bill already, to
reconsider this, and if you’re not going to, I hope you’ll be prepared
to give serious consideration to Rep. Catlin’s bill, to restore the tax
credit for seniors on their medical deductions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash,
Representative Collins rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve been looking for a way to try and agree with this
bill for a long time. When it was first in the making, I heard that,
number one, it was only going to be about commercial properties, wasn’t
going to be about people’s residences anymore, and frankly, I’ve got two
things I really can’t get past. Number one is that one. I would be a
little more amenable if it was just the commercial properties. There’s
no way we’re getting any of our money back on the state level for
private residences, unless you assume they’re going to be homeless and
not have a job if they don’t move into these particular structures which
I doubt seriously. So we’re not getting any return on the state level on
that money. The people who are getting the greatest return are the
cities and counties in which these rehabilitations are occurring, and I
have asked repeatedly if we could get some buy-in from the cities and
counties. I understand the small towns like the one I live in, and
counties like the one I live in are taking part. I understand. And I
don’t have numbers to back this up. I haven’t had a chance to research.
I’ve been busy with other things, but I have a sneaking suspicion that
some of the other cities in which the city council is smart enough to
know the private developers are going to be-they’re not taking a risk if
they’re rehabbing a bill, and then downtown A, B, C, they’re going to
start making money right away. I have a sneaking suspicion that these
cities are not anteing up. The state, we can put in our money. My
problem with this is the cities aren’t required to do anything in this
except ask for our money. I think all parties to contract all that have
skin in the game, cities and counties are benefiting by this financially
far more by this more than anybody else is, than any other entity,
including the state. They’re almost benefiting as private residences
being rehabbed, and I can’t vote for a bill like this until me require
the localities that are benefiting also have skin in the game. I hope
when this bill passes out of here, that when the Senate sits on it we
come back with something where we require the locals to participate.

  —again, use some personal experience. First thing: this is a tax credit.
This is not an appropriation, this is not a grant. This is a tax credit.
This is a credit towards income earned after the fact. In other words:
You do a project, the project generates income, you get a credit on a
portion of the taxes you pay. So this is not money out of our pockets,
so to speak. Now, in Hickory, right now today, there are four projects,
two of which have been completed, that are underway using these tax
credits. The first project was a mill that was falling apart when I
moved there forty years ago. It&#39;s right at the front door of
Lenoir-Rhyne University. 40,000 square foot hosiery mill. It was a place
where homeless people lived, it was a problem, it was a hazard, and yet
a group of investors—evil developers, I might add—went in and developed
this, using this tax credit. What is it today? Well, it&#39;s a
performing arts facility, partially. It&#39;s probably the closest thing
we have to a five star restaurant in Hickory, today. It&#39;s got some
local space in it, and it inspired another mill owner, about two hundred
yards away, to begin work on an 80,000 square foot project, which is
also gonna have restaurants, office space, housing, and a fitness center
in it. Which also inspired another developer, Transportation Insight, to
house their new office in another mill building about four hundred yards
away. The first project was about a four million dollar investment. The
second project is in excess of ten million dollars. The third project
will be in excess of ten million dollars. But that&#39;s not the whole
story. It&#39;s not the footprint of the projects that&#39;s going to be
enhanced. It&#39;s the neighborhood around these projects. It&#39;s a
whole quadrant of our downtown that&#39;s gonna be changed. As far as
the residential tax credits go? The little houses, the old bungalows
that date back to the 1920s that are in those neighborhoods have a
chance of being renovated as well using those tax credits. I&#39;ve seen
it firsthand, folks. It&#39;s not just the projects. It&#39;s the whole
community that benefits. It is gonna be hugely restorative, and it&#39;s
gonna be a big boost to Lenoir-Rhyne University. Get this clutter out of
the way. I strongly stand in favor of this Bill. And as far as the other
tax credits? I&#39;ll look at &#39;em all individually. This is a good
investment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Bumgardner]

[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Bumgardner]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You can come in and cherrypick projects and
statistics from now until tomorrow, and talk about how great some of
&#39;em are— and I have no doubt some investments work out and some
don&#39;t. I wonder how many, if we cared to, we could cite that
haven&#39;t worked out, all over the state. We&#39;re still engaged in
picking winners and losers here. We&#39;re going back on what we did two
years ago. I want buildings to be developed that have historical
significance and redeveloped downtown areas as much as anybody else
does, I&#39;m just not willing to spend other people&#39;s money to do
it. Developers should have skin in the games. Everybody that&#39;s
involved should have skin in the game because when businessmen make
investments that don&#39;t work out they lose money. When politicians
make decisions that don&#39;t work out, they get re-elected. So—
[laughter]
If this statistic cited here—462% return on investment—is true, then we
need to develop— we need to redevelop every building in every town in
this state because then we&#39;d really have something fabulous. Because
it would be Christmas for everybody. Vote against this Bill.

  that this bill will create some jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There&#39;s no question about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you also believe that if this tax credit doesn&#39;t go through, do
you believe that some of these older buildings will be torn down?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can assure you that there are some of these older buildings that will
be torn down. There are a number of them, their old hold now, in fact I
have a newspaper article from about a week ago from Graham, North
Carolina where there&#39;s a huge mill, the Onata textile mill, which
was waiting for developers to work out the numbers and be able to do a
reconstruction there. Unfortunately, the rooftop caved in under the
weight of the snow. So, as they get older they get more feeble and there
goes a piece of history in Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s what I was getting at, is about the history also, because I
think that-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wish to ask a second question or debate the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question, second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Alamance yield to the gentleman from Guilford,
to a question? He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you think also that the history will be lost here in North Carolina,
in various communities?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you look at some of the things that have already been done,
absolutely. Saxapahaw, there&#39;s a mill, would not be a vibrant
operating community right now if it weren&#39;t for this historic tax
credit, the previous program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Alamance yield to a third question from the
gentleman from Guilford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Landfill, I&#39;m going to assume that if these buildings are torn down
that they&#39;re going to fill up our landfills.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m sorry, could you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I said if these buildings are torn down they&#39;re headed to our
landfills, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In one way or the other, yeah. Usually they just fall in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, that&#39;s it, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover, Representative
Catlin, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As you all know, I am not for incentives unless they are for
infrastructure, and in my opinion I think that historic preservation,
rebuilding these homes and these historic buildings is infrastructure
for our state. It&#39;s a place that you don&#39;t find when you go out
west, it&#39;s a place that you don&#39;t find when you go to Germany
because they all got bombed. It is something that makes us special in
North Carolina and in the historic text, construction requirements of
very strict. When I was commissioner we looked at that for one of our
old buildings that we were renewing and it actually, I don&#39;t think
that the contractors that build these make people aware of the cost they
have to do to meet all of the historic requirements to build these
buildings. So, with just the federal tax credits in hand, I don&#39;t
know that the builders actually can make it break even. So this is
something that does help offset some of the extra cost. They have to use
historic wood, they have to use historic this and historic that to make
it work. So it&#39;s not something where they just go in and get rich
building it. At the end of the day North Carolina benefits from it. I
did serve on the Board of Directors for the Bellamy Mansion Museum and
so I was very aware of the cost of all that they do and how these
credits offset some of those costs. Nobody was getting rich off it but
the town of Wilmington benefited from that museum and those other
things. This is one infrastructure that I do support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I&#39;m a primary sponsor on this bill
and I&#39;m not a fan of tax credits. When I was approached by a
constituent several months ago and asked about restoring the historic
preservation tax credits, I struggled with it because I agree with some
of the comments have been made, Representative Speciale made a comment
earlier about a clean tax code. In general, I support that philosophy,
but I think it&#39;s logical

  <p id="070:00">
  to make an exception for this particular case, and I say that for
several reasons. Number one, I think it&#39;s appropriate for the
government to play a role in historic preservation. Number two, I think
it really does work. The investment is there. It creates investment
exclusively in North Carolina. It creates jobs. It increases property
value. Another issue I was going to point out is exactly what
Representative Catlin just said, infrastructure. I see this from that
standpoint as well. It especially benefits small towns. I&#39;m from
Guilford County and the Guilford County Board of Commissioners, which
has a republican majority, voted unanimously to reinstate the tax
credits but also Gibsonville, Pleasant Garden, Oak Ridge, those three
small towns in my district, they voted in favor of reinstating these tax
credits, and again, those small towns have a republican majority on
their council. They voted for it. The city of Greensboro has voted for
it. There are projects all over the state that have benefited from
having this credit in place and I think it&#39;s very safe to say that a
lot of these projects would not have happened without this tax credit
and there&#39;s many more projects that probably won&#39;t happen if we
don&#39;t keep the tax credit in place. This bill, the tax credit, is
actually scaled back. But my position is we need more time. We&#39;re an
old state. This is a unique state. We have a lot of old buildings and
structures that, quite frankly, have character and quality that you
don&#39;t find in modern architecture. So I think this is a good bill
and, Mr. Speaker, I would ask our members to support it. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In Kannapolis, North Carolina, my hometown, we
have a unique situation right now where the city has actually bought the
entire downtown, just recently, and if that were what this was about
I&#39;d be all for it. I appreciate them preserving this downtown and
they definitely have skin int he game, without a doubt, and that&#39;s
what we are to be looking at, but not only these other things, including
private homes. My home is over 50 years old, if you all want to pay to
renovate it I&#39;ll be glad to let you do it. But I think this bill is
reverse Robin Hood, we&#39;re taking from the poor and the middle class
and giving to the rich, and that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re doing.
We&#39;ve had these projects at home that were bought up by banks, they
turned around and sold them as commodities. That&#39;s not right.
That&#39;s not what this was meant to do. I&#39;m for tax reform and
we&#39;ve moved forward with tax reform and here we&#39;re going
backwards. We got to make up our mind what we want to do. Do we want to
bless everyone, help everyone, or just the chosen few? Thank you.

I have a very good friend and client who does these for a living and if
you want to just visit one that&#39;s such a success, two blocks down,
if you go down past this side street past William Peace University
you&#39;ll dead end at the Pilot Mill, it&#39;s an old textile plant,
beautiful brick building built in the 1880&#39;s and Frank did this
building. He said the only way it would work financially was with
credits and it was on the books, Wake County property tax rolls, for
$400,000 valuation and it&#39;s now in the books for $21 Million
valuation. He went over to Hillsborough and did the same thing on a
plant down the river. But he says he can&#39;t do any more without these
credits. He did say that people are right on these homes. He doesn&#39;t
believe you should do homes because you&#39;re just not going to get
your money. It&#39;s not for the public good to do the old homes with
the credits, you might want to use something else. So that&#39;s my two
cents worth.

  Tax credits, I don’t mind quite as bad. The problem for me is this. If
this were a bill were about actual historic preservation I could see
some point in it. But, I’ll give you an example of the kind of thing
that would bother me with this. The house I live in was built in 1957 as
the old parsonage of one of the local Methodist churches, and I suppose
if somebody wanted to, they could get that put on the historic registry.
So then if I sell it to some business, and they come in wanting to
renovate it, making it better for their use. They would get a tax credit
for that? I don’t think so. And to take a building that is of
questionable historical significance. Ripping out the first two floors
and putting in a parking deck, and putting apartments when it used to be
a furniture store or something like that. I don’t see how that’s
historic preservation either. So I just—I have gone back and forth on
this. Probably a few days ago, I would have been persuaded to vote for
and I’ve just been back and forth, it’s a tough decision for me, and
finally I have to say listening to the debate today and decide what to
do. And from the debate I’ve heard, I’m voting no. Thank you.

Adams, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill a

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m just thinking about looking at these projects
underway in Hickory, and I’m thinking about all the electricians, and
the plumbers, and the sheetrock installers, and the people who put down
flooring, and the people who have gone back and detailed out all the old
features of these buildings. I’m thinking about all the jobs that is
creating in our area. Those same people work on historic houses too. So
I’m strongly in favor of this bill and I hope you consider more than
just the tax aspects of this. This is about jobs. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman Alamance,
Representative Ross rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I’d like to clarify a couple
things that have been said here, in the last little bit. First of all, I
want to make sure when you’re talking about the evil developers that you
understand something, and that is that the developer is the one who
assumes all of the risk. There is no risk to the state, so if the
developer’s going to assume the risk, doesn’t it stand to reason the
developer should make a little money on it. That’s the way commerce
works. The second thing I want to clear up its some things were made
about making change to our tax direction. Tax policy is a complex issue,
and a tax policy is not something you do one time and say, “We’re done
with it, we did it, it’s over.” Every state around us has this historic
tax credit program, all of them. In fact, let’s go to the state a lot of
people like to use as a model. We’ll take Texas, a state that has no
income tax. Well, if they have no income tax, why would they want to
have a program like this? But last year, Governor Rick Perry signed into
law a historic tax credit for a ta25%. Historical rehabilitation tax
credit. Tax policy, like I said, is complex. Sometimes we have to look
at the sources of revenue that we’re trying to generate. We have to look
at what tax policy is trying to accomplish. And in this case here, what
we’re trying to do is make an investment back into North Carolina
through tax policy. We’re not sending money off to the Moon. And the
third thing I want to mention that was just stated over here, is as far
as residence, and how does a resident qualify? We’ve greatly scaled back
the qualification for residents. But you can’t just take any old house
and turn it into a house for tax credit. It has to be a registered,
certified, historic site. What this part of the bill is designed to get
at, and I’ll try to use an example. Take a city like Greenesboro. I’m a
little bit familiar with Greenesboro because--

  <p id="080:00">
  Is right next door, and every city is like this. Greensboro, Wilmington,
Asheville, you name it, every city is like this. There is a group of
very old colonial style homes that were built in a little corridor, a
little core, a little neighborhood right next to the downtown, and
Greensboro, I think they call it maybe Old Irving Park. These are the
very historic houses that are the foundation of that city, and for that
reason, it&#39;s important that we try to do everything we can to help
preserve those old homes, because when they&#39;re gone, we won&#39;t
have any old residential architecture to look at. Now, there&#39;s been
a lot said about local communities and skin in the game, and as someone
who&#39;s spent a lot of years in municipal government and worked a lot
with county governments, I can&#39;t tell you the amount of money that
local governments put in to make these things work. The project that I
mentioned in Mebane, the white furniture company, the city has gone in
and is moving all the water and sewer lines that go to the structure.
Now, in my knowledge of water and sewer lines in my municipal days, they
sell that stuff by the inch. It&#39;s not cheap. There&#39;s engineering
and design work that has to go into putting all that in, and it can run
into hundreds of thousands of dollars. They&#39;re redoing all the
streets, streetscapes, sidewalks. They&#39;re moving one street. These
are all investments the city can legally make to make this project work.
Now, the city can&#39;t legally put money into the project under most of
the city&#39;s charters. I know my city couldn&#39;t, but we sure could
do a whole lot of infrastructure improvements to make it attractive for
a developer to come in and take the risk and make it happen, and so
that&#39;s how local communities participate in these things. Now
granted, there are a lot of small towns all across North Carolina, tier
one counties, that don&#39;t have the, the financial wherewithal to be
able to do that, and I understand that, but in most of the larger cities
and counties, there is a lot of skin in the game.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, are you aware that Ronald Reagan was a supporter of
historic tax credits?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m glad you asked that. I have a, I&#39;m not, I&#39;m not gonna
read, I&#39;m not gonna read this, but this is actually a speech that
Ronald Reagan gave to, to an organization. As most of you know, well
most of you may not know. Ronald Reagan is considered the father of the
historic tax credit, okay? That&#39;s important for some of you to know.
He believed so much in the historic tax credit that he delivered a
number of speeches about why they&#39;re important and why preserving
our history and our historic structures is so important. And in the lieu
of time, if any of you want to read this speech, I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll have
it over here and after the, after the session you&#39;re welcome to come
by or I&#39;ll give you a copy of it.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe I heard a bell ring just a minute. Can you explain to me
exactly what the meaning of that is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. What the, what the bell, well, it could mean a number of
things. But what the bell meant, what the bell ringing at this time
meant was that the gentleman was about, was fifteen seconds from using
up his allotted time on the second speech, and so, if a member, if the
member hears the bell and then doesn&#39;t, keeps talking, then usually
there&#39;s a loud crack of this piece of wood up here with the gavel to
notify the member that their time&#39;s expired. But that&#39;s what
that was for. So, for what purpose does the gentleman from Craven,

Ladies and gentlemen, if we concede that Ronald Reagan is right, if we
concede that North Carolina does need to preserve it’s heritage which we
all do, I get that, we all get that then I would like you also to
concede that what we did two years ago was right that we wanna stick
with that. So I thought an alternative and I said, “Okay, let’s help
these people out to keep these buildings going.” The legal
municipalities, the sponsor of the bill said that they were for this
bill, the legal county commissioners was for this bill. Well, then they
should be ?? amendment because I want this thing to go through as well,
I want the tax credits to go through as well, and I’m gonna let these
cities and the towns if you vote for this, we are gonna let them help us
by allowing them to participate with 50% of the cost depending on where
the building is located, and let the counties and municipalities, okay
that want this as we want it, let them help, let them put some skin in
the game, they will be much more selective about which things get
rehabbed and which things don’t. And I think it’s a win, win for
everybody. So I ask you to support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Brunswick, Representative Hour
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative ?? yell to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yell to the gentleman from Brunswick?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was reading the book however, so I hope the question is…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thought you are looking at the constitution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Who elected the amendment that is been proposed where the county or city
must paid ?? no matter one half of the tax credit? First, do you that’s
constitutional and second would you characterize it as unfunded mandate
to the county or city?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Regardless of the wisdom of the amendment I can’t understand why it
would be unconstitutional since cities and counties are creatures of the
state, and so the answer is no I don’t think it’s constitutional and
it’s not an unfunded mandate because they don’t have to do it. In other
words, they just wouldn’t have to approve it. I have not studied the
question I was studying something else.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Brunswick, Representative Hour

Does the gentleman from Wake yell to an additional question from

they wouldn’t have to do it, it was…

The confession is good, I haven’t seen the amendment yet, my computer
right out of battery and I haven’t seen it, I will look at it. What I
was looking for was in 160A I think they are probably and here she come
Miss. Churchill to advice me, I think that actually…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Permitted on the floor, expedite this process, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss. Churchill under 168A, can cities directly appropriate money for
