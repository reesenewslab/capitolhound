  The House will come to order. Members are asked to take their seats.
Visitors will retire from the chamber. The Sergeant-at-arms will close
the doors. Members and visitors are asked to please silence all
electronic devices. Today&#39;s prayer will be offered by Representative
Goodman. I would ask the members to please stand and visitors in the
gallery to please stand, and also to remain standing for the Pledge of
Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Let us pray. Dear Lord, we gather here today intent on
doing good work. We seek to represent fairly and well those who have
given us this task. May our efforts be blessed with insight, guided by
understanding and wisdom. We seek to serve with respect for all. May our
personal faith give us the strength to act honestly and well in all
manners before us. Lord, we also ask on this winter day that you keep
those who must travel safe from the hazards created due to the snow and
ice. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The pledge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis, is
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, the journal for February 23rd has been
examined and found to be correct. I move that it be approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Lewis moves that the journal for
February 23rd be approved as written. Those in favor will say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Opposed, no. The Ayes have it and the journal is
approved as written. Members are nurse of the day who made it here
somehow in this weather is Tom Bush from Hillsboro. Mr. Bush, we&#39;re
glad to have you here with us today. Members and those guests who are
wondering why we started a little late, we continue to monitor the
weather, and it&#39;s my understanding that this round of snow and
weather we&#39;ve had today is the first round, and that a worse round
will actually be here on Wednesday evening, Wednesday afternoon. What
we&#39;ve done is consulted both with members of the minority party,
members of the majority party, and what I&#39;ve sensed is the consensus
that we&#39;re gonna take up one bill today, and we&#39;ll get to that
in a few minutes, that Senate bill 14 will be rolled over to be dealt
with next week, and this will probably be the only day of any kind of
session. You can see how many empty chairs we have today, and it&#39;s
expected that Thursday we wouldn&#39;t be able to get anything done. The
roads are gonna be pretty bad. As far as tomorrow, the dilemma is that
in the morning it&#39;s going to be frozen. They&#39;re telling
everybody stay off the roads in the morning. That&#39;s when the
committees would meet, and if we wade into the afternoon then
folks&#39;ll be stuck driving to other parts of the state in the
evening. So we just can&#39;t catch a break on this one, I&#39;m afraid.
So just for your planning purposes, this will be the only day of
official business in session. Introductions of bills and resolutions,
the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]House bill 97, Representatives Dollar, L. Johnson,
McGrady, and Lambeth, 2015 Appropriations Act.

will read.

entitled An Act to Make Changes to the Unemployment Insurance Laws.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Rules, Calendar, and Operations of the House. Members,
on behalf of Representative Bradford of Mecklenburg County, the Chair is
happy to extend the courtesies of the Gallery to Cornelius Mayor Chuck
Travis. Mayor Travis, thank you for being here today. House bill 65, the
clerk will read.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry.

Gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis, is recognized for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I move that
Senate bill 14 be removed from today&#39;s calendar and re-calendar for
Tuesday, March 3.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection? So ordered. I would ask the pages
to come down front, please. Members, while the pages are coming, I would
remind members that tomorrow is the bill filing deadline for bills
recommended by study committees. That&#39;s the first deadline to fall.
I think the next one is not until March 18. But again tomorrow. Excuse
me, it&#39;s to, yes, that is the bill filing deadline for tomorrow. So
if you have a bill that you&#39;re working on from a study committee,
please make sure that is filed by tomorrow. Pages, the clerk is going to
call your name, and when he does if you would please step forward so
we&#39;ll know who you are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Cassidy Davis. David Gries. Clay Griffith. Erin
Kennedy. Hope Kim. Harrison McNeil. Drew Wrexel. Luke Smith. Mark van
Ripper.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Pages, just want to welcome you here. This is, as you
can see, the weather hasn&#39;t exactly cooperated with us this week,
and we actually had a few bills you would&#39;ve been able to see get
voted upon, but due to the weather, this will be our only day of
session. But I do want to thank you for your brief visit, and I hope you
enjoy the time you are here, and I would ask the members to join me and
thank you all for your services. You all may return to your stations.
House will be ?? just a moment. Notices and Announcements. And the chair
would pose a question. The chair intends that the skeleton session that
we have this week be on Friday. That&#39;s in consultation with the
clerk&#39;s office. That would allow us then to not have, of course, to
be back until, be back Monday night. The rules require or state that we
do not have session on Friday. So my question is, is there any, and it
will be a skeleton session on Friday. The reason we are choosing Friday
is because Thursday, by all accounts, is supposed to be pretty nasty,
and we don&#39;t want the clerk&#39;s office having to be here. Will
there by any objection to the House being in session on Friday? Hearing
none, that&#39;ll be ordered. Notices and Announcements? For what
purpose does the gentleman from Union, Representative Brody, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe we, the Committee on Education, Community
College, has sent out a notice for a meeting on Thursday, and obviously
that will be cancelled.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You can still meet if you&#39;d like, Representative
Brody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] &lt;crowd noises&gt;
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Scotland,
Representative Pierce, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask a question, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 7:00 Monday night, are you coming early Monday? Are we
coming early?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ll advise the body later whether there&#39;ll
be a need for any session Monday. There&#39;s a possibility of a
committee meeting late Monday afternoon, but it is a remote possibility
at this point. We&#39;ll keep the members informed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further notices and announcements? Seeing none, the
gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis, is recognized
