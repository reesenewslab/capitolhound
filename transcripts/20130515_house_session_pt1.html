[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker. To speak on the bill
[Speaker Changes]The gentlemen is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker and Ladies and gentlemen I
appreciate the work that has been done so far. We know that there are
changes in the work place and changes in how are treating state
employees and lot of work done on the bill. We had two good amendments I
think would have improved the bill. Certainly would have made it so that
I can support it. Without those amendments I think we have some more
work that needs to be done on the bill. It will be going to the senate
and in the present state I would be opposing the bill. So I would ask
you to vote no give some additional effort to be put in the bill.
Resolve the employee rights and also to resolve the question of cronyism
that might creep in to the bill by having these 1500 appointees. So I
would ask you to vote against the bill; and let us have some more time
to do more work on this.

[Speaker Changes]  This is amendment number ALR -10 D2, Rep Hurley moves
to amend the bill on page 15 Line 6 by deleting those lines and line 12
by deleting section 8.4 and substituting Section 8.3
[Speaker Changes] Thank you
[Speaker Changes] Rep Hurley is recognized to debate the amendment
[Speaker Changes] This portion of the amendment that I am putting
forward is take out section 8.3 which allows them to get in and
arbitrarily just change the department. This is unfair to the current
employees there. We understand re structuring and re-organization, but
we still feel that the state employees be given first priority in the
job. In the current way its done is that if a position is changed
limitedly or eliminated and that’s the way to treat an employee and they
can re structure and do something back. With this is written is written
that we don’t have to we don’t have to change our position. We can be
with you. Keep your job exactly where it is and hire somebody else in
that position. We need to very careful when we start to getting in to
the right power with the employees of the state government. So I put
forward this amendment. To take that piece out and go back to the
original wording of what the legislators have been doing and what the
current policy is.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Collins Please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] Speak about the amendment
[Speaker Changes] The gentlemen is recognized to debate on the amendment
[Speaker Changes] All this section does is trying to take out and say if
the new reduction through re-organization doesn’t work we continue to re
asses the same way we have the employees the same way we have it now
doesn’t create any new bogus reason for doing anything like that again
it would and there is no reason for this amendment and I would ask you
to defeat it.

negotiated, and I want to make sure that someone acknowledges all the
work that Representative Collins has done, as well as others, but
certainly Representative Collins has spearheaded this effort. He spent
hours and hours and hours probably never anticipated that he'd be coming
to general assembly this year and spending this much of his life in
chapter 126. But he's done a yeoman's job and I think he's produced a
bill. Yesterday we had well over 100 votes on this bill and I think
that's testament to the hard work and the willingness to negotiate that
he has put into it, and I would appreciate your support on the bill.

recommendation of the North Carolina association of chiefs of police to
extend the date for implementation of operating standards set by the
9/11 board, and to provide for study of the 9-1-1 service by the joint
legislative emergency management oversight committee. General assembly
of North Carolina enact. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Faircloth, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Speaker and members of the House. This bill concerns the 9-1-1
board which is under the chief information officer in the state
government and meets the set policy and funding and so forth for the
operation of the 911 system in the state. As you can well imagine by the
numbers 9-1-1, this is a very, very important service because it
connects virtually every emergency  management, or emergency
organization we have in the state together. Back about a year, year and
a half ago, there began to be some folks giving me calls and had some
concern about some issues about the 9-1-1 organization, the board, and
asked that we have some meetings, We did have some meetings and I found
that there were some divisions and concerns within the board membership.
primarily I was asked by the chiefs association, the police chiefs’
association, and by the sheriffs’ association, and by the county
commissioners’ group, to try to look into the operation of the board and
see if there was some revisions or perhaps some changes that might be,
or might help the organization. We did have some meetings, the meetings
did not resolve a lot of the questions that still remain, so I am
sending forth the particular bill to try to officially address those
concerns and, Mr. Speaker, I’d like to send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk
will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Faircloth moves to amend the bill on
page lines 25 and 26 by inserting between those lines. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. What this amendment does is to assure that the
sheriff, the representative on the board who is a serving sheriff, is
appointed at the recommendation of the North Carolina sheriffs’
association. This tracks what's done by other membership on the board,
this should not be controversial at all. It simply allows the sheriffs’
association to recommend the person who would be appointed. Also, this
amendment will delete the wording “joint legislative emergency
management oversight committee” from the lower part of the bill, and
I'll explain more in a minute, but it replaces that with “a legislative
research commission.” Now if I can go into the bill a little bit.

continues, can the gentle</p>

The reception center for calls, if someone hands him a rule that says
you have to always have two people in there, he can’t afford that. He
doesn’t have that many people.  Somebody else is telling him how to man
and run his operation.  We just want to take a look at that and see if
there’s some way that we might help the Sheriff’s out with that as well
as the Chiefs of Police. The third one is development of standards for
?? training and certification for telecommunicators.  All
telecommunicators should be trained and certified alike in the state of
North Carolina and they should be certified by the state of North
Carolina as are other types of public safety officers.  Fourth is
consideration for the next generation of 911 service.  In other words,
what’s evolving.  What’s coming along.   What’s going to be our charge
here in the General Assembly in the next few years, with aside how much
we have to spend and for what, with regards to 911 service.  And
finally, the 911 Fund, which involves a utilities and involves the
service through these centers to provide for 911 service.  We’d like to
have that looked at as well, not with the intention of changing or
anything, but just having so that the legislature understands what’s
involved with that.  This will become effective December the 1st, 2013.
I’d be glad to answer any questions and I ask you to support the bill.

[speaker changes]  Thank you Mrs. Chairman and fellow representatives.
House bill 465 amends term statue 464-6 by adding a new section.  I want
to caution you up from this is a law enforcement bill. I was contacted
by officers who experienced problems with a lack of jurisdiction when
dealing with firearms violations by undocumented aliens.  Under federal
law 18 USC 922 possession of a firearm by undocumented aliens is
illegal. It's a 10 year felony.  This bill is designed to give officers
an alternative to federal prosecution by giving them a state statute
which makes this possession illegal.  It is supported by the North
Carolina Sheriff's association.  Each of you should have a copy of that
letter on your desk. It did pass judiciary c with a favorable report.  I
commend the bill to you and at this time I have a small technical
amendment that I would like to send forward.

[speaker changes} Representative Mcneil moves to amend the bill Page 1

[speaker changes] Representative is recognized to debate the amendment.
[speaker changes]  Basically this is just a technical amendment
submitted by Representative Stam.  It basically just clarifies the
language, just a  little bit, to determine who is a U.S. citizen or
national and the definition of an undocumented alien.

The amendment passes we are back on the bill.  Representative
Baskerville  for what purpose does the Representative rise?
[speaker changes] to debate the bill.
[speaker changes]  You are recognized to debate the bill.
[speaker changes] Thank you Madame Speaker.  I rise in opposition to the
bill and I'll explain to you a couple of the reasons why.  A large
majority of the undocumented folks that are here in our state do not
have access to traditional banking institutions, in part because some of
the moves we have made here in the legislature which disallow the only
form of ID that they have from being accepted at banks, from being
accepted at DMV, from being accepted in a wide variety of arenas. So
these undocumented folks don't have bank accounts so they have to carry
cash around.  They carry cash aroundon their person they have cash
stuffed in their cars, they have cash in their homes.  Criminals know
that ya'll. Criminals target these individuals because they know that
they have cash in their homes.  This is a fact.  They are victims of
crimes way at a much higher percentage than anyone else. So I can not
understand the policy or the basis behind making the mere possession of
firearms, something they can use to defend their homes, to defend their
families a felony.  Particularly when it is already a federal offense.
Particularly when they can already be prosecuted under that federal
crime.  I can understand if we say that undocumented folks using that
firearm in the commission of a crime, using that fire arm in the
commission of a felony, but just by mere possession of the firearm I
don't think we need to add another criminal offense to cover that.  The
constitution says the people have the right to bear arms.  Now listening
to a lot of these debates over the second amendment, I thought that</p>

that was in the right that was instilled by legislative and all right
there came down from judges, but that was something that you have a
right to
if they're not possessing the palms and committing crimes. I don't think
that I'm hoping that that should be illegal. I think that's a bad public
policy decision. and so, by reason of the vote. no thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
for the latest State Department become available members recognized to
speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you, Madame Speaker in all this bill presents a circumstance of
catch twenty two of me being a little caught carrying NRA member. I
support gun ownership and most of us in the chamber. a lot of us in the
chamber for good ownership now wish they had to hope that you have good
luck places me in a quandary. what do I do I recognize that undocumented
aliens. not a wise idea to allow them to have guns in their intent is to
commit crime, but it may otherwise all got in the law. all I working for
us and needless harm because it will work for what I'm sure that the
employee was know that they are undocumented, though I don't know if we
could about his personal law of civil laws. they broken on multiple
fronts. but in any rate, if you are working for us. they have a right to
protect the early that's a human right to predict the only do you
already does not want to go. the meters. want to vote yes, and did not
befall the right to have the old level about no and faith. my next
opponent who will say yeah he was illegal aliens. I haven't done. I have
problem is that with the fact that one of the representatives W Brawley
police take a purpose, I wondered if represented Baskerville with you
for question everything.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
asking you, you certainly become annealed fight
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
your representative. I noticed that you invited noted on the amend
certain firearms laws one nine thirty seven, which would've expanded the
places where law-abiding citizens who qualify for concealed carry could
legally carry their firearms to protect themselves from criminals and
today you spoken in favour of illegal aliens being able to possess
firearms because they have to carry cash, and I'm assuming while they're
carrying cash. they would have to be carrying a firearm to protect it.
my question surgery, you propose that ilk. undocumented aliens have
greater firearms rights than law-abiding citizens with concealed carry
notes are representative, Ramsey, please state your purpose as
represented by the request of rep to ask a value you. yes, yes, the
gelding yields a represent Baskerville that was mentioned earlier, this
is a federal crime. so if it's a federal crime. what is the harm of
making this a stay crime sets of we are a have a federal law on the
books
will him he ought to him program and I can see both that are convicted
under that federal statute of to be convicted of and be punished much
more severely than a class spelling here know, I think this actually is
taken away the discretion of the federal authorities who have way more
power to really get to the bottom of this and prosecute these crimes. I
think that's taken away their mom,authority and discretion clean at
this. is this, here is the lowest class family that we have here on the
books. most of these notes are not currently incarcerated. they will be
eligible to take active active cynicism. I think that's the reason that
we shouldn't do it because it is already federal crime. allow the
federal prosecutors to bring all of them on live there just is today on
this and not let</p>

attorney, I loved it when I can call in the feds to help me prosecute
these big time drug cases because the feds have way more things at their
disposal to prosecute the crimes than assistant district attorneys, than
district attorneys do. That’s why I hope that answers your question,
Representative Ramsey, and I’m not – [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the gentleman
wishing to debate the bill or the answer the question? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman’s recognized to debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m in no way… Thank you, Madam Speaker. I’m
in no way suggesting, Representative Brawley, that folks born here have
more constitutional rights or have less constitutional rights than
people that are not born here. All I’m doing is reading the Constitution
here that says people have the right to bear arms. That’s the United
States Constitution. That’s the North Carolina Constitution. It says
“people” have the right to bear arms. It doesn’t say “North Carolina
citizens”, doesn’t say “people that are born here”, doesn’t say “people
that are here legally”, doesn’t say “people that are here working
legally”. It says “people”, and we have not… the United States Supreme
Court has not come down with a decision that said undocumented folks
don’t have a right to bear arms. That has not happened. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative McNeill, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the bill a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a second time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I just want to point out that there is already a federal law,
and I understand that it is already a ten-year crime. Also if it’s a
state law, I think you would probably rather if an undocumented alien
were arrested for this crime, I think you would rather that they get
taken to state court than federal court, since this is a Class I felony,
and if they have a clean record, they could get community punishment. I
think it’s a good bill. I understand his point… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam
Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] … but… [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose
does the member from… Representative Brawley wish to speak? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To ask Representative McNeill a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s been commented on in being a
federal crime already and this being a state law; do we have more state
law enforcement officers in North Carolina or more federal law
enforcement officers in North Carolina? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a
whole lot more state law enforcement officers than we do federal
officers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative McNeill would yield
for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeill, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The member yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative McNeill. I have a question
about in the bill lines 15 and 16 – page 1, lines 15 and 16, where it
reads “Upon a determination that probable cause exists to believe that a
firearm…” etcetera, etcetera. How would we determine probable cause?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, that’s the language that is in all the statutes
dealing with the seizure of guns. It was just adopted out of the other
statutes. Same language. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. Does the gentleman yield for a follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In this particular bill however, you’re asking law
enforcement to have probable cause that a person who is undocumented is
possessing a firearm, and I’m wondering basically how does a law
enforcement officer guess or have probably cause unless it’s a… It seems
to me it could be an issue of ethnic profiling; that is to say an
officer looks at me and decides I don’t look like somebody who would
illegally have a firearm if this were law, but other people might. So
how would you deal with the issue of ethnic profiling as it plays itself
out in this bill, law enforcement having probable cause to believe this
is an undocumented person? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, I would imagine if
there’s an officer out there on his beat and he stops a vehicle that has
a person in it, he’s going to have to have probably cause first of all
to stop that person, and I understand that that’s basically what
existing law is, and if during the cause of his meeting with that
person, talking with that person, asking them questions, asking him for
his driver’s license, any other documentation which he has a right to
ask for</p>

I suppose if he would, at some point in that, after he had enough
evidence, he would come to the conclusion of where that person was a
document alien or not. At that point, if that person had a firearm in
their possession, then he would, I believe, have probably cause at that
point to seize the weapon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. To speak very briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The member is recognized to speak very briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Members of the House, as I suggested in my query to
Representative McNeill, I think this bill has a real danger of allowing
legalizing ethnic profiling because in this particular case, the easiest
way to have probable cause is to look at someone’s skin tone and I think
everyone here knows what I’m talking about. I think for that reason,
notwithstanding it’s already a federal law, I think this bill, using the
language that we are, needs to be opposed because I think we all should
oppose to ethnic profiling. Thank you, members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, please state your purpose. .
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Baskerville would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Baskerville, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The member yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Baskerville, is it your opinion and other opponents of
this bill’s opinion that anybody in the world today, on Wednesday, who
can somehow get on an airplane, come to the United States, in
contravention of our laws, has a second amendment right to bear here in
the United States?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I’m not going to speak for anyone else that’s opposed to the bill,
just for myself. I will say that the United States Supreme Court took up
the issue of the second amendment with the Heller case and they did not
say that this right did not apply to undocumented folks. That’s what I’m
saying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you,ma’am. Just wanted to…
It’s THE people. It doesn’t say the right of people in general to keep
and bear arms, it says THE people, meaning specifically in the United
States Constitution, the American people, the American citizens, and I
would say in the North Carolina it refers specifically to North Carolina
citizens. Second point I would address as to this idea of an
undocumented person who has not committed a crime has a right to carry a
gun. If I go into a bank and I, some of the lawyers here can correct me
if I’m wrong, but I think if I go into a bank and hand a teller a note
that says, empty out the drawer...Thank you Mr. Speaker….and give me all
the money, I’ve already committed a crime. If I happened to be found to
have a gun as well, I believe that adds to the charges, other than just
trying to commit robbery. So I would say in the case that we’re talking
about here, an undocumented here has already committed a crime by being
here illegally and it would be the same thing, a gun just adds to the
crime. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you,Mr. Speaker, I’ll be brief. Had a discussion with some of my
fellow legislators over here about whether or not you’ve committed a
crime because you’ve committed an act that someone would think would
constitute a crime without going through the judicial system. I think
the distinction that this bill doesn’t refer to someone in commission of
a crime, but just refers to someone in possession of a firearm who does
not have current authorization. I know that the majority or greater than
one half of those individuals in the United States, from foreign, who do
not have current status, came here legally. The didn’t come on a plane
illegally. The majority came here legally and have process pending or
appeals or whatever, so I think we should be careful about lumping
everyone into that category. So, again, the big distinction, this is not
someone in the commission of a crime, and many instances these would be
persons who came here legally and are working and participating in our
economy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman, we had a great
discussion on this bill, 714 on Monday in Judiciary B, wanna briefly
describe the bill and then I wanna send forth an amendment, a clarifying
amendment. In short what the bill does is that, considering different
abandoned firearms, whether they have been received by law enforcement
as unclaimed firearms or if they've been seized through criminal
activities, things like that. What it does is that it eliminates the
option of being able to destroy a fully functioning and lawful firearm.
What it does is that it would require a number of things, a number of
options. The firearm could be transferred to law enforcement agency for
official use, it can be sold at public auction to federal firearm
liscenced holders. It also can be maintained by law enforcement for
training or experimental purposes. It can be transferred to a museum or
historical society. At this point I would like to send forth an
amendment.
The lady is recognized to send forth an amendment, the clerk will read.
Representative Schaffer moves to amend the bill on page two lines 27
through 35 by rewriting those lines to read.
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
This is a very simple amendment and was requested by our police chiefs
just to make sure that they could continue the trade-in scenario</p>

&lt;h3&gt;by saying, and demanding, who can and can't be in the group,
which I think generally I agree with. And so I'm asking that we put back
in the language that Representative Jones originally had in the bill and
make sure that these sections are consistent with federal and state law.
We just had an argument or debate on the floor where we talked about
it's no harm in having a secondary bill that says you're consistent with
the law and so I would ask for adoption of the amendment based on what
happened in education and with the bill drafters originally created.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I would like to oppose the amendment, and ask you to vote red, and
here's why. You could add this language to every single bill that you
present, to the extent allowed by state and federal law. Because, first
of all, the supremacy clause, we are subject to federal law and so that
adds nothing. Now, to the extent allowed by state law means that it
would change the rules of construction of statutes. So when statutes are
clear, there's no construction, you just explain them. But when statutes
conflict or are unclear that there are different rules of construction.
And so, for example the most recent statutes controls over the or former
statute, the more specific controls over the more general. And there are
8 or 9 rules of construction like that. But by putting this to the
extent allowed by state law, it means that other state laws would trump
this. Now, the second you want, is there some other law that you want to
trump it. And sometimes I'll see in, even some of my own bills, but I
don't like it and I see a lot of other bills notwithstanding, but in the
other section of law, you ever seen that in a bill? And that's just lazy
drafting because if you wanted to trump some other statute, tell me what
it is. So I don't have to look through the entire statutes of North
Carolina which are twenty chapters, twenty volumes, to figure out what
you're talking about. But by putting this back in it makes this statute
less usable for a student group. Because that student group may say
&quot;OK, we've got this House Bill whatever it is, 730 I can't read it
up there 735, and this is what it says.&quot; But if you put this
amendment in then they either have to go to a lawyer or search on Google
for every federal law there is to see if there's something else keeping
them from doing this. So, I would suggest you defeat the amendment. Yes.
It's still subject to federal law, this is not an attempt at
nullification and I don't know of any federal law that this would
violate. But you don't want to say it and put that in this bill anymore
than you would want me sticking it on every bill you, that you, I'm not
threatening to do it, believe me I'm not going to do it because it's not
a good idea. But would you want me to put this as the predicate for
every bill you introduce? No. Vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to weigh in since I am the primary
sponsor of the bill and I think the first thing I'm going to tell you is
vote your conscience, but I do want to tell you that this language
indeed was originally in the bill and it was in the Senate bill that
passed. I think that Representative Stam makes a good point in that
technically I think it is unnecessary, I mean, any bill that we pass
obviously any law that we pass is should go without saying is subject to
other state and federal law. I think that when the bill was drafted that
the language was put in there perhaps to reinforce that, perhaps even
for a couple of reasons. I will tell you that myself and some of the
other bill sponsors did not vote in Committee to take the language out.
It seemed to provide a little bit of comfort and reassurance to perhaps
some of the members that were maybe concerned that because we were
talking about a college environment where there may be students from
other cultures, other nations, whatever, that may be wanting to bring in
some of their own cultural laws or whatever that maybe that would
reinforce it. However, with that said, to this point, I do think it is
implicit that whether or not you pass this amendment, it is subject to
state and federal law. So, I probably, myself, will not vote for the
amendment on the floor-

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That objection, so ordered, Representative Glazier is recognized to
explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker; thank you, members. This second amendment
relates to my biggest issue with the bill which was prior to what we
just went through, which was 1A and let me explain why. If you read
section 1A - and it's the same language in 2A, and I talked with
Representative Jones briefly about this last night - I don't have a
problem and I agree with Representative Jones that when a constituent
institution recognizes a group the group ought to have access to
facilities just like any other group and access to any other program the
groups have, and once the other Universities pass that Rubicon they
don't get to sort of pick and choose who gets a room. But I think there
is a difference when it comes to funding. I think Universities have
abilities and they make decisions all the time about - they get a
hundred thousand dollars for student activities, this group gets student
funds, this group doesn't. Often it's the student activities group
that's making that. Quoting one of my favorite films, 'My Cousin Vinny,'
In my yout' I was a member of a student activities fund and we voted yes
or no on activities funds. By what I see - and I think Representative
Jones and I had that conversation - and I don't think it was the intent
of the sponsors to say just because you're recognized you must
automatically get funds. But I read section 1A where it says no
constituent institution that grants recognition shall deny the student
organization access to funding. I think it's easy enough to make the
argument - and as a lawyer we can make them on either side - I think
it's easy enough to make the argument that that means you have equal
access to the funding, not access or opportunity but access to it, and I
don't think that's the intent here. So what this amendment does is keep
the core of section 1A and says, again consistent with law, no
institution can deny recognition or deny a student group that they
recognize access to programs and facilities but it takes out the word
funding so that there is not a specific suggestion that just because
they're recognized they ought to get money. And for that reason is why
the amendment exists, and let me give you two examples of why I'm
concerned. Let's assume, because this includes not just religious groups
but political groups, so let's assume that a political group 'The Aryan
Nation Group of</p>

Chapel Hill wants to be recognized because I think the university has a
non-discriminatory obligation to recognize if they're gonna recognize
one political club they gotta recognize the others, and they can't pick
and choose based on whether they agree or disagree with the message. So
they consistent with this bill recognize the club and they give them a
room, and consistent with section two of the bill, the Aryan nation can
say well the only people who can join this - the people who can't, we're
not gonna let any Jews or any blacks in this club. And section 2B
technically allows that in my opinion, 1B and 2B. Well, I don't think
the university has to then go the next step and say you also have equal
access to funding.
I think the university can apply its non-discriminatory policy and say
we've recognized the club, you can meet, we're not gonna censor your
words but we are not gonna fund your words either, and that's what this
takes out. And if you don't take it out then the Aryan nation has access
to that student funding just like anything else, and that I'm not even
gonna go to another example because that's my concern. I think the
universities have to maintain some control over involvement and
supporting their non-discriminatory policies and not funding groups that
do discriminate, consistent with what we put in section 1B which is that
they can discriminate in their membership. And so I would really
encourage us to support this amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Farmer-Butterfield if the lady is
recognized to make a request to he chair then she can make it from
there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I wanted to change my vote on
house bill 465 to yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady will be recorded as having voted aye on house
bill 465 and the lady recognized is the use of her get out of jail card.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr Speaker. And ladies and gentleman of the
house I'm gonna ask you to oppose this amendment and this is why. Now
representative Glazier, and I appreciate his concerns and quite honestly
when this bill was debated in committee we heard a lot of rather
farfetched examples of what student clubs could be recognized and I
appreciate that, but he didn't go on to read the rest of that sentence.
And there is dependent clause at the of that that says on the basis of
the organizations exercise of its rights pursuant to subsection B of
this section. So frankly what we're gonna say here is we pass this
amendment is that we're still gonna discriminate against certain clubs.
We're gonna say if the university likes you, if the university
leadership likes you and your mission and so forth well we'll give you
funding, but if we don't we won't. Now there's nothing in this bill that
mandates funding to anybody, that mandates funding to any club, and
there are other reasons why if the university is choosing to fun certain
clubs it can continue to do so. This does not prohibit that whatsoever.
What it does say is that the university cannot choose, or the community
college cannot choose to provide funding to one versus funding to the
other simply because they're exercising their first amendment rights. I
would think quite honestly in one of them, I'm not gonna address all
the...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones please state your purpose. Oh,
I'm sorry, representative Brandon please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the gentleman will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized, or does the gentleman
yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir I will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I heard you go around about all the way in a complete
circle and so my question to you is please explain to me if I had an
organization, you just said they can exclude one and then exclude
another, so what is the difference? Tell me why a university should have
to allow an Aryan nation and tell me why that's not the case? Tell me
why if you just said that they cannot exclude one if they're gonna
exclude the other or they have to take both then where is the discretion
at and where is the place that the Aryan nation group says, hey you
can't exclude me? And where do we draw then line? I want you to please
[??] that because I'm very confused. Because you went from one place all
the way to a complete circle and I just want you to explain to me where
is it that the example that Representative Glazier has will not happen?
Because you just stated that it will happen.

And I’m afraid that my very good friend, the amendment sponsor, has kind
of led us on this path because I believe that he has missed the last
dependent clause like representative Jones said. Notice that the last
line in the original bill of “A” in each section: “On the basis of the
organizations exercise of its rights pursuant to subsection B of this
section.”  Subsection B says an organization may do exactly what
representative Jones went through very quickly with you, but I’m going
to go more slowly and more detailed because I’m afraid you’ve missed
something.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] the things in “B” say, “determine that only persons
professing the faith and mission of the group, and comporting themselves
with, can be leaders.” It does not say membership. We’re not getting
into an all-comer’s membership issue here.  It says that a group can
determine that only people following that mission or faith can be
leaders, number one; number two, order their internal affairs by some
written doctrine; and number three, resolve organization internal
disputes.  That is what the last clause in “A” means. Therefore, “A”
says, if a university, or institution, recognize a student
organizations, they cannot deny the funding, the privileges, etc., to
another student organization based on the three things I just talked
about. I can deny it for some other reason perhaps, but not based on
those three things. Having leaders that profess the same mission and
faith, ordering their internal affairs, and dealing with internal
disputes. Those are the only three things that organization that keep it
from being discriminated against. Does that help?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In my follow up…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I think it does help in the terms where I think that
you guys think where it’s at. What I’m saying is that there is no way
that - there are a lot of support organizations that claim religious. I
mean the guy that blew up the Oklahoma City bombing- he thought he was a
Christian too. And he could go start a group based off of that, and get
a whole bunch of people behind him and he could say this is religious
and keep that. I think you’re in dicey waters. I don’t think you can
explain it the way you explained it because you have it so broad.
Anybody can claim religion. Everything can be religious. You have
Muslims that are religious. You have Christians that are religious. You
have radicals on both ends.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Agreed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So by the language of this bill you are taking away
from the university to be able to determine what their integrity should
look like. And I don’t think that’s- I just have a question about that.
I see what you’re saying. My question to you is: Do you feel like this
can be misinterpreted? And do you think that there are other people that
could be, say that they are religious groups or whatever the three
reasons that you just said and not really have that intention and lock
up the school with some sort of lawsuit and say, “hey, according to this
law, I am religious and you have to provide me with the same things you
did the other people.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker to the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Once again, Representative Brandon, it is
not the issue of saying, “our club is religious, you can’t do anything
to us.” What this bill says is: If you do these three things, you
determine that only people professing your faith or mission can be
leaders; you have your own internal affairs organized by your own
written doctrines, and you ??

twelve. nearby was a hundred and thirteen for the rail against. in March
of this year. just a few weeks again. Tennessee also passed legislation
addressing the issue in a similar manner of the act of ninety four yes
and one nine primary reason for objecting to this type of publication is
where beginning to follow Congress where exempting ourselves from laws
that we asked the private sector too bey when we pass laws and taxes and
regulations, we hear the private sector yell it's too expensive. our
response is that your cost of doing business will members are cost of
doing business in public notifications to our citizens is a cost that we
should incur. it's a war built on the calendar today dealing with the
same issue in the arguments of the same were setting a precedent that is
not good, and policies for students. that's what our citizens, we won't
gain or to exempt itself from notifications. what's next,
transportation, education, commerce, are citizens that have to bookmark
every website for every department in every division in government and
check it every day to figure out what were up to down here. this
illustrates more clearly than any other argument the direction for this
legislation is to keep the current requirements with cost adjustment and
expanded to reach out to those that want electronic notification not
force all citizens. Jordan limited means of communication that they may
not have access to, or ability to use has to support the amendment

had been reading these newspapers back here, but I've got a couple of
this type apex is the probably the town that is handle electronic notice
as long as her longer than others, and we say twenty or thirty thousand
a year for doing it. I'm looking here at the Apex Herald or raw Thursday

notices

used to about seven or eight years ago and that's it. that's one of the
problems on the other hand, the Fuquay independent
in a town that doesn't electronic but would like to do it, as about one
and three quarters pages of legal notices the apex paper has just as
much business there, competing on price publisher to publish a notice
was from Raleigh, but most of it is legal. ads by lawyers and about
lawsuits, and I say this to say that we were the only real argument
against the underlying bill. but this bill of the other two on the
calendar is we need to take tax money and subsidize the newspapers we go
at part of our mission against newspapers by the hyper link that Carol
has been as kind to me in my political career as any newspaper in the. I
have no idea. we have no problems but we don't advertise their and they
have never objected to not publishing of notices of the town. if you
wish the underlying bill, you'll see that anybody who wants to get a
notice from the inner will get something a lot better than a notice in
the paper and what they get. if they ask for it. isn't e-mail. they
don't have to go to the website they get an e-mail of the notice that
they can actually read and print out instead of just hoping they say it
in the Raleigh news Observer, I ask you to please the big amendment</p>

The sponsor of the amendment is incorrect ?? ?? stand.  This isn't any

to get noticed.  The amendment will eliminate all the cost savings that
we have in the bill.  It completely eliminates the pilot program.  The
department is trying to get more involvement than the notices that are
put in papers.  Their website is up 24 hours 7 days a week.  What we're
trying to do is through a pilot figure out if there is a better way to
do notice.  There are only 4 provisions of all the notices that ?? gives
there's only 4 of them left. And we're just looking to have an
appropriate pilot.

Quote unquote pile up of posting notice in newspapers, well about this
time last year my niece died and I was to be the executor of her estate.
 I was required  to post a notice to creditors in the newspaper of
highest circulation in my area, so when Representative Avila makes the
point that we're in this quote unquote pileup we are treating ?? as one
entity but we're treating our individual citizens as another entity now
if you want to hear my next speech Mr speaker just call some of these
other electronic notice bills and you'll get the pleasure of that too.
Thank you very much, I do support this amendment. SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Davis please state your purpose  SPEAKER CHANGES: Speak
on the amendment. SPEAKER CHANGES The gentlemen is recognized to debate
the amendment. SPEAKER CHANGES  Thank you Mr Speaker and members of the
house I was one of the four original primary sponsors of house bill 723
which is the subject of this amendment and this amendment is not only
important to the bill we have under consideration but it also impacts
house bill 504 and senate bill 287 that we have not taken up yet that
are on page one of the agenda. I would just like to say that this
amendment does have the endorsement of the North Carolina press
association and I want to do something that I will probably never do
again and I'd like to read something from my local newspaper, The ??
Star news in an editorial,and it says as many people as the government
excuse me, as many people as the government web site on state laws
requiring public notices in the first place is to ensure that the public
has easy broad access to the information pertaining to the conduct of
the people's business. Local governments may like to think that notice
on their website is the same as notice in a well read newspaper, it
isn't the result would be less access for the public the general ??
should leave the public notice requirement in place and consider house
bill 723 which would expand the reach of public notices encouraging even
more people to participate in their democracy.  And Mr Speaker and
members of the house I think this is an excellent point,because as you
know not everybody gets a newspaper.  Well if you don't get a newspaper
how you going to read any notices that might be in it. As everyone knows
not everybody has a computer. If you don't have a computer how you going
to be able to have access to anything that might be sent out that way.
So at least with this amendment I see it as a good compromise to be more
transparent and more encompassing for the people that live in the state,
allowing those who read the newspaper to have access to the newspaper,
and those who have computers can have access through the computers.  And
for me its a win win and ask you to please support the amendment,thank
you. SPEAKER CHANGES: Members this bill is going to be displaced the
chair anticipates a lengthy debate later on this evening and we will
carry it on at that time house bill 755 the clerk will read, I'm sorry
the clerk stands corrected house bill 816 the clerk will read and the
chair does intend to allow all debate on this bill to continue as late
as is necessary this evening.  SPEAKER CHANGES: ??? house bill 816 the
bill has been titled and act to authorize tobacco growers to assess
themselves to promote the interest of tobacco growers general ?? of
North Carolina enact. SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Daughtry please
state your purpose.  SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you, I want to speak on the
bill.  SPEAKER CHANGES: The gentlemen is recognized to debate the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES: This is Representative Langdon's bill and its a bill
that the tobacco growers association is an association that has been in
business for many years, this bill would allow the tobacco growers who
are members of that association to vote to assess themselves to take the
money that they collect from the assessment to promote their product.
Other commodities like sweet potatoes have done that very successfully,
and if two thirds of the tobacco growers choose to vote for this
assessment, then the money would be used to promote tobacco, which has
been the fabric of this state both growing, processing, and
manufacturing.  I hope you will support the bill, I don't know of
anybody whose opposed to it.</p>

The House will be at ease.
Ladies and gentleman, we have a procedural question. A good question
raised by Representative Luebke that we're addressing with the Finance
Chair. We're going to skip this bill and go to House Bill 918. The Clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee Substitute for House Bill 918, a bill to be
entitled An Act to Alter the Reporting Schedule for Independent
Expenditures and Electioneering Communications Through Providing
Information in a Timely Fashion. General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of the
House. House Bill 918 provides a practical reporting schedule and timely
disclosure for outside groups spending money to affect North Carolina
elections. The current reporting schedule is not meaningful in that it
requires disclosure of some spending only after the election has
occurred.
This bill satisfies the public's need for timely disclosure without
placing unnecessary burdens on those trying to comply with our laws. I
know this bill has been discussed earlier this week. I know that there
are some folks with some concerns on this bill, so Mr. Speaker, just so
everyone knows, it is my intent should the House pass this bill on its
second reading, I will ask that the third be held until tomorrow. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Davis, please state your purpose.
Representative Brody, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to debate the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to stand in opposition to the bill and Monday
when we went through it I did also stand in opposition and the Speaker
displaced it. What I want to first emphasis is that this bill is about
reporting. It's not about voting rights, it's not about candidates. It's
strictly about reporting certain reports that are looking, State Board
of Elections wants to do.
Basically, what I want to start out with is just say just how much time
and how much money do we as a State need to spend in order to assure our
citizens are getting a fair election? Going beyond that, how much money
do we have to spend or others have to spend to be mandated by the State
to also ensure our citizens fair elections? Currently, we spend a lot of
money to do that and know I believe that we have reached a point where
we have to start looking at it.
I've two issues that I believe are enough to end this bill. First of
all, there are four new reports to be filed and some are recurring
reports, meaning you have to file the same report multiple times.
Second, it creates a whole new section, Section 2, and that wasn't in
existence before, which also creates a whole bunch of new reports.
There's no necessity for these because these have not been a problem
before and there's nothing to solve. The State Board of Elections just
plain wants them.
The other issue that concerns me, and I hope it concerns everyone, is on
Section 1, Item No. 5, it's located on line 28, beginning on line 28 on
page 1. If you remember on Monday, I had asked Representative Debra Ross
a question and a couple times about what happens if somebody, an
organization, a large organization decides to play a part and a role and
they literally have a lot of contributors. I asked her twice and, of
course, the reason why I suspect she didn't know the answer at...</p>

<p id="125:00">
And I was looking for, because even the State Board of Elections doesn't
know the answer to this question. Because I called them and I asked
Representative Ross twice. I had asked more than that to finally get the
answer. And the answer, what they said was, that it is possible that the
State Board of Elections could actually demand literally millions of
people that have contributed. Now I want to go a little bit further
because some may say that there may be court decisions based on that
wouldn't allow that. And I don't know that. But Representative Louis was
kind enough to send me information about this subject. And basically the
people decide if we need these reports from these individuals or not.
Is a decision by the State Board of Elections. They can literally, at
one time, in one fast motion, declare that every single person that ever
has given some money to support a political campaign has to be
identified. And that can run into, I'd say, literally millions.
Especially if you're dealing with stuff like labor unions, the NRA, and
any other organization that one might want to address. So this is
extremely serious. Now it's origin is from a previous language. What the
problem we have it's been prewritten. Every time you rewrite something,
it's subject to another interpretation. I thought the bill, well, I
decided to try amend this and it just plain got too complicated. I don't
know what ?? but I like to, when I go through this, I look at what I
call octopus statue.
Which means that you started in one spot, and before you know it, you're
scattered all over the statue. And there's no real way address one issue
unless you address a whole bunch. So I decided to just to just oppose
the bill. I know that if we will vote against this bill we will defeat
the ?? amendment that was on Monday. But I feel like that's worth, that
basically in reality this is unnecessary legislation seeking an
imaginary problem. What we should do before adding additional burdens is
to review what we have so far and decide if what we have now is
appropriate and enough. More legislation does not always make things
better. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam. Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak a second time on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a second time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I support the bill. If you look at page 2, lines 7
and 8, you'll see that the principle objection that Representative Brody
has is already in the underlined law. So that his point would not be
furthered by defeating the bill. Secondly, what the bill does is raise
some thresholds to keep people making small contributions, independent
expenditures out of the system. So I encourage you to support the bill.
It was worked on by the election law committee in a very thorough way
and I think it does good things.
By the way, I've litigated this exact question all the way to the US
Supreme court and back. And don't want to get that into that thick of it
again. Thanks. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Debra Ross, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
very much Mr. Speaker. And I wasn't going to rise until Representative
Brody mentioned my answers to him and I just wanted to let the body know
that Representative Stam is 100% correct. The part that he's concerned
about is something that is existing law.
But the other thing that you need to know is with Representative Stam's
amendment that raised the threshold for even doing the first report to a
thousand dollars, there will be fewer groups that have to report under
this law. So if you reject the bill, you're going to say that more
groups have to report rather than fewer. So Representative Stam raised
the threshold to a...</p>

something, so that's yes they do have the file under the current loan
lenders simply raises the amount, but depends how much money they raise
the pay raise five hundred dollars, they would have to file under the

question because it depends on the facts, but it's less likely to have

I guess to bring us back to where I think I started was I object to Bill
because it adds additional reports that I don't feel are necessary and I
can point them ?? in particular. The other point about what's causing a
lot of concern is the fact that the language was changed from the
original language and expanded. When you change and expand language, you
have the ability for somebody, whether it be a court or even the State
Board of Elections,  to negate the previous and adopt some new
regulations. Just so you know, the State Board of Elections has the
authority to require virtually anything they want by this bill from
anybody they want. All they have to do is say so. Thank you.

Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[speaker changes]
To see if Representative Lewis will yield for a question.
[speaker changes]
Representative Lewis, does the gentleman yield?
[speaker changes]
I do Mr. Speaker.
[speaker changes]
Representative Lewis, this bill was relatively uncontroversial in
committee. Have you received any opposition or anybody with concerns.
Any groups that might be covered with this -- by this bill that have
objected in any way to it since this bill came into committee and to the
floor?
[speaker changes]
Thank you for that Representative Blust. If I may answer a little more
completely to what you ask. The short answer is no. I have great respect
for the concerns that have been expressed on the floor here today. This
is a tremendously complicated area of the law. I would point out to you
Representative Blust and to anyone else interested that on page 1
starting on line 28, the wording of the bill says that the names and
addresses to all entities that donated to further an independent
expenditure in this state should be sent forth. There have been a couple
of national groups and even state groups that have been mentioned here
today. This would require no more of them than they are currently
required to do. And so, I realize that it's a confusing area of the law
and the law continues to change. The courts have helped us with that.
They continue to change the law too but except for the very gracious and
respectful opposition that has been expressed on the floor, I'm not
aware that this bill is opposed.
[speaker changes]

Representative Lewis, does the gentleman yield?
[speaker changes]
yes, sir.
[speaker changes]

[speaker changes]
Thank  you Mr. Speaker. I needed clarification of a point. On page 1
where it says on line 14, in the manner prescribed by the state board of
elections, period. In the previous statute. When they're expanding and
saying it shall contain all of the following. Is there anything new in
there that hasn't already been prescribed or already been followed in
the information that the state board of election has required?
[speaker changes]
Thank you for that inquiry. The short answer is: I don't know. The
expanded answer would be, if none of those words were there, the state
board could actually require more than what these words say they can
require. So, these words actually limit and define what the state board
can do. Thank you ma'am.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is a reminder that this amendment adds two
parts to 1A and 1B. It would put the beginning part consistent with
federal and state law and the second is to take out the issue of funding
but allow the rest of the bill to retain. Just in response to
Representative Jordan’s comment, and I appreciate my colleague’s
comment, but I don’t think it matters that last clause. Here’s why I
don’t think it matters, and why I still think the amendment is
critically important. Because it says in 1A, you can’t deny funding on
the basis of the organizations exercise of its rights under subsection
B. As I understood Representative Jordan’s argument, that was that you
are limited in that subsection to dealing with only people who profess
faith or mission of the group or internal affairs issues or resolving
organization’s disputes, using my Aryan nation example. It may not be
that they could borrow or impose the funding restriction based on
whether they allow Jews or blacks in, but assume, instead, under the
theory, that what the mission of the group is is to deport all blacks
and Jews. We’re not basing it, then, on their race or their religion or
their ethnicity or their origin or anything. We’re basing it on mission.
The distinction Representative Jordan makes is a distinction without a
difference because you can discriminate in multiple ways and one is just
as easily through the mission as it is through the general membership.
While I understand your point, I don’t think it makes any difference and
that’s still the reason I believe in the amendment. That’s a short
debate on it and I’d ask members to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, please state your purpose.

Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to make sure I was properly

Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To ask the bill’s sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, we had a lot of discussion on this bill in
committee. I had some concerns, I still do. I just want you to clarify
for me on the part of the bill line 22 where it talks about the
organization resolving disputes. I guess, the question I have is how
will the university or the college, how will their policy coincide with
this? Would the organizations dispute a situation overrule what the
university policy might be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams, I would just say that I think the resolution would
have to be in accordance with the law. In other words, they couldn’t
agree to resolve their dispute by by having a duel or something like
that, but, frankly, it would give the right and privilege to the student
group, in this case, to resolve its own dispute, handle its own internal
affairs rather than the university leadership doing that for them.</p>

<p id="155:00">
May I speak on the bill Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the
house I don't think there's anyone here whose been a more loyal
conscientious advocate for students in this general assembly or even in
the community, and I've said this many times that I've had 40 years of
service on a college campus. I've worked with thousands of students and
I know that many things can happen on a college campus. I've had the
privilege of even serving with students on disciplinary committees, and
it just seems to me that the way this bill is drafted that the
organization if whatever policies they have in terms of resolving
disputes would really overrule the university.
I have a concern about that because we're talking about young people who
get involved in many kinds of things, organizations that have been
scrutinized for various kinds of behaviors that have not necessarily
need positive. And so I just worry about what this kind of law would do
in terms of students really finalizing that process for disputes. And so
it's really not clear to  me, well it seems to be clear that the
organization would have rights beyond the university and I just think
for university campuses that this would really present a problem. I have
never been opposed to students rights, as a matter of fact I have always
believed that the students should have a vote on the Board of Governors
and I filed the bill many times here, and even have one out there now.
And so I have always believed in students having rights and I support
that, but I do think that the universities and the colleges ought to
have jurisdiction because other kinds of things that can happen that
would really create serious problems and probably some legal problems
for the universities as well. So I can't support the bill because of
that and I just think there's a lot of uncertainty here as to what could
happen on these campuses with these student organizations and I'm not
gonna support the bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate briefly the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you members and I'm going to be very brief, I
just wanted to supply some additional information and I think there was
a way to make this bill work but I think without the amendments it
doesn't. But I just want to let you know that I contacted NCSL earlier
today because Representative Jones was kind enough and we talked, and I
did look at the other four states that have passed the bill. There are
some states obviously that have a version pending and a couple who've
rejected it, but just to be very clear the bills that were passed in
Virginia, in Tennessee, in Idaho and in Arizona, the ones that I've seen
and I think there's one other state that I don't have, have different
language.
It is not the language that we have before us and Michelle Lu [SP] who
is the education specialist at NCSL made it very clear that she's not
seen many states at all enact legislation similar to this one. And so
the language is broader than the language in other states, and just to
let you know that I will be opposing the bill for all the reasons I've
argued and representative Adams argues, and I think this just avoids the
university's non-discriminatory policy and now doesn't allow - and now I
think is going to demand that we fund or create access to funding for
organizations of every stripe and I think that's just wrong. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Jordan would yield to a brief
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan does then gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm gonna try to ask a question that has a one word
answer to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're arguing with the [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll make an attempt. Is there anything in this
legislation that would prevent a university from determining that an
organization, that they feel is detrimental to the university or the
university body, they could deny funding facilities, access to
university resources based on their view that that organization was
detrimental to the interest of the university?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate?</p>
