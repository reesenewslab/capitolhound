Please take your seats and we will resume round two of the Senate Health
and Human Services appropriations sub-committee. This afternoon we're
going to be going through the changes to the provisions between the
house and the senate. And we'll follow the same procedures we did this
morning. We'll go through the entire document and then we will take
questions from the members. Miss Joyce Jones, I believe you're the first
one to present this afternoon. You can come forward. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]
Good afternoon Mr. Chair and members of the committee. I'm Joyce Jones
from Legislative Drafting, and I am going to be walking you through the
document that you should have in front of you. It is the special
provisions, just the items that are in controversy or that are different
as between the house and senate. This package does not include identical
provisions. I am going to begin in the division of central management. I
am actually going to start on what is numbered as page 271 in your
package. There is one special provision that precedes this one, but
within the division of central management. But, my colleague Lisa Wilkes
will cover that when she comes up to cover up her assigned areas. So,
right now, if you could turn with me to page 271. The first provision
that differs between senate and the house, funds for statewide for
health wide health information exchange. If you recall, this special
provision requires a division of central management to allocate
sufficient funds to the non-profit entity known as North Carolina Health
Information Exchange. This was to represent the state share for the
maximum amount of approved federal matching funds. Or allowable medicate
administrative costs related to the HIE network. These provisions are
the same except that if you look on page 72, you'll see that I have
starred subsections C. The house version added language to require NCHIE
to provide a detailed audited report to HHS oversight by March 1 of 15.
And the report is to give an explanation of use of state appropriations
received pursuant to this section, as well as its receipt in
expenditures of federal matching funds for cost related for the HIE
network. So, the next page we have a senate only provision. On Page 273.
This provision in the senate extended by two years the deadline for the
Department of Health and Human Services to implement system
modifications to the replacement MMIS, also known as NCTracks. In order
to allow contract entities like the LME NCOs, to perform medicate claim
adjudication within the NCTrack system. The house did not include this
special provision in their package. Instead, you'll see on page 274, the
house repealed last year's budget provision that required the department
to implement those system modifications. Turning to page 275, this is
the house only provision that follows money. It is technical in the
sense that it just revises the amount of prior year earned revenue that
may be used for replacement MMIS during the 14-15 fiscal year for
consistency with the money report. We have a similar house only
provision on page 276. Again, this is technical in nature as it confirms
with the money report. Just revises the amount of the prior year earned
revenue that can be used for NC fast in the 14-15 fiscal year. You turn
to page 277, this is the house only provision that follows money. Susan
Jacobs explained this a little bit earlier this morning. This is the
supplemental short term assistance for group homes. You may recall that
we had an identical provision in the budget last year. And, basically it
provides two million dollars of non-recurring funds to the secretary's
office for the 14-15 fiscal year to provide funds for one additional
year of assistance to group home residents who are determined and
eligible for Medicaid PCS. Honored after January 2013, due to some
Medicaid state plan changes in PCS eligibility. I'll just note for you
on page 278 that this section does expire on June 30th, 2015. We're
gonna flip over now to the division of aging in adult services. So if
you would, please turn with me in your</p>

Speaker: Package to page 296.Page 296 this is a provision on state
county special assistance both the senate and the house had provisions
addressing essay as we call it,however the senate version did
substantially more.The senate version follows the money and you'll see
the changes that are significant that are highlighted with stars.The
senate version eligibility for essays that are hundred percent ??
November 1st 2014, and you'll see that around like 18 to 24.The next
change in senate version starts in the line 28 and this change narrows
situation under which the version treatment on ?? facility.This is the
change in line 8 and line 28.Eliminates the provision allowing non
residence to qualify for spending ?? days in North Carolina resident as
a close resident relative.The next significant change in down in line 37
, 36 and 37 and this is the change that narrows situation under which a
person receiving treatment under state facility with mental contact can
qualify for ?? and that only the compact requires the state to continue
up personally ??.When you turn the page you see that the house version
to need it all of the state version and eligibility that makes a clear
technical change ?? law and there is no change to eligibility in the
house version.On the page 298 and also page 300 these are different
versions of same senate provision.The only difference if that the senate
and the house are marked on page 300 and page 301, I' ll just note that
and the house distinction is that it retains ??  by allowing for a
report a summary of this information and also by directing guardian to
explain the document diligence but unsuccessful attempt ?? this
information on page 301 you'll also see that start language that allows
the ?? to file ?? or by one ?? of confident witness.Page 302 is the only
house special provision ?? and adult services and developments of a
strategic state plan ?? they have 16 different issues related to this
disease.Page 303 is also house only provision  it requires the division
of aging and adult services to reinstate the voluntary development
program as service category under the ??.This also allows the counties
to use this programs to provide services to elder adults from these ??
Page 304 is the C D S A provision there are difference between the
senates and the house you'll note that on page 304, I have start the
significant parts of the provision.The senate version requires the
department to close for state operators of C D S A by January 1 2015 and
also to make eligibility requirement to change this program for the
14,15 ??.The house distinction if you turn to the over the next page on
page 305  to start the language to show difference the house versions
directs the departments to slow off options in order ti achieve the
reductions that set out in the budget.Page 306 is the senate only
provision it follows money.This is the ?? funding initiative we have
directing those funds ?? to counties only and again this only appeared
in senate provision.Page 307 and 308 this is the increasing fee over
well water testing.These two are identical over ?? on 308 i start the
news exception that appears in the house version that adds provision on
the report of public health on the ?? review commission option for
reducing or waving this fee.</p>

<p id="10:00">
Households with incomes at or below 300% of the Federal poverty level.
Page 309 is a Senate only special provision that follows money. This
transfers the On-Site Water Protection Branch currently in DPH to the
Division of Water Resources within deener. Page 313 is a Senate only
provision, it requires program evaluation to consider including in its
14-15 work plan a study on ways to improve North Carolina's medical
examiner system, with particular focus on death investigation policies
and procedures. Page 314 is a House only special provision dealing with
operational efficiencies for the office of the Chief Medical Examiner.
This provision changes the current method of appointment for medical
examiners. It also requires the Division of Public Health to study and
report to HHS Oversight on the adequacy of current fees paid by state,
the state and counties for death investigation and autopsies. And
subsection C also directs that a portion of the appropriations for this
office be used to establish an oversight system to achieve operational
efficiencies and improve quality assurance of death investigations. It
also requires the department develop and implement a uniform protocols
for conducting death investigations in accordance with established best
practices. Page 315 is a House only special provision, it extends by one
month the date that the department must submit its diabetes coordination
report, and this is just to make it consistent with the due date for
another similar report on chronic care coordination. Page 316 is a House
only special provision effective July 1, it allows the state to retain
the $400,000 that is currently appropriated for aid to counties for
local food and lodging programs. The state is required to use these
funds to operate the state elements of the food and lodging program, and
that would mostly be to cover costs related to food and lodging
regulation. Page 317 is a House only provision that follows money as
well. It transfers the summer food service program, and all the federal
funds received for this program, to the Department of Public Instruction
effective July 1, 2014. Page 318, these are special provisions related
to the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and
Substance Abuse Services. The first is traumatic brain injury funding.
This provision follows money, and if you turn to page 319, I've
underlined the only difference between these two provisions. The House
version added language allowing for contracts with other appropriate
providers, and not just to Brain Injury Association of North Carolina
and Carolinas Rehab. Page 320 is a Senate only provision, the closure of
the Wright School. The House opted not to include this. Page 321 and
page 323, again the same provision with some modifications in the House.
If you turn page 23, I have underlined and starred some of the important
differences between these two provisions. Notably in lines 24 through 30
on page 323, there's just an addition of a reference to the Medicaid
state plan definition of facility based crisis programs for children and
adolescents, and it also makes other technical corrections that are
noted. On page 324, if you look at pages, sorry, lines 18 through 20,
this language just requires that the strategy developed by the
department include recommendations as to any regulatory changes
necessary to ensure safety and quality, and facility based crisis
programs for children and adolescents. Page 325 is a House only special
provision, it requires the department to report to HHS Oversight on
budget shortfalls resulting from liabilities associated with community
services for the Division of Mental Health and state operated health
care facilities under the jurisdiction of the department. Page 326 is a
House only special provision that follows money. This requires the
Division of Mental Health to use $5.2 million of funds appropriated for
Fiscal Year 14-15 to increase the number of behavioral health urgent
care centers that provide outpatient crisis services and facility based
crisis services at the same location, and it also specifies other uses
of those funds. Page</p>

<p id="15:00">
Anon begins the division of health service regulation. Page 327 is a
Senate only provision, this makes modifications to the health care cost
reduction transparency act that was passed last year. It redefines the
term health insurer to include a risk of self insured and group insured
health plans. It clarifies that each of the five largest health insurers
must report information about the most frequently reported admissions by
DRG. It requires the medical care commission to adopt rules specifying
the method by which the department is to determine the most common
DRG's, imaging procedures, and surgical procedures for these reporting
requirements, rather than requiring the commission to establish the most
common ones by rule each year. It also exempts these rules from certain
provisions of the administrative procedures act. Page 329, this is the
moratorium on home care agency licenses for in home aide services. There
are differences as between the Senate and the House. I've noted them for
you at the bottom of those pages. The Senate version makes this
moratorium permanent until the General Assembly knocks legislation to
lift it and the House version extends the moratorium by two years until
July 1, 2016. Page 331 and 332, this is the moratorium on special care
unit licenses. The Senate version makes the moratorium permanent until
he General Assembly enacts legislation to lift it and the House version
sunsets this moratorium one year early on July 1, 2015 instead of July
1, 2016. Page 333, this is a House only special provision. Effective
October 1, 2014 it increases the minimum age for use of tanning
equipment from 13 to 18 and it repeals the exception for youth below the
minimum age requirement who present written prescription from a medical
physician. There are some general health and human services special
provisions that I'll cover and they begin on page 385 of your package.
Page 385. You'll recall that last year there was legislation passed
requiring hospitals to connect in with the health information exchange
network and this special provisions makes some modifications to that
statute. It makes a technical correction but it also requires the NCHIE
to provide professional staff of the fiscal research, bill drafting,
research, and program evaluation divisions with access to information in
that network. The differences between the Senate and the House version
are that the house version is much more specific as to how staff will be
able to access that information and it also requires the NCHIE to
provide this information to staff in a way that is consistent with the
standards specified for de-identification of health information under
HIPPA standards. On page 387, this is a Senate only provision, that
establish the joint legislative study commission on traumatic brain
injury. The house opted not to include that provision. Page 389 is a
Senate only study, it requires program evaluation to consider, including
in it's 1415 work plan a study of the benefits and disadvantages of
requiring local ABC boards to stop paying the department from revenues
generated by local ABC mixed beverages surcharge and the local guest
room cabinet surcharge for alcohol or substance abuse treatment,
research for education and it instead redirects these payments to the
North Carolina ABC commission for it's substance abuse education and
prevention initiative. Page 390 is the House only special provision and
it reinstates the ability of UNC medical schools and UNC satellite
medical offices and the UNC health care system to utilize hospitals set
off debt collection. Mister Chair that concludes my remarks and now Lisa
Wilkes will come up and explain her provisions. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank
you Miss Jones, Miss Wilkes. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mister Chair,
members of the committee, Lisa Wilkes with legislative drafting. If
you'll turn with me.</p>

<p id="20:00">
In your booklet to page 267 as Miss Jones mentioned, there’s one
provision in central management that I’d like to discuss. On page 267,
this is your competitive grants provision and this provision follows the
money. Just to mention, on page 268, if you’ll recall in the Senate
provision under subsection 8 you made a direct appropriation for the
2014-15 fiscal year to big brothers big sisters of the triangle with the
intent that going forward they participate in the competitive grants
process so that’s that stark difference that you see on page 268 and
then if you’ll turn with me to page 269, you see also on page 270 – the
House did not elect to give that direct allocation to big brothers big
sisters nor put them directly into the competitive grants process. What
they did do is on page 270 line 5, you’ll see a new sub-subdivision and
they created a new initiative for comprehensive smoking prevention and
cessation program for pregnant women and postpartum mothers. Now, if
you’ll turn with me to the division of child development and early
education that begins on page 279. This is your childcare subsidy rates,
revised co-payments and eligibility criteria provision and this
provision follows the money. The biggest differences between the House
and Senate versions, if you look under 12(b).3 subsections A and B,
you’ll notice date differences. The House moved it to October 1, 2014
and that basically is to align with the market rates provision which
we’ll talk about a little bit later. Also, if you look on page 280,
there’s a new subsection, A1 and this is language that’s House-only that
the House added regarding allowing for a transition period. Regarding
the eligibility changes, the Senate elected to make those changes
effective immediately, of course beginning on the September 1 date. What
the House decided to do was to create a transition period. So, if you’ll
look under section A1 it allows for child who’s currently on the income
eligibility based on 75% of the state median income, to remain there
until their next re-determination and on that date, they will then
become a part of the new eligibility income criteria under subsection A
of this section. So that’s the change on page 280. Moving on to page
281, this is the smart start tentative maintenance of effort requirement
and if you look on page 282, the difference here – the House added a new
subsection A and this basically requires NCPC to hire three staff to
assist local partnerships with fund raising and grant writing. The
remainder of the provision is identical. Moving on to page 283, this is
study childcare subsidy for 11 and 12 year olds and if you look on page
284, the difference here is that last line is underlined on 9/11. What
the House did was to make it clear that the findings and recommendations
are to be separate for each age group. Moving on to page 285, provides
childcare allocation formula. If you look at the bottom of subsection B
on page 285, this was Senate-only language and what the senate did was
require that any reallocated funding in fiscal year 2013-14 become part
of a County’s allocation in future fiscal years and beginning with
fiscal year 2014-15, the revised formula would apply to both increased
and decreased allocations. So that was the language in the Senate
version. If we move on to page 286, you’ll see.</p>

<p id="25:00">
That subsection B here was the language from last year’s version of the
child care allocation formula. The House did not elect to take the
language that’s in the Senate version for subsection B. What it did was
create language under subsection C. So if you’re looking beginning on
line 28, the biggest difference begins with the subdivision 1 and what
subdivision 1 says, it provides that beginning the 2014 15 fiscal year,
the department is to use 1/3 implementation of the new census data
allocation formula every 2 years. However for the 2014 15 allocations, a
county that did not have a subsidy waiting list in the 2013 14 fiscal
year does not receive an increase in its allocation based on the new
allocation formula. And beginning 2015 2016, a county whose spending
coefficient is below 95% in the previous fiscal year does not receive an
increase in its allocation in the following fiscal year, meaning 2016
2017. However it does provide for a waiver due to extraordinary
circumstances. And it also further provides for a report by the
department due on October 1 of each year on the number of counties that
were granted the waiver pursuant to that subdivision, sub-subdivision.
It goes on to say that under subdivision 2, immediately upon release of
new census data, the department shall use 1/3 biannual implementation
reflecting a 6 year phase in approach to each census cycle thereafter.
So basically the difference in the Senate version is a 2 year phase in,
the House version is a 6 year phase in. Moving on to page 288, this is a
House only provision. Child care market rate adjustments. And what this
does is adjust market rates for 3 to 5 star rated child care centers and
homes to 40% of the difference between current market rates and the 2013
market rates. Moving on to page 289, NC pre-K audits. Again this is a
House only provision. And it addresses an issue regarding duplicate
audits, by requiring local partnerships administering NC pre-K programs
to be subject to audits that are already under current law. Page 290.
Again, this is a House only provision. Child care license certification
by DHHS. This allows the division to assume responsibility for issuing
certifications for child care early educators. All right, moving on to
the division of social services. On page 291, this provision follows the
money and there’s only a slight modification on page 292, line 30, you
notice that under subdivision 4 it references any funding needs. And if
you’ll turn with me to page 295, line 23, under subdivision 4 the House
changed that to reflect adequacy of funding. All right, and now if
you’ll turn with me to the very end of the book on page 404, this is
your block grants provision. Again this is page 404, toward the back.
And I’m going to go ahead and just have you turn to the House version
again this follows the money. And the House spent, had some additional
funds to spend in ten of contingency funds. If you look at page 405,
lines 36 to 39, this shows you where that additional money, those
additional funds show up. Plus 12 million. And then if you’ll turn with
me over to page 409, there are two differences that I’ll point out here.
One with the mental health services block grant. Under item 2, the
Senate has, this amount, they mainly had the funds</p>

funding under that particular item however if you look at items 4 for
the most far all the way to item 10 the house elected to break out these
various initiatives versus putting them under a particular item I also
note that the senate version also listed as a specific initiative item 5
which is the critical time intervention similarly under this substance
abuse prevention and treatment block grant on page 410 if you turn with
me to that page item 05A which is the substance abuse services treatment
for children and adults the senate had a slightly increased amount for
that item and they also had an item funding for the veterans crisis
which is item 05F however the house as you can see here again elected to
list out specific initiatives in terms of giving the funding under the
substance abuse block grant the last thing I'll note is on page 410 at
the bottom the house carved out under the maternal and child health care
block grant funding for prevent blindness and Mr Chair that concludes my
remarks Mr Ryan Blackledge will be up next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you miss Welch Mr Blackledge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Chair, members of the committee Ryan Blackledge with Legislative
Drafting I'm going to cover medicate provisions they start on page 334
page 334 I'm gonna cover the first half and then Jennifer Hillman is
gonna come up and cover the second half of this the very first provision
the senate had a medicate reorganization that they set out they created
a new medicate nst outside of the department of health and human
services and also specified that there will be full risk capitated
health plans for medicate, if you turn to page 336 you will see that the
house did not do that nor did they include any details about a direction
for reform and said that there was just this provision that follows the
money and says that anything for medicate reform can only be used for
medicate reform and not anything else like a shortfall I will note
though if you turn to page 383 the house did have a provision that had
some restructuring so to speak and the house had included a provision
that required again it's page 383 the house had required a provision to
have the medicate director recommended by the secretary of health and
human services appointed by the governor and then confirmed by the
general assembly sets up a 5 year term of office they can be removed for
some reasons they're not completely serving at will there're some
reasons they can be removed and then there's some additional detail in
here the general message being just appointment and approval by the
general assembly of the medicate director alright let's jump back to
where we were let's go to 337 please page 337 Steve mention this already
this morning the senate had made some adjustments to medicate
eligibility there was delinking the SA and then also the elimination of
coverage for the medically needed the house chose not to do either of
those additionally within this senate provision on page 337 there's that
subsection B which had a study to look at some possibilities for taking
some additional coverage down for aged,blind and disabled persons on
page 338 there's a provision that the senate had and the house did not
that was just a study of an additional 1915C waver over on page 339 and
also 340 there's the senate version and the house version of a traumatic
brain injury waver just to draw your attention to the 340 the house
version of that you can see the underline language the house just added
a few additional details on the study on page 341 there's a provision
that follows the money this was discussed earlier this involves [??] a
something on the nursing home direct care services case mix right now
that goes up periodically and this would have put a freeze upon that
that automatic rate increasing on page 342 there is well 342 and 333 are
two different ways of dealing with something the [??] government is
going to be requiring of states or at least theoretically it's expected
and that's changing to using the average acquisition cost for drugs.

Just as reminder everyone when drugs are priced there's the cost of the
ingredients and there's also the dispensing, looks like the federal
government is gonna require states to go down on the cost of the
ingredients and what the senate did was to say alright increase the
dispensing fees so that net there's a savings of 975 thousand dollars
what the house said was make it budget neutral so as those ingredient
costs go down raise the dispensing up so that the pharmacists are more
or less kept whole, also the house version is conditional on the federal
government actually requiring this whereas the senate version says
January 1 2015 just go ahead with it. On page 344 there is a provision
that was amended on the floor during debate on Thursday from the house
and this is something that has two conditions on it one if there are
savings in doing what I'm about to describe and then second the
department may choose to do it there's an issue when we've got on the
drug list preferred drugs which are brand drugs that the state actually
net works better than the generics because there are certain rebates and
so the prices are better on that than the generics and so there's a
requirement that those drugs be dispensed sometimes though pharmacists
can't get a hold of those preferred brands and so what this provision
would do is if there are savings that the department may allow
pharmacists to instead substitute the generic if they can't get the
preferred there're some details on what the pharmacists would have to do
they'd have to keep records they'd have to try within the two prior
weeks but this is just something that would allow pharmacists to
substitute some generic drugs in certain circumstances page 345
something that follows the money is in senate only that's mental health
drug prior authorization Steve already mentioned this one this morning,
page 346 both the senate and the house had something on studying
personal care services or PCS but on page 346 you can see there're two
subsections that were senate only Steve mentioned these this morning
these were the sections that required the department to go back and
recoup and then also make rate adjustments to further reduce the amount
of cost for personal care services, one thing to know on page 348 there
were couple things added to the study portion by the house just looking
at the impact on any reform of personal care services any impact on
appeals and legation and also there on lines 25 and 26 included within
the study just the quality of resident care within adult care homes.
Alright if you look at page 349 and also 350 if you kind of hold them
open you can see two very very different approaches senator Mckissick
this is actually what you asked about earlier this morning with the base
rates the senate created a state wide base rate and what the house did
was pull back from last year's budget where there was a director to the
department to do the regional base rates the house pulled back from that
and turned that into a study and so you can see a modification on page
350 modification on what was on last year's budget changing to that
study page 351, 352 another couple that you probably wanna keep open at
the same time so you can see this [??] with the supplemental payments
that go to UNC and the ECU providers if you look on line 11 over on page
351 and line 8 you can see that the number of slots allowed for east
Carolina university went from 375 to 418 that should really be
considered a technical fix because we got updated information indicated
that 418 was actually the number that had been receiving it so that
should be really considered technical what's not technical on page 352
is line 14 the house included language say that supplemental payments
shall not be made for services provided in wake county additionally if
you look further down both of those pages you'll see different
percentages over in the senate you see 28.85 over in the house you see
25.9 that's just linked to different approaches to the hospital provider
assessment tax these supplemental payments are funded by the university.

<p id="40:00">
What happens is, for each $3 that they’re going to draw down for this,
they put in a dollar. What the change is made here is instead of putting
in a dollar in the Senate version they have to put in basically $1.28.
In the House version they have to put in $1.25. The $1.25 corresponds to
a provision that was Senate only and I’ll explain that one in a little
bit more detail and you’ll see how that’s linked when we get to it. Page
353 and 354, again another one where it’s helpful to keep them open and
look at both. The subsections A and B are identical, however there were
different modifications made to the list. This is the shared savings
program. Both chambers repealed it, but there’s a 3% rate reduction. The
Senate gave that 3% reduction back to optical services and supplies,
podiatry, chiropractors, hearing aids. The House gave it back, if you
look over on page 364, gave it back to nursing homes. So again, the
subsections A and B are identical and it’s the C where those differences
are. Turn to page 355, there was a Senate provision to publish Medicaid
payments to providers, similar to what was published for Medicare
payments was done recently. The House did not do that. On page 356,
there was a study of a physician assessment. The House did not do that.
On page 357, there was an increase to the hospital assessment retention
by the state. You’ll , a few pages ago I was talking about that 25.9%
and then the 28.85, that’s where these percentages come from. So the
other provision would have treated UNC and Eastview the same as the
other hospitals in terms of the percentage. And because this was a
Senate only provision, the House did not increase the assessment on
hospitals. They used the existing 25.5% for the universities. Page 358
was something that the Senate had included because the Governor had
included it in his budget. We got additional information after the
Senate budget passed that CMS will not approve this. This is something
that we cannot do. There’s something else on page 359 which we also
currently cannot do. This is what the House proposed. But this is an
assessment on 1915C innovations waiver services. Federal government does
not allow this, but this is a 3 year authorization that if federal law
is changed or if CMS allows waivers to do this within the next 3 years,
then this is something that the department may pursue. There’s already
an assessment on IFCMR services and these are services that are in the
alternative to those. And so this is something that was included there,
another potential source of income. Again, the federal government
authorized it, but they may. Over on page 360, the Senate’s repealed the
planned CCNC payment of PNPMs. Last year’s budget had the department and
CCNC work together to transfer all of the PNPM money to be paid out, and
then have CCNC have in a tiered system make those payments to the
doctors. The Senate repeals that. If you turn to page 361, the House
directs it to occur. So, the complete opposite. That 12H.19 is the last
one I’m going to do. At this point Jennifer Hillman is going to come up
and do the rest of the Medicaid provisions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Bocklage. Miss Hillman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee. Picking up on page 362, we have a Senate
provision that has a very different House counterpart. The Senate
version authorizes a new Medicaid entity to terminate the CCNC contract
upon 30 days notice, effective December 31 2015. And on page 363, the
House version instead would direct DHHS to draft waivers to allow a
primary care case management entity such as CCNC to require dual
eligibles to enroll in case management programs. It also allows DHHS to
draft a waiver for LMENCOs to do primary care case management for dual
eligibles with a primary diagnosis of mental illness. On page 364, we
have a Senate provision</p>

<p id="45:00">
...where the language in Subsection D required this comprehensive
program integrity contract, or allowed it to be exempt from review by
the State Chief Information Officer and on page 365 you will see the
House version removes that language and also contains a technical fix to
Subsection B.
On page 366, we have a Senate only provision that returns the burden of
proof to the petitioner on Medicaid provider appeals at the Office of
Administrative Hearings.
On page 367, we have another Senate only provision that requires DHHS to
withhold payments to providers who owe an overpayment beginning on the
75th day after the notice of overpayment. Monthly withholdings are
limited to 11.1% of the total amount owed, which allows the state to
recover the overpayment during the 365 day time period allowed by CMS.
Then on page 369, we have another Senate only provision that establishes
procedures for a party at OAH to seek superior court review of
interlocutory decisions, such as injunctions, stays and other types of
decisions that are made prior to the final decision in OAH cases.
Then turning to page 371, we have a Senate provision that would in
Subsection A would shorten the time period for a recipient to request an
appeal to the federal minimum requirement for requesting an appeal. That
language was removed in the House version and then on lines 43 to 47,
the Senate provision would clarify that the recipient always has the
burden of proof in appeals at OAH.
And then the Senate had language that stated if a Medicaid recipient
accepts an offer of mediation and then fails to meaningfully participate
without good cause, OAH shall dismiss the contested case. If you turn to
page 373, you'll see the House version changed the language meaningfully
participate and instead used the words attend mediation.
On page 374, we have a Senate only provision, Senate only in the DHHS
section of the budget because the House did take this language with
slight modifications but they put it at Section 11.20, which is within
the education section of the budget.
On page 375, we have a provision that is identical in the text, it only
has a technical fix to the title that appears in the House version.
On page 377, we have a House only provision regarding non-emergency
medical transportation. It requires DHHS to issue a request for proposal
for a contract to manage state-wide non-emergency medical transportation
services beginning January 1st, 2015.
On page 378 is a House only provision that directs DHHS to study the
practice of reimbursing for ambulance transports that divert individuals
in mental health crisis from hospital emergency departments to
alternative, appropriate locations for care by examining current pilots,
including the Wake County Advanced Practice Paramedics pilot and
requires a report on the findings to the appropriation subcommittees.
On page 379, I have another House only provision. It follows the money.
Steve mentioned it earlier. It requires DHHS to reimburse for Paragard
using the same methodology that is used for other IUD's in plan and in
??.
On page 380, we have another House only provision requiring DHHS
oversight to study the issue of implementing uniform reimbursement rates
for Botox for physicians and pharmacists.
On page 381, we have another House only provision. It directs the
department to report on the PACE program in September and December of
2014 regarding the individuals who are being served by the PACE program,
the cost of serving those individuals through the PACE program, as
compared to nursing home placement, and a proposal to make the program
sustainable.
On page 382, we have another House only provision. It exempts individual
who are served by the 1915 BC waivers from the Medicaid County of Origin
requirement and it requires individuals to be served based on their
current county of residence. It requires that 1915 C slots be portable
among counties.
On page 383, we have another House only provision. This is the one that
Ryan covered.</p>

Earlier regarding the appointment of the medicaid director and so we'll
skip to page three eighty four is another house only provision that
requires C H A S to require or direct C H A S to require that the annual
medicaid billing unit limits for services that are managed by the O M N
C S to be based on the fiscal year beginning July first twenty fifteen
provided there is no fiscal impact to making that standardization and
that concludes the medicaid provisions.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Well thank you Ms. Hill. Thank you very much for your presentations and
now we'll open the floor for questions from members Senator Beranger I
recognize you.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you Mr. Chair I have two questions at least at first or two topics
to cover. The first one regards the transfer of the summer foods service
program. Could someone tell me, I'm assuming that that's for children
who ordinarily are a part of the school food program that then covers
them in the summer am I accurate or could someone tell me what that's
really about?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Ms. Thompson.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Ms. Thomas fiscal research. Senator Beranger that is a summer...that
program does cover children who are younger than school age all the way
up to I think age eighteen or twenty one. And it's currently...it was
transferred more than ten years ago from DPI over to the division of
public health and this was a floor amendment to have it transferred back
to DPI. I think at the time when it was transferred years ago there were
not very many schools that wanted to do the program. But now more
schools are willing to offer the summer eating program.
SPEAKER CHANGES
?? Now that I understand and I did have a basic idea about it you
mentioned that it's being transferred to DPI. How will that work? I have
some concerns on how they'll be able to implement it is there a plan or
program for this?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Well it's not just for children under school a...it's for children from
age zero if you wanted to take a baby with you to a site up to age
eighteen. It's usually administered by local churches or other non
profits who want to offer the program during the summer months but also
a lot of school districts that they choose to be open and offer summer
feeding at their sites. And the way the intention is as I under...we
didn't have any background on ?? was done on house floor in speaking to
the people at public health afterward they were in agreement with the
transfer so the entire transfer would just be...I don't think that they
intend to transfer the employees. The positions would go but the current
employees would stay over at public health. It is a hundred percent
federally funded program so the federal allocation will be transferred
to DPI.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Communicating concerns about this transfer from one to the other.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I have no knowledge of that.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up on a different topic.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes go ahead.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you Mr. Chair. I have made several comments in the past about
portability of medicaid and I noticed in on page three hundred and
eighty two there's at least an attempt to allow for the movement of
certain medicaid recipients for that to portable from county to county.
The county residents. Does this take care of it finally or are there
limitations with this? I thought the department of health and human
services was taking care of it internally. I'm just...I'm just trying to
get my head around this and see if we finally have a resolution of this
portability cause there mentally well there's lots of people that need
to be able to take that those benefits and move from county to county
whether it's adoption or foster care or mental health or whatever.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Who would like to tackle that? ?? Blacklidge?
SPEAKER CHANGES
I'm Blacklidge ?? drafting. This language is intended to allow that
portability that transfer. There may be some technical adjustments to
the language. We haven't heard back from the department on exactly what
those might be but the idea behind it is to allow that portability.
SPEAKER CHANGES
?? Well I certainly support the portability and I have advocated for
that strongly but this because it's the nineteen fifteen BC waiver will
involve the elemy MCA. Are they on board or is this...I want this to
happen. I want it to finally get done have they weighed in. Is there a
plan to finally implement this so we can check this off and move...</p>

On to other, other issues. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Unfortunately I do not know the answer to that question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You're welcome. Senator
Hise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr Chair. A few things I wanted to go
through. First on the CCMC provisions 360-362, I was under the
understanding we had originally set a three tiered system and required a
zero payment level. Was under the impression that the department was
unable to implement that and there was no buy in from the association,
that's why we stepped away from that. What are the conditions that have
changed in that manner that would bring us to say go ahead and implement
what you don't have. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Blackwich. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, Senator Hise, I do not know of any conditions that have
changed. All I know is that the House took a different approach.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And a comment on those there with the contracts that
are on there, and this might be in a question, but, for not having the
CCNC this was tied very closely to having a new division that we were
creating, and so we were trying to not have the previous department
enact contracts that bound the new division beyond the date the transfer
was coming in. There's no, and just to clarify for a follow up on this
one, there was nothing in the provision on the Senate side that said the
new division could not do any contracts with CCNC or extend them out as
far as they wished. The prohibition was only on the department as I
understood that and we intended to write that. And the next area I kind
of want to hit up if I can follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is somebody giving 280, 288 dealing with the copay changes and
those type of things, do we have a current number on what the wait list
or a best estimate of what we think the wait list is for subsidies right
now? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Landrick? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, the
current wait list for childcare is subsidies actually much lower than
normal because of the reallocation of funds, so it's around 20,000 right
now where it usually averages around 40,000 over a year. Once the
reallocated funds, depending on how the budget turns out, if those
individuals are on a temporary voucher, so beginning on July they would
go back on the waiting list and then you'd again average around 40,000
at that point. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And follow up on those. I guess this is
kind of where I'm going with this on comparison of the two. When the
House takes, the Senate took the funds and put it toward reduction of
the wait list, plus we changed the funding formula to make sure that
those allocated slots became permanent slots in those counties, was
coming through in this budget year. Do you have a sense of where the
budget list, where the wait list would compare between the House and the
Senate when the House takes the money and puts it into making each slot
more expensive by increasing the market rates and doesn't do the other
operations and goes back to the new formula, do you have a sense of what
that difference would be in the waiting list. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Hise, Debra Landry with fiscal research, what I can tell you is that
after the market rate increases are done and the remaining money is put
in towards the waiting list, on an ongoing basis it would be about 2,200
slots, 2,200 children off the waiting list. That happens over time
because the House implements the change to childcare eligibility over
time. They don't do it immediately. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you have
another question Senator Hise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't know, follow
this in the House and I may be trying to get to questions of maybe
things that may have been said in debate or maybe even to intent, and
maybe that's a little further, but for the provisions on 327, the
transparency acts, as well as 355, publishing the Medicaid payment to
providers, did we get any indication from debate or others, what's the
House's opposition to transparency and to having that information
publicly available. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Who would like to tackle that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can. Similar to Ms.</p>

Black legis comments I can only comment that the House chose not to
include that in their package. I am not aware of any specific
objections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One last ?? may be simple and then just comment to ??. For the provision
on 3 8 and I'm still trying to find the answer to the transparencies
myself. 380, does anybody know what the medical uses of Botox are beyond
cosmetic surgery? I'm hoping that someone can give me some of those but
I'm not aware of them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair sir, Ryan Blacklitch, bill-drafting, and I'll say this and I
will look back cause I know we have...Okay, maybe the press has left.
Botox can be used for purposes other than making your face look
smoother. What it does and we did a fair amount of research. We looked
at the existing medical policy that the department does have on it. If
you think about the fact that it relaxes the nerves within your face,
there are instances..spasticity, uncontrollable limbs, and things like
that. There are instances where injections in particular locations can
deaden those nerves' responses and can help with the reduction of pain
and also the control of limbs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and just, I'm glad to know that there are other uses. I was a
little nervous in reading that probation that was coming through. In
controlling costs, I didn't think cosmetic surgeries were we wanted to
go, that was coming in, but just for final comment in these types of
things, I think we're probably about as far apart on the provisions as
we are on the budget numbers and I think those are kinda there. I think
it's pretty evident to say that this comment has been that there's don't
put policy in the budget from the House has been when you put the youth
tanning bill in the budget, I don't see really where that came in
anywhere else in those operations. I think the largest ?? we've gotta
get going forward is what is the future of the department as well as
medicaid as a whole and that's the question we're going to have to
answer in moving forward, what type of system we're going to have, and
what does the department and division look like and those are the large
gaps right now between the House and the Senate in spite of all these
other significant ones so that was my comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First, I want to thank the staff for really providing some excellent
overview and explanations because I think most of your explanations were
very clear, very concise, and provided a lot of very meaningful,
insightful data so I appreciate that. I want to comment first about some
of these differences between the House and the Senate and then it was
one or two questions that I had. I do like the way the House is handling
the ?? dealing with the personal care services and terms of providing
for an additional year there. I hope that when our senior cares will be
able to deliberate. They will be able to see a way to make certain that
occurs. I like these ??. We talk about the drug reimbursement ?? the
acquisition cost. I'd like to see us continue to advocate for that cause
I think that is a smart policy in something that we should move forward
with. In terms of the study of the 1915 sea waivers, I'd like to see us
try to continue in that direction as well. There were ?? here the House
had about and strategic plan dealing with Alzheimer's, something which I
am deeply concerned about, something which I think we really need to get
jump-started. I know I actually had a study build for that to move in
that direction. If this can be worked in the special ?? here in the
budget, it would be excellent to ?? to you all, especially the senior
cares. The right
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, please stay objective with your comments sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, I will. I will stay objective as possible, but I think it's good to
be able to chime in in terms of those things that you may feel strongly
about, either one way House or Senate. With the right school funding, if
there can be a way to continue that effort. I know they have been around
for 50 years and the people who do receive services there. If you go and
listen to their testimonials, and I've been there and toured that
facility. It's something if we can continue would be great. The
traumatic brain injury, the study, the services, things which I see
there. If there's a way to keep those in there, that would be hell good
as well as if ?? ?? ?? healthcare transparency. Now, one thing which I
had some questions about that I wasn't certain of that wasn't quite as
clear during the presentation was back on page 371 beginning with the</p>

...I guess provisions dealing with appeals for recipients. Dealing with
the modification of recipient appeals and dealing with Medicaid
provisions, excuse me, Medicaid services. If someone could address what
it is that we are doing here and the differences between what the Senate
and House are proposing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Hillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Jennifer Hillman, Research Division. The Senate
version really did three things. In line 7 through 26, where it says
Senate only, it shortens the time which a recipient would have to
request an appeal with the Office of Administrative Hearings to the
federal minimally required amount of time, which is basically before the
action becomes effective. They would have until the date that the action
becomes effective to request a hearing.
Then on line 41, it makes a change that would allow, or require, OAH to
dismiss a contested case if a recipient requests mediation and then
fails to meaningfully participate. I noted that in the House version,
they change the term meaningfully participate to fails to attend.
And then on lines 43 through 47, the Senate version clarifies the burden
of proof, stating that the recipient always bears the burden of proof in
contested cases at the Office of Administrative Hearings, which is
consistent with how other petitioners are treated at the Office of
Administrative Hearings.
And so of those changes, the House did not shorten the time period and
the House did not make the clarification of the burden of proof. They
only allowed OAH to dismiss cases for failure to attend mediation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, may I make one follow-up on the
difference between the House and the Senate on the attend mediation
versus meaningfully participate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ryan Black, Legislative Drafting. Senator McKissick,
just to let you know that the meaningfully participate language came
from language suggested by the Governor and the issue with meaningfully
participate is it's sort of hard to nail down and what this actually
creates is a reason that a case can be dismissed. And so instead of
using meaningfully participate, by using attend mediation, that then is
an objective standard that all of the participating parties could say,
yes they attended or no, they did not. And so that's a little bit more
in line with the reason that something could be dismissed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Excellent. I appreciate those explanations. Follow-up,
Mr. ??, if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me interrupt first. I believe our rules call for
us to end our meetings when a floor session's coming up within 15
minutes. But in our discretion, if we can get a couple of questions
answered that will finish up our deliberations so we don't have to come
back at 5 o'clock this afternoon. I recognize you, Senator McKissick for
one more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It needs some the same issue. I clearly prefer that
language failure to appear. I think its inherently ambiguous when you
have to say that someone doesn't meaningfully participate, it's subject
to an objective standard, which I think doesn't need to be involved in
these situations.
Now, the clarification I'm seeking is the Senate would be shortening the
time frame for appeals to those that are minimally required. What is the
difference time frame wise between what we do now and what the new
federal standard would be?
And then lastly, I'm assuming that all of this applies to appeals which
occur after the enactment and passage of the budget bill, assuming it's
a special provision and it has absolutely no retroactive application.
But if we could get some clarity on those matters, as well. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Hillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jennifer Hillman, Research Division. Yes, you're
correct that this would apply to appeals that are filed going forward.
It would not have any retroactive effect. And the current time period
for requesting appeal is 30 days from the notice of adverse action and
the change here would require them to request the appeal before the
action that's being taken and the notice becomes effective. And that
notice must be given at least 10 days before the effective date. So it
would be the time for appealing would be no shorter than 10 days,
basically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Last follow-up, Mr. ?? and...</p>

Quickly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Remind me in terms of where we stand now in
terms of the continuation of benefits during the bills period. I know
there have been discussion of payments not continuing during the bills
period but historically payments had continued. Where do we stand today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, Jennifer Hillman, research division. This
does not change the maintenance of service that applies to recipients
and it does not change continuation of benefits which applies to
enrollees of LME NCOs. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, I believe you had a question. Please bear in mind our
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will. Just a couple, Mr. Chair. Thank you, and
I’ll try not to repeat anything. I want to get back real quick to the
summer feeding program. Does that program preclude… I mean does the
provision that’s been written in preclude schools from contracting with
other churches or community-based organizations to provide those
services? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Denise Thomas, fiscal research. Senator
Robinson, it does not. They would still be open to other sponsors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one or two other quick ones, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] One please, ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We should have cut Senator
McKissick off earlier then. In terms of the PCS, and I’m trying to refer
to the page… personal care services, with the changes recommended by the
House, is that at the reduced rate or does it impact he personal care
services reimbursement rate? Home cares went from 15 to 14 to 13, or am
I on the wrong thing? You know what I’m talking about, Steve? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Steve Owen, fiscal research. The Senate budget calls for an
additional rate reduction. Currently the rate that’s approved by CMS is
13 dollar and 88 cents per hour, so under the Senate version, that would
be reduced even further to compensate for the additional 50 hours. Under
the House version, the 13.88 stays intact, but there is the study to
actually look at a brand new PCS program altogether. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry Senator Robinson; I must end your questioning now. Senator Van
Duyn, I believe I saw you had a question. You can bat cleanup for us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I have a question about CCNC, pages 360 to 362.
My local CCNC, CCWNC, maintains that they’ve saved significant Medicaid
dollars. Am I understanding that this zeros our funding out in the
Senate version? [SPEAKER CHANGES] There’s not a zeroing out of the per
member per month payments. Last year’s budget required the payments to
be made by CCNC. I believe the policy argument was that there was a
disconnect between the department which was making the payments and
CCNC, which was trying to get doctors to participate meaningfully in the
programs, and so the reasoning, as discussed, was that the money would
go from the department to CCNC and then they would pay the per member
per month, and it would be paid on a tiered basis on the basis of the
doctor’s participation in the CCNC initiatives. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks
everyone for your attention. Session begins at 3 o’clock and I
appreciate all of the good questions, good answers, and thank you
audience for being here. We are now adjourned.</p>
