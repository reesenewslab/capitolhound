[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.  Members of the Senate.
Members, we had a full and robust discussion about this bill yesterday
and I would just urge you to vote for the bill.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or debate?  Senator Nesbitt,
for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.  To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.  Members of the Senate.  Any
time we get into a debate on the tax bill it seems like groundhog day to
me.  We just kind of keep doing the same thing over and over.  This is
the third bill that's been brought forth to us. Basically all three do
the same thing.  The people on the other two got in an uproar.  You all
went off and negotiated, framed around the edges a little bit, put a
little lipstick on it, and here it comes back. This bill does the same
thing the others did. You're taxing the middle class to give tax cuts
for the rich. It's that simple. This bill hurts working people and it
hurts the middle class so that we can give huge tax breaks to those at
the very top and out of state corporations. In addition to that you're
creating a $1 billion hole, you're projecting revenue in the future at
only inflation and population growth which you're going to have to cover
both of those and trying to maintain that so you're not creating a hole.
 You're taking a billion dollars out (audio ends)</p>

services to somebody and it's gonna be those same people that are hurt
by the tax break.  I urge you to reject this...and hopefully on the
fourth time, we'll get something in here that's called tax reform which
actually does fix our tax system but doesn't do it on the backs of the
middle-class and working families in this state.

[Speaker changes.] Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] To debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Bryant has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] On yesterday, I objected to third reading to look at
the amendment regarding the request of the Commission for Public Health
to make rules regarding smoking in restaurants and bars and, while I
think we are putting in a time clock because one employee is late and we
could really probably deal with that one situation we know about, I am
supporting the bill.  I do regret that we're fast tracking those rules
and also regret that we're opening up a situation that has been working
well for our restaurants and bar owners and tobacco growers and health
advocates since we enacted this ban so I'm concerned about that.  But
thank you for the time to look at the details of the statutes that were
put in. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Senator. Any further discussion or debate?

[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister President...members of the
Senate...this is an interesting bill.  I've...the fracking issue is
something that was new to all of us and we been goin' through it and, as
you know, a number of us are concerned about the environment and the
fact that we may be gettin' the cart before the horse. If you can
remember, when we started on this, we were gonna do a study and then
come back and kinda do it and we decided well...we didn't really need to
do all that, we'd just do it and then everything would fall into place
and we created the Mining Commission to put together the rules about how
we would proceed and, I'm gonna be honest with ya', it scared me to
death.  I didn't have a lot of faith in the Mining Commission and, what
I read in the paper about appointments, I had even less faith in it but
it was the group that was gonna do something and they were meeting in
public and they were taking input and moving forward and now I found out
that they are about our only hope.  What we've done here is basically
take the transparency out of the fracking. We're going to allow people
to put into our ground chemicals, which we don't disclose enough
information about for people to be on the watch for. And this was

that I handed up and we voted on. All this amendment does is it makes
the acts effective, date- It deals with the laws that were filed for
Superior court cases, all of those that were filed prior to the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Members of the Senate, last night there were about 20 people
in the gallery because you tried to sneak this bill through without
letting the people know. Well look around you. This is the result of
people talking from 8 PM to midnight last night. Wait until they read
the paper this morning or read the paper over the weekend. The lesson is
pretty clear. When you infringe upon people's fundamental constitutional
rights you spark them to action. The purpose of this bill is to make it
harder, more onerous for healthcare professionals to provide women
access to a constitutionally protected medical procedure. It does it in
a number of ways. It limits a woman's ability to pay for the services by
denying them access to insurance. This is so even though the Affordable
Care Act requires that there be no taxpayer money go to pay for an
abortion yet you all say that no one can get health insurance through
the exchange that has abortion coverage. The bill also interferes with
local government's decisions about what healthcare benefits to provide
their people. This is but one more example of you here in Raleigh
telling local communities that you know better than them what their
people merit. No one believes that abortion should be performed for sex
selection but this bill authorizes a disgruntled spouse or guardian to
bring a civil action against the provider making such an allegation,
introducing a threat of litigation and massive fines. The bill imposes
burdens on care, dictating to the doctor how to do his or her job. It
requires that the physician prescribing the drug to a person sit with
that person while it's being administered. A medical abortion, one which
is carried out using medication, is five times safer than Viagra. If you
really care about [...] you were essentially tripling the requirements
on them for absolutely no medical purpose. Of the 36 clinics in North
Carolina only one, which is in Asheville, meets this standard. So you're
saying, to any woman who chooses to exercise her rights, she has to
drive to Asheville. No matter if they live in Wilmington or Charlotte or
Raleigh. These standards include things about ventilation systems and
surgical sinks and the type of linoleum and the type of paint. Things
that have absolutely nothing to do with what happens in a clinic.</p>

Procedure after procedure are done on a ...
[AUDIO BREAKS 00:17-00:37]
...clinics providing women healthcare options. Your efforts will not
change, however, what decision a woman makes when facing that most
intense, most personal, and most difficult decision as to what to do
with their pregnancy.  And the sad irony is that the result of your bill
will cause more unwanted pregnancies to occur.  Because what the bulk of
what these clinics do is provide reproductive healthcare counseling,
family planning, and reproductive healthcare.  So by shutting them down,
you're denying women access to the birth control that keeps them from
having unwanted pregnancies.  Furthermore, you shut them down, women are
still going to want to have abortions.
We as a state and a nation have been there in the 60s and 70s.  We know
what the consequences are.  Please let us not go back to those days.

anti-Sharia law is really astounding.

Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I find this bill deeply, deeply disturbing.  We're rolling back the
hands of time on the rights of women in North Carolina.  Rather than
being proactive in protecting their rights, their liberties, and their
constitutionally protected zone of privacy, instead we're invading it.
Since Roe v. Wade, Supreme Court decision allowing abortions, it was
based on the right of privacy.  But yet today, we're further intruding
on that zone.  Last year you passed bills saying that women would have
to listen to a fetal heartbeat, they'd have to go back home and they'd
have to think and reflect before they're making the most personal
decisions of their lives.  Now we're saying we're going to have doctors
interrogate them as to the reason they're seeking abortions to see if it
was based upon the gender of the child they may be carrying.  These are
uniquely and intentionally and immensely personal decisions.  We should
not be invading on that constitutionally protected zone of privacy.  And
we're literally putting a padlock on the door of every abortion clinic
here in North Carolina through these stringent new standards that are
contained in this bill.

Question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not at this time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
McKissick you have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] They cannot offer
coverage for abortions. We are doing the wrong thing in terms of
protecting the rights of women in North Carolina. They're immensely
personal decisions relating to children they may  be carrying.
Regardless of what you may think personally, these are constitutionally
protected rights that have been upheld by the United States Supreme
Court. ?? send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick
you can send forth your amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator McKissick moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Decision about the health insurance coverage which they seek. To protect
them and their interest and their welfare. They should have the
privilege to do so. Without interference by this chamber. So I ask your
support on amendment one. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or
debate? Senator Daniel, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniel has the floor
to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is. 12 to 29 Senator
Randleman. Senator Mckissick is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like
to send forth a second amendment it should be with the clerk and
available in your dashboard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator McKissick is recognized to to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Pretty straight forward amendment. Even if a hospital
chooses not to offer abortions as part of what they do. In terms of what
their doctor's privileges might be. What it would simply say, is if you
went to an abortion clinic, some other facility that did. But for some
reason there was an emergency condition that occurred relating to your
health as a result of that procedure. That hospital that normally would
not require or allow abortions to be conducted there, would be required
by emergency care, if that person showed up at their door needing help.
We shouldn't turn our backs on people in these situations. We don't know
who may be coming forward. We don't know what the circumstances might
be. But we want to make sure.</p>

you directly or indirectly. It's about women's health. When there's a
college student across at Winston and Fayetteville and Chapel Hill and
UNCC, they're in the know. What do you guys think about what we're
getting ready to do? Did not have the opportunity to do that because it
was slipped on the calendar in the evening. We have rules and we have
process and we clearly know what the numbers are in this chamber. You
guys can do anything you want to do when you want to do it, how you want
to do it. And as I said last night, just because you can, don't mean
that you should. The citizens of North Carolina have not had an
opportunity to speak on this bill. A 45 minute committee meeting last
night. Judiciary 1. I would have loved to hear the perspective from
women's groups and organizations across the state on this particular
piece of legislation. Would have loved for them to come to my office and
help me understand why this is a good idea from someone's perspective or
why this is terrible legislation. Was not afforded that opportunity. Was
not afforded the opportunity to talk to the folks in the city of
Charlotte and Mecklenburg county and how they will be impacted on this
based on their providing insurance coverage. Did not have the
opportunity to do that because the citizens were not afforded the
opportunity to be heard. So they are silenced today and they were
silenced last night because no one knew what was coming. Transparency is
important on major legislation. Because we don't respect our own rules,
we change them to fit our purpose. We introduce a major piece of
legislation during a holiday week when even members on both sides are
absent. The House is not even in session this week, and we roll it out
in the middle of the evening. Family, faith and freedom.</p>

Before that Texas. We were pleased to come to a state that was a beacon
of enlightenment how sad to see it fall from a leader of the South to
one of egregious denial of rights. This bill claims to make women safe,
but we know that is not what the bill is all about. 40 years of safe
abortion procedures in North Carolina and one clinic we do have the
oversight of making sure that women are safe and we’re not Philadelphia,
we have oversight and I just want to contrast our safety record with the
thousands of medical about a 100,000 a year. What we have now is
something that has been declared safe: 1 in 1000,000 procedures have an
occurrence.  Where as Viagra has 5 in 100,000, this is from the
Association of Reproduction Health Professionals. But what we’ve also
got is we’re losing by closing these clinics for no reason at all that

catch those kinds of clinics that's making those kinds of mistakes. I
just would like to say, my colleagues, they have done an excellent job
debating this bill and saying why it's such and atrocious, shameful bill
and I just want to make it clear that this bill is not about healthcare
safety for women, but this bill is about dictating to women about their

Senator Parm, how is this bill restrict [...] be able to have insurance

only allows it as, is in this field for incest, rape, and for the
possibility of death of the mother and that is what is practiced in 32
other states. And so, do you consider it a right that it's a requirement
for other people to pay for an abortion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I did not make a statement about insurance but I also

insurance for an abortion procedure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Parmon, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well then, Senator, I'll ask again, do you think other than the things I
mentioned, rape, incest, and the life of the mother, that you think that
it should be a requirement for someone else to pay for a woman's
abortion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all, Senator, it's my opinion for what a woman decide to do is,
shouldn't count in this and I don't think that we should deny access to
a woman making a decision that should belong to her and her doctor
period, and my opinion about another woman's body should not count.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I'd like to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly there are choices to be made and there's nothing in this bill
that affect any woman's right to make a choice with their doctor on what
they decide on abortion. The other thing, the only thing that I see in
this bill is that it would limit anyone else from having to be required
to pay for an abortion that wasn't due to incest, rape, or the life of
the mother. The other thing I would like to mention, we all could have a
choice if we want to help contribute to a fund for Carolina, it's called
Carolina's Abortion Fund and it's a non-profit that helps low income
families that might be facing abortion and it's a choice that each one
of us could make if we want to donate to that cause. But, as for a
requirement to pay for someone else's abortion, I would support this
bill in making it only if you're using tax payers money for incest,
rape, or the life of the mother and I see nothing in this bill that
limits my right as a woman to make a choice with my doctor and make my
own personal choice. Thank you.

parading it all over town, bragging on it, and telling everybody what
you're doing for women. And do it for a week or two and you'll get some
good press.  That isn't what you did.  You called a meeting last night
at 7:00 when everybody is out of town, and you sent out engraved
invitations to the Values Coalition, the Family Policy Council, the
Right to Life...
[AUDIO BREAKS 04:13-04:44]
...because everybody was trying to celebrate the Fourth of July and you
thought they weren't looking.  Now, I know the Governor said the other
day that he wasn't going to talk to anybody.... [AUDIO ENDS]</p>

It’s coming down here on moral Mondays.
No sound
That he didn’t anything to discuss with…and…I know this bill was run
through last night without anyone able to be here, representing women.
And when I made the comment by the way you whipped three of the best
women I know these three democrat women who were fighting for their life
but you’re about to meet some more.  Overnight you generated this crowd
and I predict, before we’re all said and done with this, that you’re
gonna talk to them and the governor’s gonna talk to them.  You can’t
turn your back on half of the people of this state.  And I’ve said all
along I couldn’t figure out what it would take to wake up the people of
North Carolina to what’s been going on down here.  This week while we’re
going to go celebrate the 4th of July 70,000 people lost their
unemployment checks that have been unemployed for a year.  And Happy 4th
of July.  And I’ve decided, and I’ve used this phrase, I was convinced
that you were going to have to poke them in the eye with a stick to wake
them up so they would know what was going on down here.  Well, you did.
And I thank you for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the Bill please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca has the floor please to speak to the
Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  First off, I’d like to say a shout out to my
Republican women.  I guess in the eyes of some of this chamber, you
don’t exist, but you do exist and we’re glad you’re here and you’re
welcome too to come up to Ashville and Henderson…
No sound
It’s been done here about 250 years and we’re going to celebrate a lot
of that this weekend.  We’ve let everybody on this floor here speak
today and haven’t stopped a soul.  And you know if we have continued
this for another two weeks, I’m going to make a bet with you right now,
the votes going to be exactly the same right now as it’s going to be in
two weeks.  So, let’s get on with this and enjoy our holiday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t know about the other members but has been
mentioned by…</p>

Senator Daniel these bills have been out there for a while and maybe you
don't read your emails, maybe you don't get messages from your LA about
what calls you've received, but I've received multiple calls over the
past several months about all of the provisions in this bill, both pro
and con. So people have had an opportunity to speak, people have had an
opportunity to make known what their views are, and this body
representing all of the people of North Carolina has had a full and
robust discussion about this issue over the past two days. Now let's
talk about some facts because facts - and I always attribute this to
John Adams. [AUDIO DROPS]
Bills, at least the portion that's garnered the most debate deals with
safety... [AUDIO DROPS]. They're huge problems, but we have an
obligation to protect the health of the...  [AUDIO DROPS]. Bill, I urge
you to support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none. Question before the Senate is the passage of the Senate Committee
Substitute House Bill 695 on its third reading. All in favor vote aye,
oppose the vote no, five seconds will be allowed for the voting and the
clerk will record the vote. 29 having voted in the affirmative and 12 in
the negative. Senate Committee Substitute the House Bill... [AUDIO
DROPS].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barefoot, Senator Clodfelter, thank you Mr.
President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] Personal privilege at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson you have the floor for your point of
personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. As most of you know and I'm
sure we're all aware of we have have the fourth of July coming up
tomorrow, and we celebrated our freedom and our family and our
independence, but it is also the most holiday that watermelons were
sold. A few years ago our U.S. Congress declared July the national month
of the fruit named watermelons. In 2011 we done the same here in North
Carolina, each of you has received I hope a watermelon and a sprite
melon in your offices including you Mr. President, and I hope y'all
enjoy it, and if the quality is not quite as good as you're accustomed
to receiving I apologize for all the rain but I can't control that. But
thank you all and happy fourth of July to all of you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further notices or announcements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. The democratic caucus at a
quarter til' twelve.
