This bill is basically a home builder's bill. It has three main parts of
it. Really two and a half main parts. I wanna say the depth now and say
this is a very simple bill. Very short bill. I'll go over the first set.
I'll go over it section by section. The first section deals with
inspections of homes being built, and I'd like to note before you</p>

<p id="05:00">
Before we get started, we do have two homebuilders in the room today and
Representative Brody is a homebuilder and I am also. So I'd like to go
over this so that we can both talk very knowledgeably about this.
Section One deals with the inspections that a homebuilder has to go
through to make sure the building he's building, the one or two family
dwelling, that he's building is subject to the Building Code of North
Carolina. I've got that right here. You guys can see how much is in
here. This is a Engineering Safety Structural Code and basically the
inspections are to make sure the homebuilder complies with this code
that we have in here. And basically it's for the structural integrity
and the safety of the home that's being built. At present, there's eight
inspections listed in the, our Building Code. Footer Inspection, a Slab
Inspection, a Foundation Inspection, a Frame and Rough In Installation,
a Fire Protection, and then a final inspection to make sure everything
looks good. What we would like to do is to make sure that these
inspections that were built under an Engineering Code for Safety and
Structural are the inspections that a homebuilder goes through, period.
These inspections are there because they've gone through the time of
Engineering practices and Engineering calculations and these are the
pertinent inspections for a safe and structurally sound built home. What
has been happening in other areas is there's been added inspections on
here. Now we don't, they may be, for instance, take the Footer
Inspection. There may be a couple of inspections associated with Footer
Inspection. You dig the footer, you pour it full of concrete, there's
several things you need to do. But there's, what is happening in some
locations, is there's other inspections added upon this. And you might
say that's not a big deal. You got to have a third or fourth or fifth
inspection on something that's not in this list. But what it does for
the homebuilder, he's got a customer waiting, and he's dedicated time
that he wants these homes built in. He's got people waiting, he's got
equipment waiting and that usually costs a lot of money. Now, when you
guys think about a home builder, you may think of these large
homebuilders that you see a lot in the urban areas, but I doubt,
Representative Brody and I are probably pretty close to the same, I
doubt he's got a big company behind him and I don't have a big company
behind me. We are kind of one trick horses so to speak. And so a delay
for us means a lot of dollars and sometimes even thousands of dollars on
the cost of the home. And you guys know where the homebuilder sector is
these days. It's probably one of the most devestating parts of the
business that we have. One of the most devestating sectors that we have
in North Carolina. But what we're trying to do is make sure that we
apply to this code, make sure we apply only this code because this code
was put in for sound Engineering practices and make sure we try to
reduce the costs and build the sector up a bit. That's the first
section.
The second section deals with the Code and when this gets updated
basically and what cycle it gets updated on. At present, it's a three
year cycle and that causes some issues. We had an issue back last year
in the Energy Code in how it was updated and the Code was actually
updated before the inspectors had the training and before Representative
Brody and I got our addition books so we were actually responsible for a
Code that we didn't know what we were supposed to be responsible for. So
going to the six-year cycle helps that. Helps get the data in there.
And, honestly, after two hundred years of building homes, three hundred,
four hundred years, there's not a whole lot of things to put in a new
code. If it's an Engineering practice, then those Engineering practices
are Physics and Geology and those things that are already proven through
time. Science is just not there as much. What you'll see mostly, that
most folks want to put in the Code are new products. Well, I've got a
better window glazing, so I want to get it in the Code. Well, this is
not for product placement. This is an Engineering Safety Code that we're
dealing with here, to make sure we build good houses and we build safe
houses. Those are the two main pieces.
The third piece is really some of the inspections we were seeing. We
were getting an inspection on inspecting cable wiring in a house, which
is low voltage wiring, there's no safety issues there, there's no
structural issues there, so it exempts the cabling in a house, the third
section does, from any of those inspections. And I'll be happy to answer
questions Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Hager. Are there questions for the
sponsor of the Bill? Representative Holley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I'm sorry, I've got a quick question. Under section
two, you said this for products. What do you mean? Like if windows have
to meet a certain code and a new company comes out with something that,
they can't put those windows in the home if they don't, for six years,
if they don't meet this Code?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Representative Holley for the...</p>

<p id="10:00">
but no, what I am saying is basically, this is a minimum code.  This is
the standard you build to.  You can upgrade.  You can put more
insulation in your house.  You can put better windows in there, you can
put better doors in there, exterior doors.  A lot of things you do
depends on what you want to spend on a house.  My district, for
instance, when I got elected in 2010, we had almost a 20%  unemployment.
 My folks can't afford those upgrades.  They can afford the basic house
and that's what we are trying to get a lot of my folks in. I imagine a
lot of your rural folks are in the same issue.  We've got to be careful
not to over build the code to price our folks out of homes.  And I think
they can upgrade to those new windows but they don't have to.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Question for the Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Concerning stakeholders, there might be some in the audience, I'm not
sure.  I don't know if the chair...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a list of people that wish to speak and if time allows depending
on the number of questions from the committee we will take that input
but it is the intent of the Chair to vote today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Terry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.  I simply want to ask a question regarding and I haven't
read it completely, the impact to green building.  You mentioned
products and I know there is a plethora, plenty of those, does this have
any impact on that sector, the green building sector?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you explain the green building, I'm not familiar with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am simply speaking about those efficiencies regarding new technologies
as it relates to buildings that don't have energy leakage and that sort
of thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And now, as far as the commercial code, you may be talking about the
commercial code, we are just talking about the residential code.  Yes
m'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Residential as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, and if you are talking about energy efficiency areas, is that what
you are talking about?  Okay, thank you.  What this does, this sets a
certain standard to the last upgrade that we had which was the energy
code upgrade.  It sets the standard.  Now you can always build above
that standard.  And you can always make your house more efficient.  You
can always add triple glazed windows instead of double glazed, you can
always do a lot of those things.  The code book is there to set the
minimum standard and saying this is where you need to build.  The code
book has traditionally, until recently, been a structural code to say if
you build a house this way, it won't sink and it won't fall down.  If
you build a staircase this way, then most likely you won't have
accidents on staircases.  If you build a house this way, then safety
wise, it is a good solid home.  Now, if you want, as a homeowner, want
to go above that, it is certainly your prerogative again, but folks in
my district struggle to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Move for a favorable report at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Representative Fulghum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question I had about the additional local or county codes, over and
above the North Carolina code, this does not exclude the county or local
codes from being greater, for example, in regards to geology or some
kind of special soil issue, or is that not correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fulghum, it does exclude them because what we want to do,
and I will give you a great example.  If there is an inspection in
Rutherford County where I live, because of the geology that we live in,
well that geology is not just unique to Rutherford County, it may be in
Cleveland County, or it may be in Bert County, it may be in others, but
there is an inspection that the folks discover needs to happen, we have
a process for driving that back up to the building code council, looking
to ascertain where that geology, doing some engineering studies, to know
if that was an adequate inspection or not, because most inspectors are
not engineers as you know. And then looking at where that same geology
would move to because, as you know, it may go to several counties and
then input that into our codes.  If we do it just for the county and the
county has that inspection then that look never happens, so it may be an
adequate inspection but it may just be happening in Rutherford County
and they may should have been doing it in Cleveland County also.  This
gives that mechanism to make that happen and even with the 6 year code
cycles, anybody can elevate up to the building code council any concerns
that can get put into the code.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McManus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My only concern, and someone came and talked
to me about this yesterday and answered a lot of questions and I really
appreciated that.  My only concern was changing from the 3 year cycle to
the 6 year cycle and I am struggling just a bit with that when I</p>

[Speaker]
The states araound us are still ??? on three year cycles and some are
examining it but right now thier on three year cycles
and i worry about why we would change that
[Speaker Changes]
Michican i think thats goin to a six year cycle for instance, and i
think everybody is looking to move that way and it is the burden it puts
on the builders at that time.
and with changing technology it changes that fast, you need to have
things that change in the code that are pernant for the code again,
if you believe its a structural and safety code theirs mechanisims if a
safety instant comes up
lets say for instance a hurricane hits the outer banks, there is a
different clip that needs to be on a house, to keep the roof from
pulling off, now there's huriccane clips on there now, but there is a
different design and its proven through engineering
then there is a mechanism for putting that in there, the code updates
are for the normal look for international code , if theres anything
different
now its usually just small new ???(time: 0:54) , there very simular,
theres very very unsusal have large issues in there , now these small
new ???(time:1:00) and updating the code, six years is not a long cycle
any other issues like huriccane clips, structural issues, job issues,
have a mechanism for getting in there within the six year cycle
so thers mechnisms in there its just the updates to the book its the
updates to the inspectors that cost money and frankly its a cost to the
builders,
[Speaker Changes]
thank you represntaive Brody,
[Speaker Changes to representative Rep 55 Mark Brody]
thank you mr chairmen and i just like to address briefly that question
the representaive for the cycle itself from a real practicle stand point
cause im a builder and i can probly say i average about 25 homes a year
over the last decade so its not real big but yet its a full time job
,and thats what i did,
the problem we run into on a practicle level is that the code gets
introduce for example in 2009 , the international building code, the
system takes that code and decides if north carolina wants to
participate in the code and that takes quite awile and the n once we
decide what we want to do that gets filtered to the local inspector
and by the time, and we're we, the builders are in this trial period, we
are building things along the way and then the inspector comes in and
says
and sometimes the inspectors are really good and say guess what, what i
need to tell this and this is goin to change, im going, we're going do
it this way now but, next one your going to have to do this but other
times we catch by surprise
that the new quotes come through and its probly close to three years
before we actually get it and then another six months to build it into
our system because you got to remember we got to deal with with multiple
building inspection juristictions that even have their
they like to interpretate , interpret what the state interpreted
differently, from what the state interpreted,  so we sort through that
and by the time get around that area its about three and a half years,
just in time for the 2012 code to come out and to talk about the what
are we gonna do next, maybe we should implement this right away or not,
its real confusing
[speaker changes]
is there a question in there,
[speaker changes to repsentative Brody]
no i wanted comment on
[spearker changes]
thank you sir but we're taking questions right now
ladies and gentalemen we will yield
representative Holley is recognized for another question
[speaker changes to representative 38 Yvonne Lewis Holley]
well actually he's anwsered some of my questions but i, the energy code
piece, look at what these codes are and i can see them being standard i
also know that the energy field is developing at a faster rate,with
energy effiency, at a faster rate because the new technologies are
constantly being introduce
is there something in here that if something came up they could
implement a new code,
[speaker changes]
reprentative Holley , i think the question has been asked three
different times if new technolgy that improves can it be used and the
anwser is yes the sets a floor of what the minimum is and also does not
allow creation of new regulations
[speaker changes to representative Holley]
you can still do some new regulations during this period if necessary.
[speaker changes]
would you like to address
[speaker changes]
thank you representative Holley , thank you mr. chairmen, resentaive
Holley there is a mechanism for getting a code into the code book , as
new products come in , if its deemed important enough, so i think if
some technology came in all of a sudden, to make a house completely
energy efficient, and it is required it could get into the code without
having to go through the six year cycle, there is a process for that ,
but as the chairmen said this is a  standard minimum building criteria,
and anybody can upgrade anything they want
,
this is a design to build an affordable house, for the average north ???</p>

disparaging about South Charlotte.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]None Taken
We have some members of the public that would like to speak. And we will
start with Ms. Joanna Reese. Would you please give us your name your
organization that you represent and limit your comments to three minutes
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman I am Joanna Reese with the
association of county commissioners and while we've had some mixed
response from our members largely the concern has been around moving
from a three year cycle to a six year cycle the way they explained it to
me is that moving to a six year cycle would put us somewhat for the
state out of compliance or out of line out of sync with the
international building code, That they would prefer to stay in the three
year cycle. There was some concern over limiting the number inspections
but mostly it was around the three year to six year cycle. Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Do we go ahead and get the comments and respond to
everything? Glenn Batten. Mr. Batten would you hold for a moment?
Sargent Barnes will help you with the microphone. Better yet,
Representative Louis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Anyway we don't have the problems in smaller
jurisdictions that occur in larger jurisdictions we have much smaller
scale much fewer of them. We do face similar problems. With the issue of
extra inspections we started doing the extra inspections on the winlow
provisions and when the flashing and house wrap started being a very
common thing. I've tried for twenty years to get people to flash windows
better and it took a couple years of bad weather before they actually
believed that they were not doing it properly. And nowadays we have
something to hang our hats on when I look at it. And a lot of times the
truth is I'm riding by looking at something else next door and I can see
what they have. It’s a very quick thing. If I have to go in I can take a
three pound hammer and I can tell you if the nail pattern has been
maintained and that's the only extra inspection we have over and above
those eight listed, And builders by and large are happy to get it in my
jurisdiction because number one if I'm there heck I'll look around and
if I see something obvious I'm going to tell them and you have to
establish a trust bond with builders. A lot of times there is an
adversarial nature to what we do but if you've got respect for each
other and you communicate with each other an extra inspection is not
going to cost a lot of money unless it is something truly exorbitant and
therefore I don't think the extra inspection is going to be a big issue
here and I urge you to consider that I'm well aware that there are some
codes that are not liked and the ?? code being a prime example, I hear
it every time I go out somewhere. And the other thing and I don't know
if this was pulled from the bill or not in respect to the building code
counsel, doing interpretations and putting them online. I know for a
fact that the North Carolina Building Association has three seminars a
year in all reaches of the state for four days where people come and we
attempt to achieve the consistency that is the desired goal here in this
and I think we do an excellent job of that and on behalf of the Builders
Inspectors Association I would just like to tell you that I am honored
to be here on their behalf. I thought I'd never find the day that I'd be
in a place like this. If anybody has any questions I'll do my best to
answer them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Batten. Is your last name spelled Batten?
And you represent The North Carolina Building Inspectors Association?
Thank you Sir. Chad Ray. You are appearing as an individual?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you for allowing me to have an opportunity to
speak to you. The first thing I'd like to do is thank each of you for
your service to our state. Not everybody bites off the bullet you bite
off and I know it's not easy so thank you. I'm not here to make big
waves either way</p>

on either side. What I personally believe is irrelevant in this case. I
personally believe that the three co-cycle is efficient and that it
works, but I'm here to tell you if you decide otherwise, like me and
every other build in their state, that's what we'll do. My main concern
is why this argument is being held here. There's no one in the building
world and no builder in North Carolina that I respect more than Dan
Tingen, who's here, a good friend of mine, and I don't understand why
this case isn't a Building Code Council, if Mr. Tingen and his council
decided this is what was best for the builders of North Carolina so bet
it, but I don't understand why this can all be decided without the
council is my main question. And I do only have a couple of statements
about what was made from our Chair, there, about the science. It's true
we have been building homes for thousands of years but we don't build
them the same way. We have indoor plumbing and electrical codes that
don't kill people and there's lots of things. The ceiling, the floor has
always been raised over time. It always will be raised over time and in
today's world things change at a faster pace than they ever have
technology-wise. Products do come out, and I'm not here representing any
product, could care less about a product, but things come out that make
people's lives more comfortable, saves them money, and most importantly
keeps them safer every day. Again, it's my person opinion, going to a
six-year cycle keeps those things out too long but, again, I'm a builder
and I'm a member of the association and whatever what it goes is fine
with me. But that's how I believe. And I thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Dan Tingen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. I appreciate the
opportunity to speak to you this morning and comment on this bill that I
thoroughly support. I am the Chairman of the North Carolina Building
Code Council. I'm not here to represent the North Carolina Building
Council today but I am a builder of over 35 years in the state of North
Carolina and can speak with some opinion about the items in this bill.
To go back, for a second, to something Mr. Ragis[?] commented on or
questioned, was why the Building Code Council was not dealing with this,
why was the legislature dealing with it, and in fact, in order to carry
this thing out the way it's being designed it would require legislative
authority and a statutory authority, which we do not have. Just, real
briefly, I know you have all received some correspondence from various
interested parties about this bill and I just want to take just a second
to run through some of these items. Some have defined this bill as
creating inflexibility and I would argue that, in fact, this bill is
going to be tremendously helpful to the industry and also to the
inspectors it's going to go assure the consistency of enforcement around
the state. One of the cornerstones to the legislative authority that we
have is that we have a statewide uniform code and this, to have a
statewide uniform enforcement policy behind that would be very, very
helpful and, in fact, will limit the exposure of local inspectors it
tell them exactly what he's supposed to be looking for. Local
departments have created their own unique set of inspections and has
created tremendous amount of burden on the industry. There was a time
before the economy fell that my company was doing about 25 houses a year
and I had people in various subdivisions, various locations, and they
understood the requirements to of that jurisdiction and unfortunately,
with the economy like it is, I'm down to just me. And as you can see
I've got a few grey hairs and I'm getting too old for this, a little
bit, but in the last 12 months I've done business in 5 different
jurisdictions. And quite honestly I can't keep it straight what my next
inspection is. So it is quite a burdensome process. One comment that's
been made that I think may need some clarification, and that is, from
time to time these model codes are referred to as national standards and
I want to be sure that members of the committee understand that the ICC
code volume, the model codes that we use as a basis for our codes are
not an industry standard. There's a tremendous difference between the
codes that we use as a model and what an industry standard would
represent and this is not an industry standard. The ICC is in the
business of making, of producing model codes just like I'm in the
business of building homes and they're in the business of selling code
books and that's what they're there for and we appreciate the work that
they do, it does help us, but it is not a national standard. With
regards to the legislation, it has been mentioned, questioned to me
about whether, why the code council would want to do interpretations.
And as I've read this bill I don't see that the code council  would be
doing interpretations. The only</p>

But, the words are the same. There needs to be, in order for this system
to work fairly across the state. By the way, let me say. A uniform state
code is unusual when you consider the codes in the rest of the country.
Some states don’t even have a building code. Okay? Most of the building
codes in this country are municipally based. The larger cities have
codes, but often the surrounding countryside does not. North Carolina
has been a pioneer in the protection of the public. We’ve had a building
code actually technically since colonial days. In 1935, this legislature
passed the system that we have now and they created the North Carolina
building code council. Which is a 17 member council with tremendous
expertise, categorical appointments. Who update the code not every three
years, but every time that it needs updating. We are not changing the
authority of the code, of the code council, under this legislation to
consider any change that needs to be made in the North Carolina building
code that they can make at any meeting that they hold. It is not we’re
delaying products. If there is a good idea that needs to be adopted in
North Carolina, there is nothing to prevent the proponent of that idea
to come forward at the next meeting of the building code council. And
say, this is the sort of the thing that needs to adopted in North
Carolina. Now, with respect to the number of inspections, the types of
inspections we’re talking about. The building code council, this
legislature has given the building code council the responsibility to
decide what are the number of inspections that are necessary in North
Carolina to make sure that we’re delivering safe housing in North
Carolina. The building code council has decided that number is eight.
Some local jurisdictions have decided they want some additional
inspections. All of this, but you’ve heard Mr. Tension say, they don’t
believe they have the authority in the absence of this legislation to
tell local governments that they can’t do more than the eight
inspections that are set forth in the code. This legislation encourages
any local jurisdiction that believes they ought to be doing inspections
in addition to the eight that are set forth in the code…

Mr. Carpenter, I need to cut you off. We’re out of time.

Thank you.

The motion before the committee. A motion of Rep. Bell is favorable to
the PCS unfavorable to the original bill. Serial referral to finance.
Any discussion or debate? Hearing none. All in favor of the motion say
aye. All opposed. Motion carries. Is there any further business for the
committee today? We are adjourned. Thank you.</p>
