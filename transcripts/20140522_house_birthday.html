add our efforts and achievements to theirs. May we be reminded that the
greatest reward of serving is not what we get for it, but what we become
because of it. May each of us become more caring because of the
compassion of our predecessors, may each of us become more loyal because
of the courage they showed, may each of us become more dedicated because
of the commitment they exhibited, and may all of us find ?? into giving
up ourselves to the end as we continue to give expression to the
principals we cherish and let us all say amen.

State capital; and
Whereas, for many years, the Assembly held session in homes,
courthouses, and other buildings throughout the State, including Bath,
Edenton, Fayetteville, Halifax, Hillsborough, Kinston, New Bern,
Smithfield, Tarboro, and Wilmington; and
Whereas, in 1788, the Constitutional Convention decided that the State's
capital should be located within 10 miles of Isaac Hunter's plantation
in Wake County; and
Whereas, in 1792, the Assembly appointed commissioners to select a site
for the new capital; and
Whereas, the commissioners purchased 1,000 acres from Joel Lane of Wake
County for $2,756; and
Whereas, Raleigh was chosen as the name of the new capital in honor of
Sir Walter Raleigh, who was responsible for sending the first colonists
to North Carolina; and
Whereas, Senator William Christmas, a surveyor chosen to lay out the new
city, based Raleigh's layout on the city of Philadelphia, which at that
time was the nation's capital; and
Whereas, construction of a State House, a simple, two-story brick
building, began in 1792, on Raleigh’s central square; and
Whereas, on December 30, 1794, the Assembly held its first session in
the State House; and
Whereas, the State House served as the State Capitol until it burned in
1831; and
Whereas, the cornerstone of the present State Capitol is constructed on
the site of the former State House; and
Whereas, 2014 marks the 220th anniversary of the Assembly's first
session in the State House, and it is an occasion worthy of celebration;
Now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives:
SECTION 1. The House of Representatives honors the memory of the early
Assembly members and acknowledges the 220th anniversary of the first
session held in the State House.
SECTION 2. This resolution is effective upon adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I see that? May I see that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution loudly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, we have convened in this
historic State House to commemorate the 220th anniversary of the first
session held here in Raleigh by the North Carolina General Assembly.
Now, this wasn’t the, this wasn’t the building they met in. It burnt
down in the late 1800s, in the 1800s. And so, after moving around the
state for several years, the legislature declared in 1788 that the state
government was to be located in Raleigh and, interestingly enough, the
original mandate required that the new capital be held within ten miles
of Isaac Hunter’s tavern, not just the plantation. They wanted to be
close enough to the best watering hole in town. The more things change,
the more things stay the same.
On December 30, 1794, the General Assembly convened for the first time
in the permanent state capital in Raleigh, and I don’t what scoundrel
convened all the state politicians under one roof near a tavern just two
days before New Year’s Eve. That was the 1795-96 General Assembly that
started meeting December 30th, 1794. And so, they got a early start, as
well.
The building we’re in today was completed in 1840 after a fire destroyed
the original State House in 1831. This building housed the entirety of
state government until 1888. And the state legislature continued to meet
here until the legislative building we, we meet in was completed in
1963.
So, in an effort to emphasize the role of this State House and bring the
legislature together with citizens, I would like to read a quote from
Kemp Battle commemorating the 100th year anniversary of the original
State House that was built in 1794.
The old State House was smaller than the present structure, but the
arrangement of the interior was about the same. The exterior was as
plain as a gigantic dog kennel. But it is doubtful that any building in
our state ever served so many uses or gave as much genuine pleasure. As
there was no other public hall in the city, the authorities were
generous in opening its passages below</p>

… and halls above for Fourth of July dinners, theatrical performances,
dancing balls and the religious congregations of all denominations. Many
a side has been split with laughter, many a throat made hoarse with
patriotic singing and furious shouting, many a head made to swim with
Fourth of July brandy and rum, many a heart’s transfixed through and
through by the dart of the God of Love, many a fantastic toe has been
tripped in the joking jig and lively reel, many eloquent speeches and
sermons uttered by zealous legislators or preachers burning with
missionary zeal in that homely old building. It was the people’s house
and the people were allowed to use it. I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? Representative
Martin, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman is recognized to debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Members, the
legislative building built in the early 60s is actually in my district;
the old state house is not, so we’ve left my district, so I’d encourage
you to hold off on spending your dollars until you get back to my
district. If you wonder why the line has gone that way, you’ll have to
ask the Gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis. With that said,
it’s a rare occasion that we get the whole session in this historic
building, and it’s a joy to me every time we do because it reminds me
that whatever we do in our short two-year terms here in the General
Assembly, whatever we do for the good or the ill of this state, whatever
we do, the state survives and will endure long after we’re gone. At the
same time, it reminds me of our obligation to do good works here whether
you’re Democrat, Republican, Libertarian or unaffiliated, that we all
hope to last 220 years in the future. I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill Brawley, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the revolu… resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Knowing Bill Brawley, that was Freudian. The Gentleman is
recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister
Speaker, and actually the revolution is something to reckon, because we
know how our forefathers established this nation with some ideas and
liberties which were unique in the history of the world. As we sit in
this old chamber in these desks, it would be almost appropriate to be
wearing prop coats, or even cutaway coats and powdered wigs, because
this is the very place to remember the early days of the Republic which
established a new standards of liberty for the entire world. We dress
formally when we meet and we have very formal rules and procedures. It
imparts a dignity to our proceedings no matter how divided we may be
over the issue, no matter how many arguments they may have, and there is
a specific reason for that. The deliberations of this body, this house
of the people, is exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind when
they created this great Republic which lead the world. When we are in
this chamber, we are here to do the people’s business and to conduct it
with all of the dignity and the decorum that it deserves. It has been my
privilege and my honor to serve with each and every one of you as we
have tried to live up to that great standard set so many years ago, and
for that reason I commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ??, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak
on the resolution, Mister Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman is
recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? over 20 years

shoes of my ancestors who helped build this place and be able to speak

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion. Further debate. Hearing no member rise or seeing no
member rise. The question before the House. The bill number? The
question before the House is the adoption of House Resolution 1175. With
that objection, we will take a voice vote. Is there objection? All those
in favor, say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[together] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, No. The Ayes have it. House Resolution 1175 has been
adopted with the order printed. Ladies and gentleman, we have a couple
of recognitions that I'd like to get to before we do take up a bill that
will require a roll-call vote. First, on behalf of all the members we
welcome former Senator Keith Presnell. He's in attendance today. Keith,
please make your presence known so we can welcome you. [clapping] Ladies
and gentleman, at the request of Representative Rayne Brown, I'd like to
take a moment of personal privilege, to recognize someone, to my envy, a
gallery in the center. We have a gallery, an individual, a teacher, who
is very special to Representative Rayne Brown. She's asked me to expand
our usual recognition. I've agreed to do that. This individual was the
choral director at J.E. Holmes Middle School and John Motley Morehead
High School in Eden for 38 years. Through his work he has touched the
lives of literally thousands of individuals. In addition, he has
profoundly influenced music education through his mentor-ship of
educators who teach, not only in our state, but across the country.
Representative Brown further states that this teacher was a
disciplinarian, without having to discipline. A raised eyebrow or a hint
of a frown was all that was needed. Such was the admiration and respect
for this man. He always gave the best that was in him to give and his
students could give nothing less than the same in return. Perfectly and
uniquely suited for his life's work he was inducted this year in the
North Carolina Music Educator's Hall of Fame and today will receive the
Order of the Longleaf Pine for his service to our state. So, on behalf
of Rayne Brown, Representative Bert Jones, Rockingham County, and his
current representative, Duane Hall, we would like to recognize Duane
Best and his wife Gloria. Please stand so we can welcome you and show
our gratitude. [clapping] Representative Pittman, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask ?? in recognition as ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman, upon a motion of Representative Larry Pittman from
Cabarrus County, the Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the
gallery to...and I hope that I pronounce his name right, Madison Drewen
from Davidson, NC. She raised money and awareness for Father's House
International Ghana which provides shelter and education to former child
slaves. Madison won the 2014 Prudential Spirit of Community award for
her volunteer service. Madison is accompanied by Chase Drewan, Taylor
Marshall, Zachary Marshall, Sarah Garett, and Andrew Garett all with
leadership xx. They all have endeavored to bring awareness to the fact
that child slavery still exists. We would like to extend our thanks to
her and her peers. Please stand and let us welcome you.</p>

<p id="20:00">
[clapping]
Representative Pittman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. When I was informed of what
Madison Drouin and her colleagues there have done, I was just so
inspired, I feel they need to be recognized. Madison lives in Davidson,
its actually part of Davidson, Anderson, it's actually various counties
in my District. Some of her friends live in the parish and some live out
there in the area. Madison is a student at Liberty Christian Academy.
Madison became aware of the plight of children who had been forced into
slavery, including trafficking, and the need to help them. There is a
home in Ghana, Father's House International, which ministers to those
children and Madison felt the need to help them. So she helped plan a
fundraiser, donated the proceeds of the sale of this book that she wrote
about the life cycle of the silk moth - I've got it down here, here it
is. Sales from this book were given to assist the Father's House
International. She wanted to draw attention to the fact that slavery
still exists, that many children fall prey to it, and there needs to be
a worldwide effort to put an end to this.  Madison has achieved national
recognition for exemplary voluntary service by receiving the 2014
Prudential Spirit of Community Award, and she was presented this award
in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School
Principals, which honors young volunteers across America who had
demonstrated extraordinary commitment in serving communities. Madison
earned this??award by giving generously of her time and her energy in
the effort to bring awareness to the plight and dangers of child
slavery, and to provide financially for their assistance. The success of
the State of North Carolina and of our Nation, I believe, depends a lot
upon the strength of such young people as this, to strengthen our
communities. The overall vitality of American society, I believe,
depends on such children as this, growing into the leaders that our
world needs. And so the dedication that Madison and these other young
people have shown, this calls, I believe should be honoured.  We see so
much bad news on TV and in the newspapers all the time. I believe that
when we have a group of young people like this - there's a group of
about 50 of them in this leadership link - when we have young people
like this, who are willing to give of their time and their strength, not
just to pursue something for themselves, but to help others who are less
fortunate than they are. What they do is based on their commitment to
Jesus Christ, which means a lot to me as a pastor. When we have
something like this, I think it needs to be recognized. I want to see
more of this in the news. This should be covered. This should be
exalted. This should be honoured. I am proud of these young people, and
I feel a little bit better about the future of our State and our Nation
thinking that they someday will be helping to lead. God bless you, and
thank you!

… and the intent from 2012, and right now it is a time-sensitive bill
because there’s some activity that is occurring across the state of
North Carolina, so the bill needs to be signed and in place by June 1.
The bill actually just restores the language for the occupancy tax and
the collection of sales tax on rental property that is rented, your
private residence that’s rented less than 15 days, and with that said
Mister Speaker, I would ask for the support of the body for the bill.

We're waiting for the tally, ladies and gentleman. Maybe this is the
best indication of how things have changed over the last 220 years. That
takes 15 seconds now. The house be at ease.
[??]
For a couple of guys who don't like to speak much on the floor they did
a good job.
I really do think we ought to have our composite in this building next
year.
Well that would be neat.
Run for speaker and make that happen.
Let's do that. That'll be my platform.
Take a good picture.
We'll take the picture at one. . .
The house will come to order. 109 having voted in the affirmative and
none in the negative, Senate bill 261 has passed its second reading and
will remain on the calendar.
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
Point of personal privilege.
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, members. I just confirmed with the house
next-door [??] to make sure that I'm correct. One of the things I can do
to help with office assignments and back when this building was being
used as the Capitol, initially the member's office was a seat on the
house floor and the Corps staff was contained back there. I don't think
that  would work now. I put this to you and all the operations was here
and it's neat to think about how things have changed. I think
Representitive Shiffer makes some good comments about the larger
historical context of the change over time. Just the practical things
that have changed over 200 odd years. We're operating this building and
we have remained in this chamber we're seated in right now for the six
hour, seven hour long session. Representatitve Fleetwood, I don't know
what it was like then but I can imagine there's been some interesting
stuff. But the one thing I think we can all be proud of today, although
we do not regularly meet from this building, we meet down the street is
that it is still the people's house, and it's an honor for us to use it
today and I just want to express my appreciation for all the efforts of
what th Corps office did and the Seargent at Arms staff and being here
today what they did to provide for a smooth transition. Thank you for
all all the work you did [??]. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentleman, as the count for the Senate bill was being made
and Senator Moore came forward, I though the was going to offer for the
count. That put me in a state of panic. So I'm glad to hear that you
were doing your homework. And I think just to echo what Representative
Moore</p>

Representative Bert Jones and I were walking down here and he said he
really looks forward to these sessions. I did too. It’s a tradition that
hopefully will continue with the next Speaker, but it really reminds you
of how we are very much a part of history, and 100, 200 years from now,
Mickey will probably still be serving, but the rest of us will move on,
but we really have to think about the gravity of what we do here because
it truly is writing pages in history. Pages, if you could please come
forward, and Representative Martin. Is Abbey in the Chamber? Do we know
if Abbey Martin is in the Chamber? Her daughter was an honorary page
today. We’re sorry we didn’t see her in the Chamber, but wanted to
acknowledge that she’s been here serving the House today. If the pages
would please come forward, we’d like to thank you for your service this
week. Members, as we were debating the ‘raise the age’ bill yesterday
and a couple of our members talked about crazy 15-year-olds and
16-year-olds, I went to a few of the pages up in the dais and said
“Nothing personal.” They said they understood it, but I thought it’s a
particularly interesting matter for them to be present to hear the
debate. But pages, we want to thank you for your service to the House
this week. You’ve got the special treat of meeting in this historic
building. I hope that over the course of the week, you’ve learned a
little bit about how the legislative process works. I hope someday it
will inspire some of you to come back and serve in the House Chamber. I
hope you’ll share this experience with your friends and family members
and encourage them to come back and serve as a page as well. Thank you
very much for your service. Ladies and Gentlemen, let’s show our
appreciation. You may now return to your stations. Notices and
announcements? Representative Warren, please state your purpose.

Chapel United Methodist Church, located in Woodley, North Carolina,
celebrated its 175th anniversary. Founded on January 17th, 1839, the
church has been the spiritual home for hundreds of families in Rowan
County. It has consistently provided the community with a reliable house
of worship and spiritual enrichment, where Christian family values can
be passed down from generation to generation. Mister Speaker, I’d like
you and my colleagues to join me in congratulating ?? Chapel United
Methodist Church on faithfully executing its mission statement to,
quote, “follow Christ, make disciples, and lovingly serve others through
our gifts and talents,” unquote. Thank you, Mister Speaker. I yield the
