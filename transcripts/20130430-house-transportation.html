Committee members let's take our seats, and I want to call the April
30th transportation meeting to order. And first let's greet our
Sergeants at Arms Carlton Adams, Charles Godwin, Martha Parrish, Antoine
Marshall. We have pages, if you'll stand and wave as I call your name.
Kaylen Kacura, Wake County, Representative Stam. Kaitlyn Mons, Harnett
County, Representative Tillis. Kiera Rose, Wake County, Representative
Storms, B Storms. Carrington Royals, Harnett County, Representative
Lewis. And Christian Campbell, Bladen County, Representative Brisson.
Thank you all for being here. Thank you for your service today. Ladies
and gentlemen, we've got one bill on the agenda. We cleared the agenda
for this one bill. And I'm going to introduce my coach here,
Representative Bill Brawley to talk about House Bill 817, Strategic
Transportation Investments. And we have a PCS. I need a motion for PCS
to be before us. Okay, I've got Representative Torbett. All in favor say
aye. All opposed no. You're recognized Representative Brawley.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Thank you Mr. Chairman. A couple weeks ago the governor
made an announcement of a new transportation initiative. And I was
trying to think how to put this whole thing in context today and I
realized something. The current transportation methodology for North
Carolina came out in 1989. And in 1989, I was a technical guy with a
computer company. I traveled all over North Carolina. I had a computer
on my desktop about as big as a microwave oven. It had 40MB hard drive
and ran MS-DOS 3.0. I traveled around. I had a phone card and a pocket
full of quarters for transportation. And the way that I would access
things remotely was I had three 5.25 floppy disk drives with EasyWriter
II and a couple of other things that I would put in demo machines when I
worked with my dealers. Now I carry a phone where I can surf the web. I
can do all kinds of things. And there's a thousand times the storage and
power in my phone than there was in my whole computer. I would not go
back to the way I did business in 1989. But if we're beginning to wonder
why the way we do roads isn't working so well, it's not 1989. We have
new methodologies for determining traffic, new methodologies for
determining the impact of roads on economic development, and we're not
taking advantage of that. So, the idea is to refocus through more
strategic priorities in building roads. So, let's build the roads we
need, instead of the ones we can fund, and let's not worry about the
silo programs. But except we're dealing with transportation, and that
may include rail, it may include bridges, it may include airports. But
what we really need is if we're going to put billions of dollars into
transportation, let's get billions of dollars of results. To start I
would like to ask the chairman's indulgence that Jim Trogdon, Chief
Operating Officer of DOT, give us an abbreviated overview of the
governor's transportation initiative.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Brawley, we recognize General Trogdon.
I'm not sure we've got our IT connection or not. Okay. Okay, General
Trogdon can talk through it I believe.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Yes sir, Mr. Chairman and Representative Brawley, thank
you very much. And understand that if you didn't get a chance to see the
presentation that the governor and secretary made with the speaker and
president pro tem, we have those slides available and I'll make sure
everyone on this committee gets it. I did have a few that I wanted to
focus on, but since the IT's not working, I'll do that verbally. It's on
here?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Yes?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Mr. Chairman?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Yes, Representative Brawley?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Would this not be reminiscent to Representative
Brawley's 1989 he was referencing?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Point well taken.
SPEAKER CHANGES: I'll start by saying that really the problem that
exists that we've identified, and the secretary, cause the
infrastructure</p>

…Is over the next 10 years in North Carolina using the projections on
population growth across the state over 10 years we will grow 1.3
million in population so that line will go up over the next 10 years. At
the same time primarily because of lower consumption due to café
standards, more fuel efficient vehicles are primarily our motor fuel tax
revenue will continue to decrease about 2% rate but in total over that
10 year period we anticipate their bill 1.7 billion dollar reduction in
revenues from the current and that’s total of all transportation
dollars. So, if you look over 10 years with a 1.7 billion dollar
reduction with that line going down and the population growing up that
creates what the Governor and Secretary referred to is the
infrastructure gap.
[Laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[Inaudible] ___[01:04]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just back in 1989.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, part of that solution is how do we address those shrinking revenues
and if you kept up with current events I know Virginia has passed in
their latest session how they are transitioning away from dependence on
motor fuels? Virginia solution was go to a variable rate on the whole so
that we currently use our motor fuels but have be much less relying on
motor fuels and they are going to be more relied on sales tax, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[Inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, part of addressing that gap is how do we address those revenues over
the future and what we need to look like as you already know we have one
of the highest, if not the highest motor fuels tax rates in the South
East and about the 10 times in the nation and where 60% of our revenue
comes from that so we are heavily dependent on motor fuels and if we
know that’s a declining revenue source in the future just like Virginia
what do we are gonna do to address that short fall? Being the 10th
highest in motor fuels tax we are still 48 out of 50 states in total
revenues per miles. So, in simple terms that tells me if this was stock
I’m under diversified in my stocks and I’m overly dependent on the
performance of the few and the biggest part of that if you is declining
overtime. So, how do we address that revenue shortfall that’s part of
the problem and what we are proposing to do is start aggressively
working with the General Assembly and the municipalities and counties
and all of the transportation groups across the state and let it over
the next 12 months determine which direction we need to go and North
Carolina resolve this problem, the revenue problem in the long run.
However in the short run, we believe what we need to do is efficient as
we possibly can with our existing resources and that’s why we are here
today to talk about that efficiency standpoint and how do we move from
where we have been since 1989 when the Trust Fund passed and in 99 when
it passed it was probably one of the most significant pieces of
legislation at least in the South East that moved us from that what we
are in the 70s and 80s into the gangs that we made since then but as
even if you talk to many of the people and I have talked personally with
the Secretary of Transportation then Jim Harrington and he said, “Hey,
when we pass that we really thought we would be looking at it and
adjusting it as we go every 10 years and we have not.” So, maybe it’s
the time as Representative Brawley said, “We need to think about
changing from our computer technology and communications technology of
that age to where do we need to go over the next, at least 10 years as
we move forward.” So, the simple proposal which I know fiscal research
briefed the details on the bill but it is take our existing trust fund
revenue not adjusting the revenue, the total revenue pictures but it
still allocating it to the regions and then ultimately down to the
divisions the way they are now where all projects complete in the
division that we have three levels of competition and that would be a
statewide level of competition for strategic projects across the state
then a regional level and then finally the division level with the funds
and the trust fund coming and the percentage is shown 40% to the
statewide tier competition, 40% to the regional and 20% to the division.
That way projects would have…

<p id="10:00">
Opportunities to compete, and the best projects could compete and
succeed across the state.  Probably unlike what you see though in
Virginia, the way it is now, most of the capital projects in that state
are built in the northern Virginia region, in the tidewater area with
the majority of the rest of the state being primarily just maintenance
and operations.  We still have seven regional distributions, is what
we’re calling here, so you get the statewide competition of those
critical projects, and then you still have a regional distribution, and
then down to the division the way it is today.  In our initial
assessment and the reason why we believe this is the right time to
consider this, is running good candidate projects that are already in
our transportation improvement program, many of them, though not funded,
but running those projects through this type of formula, purely on just
the quantitative, then they’ll discuss the details on the bill on the
qualitative or local rankings at the regional and division level, but
purely based on quantitative data, and our assessment, we would see this
kind of return, because, we go from what we have currently planned –
about 175 projects in our current ten year plan – to possibly a little
over 260, but then the real impact is the short term and long term jobs
impact, which would be from 174,000 projected, based on running it, and
we would do that based on running it through what we call the TREDIS
model, which is transportation and economic development infrastructure
system.  We’d run that through the models and this is the kind of
results that we got.  The simple explanation for this is two things:
it’s using money in the trust fund, primarily what we’ve been spending
on secondary road paving and aid to municipalities, but also it focuses
more heavily across the state on travel time savings.  And with travel
time savings, you get increased productivity, and with increased
productivity that affects your GDP, and the GDP is what’s creating the
potential for the long term increase in employment.  This includes both
short term and long-term employment opportunities.  So with that, I give
it back to Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you General.  Were there questions for the, were you going to take
questions for Mr ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I did have one hand that went up, that I saw, was Representative
Hamilton, was that for General Trogdon?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you General Trogdon.  Just curious, you
mentioned the highway trust fund money, taking it from secondary and
local, does that include Powellville money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, the proposal is that, we have two components.  And I’ll start with
secondary road paving.  Right now we pave secondary roads in North
Carolina, this isn’t maintenance, this is just the secondary road
paving, going from unpaved to paved.  A portion of that, and the
majority of it, comes through the highway fund, and a portion comes from
the trust fund.  The proposal is to eliminate the trust fund side of
that and maintain the highway fund until an adequate number of secondary
roads are paved across the state.  With the aid to municipalities, the
proposal is to only fund it out of the highway fund, but keep that
program whole as it is today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that does include Powellville money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is the Powellville money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is the Powellville what you’re referring to.  Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.  That will make it, steady, or will it increase
with inflation, will it stay flat?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s revenue dependent.  It’s all revenue dependent.  But right now it
would be a percentage of the highway fund.  So as we move forward it’s
still going to have those challenges that we’ve already identified on,
if highway funds continue to go down at a significant rate, we’ve got to
address that, and that’s the proposal to address that over the next
twelve months
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just as point, we’re going to have an explanation of the bill, and we
can get into the weeds in greater detail on that, and there will also be
some additional information, I know everybody’s question’s going to be,
“How does this affect my district?” and we’re generating a lot of that
information and it’ll be distributed via e-mail.  Also want you to know
this is not the entire trip for this bill, this is to start with a
framework, or structure.  From here it will go to Finance, where a lot
of the money questions will start to be answered.  From Finance it will
then go to Appropriations where it gets a full bath there.  So everyone
in this room is going to hear this bill twice.</p>

Go ahead today the hearing examiner financial appropriations which every

things that we call this together, send money committees with a larger

transportation owner you of that is, that's all right of like the way
and have fun jobs. Over the buildup, though some of the five names
Mattel will hold until jobs as gesture of the bill that's OK (SPEAKER
CHANGES)  with share price that suggested they have questions
specifically about the macro level for the general in the information is
presented yes and are willing to talk about operation and we'll get the
bill explanation or the names of dead-and-black well , I can assure me
that you have a question I think for general fund and the builder and
this may be getting into what rich and a brawl ensued we need to
deferring you can say that again after year when I ask you one of baton
looking at the project's up your own 175 going up to 260 and my
understanding is that the bill before us if we go forward in school and
the result and that encouraged and we get here the explanation earlier
about the guy at the infrastructure gap) use going down so I'm just
trying to be clear in my mind as to whether the increase in projects as
a result of simply shifting resources that will not be replaced
elsewhere are or are you see it as soon as some change in finding that
would continue to fund other projects that some more wobbles to what
they are currently being funded, but withdrew from resources yes but
there's a brawl your present job now it to say that Mr. Chairman, Mr.
Bush should the voters think sir, but I do have the specific on question
may require four jolt Rodney king live, in any way you choose but that
is what made by the way we question to which allowed them talked about
all running various things from one which my question would be of much
walked away from all include an Amtrak 111 or all projects in the 85

request an?? (SPEAKER CHANGES)  that if I can mention one thing in our
view of the bill also last page Perry is a discussion of the future
forms which will rush to come back to this body of storytellers first
amendment down to be approved, both as a specific answer that a job to
get from them to lose some of the actual all built draft a bill! Until
we go through the entire process will begin estimate from our son

<p id="25:00">
the ability of the overall state to compete.  Some of the examples is in
rural areas, for example, you would include them in statewide projects
to give them access to job centers so people could work.  In some areas,
like, say, northeastern part of the state, rather than trying to build
them another road to Raleigh, build them roads into Hampton roads.  Do
the model kind of like the Fort Mill v Charlotte thing.  Fort Mill was a
small, sleepy town south of Charlotte.  South Carolina put in a big
chunk of I-77 to get them into Charlotte.  People began to work in
Charlotte.  The next thing you know, people moving into the area moved
into Fort Mill, worked in Charlotte.  Now, they started getting small
and medium-sized business headquarters out of Charlotte into South
Carolina.  Now some of the big companies are moving out of Charlotte
into South Carolina.  If they can do it to us, why can't we do it to
them?  But the idea is these are data-driven.  We're getting some of the
old politics out of it.  The second group for the regional, they are 70%
data-driven, 30% local decision making.  The people actually in the area
will have a lot of windage on the application of the money.  The
divisional money's 50/50.  It's 50% data, 50% local input.  Those
projects that rank as a state level project are also eligible for
finding in the regional and the divisional level.  Regional projects are
also fundable at the division level.  There is encouragement for some
toll projects where significant money will come in through
public/private partnerships.  This will also have a provision that, in
areas where a major road improvement is tolled, rather than completely
financed by the state, the amount of funding provided by the other
entity- there's a percentage of that that will also be spent on related
road projects in the same area, and in the hot lanes and tolls projects
we anticipate, such as the I-77, as the state shares in the revenue,
that will be dedicated to additional road projects in the area of the
tolling project, so, there is incentive there to bring in other funds.
It also, if other areas bring in additional funds, they're incented with
additional matching funds from the state.  The unpaved roads program
currently allocates the money by county.  There are some counties that
are close to built out, while some of the more rural counties have a
much more significant number of unpaved roads.  This would shift more
money to paving roads for the first time in those counties that have a
lot of unpaved roads.  Power bill money is designed to hold these cities
harmless, and also will give them some growth in the later years.
Additional, relative thing: on the statewide programs, in five year
slices, there is a limit of any project exceeding 10% of the total
money, so regardless of how important for the state an entire project
is, it can't suck up all of the money, and it will be divided up over
the five year program.  Now, there is the opportunity for local
participation that can advance projects, but the idea is we want to,
regardless of what the data says, we just can't have one thing become a
black hole.  We're also doing away with a lot of the silos.  Right now,
this is transportation money.  If you have a project where you need more
rail than roads, if that's where the benefit is, then you need rail
money.  If you need roads, you need road money.  Right now, we're seeing
in come areas, people are building what they can get funded, not what
they need, so the idea is to shift from, this is what you can get
funded, just do that.  It's to what do you need to grow your area?  How
do we build the state by allocating scarce resources?  We're not coming
up with new sources of revenue, but I'm gonna say yet, because I'm
pretty sure the governor will be visiting that, but that's beyond the
scope of this bill.  We're just trying to get a structure to start
building roads in a more realistic vein, and, at this point, if there
are more questions for staff or for me and the rest of the sponsors.
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I wrote down Representative Starnes twice, so he really wants to
ask a question.  Representative Starnes.

roads and in the western part of the state where I live we have counties
that have a lot of miles of unpaved roads.  But it says this want to go
to a statewide prioritization.  How do you prioritize statewide unpaved
roads across the state typically we've done it by county and shouldn't
it give a little more weight the counties that have the most miles of
unpaved roads?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank the gentleman for his question. That's the idea
behind the statewide prioritization.  Right now the money is more or
less spread out everywhere.  Everybody gets to name their 10 worst roads
and they're all paved.  And if you've got 12 roads and you've paved 10
and then Burt county's got 120 roads and you've paved 10 does that make
sense.  Wouldn't it make sense to pave more roads in Burt county.  And
that's the idea that's it's a statewide spread rather than county by
county spread.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok.  Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  In section 4.8 it says that currently
administrative cost is 4.8 percent and it will go to the appropriation,
the amount appropriated by law.  What is that, I mean?  Could that be
higher or lower than the 4.8%?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir I'm on finance.  I don't know what appropriations
gonna do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could staff address that please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe Ann has got an answer for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am the camera and fiscal research.  With the highway
trust fund growth it would seem that the administration shouldn't be
based on the percentage growth that is allowable in the highway trust
fund.  The intent is to have that amount be lower than the growth rate
for administration. But it will be up to the appropriation chairs to
determine how much lower.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did that answer your question Representative Starnes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dobson.  If you hold it down it might
work.  You tried that.  Ok.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The recorder won't pick it up if you don't use the
microphone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That might be a good thing.  Just a quick comment if I
may Mr. Chairman. I think I'm understanding the concept and overall I
agree with it.  I do share some concerns of the other members but I
think it's a good thing.  I do have some concerns about how it is going
to effect rural areas like Representative Wilkins has talked about.  So
I hope that we can get some of those resolved and maybe you and I can
sit down and discuss that at a later date and I'll leave it at that for
now Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  Representative Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I am encouraged by the bills
sponsor's mention of the northeast and feeding in to an economic center
in the Hampton Road Center area.  What I'm having a difficult time
understanding is the practicalities of how a project like that might
occur because the way that I'm reading this is that there are two
competing policies. One is the  increasing the speed to reach and that's
one of the issues that's considered.  The other is the policy in the
rural areas is transportation to unlock opportunity that's not being
tapped into right now.  So it couldn't be measured by the same data of
increasing speed to access.  And what I'm reading in the 40% on the
state's side is that it's mainly driven by increasing access or speed
times as opposed to unlocking economic potential.  The first time I see
it mentioned is in the regional 40% which then talks about economic
impact but it doesn't give me any specifics in regards to how it might
be weighted in the consideration.  So I was wondering if you might be
able to elaborate some on that.  You know, you gave that example of that
project.  How might that work its way through the system that's being
set up here to be competitive in the 40% state area?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Tine, I can't give you the details but
I can tell you the example was used by the governor as something that
this program would allow to happen which is difficult to do now.  But
the idea of connecting Northeast North Carolina into the economic
centers of North Carolina makes less sense than tie you into a closed
economic center in Virginia. So having said that Governor McCrory used
that</p>

Example of what he wanted to do, I would, I would infer from that that
your chances are good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mister Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I, and I understand that, but as we move towards the data driven,
taking the politics out of it, it, it might not matter what the Governor
ends up saying that he's for or against, and the real competing
political issue is untapping economic potential versus beating up
highways, access to economic centers. So is there some provision that
I'm missing or is there some consideration that might bring some balance
under the state 40%, which is the one I'm afraid the rural issue, rural
areas might be excluded from. Is there some consideration to bring
economic impact, future impact into that portion of the state
appropriation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think what I would infer from your question is you're really talking
more of a formula level decision and this has not been fleshed out to
that point. This is more of a framework as those decision methodologies
are developed in greater detail, they will be brought back to the joint
transportation oversight committee, and in fact the bill requires
reporting to begin this August, and there will be, there's several
dates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
October first and January one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah. So that, that question hasn't been completely answered, but will
be, and this body will have a significant say in the answer to that
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, I believe Anne may be able to add to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For members, the prioritization process is being set by the DOT
prioritization office, and they have established a lengthy work group
with NPOs and RPOs which will be setting the criteria. And the RPOs may
choose for example to say, well, this is what the formula we want for
our area, as opposed to a, the one size fits all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Representative Tine, does that, does that help?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That sounds like the local, how the region and the division. My question
is at the state level, which according to the information that DOT put
out in their slide presentation, the state, the only mention for the
criteria was the speed side of it, so it sounded like some of those
decisions were already being made and again I'd be happy to work with
you as well as we move this bill through, and I appreciate the time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could be helpful, stepping out of my chair just a second, I believe
connectivity is the term that's being used also, connecting rural and
other areas that make economic sense. And also the formulas, as we said,
will be coming back for our oversight. It's different times the rest of
the year. This is the framework we're looking at now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Additional questions? Okay, Representative Starnes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Well, you know I've never been a real fan of toll roads, but
I guess this bill embraces them by increasing the projects from five to
nine. Is that an accurate statement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is a potential for more toll roads.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions? Comments? Representative Hamilton?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the appropriate time I'll make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Any further comments? Okay, and you'll make a motion and include a
referral to finance, correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may have to help me with that mister Chair. I was gonna make a
motion favorable for the PCS, unfavorable to the original. Let's see a
referral to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. You all have heard the motion. Any additional comments or
questions? All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed no. Thank you, Representative Brawley. Have no further business,
we're adjourned.</p>
