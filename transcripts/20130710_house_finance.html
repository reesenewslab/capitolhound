<p id="00:00">
Good morning, and if our members would please take their seats we're
going to get started. Our first bill this morning will be Senate bill
407, electronic vehicle lien title, Sen. Brunstetter welcome to the
House finance committee sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair.
Members, what this bill does is it requires Department of Motor Vehicles
to implement a statewide electronic lien titling system by July 2014. It
mandates participation in the ELT by all individuals and lien holders
normally engaged in the business or practice. It provides 2 different
ways for the DMV to get there. We are now going to- We are the last
state on the eastern seaboard to move towards electronic lien titling,
all other states have it. We've worked hard on this bill, there's no
opposition, and I'd ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Starnes, you're recognized sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a motion for a favorable report on Senate bill 407, any further
debate or discussion?
All in favor will say &quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, &quot;no&quot;.
Thank you Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you members very much. I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??, You'll need to report who's gonna run it on the floor on all the
Senate bills.
Our next bill will be Senate bill 378, assess propane dealers,
distributors, Sen. Jackson, welcome to the finance committee this
morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chairman, good morning members.
I appreciate the opportunity to be with you this morning. This actually
authorizes this bill will a voluntary assessment on propane to not
exceed 2/10 of 1%. It is being requested by the dealers and
distributors. This will sorta join 19 other commodity groups in North
Carolina that has assessment and it is also a voluntary one where you
can get your money back and the end, and we'd appreciate your support on
this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Collins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's the appropriate time, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I make a motion that we give a favorable report to Senate bill 378.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a motion for a favorable report. Further discussion or debate?
Seeing none, all in favor will say &quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, &quot;no&quot;?
Thank you Senator, and would you report who's going to handle the bill
for you on the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
Okay, Rep. Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Thank you all, committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hartsell, Senate bill 248. Choice of hearing aid specialist. Sen.
Hartsell, are you in the room, sir?
Obviously not.
Senate bill 571, various plates and Rep. Iler, if you're going to handle
this bill sir, would you like to have staff?
Sen. Brock, it's your bill sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Alexander is recognized for a motion that we will have the PCS
before us for the purpose of discussion. All in favor will say
&quot;aye&quot;?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, &quot;no&quot;?
You may proceed, Sen. Brock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair.
Members of the committee, this is the annual special license plate bill.
I believe if this bill hasn't covered every organization, award, or
honor in the state of North Carolina, then we'll probably get through
the rest- the other 2 next year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Brock, would you like for staff to expand on a couple of provisions
that are different in the PCS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
if staff would just expand on the PCS please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Griffin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This PCS just does a couple of things, it adds 3 new plates that were
just requested since the bill came out of transportation, one for the
professional engineers, one for the North Carolina Bluegrass
Association, and one for the Sneeds Ferry Shrimp Festival. One thing
that this bill did was to eliminate the $10 special registration plate
fee for certain military plates, and the combat veteran plane and the
military veteran plate expired as of July 1st, 2013 along with a number
of other plates due to a provision that was put in place a couple of
years ago. So this PCS re-enacts those plates, and keeps the elimination
of the $10 for those plates. And finally, there were provisions,
specific provisions for 2 towns in the bill, but this bill already has a
provision that would authorize any municipality if it gets 300
applications to produce</p>

<p id="05:00">
play for that municipality so that general authorization would cover any
town, so we did not need the specific authorization.  So those are the
only changes in this bill, since it left House transportation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Thank you Madame Chair just at the appropriate time
for a motion please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’ll accept that motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’d like to make a motion to get a favorable report
to the PCS for Senate Bill 571 unfavorable to the original.  Madame
Chair if the bill sponsor wishes I’d be glad to present the bill to
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That’ll be great.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   I have one question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  We put in it trigger mechanism I think a couple of
years ago that staff referred to that if they don't get their three
hundred applications within a certain period of time then they just sort
of dropped off the list, which makes sense to me but I don't understand
the reason why we're reenacting three plates that didn’t get the
applications and we’re to reinstating them.  Senator Brock can you tell
me the logic behind that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Make sure I get, they’re all the military plates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    I understand that but I mean obviously there wasn’t
enough interest in them to issue them so whether it's a military plate
or a Carolina Thunderbird tag if there's no interest why do we want to
keep perpetuating them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Starnes I might be able to answer
that, that was just a terrorist call we thought it was the courteous
thing to do to extend to the military one more timeframe if in effect
these people were out of the country, and back now of whatever we
thought it was nothing more than a courtesy sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  So that they would, will a clock start running again
on these tags?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Madam chair, just a quick inquiry for
staff of the bill sponsor, on page 6 line 2 I've read the bill summary,
but I'm still not sure what it stands for.   I was just curious.
Somebody could tell me it appears actually be a standard license plate.
I don’t know what it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Representative Lewis are you talking about on the
PCS page 6, line 2 did you say?  Are you talking about line 9?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Madame Chair I apologize if I don’t have the correct
version.  It reads IBPOEW.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, it’s a very long acronym it stands for the
improved benevolent and protective order of the elks of the world.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    You want to go any farther Representative Lewis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Based on the ayes of the chair I will not follow-up.
 Thank you Madame Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  We have a motion to give the PCS a favorable
unfavorable to the original.  All in favor will say aye.  All opposed
No.  Senator Brock, Representative Warren will handle the bill for you
sir.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Thank you Madame Chair members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Our next bill up will be Senate Bill 248 choice of
hearing aid specialist.  Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Madam Chair, members of the committee 248
arises from the Treaty of Versailles of the last session. I say that
when the hearing aide specialist and the audiologist separated not
necessarily amicably, but they separated.  As result of that however, it
is from a fiscal perspective the boards are hearing aide license and
have asked that they be authorized to increase the fee for the initial
application. that's what the bill does it authorizes them to go from 250
to 500, subject to the adoption of rules and going through the
rulemaking process and that I don't think they’ll go to that begin with,
but that is and I think the fiscal folks.  There’s a fiscal</p>

<p id="10:00">
And all this relating to that. There was some question about increasing
the fee for continuing and its not being done in this particular
instance. This is what they think they need this to do the examinations
and proceed with it. Other wise the bill has been through a couple,
actually a bunch of committees relating to the underline issues
associated with identifying hearing aid specialist as the opportunity
for individuals to accept them and other wise. I'll be glad to try to
answer any questions, I probably muddled it up more than I should have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions from the committee? There are folks from the
outside that would like to make comments. If not the chairs waiting for
a motion. Representative Moffitt, you're recognized for a motion sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you madam chair I was paying attention. I move
for a favorable report on senate bill 248. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You've
heard the motion, further questions debate? See none. All in favor will
say aye. All opposed no. Senator Hartsell, would you like to designate
someone to handle [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffit was so kind to
make that motion, if he would be so happy to, I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGER] Senator Hartsell if you would just remain there we
will hear Senate bill 103 Hartsell. Representative BAlly is recognized
for a motion that we have the PSC before us for the purpose of
discussion. All in favor will say aye. All opposed no. Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you madam chair members of the committee. You
may recognize this as having seen it before. You have. The bill
originally was an extension of a sunset with some definition of language
clarifying certain specific items. And how you would calculate
majorities and that sort of thing. The original authority sun-setted on
July the first. And it is necessary to do, the kinds that have this
lengthy item in here so that we can clear up the fact that it extended
the sunsets for the two years it was in the original bill that you've
already adopted from this committee. And cleans up. They're couple of
currently pending applications or circumstances I think that they are in
southern Ardell county. It may be something else but that's the only one
I really know of. I'll be glad to try to answer any other questions.
Special assessments bonds are literally just that. They are a mechanism
to bond assessments that are voluntary. And voluntarily  ??. Similar tot
he way that cities and towns use to at one time fund pavement of streets
and roads and certain questions. I'd be glad to try to answer any
questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions from the committee?
Representative Brawley from Ardell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I might comment
on it. This is, currently theres an application pending in Ardell
county. And if we dont backdate this they lose basically two years of
work that they put into this. And alot of folks have been concerned
about this being a tax. It is an assessment which the owners of the
properties agreed to put upon themselves to pay off the debts for doing
the paving and the infrastructure. In the project their developing. And
at the appropriate time I move we give the post committee substitute a
favorable report unfavorable to the original bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further comments from the committee? You've heard the motion. All in
favor will say aye. All opposed no. Ok Senator Hartsfell would you like
to designate somebody. I'd be glad to volunteer. Maybe I can do better
this time. Senate bill 81, Senator Rucho welcome to the finance
committee. Representative Luis you're recognized for a motion PSC.
Representative Luis moves that we have the PSC before us ..</p>

<p id="15:00">
purpose of discussion. All in favor will say aye. All opposed no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the committee. This
is a bill that came over to us earlier in the session from the Senate.
Senator Rucho is here, he filed the original draft. We've made enough
changes and there's been a long enough process, he agreed to let us
handle it over here.
As a brief background, Charlotte has the Charlotte-Douglas International
Airport, a nice large, successful airport, with the hub of US Air. It's
facing some interesting changes coming up to it. One change we just had
was we got a new city manager, and the city manager right now is partly
over the airport. We have a fabulous airport director who is about to
retire, so there is going to be some transition there. And as you know,
of course, the airport is the-- the airline itself, US Air is merging.
So in essence we're going to have a new airport.
Our hub is a unique hub. The hub in Charlotte is unique in the fact that
it has very few of their passengers are actually people who board in
Charlotte. Most of them are transfer passengers. As a result of that, it
means that our hub is not as secure as it would be if most of your
passengers were people who lived in the area and were boarding the
planes there. Therefore, we have been very sensitive to the idea that
Charlotte has stayed a really successful airport because we had great
value and low rates. So it was in the airline's best interest to use us
as a hub, even if there weren't a lot of people jumping on the planes in
Charlotte, because they knew that they could operate their flights more
efficiently through Charlotte. Therefore, that is how we've grown to be
a great hub. But as you know, being the hub has brought some wonderful
economic development opportunities to the Charlotte region, and frankly
to the state as a whole. It has kind of put us on a lot of people's map.
Now that we've got that, with the process of people doing all the
transfer flights, we really need to keep that hub in Charlotte. As a
result of that, some conversations that started earlier in the year with
various stakeholders, and by the time session started, there were a
group of people that felt very strongly that for the future success, not
as a judgment on the way the airport had been done before, but for the
future success, the model that seemed to be gaining the most traction
and seemed to be most successful was the idea of an airport authority.
Senator Rucho filed a bill, we took it through the Senate. It was
controversial. You don't have to be in Charlotte to know that it was a
controversial bill. When it got over to the House, we said, &quot;Okay,
Charlotte, we understand that you're upset about this. We'll give you
some time to look at the alternatives and to try to do something
else.&quot;
So they hired a consultant. We'd agreed to a delay until after the
consultant had done their report, with the assumption that once the
consultant did their report and brought it back, that we would then be
able to work together with the city of Charlotte to come up with
whatever the consultant said and come up with the best option. The
consultant came back at the beginning of May and said, &quot;Hey, you've
got a great run airport. All those things I just told you. But, for the
long-term success of the airport, we suggest that you ought to have it
as an airport authority.&quot;
We thought at that point that the city would say, &quot;Okay, it's not
our preference, but we'll work with y'all on figuring out how to
structure an airport authority.&quot; That was not their reaction. Their
reaction, frankly, was to dig in and to then shoot their messenger,
which was their consultant that they paid for, and also turn around,
frankly, and shoot us a good bit on- that we were part of the problem.
I'll admit, having been a former county commissioner, I was pretty
floored by the reaction that they had, that they would not work with us.
Since the time that study came out in early May, we have continued
behind the scenes, quietly, to try to work with our city council people
to figure out a way for us to all sit down at the table and work on
things. On June 26 we sent the city council an unprecedented offer. When
you had this removed out of your committee, it was here in the
committee, it was supposed to be heard. We moved it out of this
committee over to rules, because we had turned it into a study. We
proposed to the city council a study that we felt balanced everybody's
interests and gave everybody at the table a vote to decide, what is the
best option for the Charlotte airport. Should the best option be leaving
it like it is, making changes, something in between, or an airport
authority?
As of Monday night, they have rejected that offer, and have instead
invited us to come and participate in their study which would basically
mean a non-voting, sit in the audience and give us feedback role for the
legislature on their procedure on looking at what would be the best for
the future of the airport. With no other options, since we had
acknowledged our preference for an authority, they had acknowledged
their preference to leave everything like it is, we offered to have an
opportunity to sit together and talk.</p>

<p id="20:00">
we have before you an airport authority.  As I go through the bill what
I’d like to do is show how we took the study. I got the study here.  We
took the study by the consultants and  tried to incorporate as many of
their suggestions into the body of this version of the authorities as we
could,  We also because for the last two months we have been talking
with various council members and hearing their concerns we also tried to
put into place some of their concerns.  They do not support this bill.
We still think that it is the best for the future of the Charlotte
airport and frankly their consultant believes that an authority is best
for the Charlotte airport so with all of that said, I appreciate the
chair moving things so quickly before us, so that we had time to do
that. I would like to go through the bill and give you an overview of
what it is and then staff will fill me in where I am either incorrect or
incomplete and then will open up for questions.  The first change we
made if you look at the title Enact to create the Charlotte Douglas
international Airport authority.  The original version, said regional
Airport.  We heard back from people in Charlotte that they wanted the
formal actual title so we now have the Charlotte Douglas international
Airport.  On sections one, two and three are pretty standard types of
things in your definitions which are accustomed to seeing. Section four
is a change from the original version,  One of the complaints we heard
from the city and one of the feedback that came from the consultant was
that the makeup of the authority needed to be a little more local
centric and so what we did in and also smaller they were concerned about
it being a little  larger, so we took it down to eleven members two of
those will be registered voters in the city of Charlotte, appointed by
the mayor at least one of whom shall be a resident of the west side. I
just visit west side of the city of Charlotte.  The reason for that is
that one it gives them two votes on the Council, but one of the issues
that the city had brought up was their concern since the airport is on
the west side of town.  How do we make sure that the voices of the
people on the west side of town are heard?  We’ll make sure that one of
those appointments is a resident of the west side of Charlotte.
Interestingly, the consultant had said that one of the sometimes short
fallings of authorities is because they aren’t elected they don't hear
from their constituents as much  so we’re  making sure the constituents
voice is going to be heard in that piece.  Same reason for a number two
where  the city of Charlotte appoints, the Council appoints two people
one from the west side of town.  Then because it is a regional airport
we went to the county that the airport is in and all the surrounding
counties and had each of them appoint one person to speak to be part of
this board that left us with basically five members from Mecklenburg
County and five members from outside Mecklenburg County, so we need in
the top right vote, so we added the eleventh member and the eleventh
member will be appointed by the other ten members and there again that’s
to make sure that the body as a whole can come together and not have
this sense of us against them, so we viewed that as a way to keep them
working together and to address the concerns that people have had of
making sure it doesn't become a split divisive board.  Then if you go
down to the rest of section four, all the way through, frankly, section
five there’s a pretty standard boilerplate language on a how people are
appointed,  how they’re replaced.  Whether they can be sued, do they get
compensated for travel, all that kind of stuff that we normally have.
If you flip over to page four, section six, this too is boilerplate
language for an authority.  It basically talks about all the stuff that
they shall have the power and authority to do an authority as it says a
body, both corporate and politic, meaning it does have a lot of the same
authorities that you would expect an elected body to have, including
things like the power of condemnation.  But those are pretty standard
and were in the original bill.  If you flip over to a page six you get
into the things about at the bottom of a section six B, the whole issue
of taxes, licenses and fees but because they have that sort of
authority that’s pretty standard.  Section seven is where we start doing
the actual transfer.   One thing I failed to mention in the other part,
one of the things we did do is phase this, so what you will see is that
the people who are going to be appointed to be on the authority will be
appointed as of October first.  The reason for that is to give the all
of the bodies that are doing appointment the time to come through and
make sure that they can appoint the best qualified people and to get
that done, given summer vacations and everything else we gave in October
first. However, the actual transfer of the authority will not be until
January 1, 2014 and that’s what’s happening in section seven.  The
reason for that</p>

<p id="25:00">
Are two fold.  One, is because the city is doing a study of many of the
thing the consultant brought up.  We haven’t in any way interfered with
their study.  So they will continue to do their study, and later on you
will see a section where we then tell these new authority members, they
were appointed in October, that in that interim you are to work with the
city on the results of their study. So as we do the transfer and begin
to move this over you are incorporating whatever they come up with in
their study. So that we can make sure we’re not missing anything.  So
the authority members will be appointed in October, the transfer will
happen January 1, the city’s study’s due to be done at the end of
December.  So that should give them time to work together. That’s what’s
happening in Section 7.  7b is the actual transfer, 7b2 are the
protections on that. You go to Sections on page 87b3, upon the request
of the exec.  director of the authority the city of Charlotte shall
continue to provide such administration services to the authority as it
currently provides and shall receive compensation.  The consultant had
brought up a concern that when you do these transfers, what happens is
in the process of the transfer you still need some of the city, access
to some of the city employees and everybody agrees that’s a good thing.
So what this does is allows that seamless transfer to happen but the
authority will be compensating the city for the cost of that.  So it
allows them to continue whatever they need to continue and also to be
compensated for the pieces that need to be compensated for. If you look
at the bottom of that page, there is a new section. Section 7f. This
came up both with the city and with the consultant.  The city’s put an
investment in this airport since they built it in 1930 something and
some people accused it as a taking.  And so we’re saying, we’ll
compensate you for it. You look through, if you read this it says, in
consideration of the property they’ll go through and figure out what has
not been compensated, what do you do compensation for, and once we
resolve all that, the authority will compensate you if there’s shown to
be any need for compensation.  Of course some people thin there’s none,
some people think there’s a bunch.  This provides an avenue for them to
go and figure out what that compensation needs to be and provides that
the authority will compensate the city. Sections 8, 9, most of the rest
of this up to section 12 are pretty standard about making reports.
They’ll make reports not only to Charlotte but all the surrounding
counties. When you get down to section 13 on page 9 line 34, this is
where we explicitly state that in its initial decisions the authority
shall consider the consultant recommendations made to the city of
Charlotte in 2013 considering governance of the airport. So that means
the government study will be included in what they do. Section 14 says
basically if they do all of this and when it goes in place in January
they say, you know you should have added this provision in your bill or
you should not have added this provision or whatever, this allows them
to come back to us in the short session and tell us if we need to make
changes to this documents.  There again, we’re trying to work with the
city, we couldn’t get that cooperation and so if by chance we’ve missed
something between us listening to them and what their consultant said
they can come back and fix it in the short session.  Let’s see, and the
rest is the implementation, it  does say that in Section 15, in between
the period between October 1 and December 31st, that interim period,
that he city’s  employees will be available to the authority members for
any kind of consultation that they have. This is to make sure that we
continue to keep those lines of communication open and so it’s
authorizing the city employees who haven’t transferred yet will still be
able to communicate with the authority members. That is the gist of it,
staff did I misrepresent something or miss something?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, you’re recognized for an amendment to do a
technical.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes this is an amendment that says on page 2 lines  22 through 23,
delete the phrase west city and substitute the words west side.  And as
a member of the committee, I’d move approval of this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members you have the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It says the same thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yea it’ll do it under both but we’ll need to make that change. We need
to make it under both the city council appointments and the mayor’s
appointment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lines 20 and 23.It does say it, my bad.  It does, 20 and 23.  Thank you.

Members of the committee, you have the amendment before you, so debate,
discussion on the amendment. Seeing none, Rep. Samuelson has moved for
approval of the amendment, all in favor will say &quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, &quot;no&quot;.
?? back on the bill. Questions on the bill. Rep. Brawley, do you have
something that you would like to add? Anything?
Questions from the committee?
Rep. Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairman, and this question is to the bill sponsors, I
guess. When you were going through the history of what is happening with
the consultant's reports and the recommendations and the city study vs.
having an opportunity to sit down with the legislature, you indicated we
had previously moved toward having a study bill ourselves and the city
is now proposing a study. Why is there not some combination or effort
for both parties to conduct these studies? You said they invited us as
the legislature to participate in their study, we had a study bill, but
now we have a bill that just moves ahead, it seems that both parties
recognized the need for a study period but we're now just moving ahead
with something. Is there a reason why we're now ignored our own
recommendation to have a study?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's a  very good question. We offered to them an unprecedented study.
That study would have given equal voices to the House, the Senate, and
the city council. Equal as in co-chairing, equal votes, equal setting of
the agenda, we put all options for the airport on the table that could
be studied. We treated them as equal partners in working on this
decision. First, not only did they then refuse to participate in a study
that would have treated everybody as equals, and I use the analogy,
everybody at the dais, everybody with a vote, everybody with the ability
to influence it without asking us questions about it frankly when I call
a number of them over the weekend, even though it was 10 days later,
none of them- the ones I got had not even read the study that we had
sent them. They said well why don't you come participate in our study?
In their study, it is a manager doing their study, and the city council
would be the only voting members. So what they were saying to us, we
offered to them co-equal voting power. What they offered to us was why
don't you come and sit in the audience and listen to our study and
provide some feedback, but we will keep the final vote. We didn't feel
like that was good faith, because what they had indicated to us in the
way that we waited them to do their- their first request was let us hire
a consultant and do a study. We said okay. So we waited, and gave them
time to hire a consultant. They rejected the consultant's decision
because they didn't like it. They said they had grounds for doing it,
and that's fine, but we waited, in other word's we've been in good
faith, and everything we've told them we would do and in every offer,
and they've rejected it. And so at this point we were like- we actually
considered. We actually considered doing the study and just having them
okay you're not going to agree, fine. Don't appoint anybody, we'll do
the study without. There was questions as to whether their staff would
be available to us, whether they'd allow their staff to be available to
us, and then if they didn't participate in the study, we'd come back in
the short session and they'd still fight us. And so
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Hall, do you have a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, I've got passion on this one. I've just never treated that
way by my city council.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Thank you Madam Chair.
Has there been a public survey of any type? You talked about the we and
the they, I know you all represent the citizens of Charlotte and
Mecklinburg county, so I guess the question goes back to the citizens,
has there been any survey or testing of the preference of the citizens
of Mecklinburg county regarding
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have not done any kind of polling and I would say from email traffic
over the time, it waxes and wanes in various directions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I looked through the bill and I see that there's some requirements in
the bill for existing contracts and etc. to be carried out, and I'll try
to go to the specific section. I believe it's number 7 line 23 on page
8, and it indicates that they will comply with the employment and human
resources policies of the current board.</p>

?? reference to any contract and procedures and requirements in here if
it is then I missed it. Can you tell me how this new entity that is
being created is bound by the existing policy regarding contracting and
those matters that had been the traditional method of doing business for
the airport authority that exists now[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'll let staff
correct me if I'm wrong but my understanding is we provided for the
initial transfer of the contracts but once those contracts expired they
are not bound by them. The consultant, one of their comments in the
prose of authority was ability sometimes of authorities to not have to
be bound by certain types of conditions that government controlled
entities do but I will let staff[SPEAKER CHANGES]Is your question
Representative Lewis whether the normal process for the[SPEAKER

Halls Representative Hall is your question whether is the authority be
bound by the same state law purchasing contract requirements as the
city[SPEAKER CHANGES]or the same purchasing requiring policies that are
currently being used by the authority and specifically my reference is
again is going to be to local and small business contracting
opportunities, minority and women contracting opportunities if the
current authority has such procedures and practices [SPEAKER CHANGES]May
I address that?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Hall
this is a special case minority satisfies and small business contracts
are neither governed by city of Charlotte policies or state but by the
federal government because it's an airport and receives funding from the
FAA city of Charlotte contracting regulations do not apply to the
airport in the same way they do the other departments because they are
frequently superceded by the federal government and in those cases
specifically the ones you mentioned the federal government regulations
take precedence over both our and city of Charlotte[SPEAKER CHANGES]okay
thank you[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Terry[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank
you, Ms. Chairman I have a number of questions if I may on page eight,
eight and nine  about the transfer of property and benefits to the
compensation to the city of Charlotte what if they don't agree on the
compensation now maybe I don't understand this we keep talking about we
and they  and we and they don't does not the city of Charlotte have
complete authority over the airport currently so they own it and they're
saying we're inviting you to participate in our process that you're
saying  no we want you to be a partner in what we want to do I don't
understand some of that and the compensation what if city of Charlotte
does not agree with the compensation on that another question is
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative ?? if we can take the time
Representative Samuelson you want to take the question one
please[SPEAKER CHANGES]on the first on the part of we versus they
remember that back in the twenties the state gave to the cities the
permission to develop airports so once again this is one of those things
where they are able to do that because the state gave them permission to
do that and then on the other part about letting legally or whatever
they do if they can't agree I'll let staff answer that part[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Mr. Cowan[SPEAKER CHANGES]could you repeat the question[SPEAKER
CHANGES]She wants to know if basically in these Representative ?? will
you please repeat your question for Mr. Cowan[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you
Ms Chairman what on the compensation for the city of Charlotte if the
city of Charlotte disagrees with the compensation will the county board
or whoever who will be making that decision about what the compensation
should be like we're talking about this what happen to ?? who's going to
make that determination and if there's disagreement on this compensation
please who determines that[SPEAKER CHANGES]the city has control over the
airport service through December 31, our city policies will govern over
the airport as of December 31,??.... says the employees are transferred

The city of Charlotte on that date after January 1st and after the
authority can adopt its own personal policies as to its employees
[Speaker Changes] Follow up.
[Speaker Changes]  I wasn’t talking about employees. I am taking about
compensation for principal interest on the bonds and indemnities and if
they disagree on that. For them taking the Airport, you need copies for
them taking this Airport.
[Speaker Changes] Well I think that obviously there could be
disagreements between the authority and the city over the amount of
compensation. Obviously the courts are available to resolve the issue.
[Speaker Changes] Thank You. One more question
[Speaker Changes]  Yes Madam
[Speaker Changes] About the employees from the city. Will they be grand
fathered in to working for the authority when the transfer comes or will
they be teaching new people how to do their job and when it becomes a
regional authority will they then be eulogized because they are no
longer working for the Airport and they are working for the city?
[Speaker Changes] Rep Brawley
[Speaker Changes] Rep Holley , the employees will be transferred with
the seniority in tact their pay in-tact because this is a governmental
entity their benefits and their current local government employees
pension plans would be made available to them. When the authorities
created it  applies to the secretary of state to be added to be added
the pension program. As a matter of fact is that permission is not being
denied. Essentially, their benefits everything would move in tact to the
authority as if they can change to a different department within the
city.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you one more question
[Speaker Changes] Yes Madam
[Speaker Changes] Other question is regarding the different county
entities that are part of it. Like to make a statement  to me a regional
airport authority that’s going to be regional. If you are going to have
if you have a number of airports  in the airports in the region, they
would also be participating in the authority. It’s my understanding is
that some of these counties have their own airports. Yet they are going
to have a say [??] airports, but the authority would have a say in this.
I don’t see where this fairness is there?  We are going to do regional
authority issuing encompass all the airports in the region as a cohesive
body and to give some body, you are giving some of these counties to
have their own independent Airports. The ability to have a say is
something that they don’t have a piece of the puzzle. They have their
own. I want to know is there something in the future where those
airports would be coming in to the fold of the authority or not.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Brawley
[Speaker Changes] No Madam. All of the airports in the six county
regions except the Charlotte Douglas are general aviation airports. They
are not airport that supports  regularly scheduled airline services.
This is the only international airport hub in the region. It is the
economic impact over the entire area is what makes it important and is
the reason for the transition to the regional authority. Because it is
not just an airport for the private aircrafts  with all those come in
and fly out. There re several airports in Mecklenburg County that are
covered by the authority and would not be,. It’s only the international
airport
[Speaker Changes] Rep Alexander
[Speaker Changes] Thank you very much Chairman . First I want to commend
my colleague on the work that they have done on this measure since they
came out of the senate. It has been greatly improved. I want to
acknowledge it. I have some problems with it. Some of it stems from the
fact that I served for a couple of terms on the Charlotte Douglas
Airport committee. I am a resident on the west side of the city. In fact
planes fly over my house every day multiple times. And I actually used
to represent the airport before last change in district.</p>

<p id="45:00">
...the line, so I have more than a passing interest in history with it.
And because of that, I am profoundly concerned that what I, what I
started on the Airport Evaluation Committee it was in the old, we
talking about the old airport. We were just beginning to deal with
building the core of the new terminal, and that Josh Birmingham was the
gentleman who ran the airport at that time and was helping to shape the
vision for the airport. At that time Jerry Orr was one of his
assistants. There has been a long history of support for the development
of that airport stemming from decisions that the city of Charlotte made.
And as Representative Samuelson has acknowledged, that has gotten us to
the point right now where we're one of the lowest cost airports in the
country, if not the lowest cost airport in the country. And, in part
because of that, I think it's incumbent upon us to not rush to
judgement. One of my key problems with this is that the bill already has
concluded what the best structure going forward is, yet the consultants
point out that of the ten largest airports in the country right now, I
think seven of them are not run by authorities. The consultants also
point out that most of the time when you change governmental structures
it's because of a problem. But everyone acknowledges that there is no
problem right now with the way the airport is managed and in its
direction. In doing some research and in going over the bill, one of the
things that I've uncovered is a discussion about what just compensation
might be. Some folks estimate that it could be as high as three or four
billion dollars. Now I don't know if that, if it would go that high, but
if it did, that in effect would have an immediate impact on our tax
structure. It would, in effect, be a way of, in order to gain control of
an asset through an authority, we would impose a ta-, what amounts to a
tax on everybody in the state of North Carolina. Now, again, I don't
know to what extent that those figures make any sense. Some people are
gonna argue that it's much lower. Some folks may argue that it's much
higher, but I think that's one of the kinds of things that needs to be
very carefully considered. I would submit to the members of the
committee that this is not something that we should rush to judgement
on. It is sufficiently important because everyone agrees that the
airport is a, is a tremendous economic engine. And it's the kind of
thing that we, we might be best served by holding over for a much more
comprehensive discussion in the short session. One in which we have an
opportunity to have the product of everything that the city is doing now
through this, through the manager study. And have it, everything on the
table in front of us. So I, again, I commend you for what you've done.
You've brought this measure a mighty long way, but again, I would urge
the members of the committee to, to pause and to not precipitously rush
ahead. We do have time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one clarification or correction to your remarks.
If you look on page 8, line 50, any amount to be paid by the authority
to the city pursuant to this subsection shall be paid from future
revenues from the operation of the airport. It's not gonna be paid by
the taxpayers of North Carolina as a tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Rodney Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. Representative Holley basically
asked my question about, and I'll ask it again specifically. It troubles
me, Representative...</p>

Now, we did have the slowdown on the house side to say okay. We're
willing to talk about it with you. In the beginning there was an
outreach on the senate side to the city. It was rejected and the bill
moved forward. The house had a slower time to less time and said look,
we'll slow it down and talk about it and the city rejected it. So I
think what we have to recognize is this has been - and for members of
this committee if you have not been following it on a week by week
basis, there are a lot of nuances involved with this whole issue. This
is an issue that a lot of county and its city council members,
candidates that are running for reelection have polled on this. And it's
polling pretty high [??] no too, but I'm one who says politics is about
compromise.
So we know that the majority will vote to support this bill. It probably
would have passed coming out of the senate but it was slowed down and
the city said no. I'd like to just ask - and for the record of said this
same at committee and I'll say it at transportation, I'll say it in
here. My husband has been the assistant aviation director at the airport
for 32 years so I know a little bit about the Charlotte airport and how
it works, the politics, the business component, the federal connections,
all of it. I will also tell you that there are 200 plus employees that
have been sitting on pins and needles throughout this whole process here
at the state level. They have no certainty about what's going t happen
to their benefits, to their vacation, you're allowed to carry it over.
They're sitting there concerned. So my question Madame Chair and then a
follow-up comment if you will, my question is what is the message that
we send to these 200 plus employees? What's going to happen to their
jobs when this becomes a total transfer January the first?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Their existing contracts will transfer with the
benefits in place. what will happen after that no one knows. The plus to
them is that rather than trying to do a study where we weren't sure if
the city was going to participate and dragging this out for another year
or 18 months they will now have the certainty that as of January 1 their
contracts will transfer over and that authority will then determine what
happens finally. Brit at least they've got some certainty now of what
the path forward is. No one can give anybody certainty in this day and
age about any job anywhere including all of us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes Ma'am. Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Well, if this authority bill had not come forward
they'd have quite a bit of certainty, the 200 plus, maybe a small
percentage would not but..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I would [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] representative Samuelson please let the member
complete her remarks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you. The airport was only going to grow, is
only going to grow, and my follow-up question is specifically to their
retirement benefits going forward as of January 1st. And maybe Madame
Chair this is for staff, if they are let go do their benefits continue?
And they are listening, they are listening to this committee today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Carney I believe Representative
Brawley might be able to address that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yeah, the airport authorities [??] employees of the
city of Charlotte are part of the local governments retirement plan
which is administered by the state, and this as an entity would be able
to join the plan. They would make an application to the secretary of
state and upon approval would become members of the plan and then
everything would then just move over. So everything should remain
intact. I'm not aware of a case where an authority like this was created
and was refused permission to join the local government plans
administered by the state. By the way, the money that's currently paid
for the benefits of the airport employees is from airport revenue, so
that the source of funding for them will remain intact. And I would also
say there was...</p>

?? ...hurting people.  Four or forty-eight members of security lost
their jobs when CMPD took over security at the airport, but I would
suggest as I know Gene and people that are at the airport are going to
be, probably, more valued by an airport authority which is focused to
just on that entity.  Then they might be by city council that has
multiple departments with whom they're dealing.  They will be the
favorite employees of a very focused body. That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madame Chairman, may I continue?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm glad you answered that because I wanted the both
sponsors to answer that question not me for the employees that are
listening.  I have heard the discussion for several years from, through
my husband and others, at the airport, about Charlotte Douglas becoming
an authority.  I've heard it for the last fifteen years of my marriage
and, but it was never acted upon by the governing body, locally.  No one
ever took it forward to them to say, &quot;Let's discuss this.&quot;
That's, that's kind of what has happened here, they were bypassed,
initially.  Rumors were circling that there was a bill up here and yes,
sure enough, a bill appeared and then, they were reached out to.  The
consultant did members recommend, ultimately, in the future, that this
VIEN [??] authority.  I don't, I think that members, people in our
community don't understand the process, but the consultant also said,
and I'm sorry I don't have the report in front of me, there were various
things things that still needed to happen, that still needed to be
looked at, and there were still questions that needed to be answered,
and they are not all in this bill, and I know that you've written us a
clause in here that they shall consider.  Well, what is really needed
here, in my opinion, is mediation between the state and the city. To
just come in and say, &quot;Stop, sit down, work it out.&quot;  I'm
sorry we didn't have mediator with the proposal that the state came back
and offered.  I just don't think for my city, for moving forward that
it's the right time today to vote in reaction to, we want a good role
working and talking, I still think there could have been an opportunity.
 One more shot, take this interim period to continue the talking.  If
they want to keep their study and the state keep the study, come
together then.  This is a major airport.  The major airport in this
country.  We don't compare to RDU and we're saying overnight, within six
months, &quot;Wham-o, you're an authority.&quot;  Now we can put all
these little sections in here and say, &quot;Shall, may, will.&quot;  At
the end of the day, we're going to find ourselves, by saying, &quot;Take
it or leave it.&quot;  At the end of the day, we're going to be involved
in a lawsuit.  It happened in Asheville.  The state said, &quot;Wham,
you're an authority.&quot;  They're in a lawsuit.  I just don't think,
or whether should be an authority or not, that is what you're voting on
today as a state knowing that this city government does not want it.
So, I would ask you to vote &quot;No&quot; to let's take a little more
time and, again, I do, my hat goes off to Representative Samuelson and
Representative Brawley, and Speaker tell us, and Senator Richard [??]
for agreeing to take the time to look at this a little further.  I just
wish you would continue with your cooler heads and let it wait a little
longer.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions from the committee?  There outside
visitors that would like to make comments?  Sir, if you would come
before the microphone, hold the button down.  We give you a few minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madame Chair.  Representative Samuelson and
Brawley and Sarah DaRocha.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, if you will identify yourself and who you
represent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I'm ready with that.  I'm the legislative liaison
for the City of Charlotte and I, too, would like to start off by
thanking Representative Samuel...</p>

to take place and to allow for other communications to take place. We
appreciate the fact that we have been able to come to your offices and
talk to you about this issue for last several months and for continuing
your open door policy you have always had in the past. I'd like to first
start off by saying that the city has not closed the door on
communications with the delegations with the general assembly. In the
Mayor's letter that came to representative Samuelson earlier this week,
she said that a consensus can not be reached on council to support the
study commission. There was not a outright objection in fact that there
was even a meeting held at the council on this issue and were the issues
that was brought up was the composition of the study committee. At the
end of the day, understand that the house and senate are separate
institutions so as the study council, we'd all be represented equally
however only one third (1/3) of the appointees would come from city
councils and the other two thirds (2/3) would come from the house in
senate. My council did not see that is very equal. Also, we have started
studies, detailed studies on  financial procurement contracts, human
resources and other issues to continue making Charlotte Douglas
International Airport the best airport around. It is known right now as
the lowest cost major hob U.S Airport. We want to continue it in that
position. And we have undertaken those studies to continue it and that
position for the long term. We also have not closed the door on changing
the governance structure at the airport and a resolution that was passed
the city council by June 10th, they said that they'd like to get an
Airport governance structure that best achieves the objectives of
keeping the Charlotte Douglas International Airport as one of the best
performing and lowest cost major hub airports. That is still our goal
and whether that evolves to becoming a authority or keeping it as a
department in the city government or some other model, we are open to
those suggestions. And studies we are doing now will hopefully lead to
looking at that structure in next several months. Also, I know a few
people mention the term litigation, what we call the L word I guess. We
don't want to go to litigation, we don't think that is a really good
alternative for obvious reason however at the same time we are concerned
about unintended consequences from the legislation. We have not had an
opportunity to review it but there are huge risks. It's a 4 billion
dollar asset delivering 12 billion dollars of value to the region each
year. And we do help the judiciary responsibility to protect the airport
so we'll keep all the options on the table. In enclosing, I'd ask you to
satisfy the legislature for this year, let the studies that we are doing
continue. And again we invited the delegations, members of the general
assembly to take part in the study. We didn't see that invitation as the
way it was characterized today, in fact today was the first time I heard
that characterization. I am very sorry it was perceived that way. But in
enclosing, I'd ask you all to satisfy the legislation for this year, you
can always come back next year in an act of legislation if you feel it's
necessary.
Thank you Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sir. Seeing no other hands and no further questions or
debates, we have a motion to get the PCS a favorable report and
favorable to original bill. All in favor say Aye. All opposed say No.
The Ayes have it and this meeting is adjourned. Members of the
committee, I'll ask you to be on standby finance. Most likely we'll meet
again either right before session or right after, today.</p>
