I would like the committee to order the members could find their seats
and visitors please retire to the back of the room, we will get started.
I would like to welcome everyone to the full house committee on commerce

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you  Mr. ??. This is kind of two bills are moving, representative
?? and I have been working on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, have we done watching you. Yes, represented by Briam, luis and
we have the pcs before so in favor show aye, all oppose pcs is before
the senate and you may continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. chairman and I tried to run through the bill real quick
and then I asked for representative Burdy kinda come in with his basis
and he is working really hard on the first part of the bill but part 1
of the bill just establishes the framework for the department of
commerce to contract with a non-profit corporation provides heavy
research and recruitment recommendations regarding economic development
and ?? of grant awards and for marketing and consultation into
development of long wage economic development planning. The contract of
fulfillments is limited to skype and in the below lays out what these
limits are. Also a non profit corporation contacted by the department
would be overseen by an economic development oversight committee. The
mission receives state funds by this non profit, this specific to the
contract and do not arise until a certain prerequisites are satisfied
and you can see in the bill all that prerequisites that must be
satisfied. A contract authorized must contain the following terms  and
the bill has all the terms that must be included in that contract. Bit
of a problem, must hang on to the reports wage, giveups and fiscal
resources to base in to any performance to which of the department has
contracted with the non profit corporation. The remaining provisions of
part 1 include a report of economic development board and authorization
to a lot of sector to delegate the sectors responsibilities with respect
to a comprehensive strategic economic development plan to the
governments board  of the non profit corporation with whose the
department has contracted, a requirement that a governing board of the
non profit corporation intend to function’s privacy performed by
economic development board, in extention for officers and employees of
the non profit corporation from the revisions of the state personal act
and requirement under departments staying developers plan for the
contracting with a non profit corporation  and concentration of
organizations involved in economic development in the state. Part 2 of
the bill bring ?? the north carolina board of science and technology as
a north Carolina board of science technology and innovation. Which will
gain the duty to advice and make recommendations to the non profit
corporation on the role of science technology and innovation. Part 3 of
the bill would divide the state into 8 geographic regions to facilitate
the collaboration and coordinating planning and resource use  to improve
cooperation facilitating increased efficiencies, receive advice on
economic development issues while upper boards established by  non
profit corporations, establish a one stop assistance in each region for
citizens and businesses, the bill would require the department of
commerce, environment, natural resources and transportation each provide
one employee per each regional office to serve as that department-</p>

Liaison with other departments and with local governments, schools and
colleges, businesses, and other developmental planning bodies the
community college's system officer would also be required to designate
one representative to serve as a liaison in each zone. Part 5 of the
bill creates the study commission on interagency collaboration for
prosperity consisting of 8 members 4 from each legislative chamber. And
part 6 of the bill would repeal all legislative enactments creating
regional economic development commissions in the state, and will provide
where necessary provisions regarding the assets of those commissions.
That's going through the bill pretty quick, I'll ask Representative
Murry maybe to touch on the first part that I know he's worked on very
hard.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Senator Brown. And I wanted to also just publicly thank
Senator Brown for his willingness to work on this marriage of the
concepts between his regional realignment and the privatization and this
is a true partnership with Senator Brown on this concept. And with
regards to part one I think if you look at how we're structuring this
organization you can see the tapestry of business that runs across our
state clearly reflected in the government’s board of this partnership
for prosperity. We've got agribusiness as recommended by the
commissioner of agriculture, financial services, information technology,
bio-technology, energy, manufacturing, military, and tourism, and retail
all represented on this board of directors. And if that doesn't paint a
picture of the business segments in the state of North Carolina I don't
know what we could do any better to paint a tapestry of what the state
of North Carolina's business community looks like. Additionally if you
look in part D on page 3 you can see the clear conflict of interest
provisions that we've put into this to make sure that that the people's
business is done properly in this public/private partnership. And on
page 5 part G you can see that the public information and reporting in
part F and part G the reporting and public information pieces of this
legislation is strong to make sure that the business that is done by
this non-profit partnership for prosperity is done above board and
properly. And so that was a major, major area that we were interested in
making sure what we ?? areas of improvement. So with that if there are
any specific provisions of the legislation that you would like to ask
about the Secretary of Commerce is here and I would like to thank her
and the Governor's office for their diligence and work on this
legislation, this is a top priority we have a state with rich resources,
but we're plagued by high unemployment. And this we've got to change the
way we do business to help our existing business grow, and help new
businesses relocate to our state to expand, grow, and create jobs to
help partner everywhere across our state for prosperity for everyone.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Representative Murry. Senator Brown.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. As you know as far as aligning the regions go I
think all of you know that in the state of North Carolina if you look at
a region none of em match. I don't care what region you look at I don't
think you find another one that looks like the other one. What this
does, and these are loose regions and I think that's been a
misconception of the bill is that these are regions that'll be tight
regions. Part of the bill actually says that the department has the
opportunity to change the regions if they see that it makes sense to do
so, which I thinks important. So I would hope that you don't get tied up
on the regions so much because those lines are loose and if the
department thinks that some counties need to be moved to a different
region, they have the power to do that. But I think the important piece
of the regions is for the first time we'll have someone from commerce,
and ??, transportation working together in a central location in each of
these regions to handle requests and issues that businesses have
concerns about when they're looking at relocating in North Carolina. And
I think you know times important to most businesses if you have a
business wants to relocate in your region they want to be able to get
answers pretty quick and make decisions pretty quick, and I think this
will allow that to happen. And this is kinda the first time we've been
able to pull all of those entities together.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Senator</p>

We got this thing right into roll ??  [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr
Charin and thank you for the question .Now i will ask for the
secretaries help wanna wanna make a brief response.This this process
developing this partnership of prosperity is intending to take 6 months
for development and during that process there would be reporting
requirements back to the government operations committee here in the
legislative when we adjourn hopefully ?? rather than wider because my
beard starting itchy but once you adjourn this process of developing
this partnership will be clearly reporting back to the general assembly
in that government operation.and if there needs to be in time extension
we can we can that would be in the contract terms that will be able to
have with the department of commerce and i would like the secretary to
have to my comments Mr chair man  [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you secretary
??  [SPEAKER CHANGES] and that would be read all the original process in
volunteers.Now about last two weeks ago today and we talked about
transition time ?? and they said i deal from their perspective that
would be six to twelve months we agreed we could make it work with them
at that time frame and talking would the senator and with representative
 Murray we felt like twelve months is probably optimal  and we could
make a hand shake agreement that could work towards that and ?? we got
support that there are some pieces of that need to take some time and
that work  for those specific plans .We are gonna target six months time
frame and think that's realistic  we are gonna move aggressively but we
are gonna do the transition planning with them not apart from them and
now only to work together this pieces employs  [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank
you secretary. The final followup is the flexibility .I am not really
noble to have that flexibility to move out to the twelve months ??
comments what id that provide the flexibility that we need to make an
adjustment to move forward  [SPEAKER CHANGES] senator  brown  [SPEAKER

Where I’m actually kind of excited about being in this region. With the
- taking away the Eastern region and the funds going back to the
counties for the license plates, who in those counties will actually
manage those funds and really drive it for economic development because,
although our County Commissioners drive economic development, we see
things a tad differently.
Senator Brown?
That’s a very good question, one that I’ve got a little bit of concern
with to be quite honest, and something that we have to work through.
It’s my understanding that the Eastern region is meeting trying to
figure that out. There’s a bill right now that - for Craven County to
pull out of the Eastern region and they’re asking for those dollars to
go back to Craven County, so the Eastern region is - it’s kind of
interesting how it’s evolving because I’m not sure what the final
outlook is going to be, especially with those dollars that were
generated by the tag revenues that you’re referring to. My personal
opinion is, if the counties in those regions want those dollars back
they should be allowed to get them back. That’s how I personally feel,
and I think the bill that Representative Speciale has got, which deals
with Craven County, I think there’s some thoughts of expanding that to
all the counties in the Eastern region. I’m not sure how that’s going to
play out to be quite honest.
Representative Holley.
Thank you Mr. Chairman. One of the things I’ve learned over the years is
that if you not at the table you have a tendency to get left out, and
I’ve read this but I’ve read it briefly and lightly and I want to know
where historically unutilized businesses – minority and women owned
businesses fit in here. Are they at the table? Can they be on the board?
Can one of the hub schools be designated in the technology piece of
that, I mean is it here? Where is it? Thank you
Representative Murry.
Excellent question and I think the secretary has laid out a clear vision
on what her intentions are with that and I would ask her to weigh in on
how she sees his role now.
Sec. Decker.
Representative Holly, you can be assured that minority and women owned
businesses are at the forefront of my mind. We have not explicitly
identified on our board that there would be minority and women owned
businesses representative because my expectation is that in any board
across the sectors there would be diverse representation and that for me
is absolutely intentional and not questionable. It must be managed that
way. I think you will also see in the nonprofit, a renewed and clear
focus on small business development that the organization is the one
will be driving out over the next few weeks. I believe that we have not
had the focus with clarity that we need to have that in state commerce
and that will be corrected in this process of change.
Follow-up.
Follow-up, representative Holley.
Getting over to the schools I would like to see the schools involved in
the science and technology. I would like to see one of the other
designated schools to be a hub school, historically underutilized school
because they too play an active part in science and technology.
Thank you Representative Lambeth.
Thank you Mr. Chairman, and also thank the bill’s sponsors for bringing
this to us today and for the hard work that’s been put into this and
it’s obviously been a lot of work put into this. My question relates to
how do you see that the various chambers of commerce organizations
fitting into this as you rollout particularly those eight zones?
Representative Murry.
That’s our local boots on the ground partners that we are - I think
that’s going to be a strong relationship with those and the secretary
has laid out a vision previously on that and I would ask her to comment
on that as well.
The process will start this summer. Tony Amita and I will be making
field visit starting in late July, working on the development of North
Carolina’s first economic development strategic plan in many many years,
and at the table will be the local chambers of commerce, local economic
developers, local and county city officials. Those folks who on the
ground are involved in economic development every day, so that were
driving out this plan with their engagement and their involvement and so
there will be very - that will be the first opportunity for engagement
and a lot more moving forward. For me and you’ve heard me say this, too
many times probably, but economic development is a local business and
the state has a very important role to play in economic development in
North Carolina but the activity happens at a local level and so they’ll
be heavily engaged in the planning and in the execution of the plan.
Thank you Madam Secretary. Representative Fisher.</p>

<p id="30:00">
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
You know, everybody gets a little bit uncomfortable when change of this
magnitude occurs. And you get used to the way things are and have been,
and it's hard to make that shift over to a new set of ideas. Although I
am intrigued by your plans, I am beginning to place my confidence in
what you're going to be able to do with these prosperity zones, but I
still have a little bit of unease about the whole sort of top down vs.
bottom up approach to job development. And for example, and it's because
I come from the west, it seems like everything has had to happen in the
triangle or Charlotte. For example, we have biotech in Ashville in the
form of Nutraceuticals, and we have the largest germ plasma repository
in the country, just about, and you know biotech doesn't just happen in
one place. How are you going to, and I guess this question is for the
secretary, how are you going to be able to highlight the specialties
that come out of each of these individual prosperity zones in a way that
really brings distinction to what they're able to do apart from what is
able to be done in those other regions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Secretary Decker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the question, because that issue is one of the drivers for
the need for this change. We have not been able to successfully do that
at this point. And so by honing in our focus to a zone level, working
with your local developers who know these specialty areas, and I've
already spent some time in the western part of the state talking around
these issues. The plan for that zone will be unique to that zone, but
the state will now be in a position to promote that, and market it in a
new and unique way I think, in an aggressive way. But in support of
what's happening locally: The intention is not to be top down, but to be
bottom up. And that planning starts this summer, if we're given the
permission to move forward. And it starts with your folks at a local
level. This is not something we can do in a silo or a vacuum. I think
we've tried that, and it hasn't worked. So this is about getting on the
ground with your community leadership involved in economic development
and making plans that can be executed locally with state support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
I think it's important- one of the driving forces, I guess, for me to
try to do something different, is that I look across the state at the
unemployment rate in some of the counties in the state. A lot of our
programs you think now are for rural North Carolina. But when I look at
unemployment, I look at Wilson and Nash county. Unemployment, 12-13%
range. I look at the far western counties. Unemployment 13, 14, 15%. I
look in the southeast. Robinson, Columbus, Scotland county. Unemployment
12, 13, 14%. So it's obvious what we're doing now for rural North
Carolina hasn't done a good job, because those unemployment figures
really haven't moved, and I think getting commerce and transportation
and ?? out in those regions to understand those regions, to understand
the needs, the workforce that's in those regions, and to really develop
a plan that can address those unemployment numbers in those small rural
counties, I think that's important. And if something we haven't really
done a good job of in my opinion in this state, it's something we need
to change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Robert Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
It looks to me like it's an excellent plan. From Iredell county, we've
seen what it means when people workt together and follow the leadership
of the Dept. of Commerce, and look forward to working with you, but one
thing I've also noticed in working with body politic: Business seems to
go where the money is, and if I understand these nonprofit corporations,
they're going to be taking money from local governments, the state, and
private businesses. So what are we doing to keep that money from
influencing what gets done?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Murry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excellent question, Rep. Brawley. We've got clear conflict-of-interest
provisions in here to help prevent self-dealing, additionally I think
when you're dealing with a</p>

a true partnership. It's successful when all its parts are successful.
And so, I think that the representation that we've got from the cross
industry sector, industries populate around certain geographic areas.
We've got biotech in the triangle, and financial services in the
Charlotte area. And so, just the sheer nature of that governance board
is a geographically diverse governance board, and the plan within those
individual business sectors will help, in my opinion, make sure that we
have broad, broad investment across all areas in these different
regions.

That's right.

question, in that, page 3 deals with the conflicts of interest of the
Board members and that part of it. But if somebody in Raleigh says hey,
I'll contribute so-and so, but I want to make sure you bring in business
to Raleigh, how do we counter that? They're not a member of the board,
they're not on the board, but they do have money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Certainly. It has to, any investment that this, any activity that this
new non-profit is going to engage in has to be consistent with the
overall economic development plan that will be developed. And strong
within that plan is going to be targeting our rural, most economic
depressed areas, with a focus on small business. So I think it’s the
classic, if you fail to plan then you plan to fail, and once you have a
plan, then you need to work your plan. And so, I think that's a big
piece of this, and I think that's going to be an opportunity for each of
us to be involved in helping execute, implement, and develop that plan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Hamilton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm not really sure who to direct the question
to, so first of all, I just want to say I like the bill. I'm very, a lot
of really hard work has gone into this and we appreciate everybody's
efforts. I also like, very much, the flexibility in the mapping that’s
given to the Secretary. Maps should be dynamic, they should follow the
economy, they shouldn't be static, and hats off to you, Madam Secretary,
because you may start getting the same requests for moving around that
the general assembly's been dealing with over the last few years, I
don't envy you that. I do have a question though, about sections 6.8,
and I should know the answer to this, but I'm not on Appropriations,
what's the current budget amount for the partnerships? I know it's still
not resolved, but where are we with it as we speak?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Hamilton, it's my understanding that the partnerships get
about 4 and a half million of state dollars. Today, the bill scales that
out over time, but that's the amount of state dollars going to the
partnerships today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, Senator Brown, I understand and I agree with a statement that you
made earlier that it's time to put the handwriting on the wall. And so,
by giving them notice for the budget process that they are not going to
continue receive that funding, I think we're all on the same page there.
But the question is, do we know what that, and this may be a question
for staff, do we know what that current dollar amount is, did we give
them a year, did we give them six months, did we give them three months,
at this stage of the budget process? I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
We're currently looking, staff is looking for that number. Can we get
back to you with that? OK, good. Thank you.
Representative Wells.
OK. Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Senator Brown and Representative
Murry, for bringing this forward. Receiving this bill last night and
reading through it, I really vision this bill that has two separate
parts that's interwoven, and one of those parts is structuring the
Department of Commerce, which I fully support. I think the intent here
is to make it more efficient, as well as to make it more effective. And
my heart is truly behind those efforts and the work that's been put into
it. The second part is the establishment of a non-profit corporation, as
it ironed out on the page 1 here of the purpose of the non-profit
organization, is not to guide the state in infrastructure decisions, but
to, more or less, give them the purview to help guide the state under
the wide blanket of the statement of incentives and grants</p>

<p id="40:00">
And just as a series of questions for you on helping me feel more
comfortable with supporting this part of the bill is first of all, is
that why should we establish a non-profit corporation to do these
function of the Department of Commerce which would basically, on page 1
here if what I’m reading here it says that the nonprofit corporations
can perform one or more of the Department’s functions, powers, duties or
obligations set forth in that statute except the following.  Why should
I support this establishment of this nonprofit versus an advisory board
of private sector individuals to help guide the state in their economic
development decisions and then I may have a series of very kind follow
ups.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the question Representative Millis. And I Think the key
word that we’re looking for and the key thing that we really want to
stress here is that we need our Department of Commerce and our economic
development activities to move at the speed of business, not the speed
of government. And so the flexibility and the nimbleness that a
nonprofit organization, clearly spelled out by a contractual
relationship. Which is a misnomer with how we do economic development in
our current environment. Currently, a lots of the existing nonprofit
organizations that we have are juts, they just get checks from the
General Fund and say have a good day. There’s no deliverables. There’s
no accountability. There’s no, you will do this, you cannot do this.
And so this new world order change,  change, it’s a new way to do
business and we will clearly spell out what this entity will be
responsible for, what the accountably measure sand they’ll  have
reporting requirements back to us, back to the General Assembly.. To
make sure we have proper oversight with strong conflict of interest and
public notice provisions. So I think that’s the way the public expects
us to do business and that’s how we want this done properly and do
business as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah Mr. Chair.  Thank you, Representative Murry for that description
and as a brief comment and then  just a follow-up question, is that it
is my opinion that business moves at the speed of business because it is
their money and it is their rear ends on the line.  And that when it’s
not your money and your rear ends not on the line it’s really hard to
have that incentive to move at the speed of business.  And with this
make up of this nonprofit organization the only reason why that I can
think they would move at the speed of business is either good intentions
or personal motives.  And my other question is that in regard to page 1
here, is how can this nonprofit provide recruiting recommendations
regarding incentives or grant rewards that’s lines 13 and 14, how can
they do that without having other conflicts within the following pages
of the bill?  Again, the part 1 about the bill about the restructuring
of the Department of Commerce, my heart’s totally behind it and I
appreciate all the effort that’s’ been done.  But this establishment of
this nonprofit has me seriously concerned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The nonprofit can no obligate state funds.  They cannot award grants.
That is what Secretary ? called it the public side of the house. Which
is, which the Board of Directors is, its’ everybody that you would want
to be involved in that.  The secretary of Commerce, Transportation,
DENR, and so however if an entity is going to be charged with developing
a plan and executing an economic development process that’s more nimble
and flexible, then their recommendations on how an individual project
fits within that structure is where they fit into this puzzle.  And so
this is private sector heavy with all the expertise that comes with
that.  And their recommendations will strongly influence how the grant’s
received, versus now which is a little, it’s not quite there and I’ll
let the Secretary chime in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Millis thanks for raising the question because it’s just
that issue that brought me to the point to say we have to make the
change to the nonprofit. In this scenario, the performance puts them on
the line.  That happened in stated government today. So we create the
nonprofit.  The state of North Carolina contracts with this nonprofit
for performance recruitment.  Growth of establishing of existing
businesses the development of tourism and travel for the state of north
Carolina, will clearly define performance expectations.  My expectation
is that f this organization doesn’t meet those expectations than they
don’t get the contract next time around.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

<p id="45:00">
Thank you so much for that response. Just to let you know, I don't want
to throw out the good for the greater here. I don't have a problem with
the intent with all the aspects of tourism, the aspects of decisions
making, but just the part of the recommendations of the incentive in the
grands. I can make a recommendation to give you money, it may be
different than me physically giving you money, but I'm still making that
recommendation. I think the functions the department of commerce being
done by a private entity or a non-profit entity that actually guide them
to move more quickly at the speed of business is great, but I would like
to see the parts about incentive grants not to be a part of this bill.
Frankly, because if we get back to the aspects of the role of
government, I could understand infrastructure because that's a public
benefit that...
may have a indirect private benefit well, but whenever you are directly
given private dollars and say ??? it has an indirect public benefit, I
have strong reservations about that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I had some reservations at first until I thought
through the process and what I see is a business entity coming to a
particular zone meeting with the officials in that zone expressing their
needs to relocate maybe in that particular zone, and I see the officials
from commerce and transportation and ??? are working with us now in
profit to make that happen on a quicker time frame. As I tie it together
I see how it can work and I think that's why it's important that these
zones were created that you have those entities in place that can work
with us non-profit as well to stream line this process and make it go a
lot quicker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator. Representative
Hamilton and consultant with staff regarding your question since we're
still in the budgeting process we really can't come up with an answer
for you. Representative Cunningham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chair and Secretary Decker for being here. Your strategic plan and your
vision, thank you for that. I have just a few questions: How many
projected payed positions will be created after the transition? And the
annual salary on page two is capped at a hundred and twenty thousand per
??? to modify in a budget. What are looking at a average projected
salary? And lastly, are the people participating for the grants under
the created commission, or whatever it is, will the be required to use
evidence base practices as they move forward? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll defer this Secretary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Secretary Decker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do not have for
you specific numbers of employees nor average salary. The charge given
to me by the governor ??? you gotta do this for less money and fewer
people. And so that's the big picture. The details of that will be
worked out as we work through the economic development plan and really
define the necessary resources to accomplish that plan. It will require
evidence based performance so that we can measurably identify
performance measures and then follow up in measurement behind them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Catlin. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This will be a question for Senator Brown: Is
this PCS changing officially the Diener regions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
have talked to Diener and Diener is very interested in these regions as
well, as you know there are seven Diener regions now, this will allow
them to actually add a Diener office in the Charlotte area which they
don't have at this point, which as you can imagine, is kind of unusual.
But it will allow to put a Diener office in Charlotte because the other
seven regions will have a Diener office available, but not just an
office, I think the key piece of it is to have a representative from
Diener located in this one-stop-shop facility within those regions,
that's the important piece. So they'll be at the table from the start on
the ??? process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not
sure I understood. This does change the Diener regions. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It does change the regions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, I have had
some concerns expressed by the marine core ??? point about that, this
is, it's not a no-brainier type of thing, I think we need to look at
that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not sure why they would have a concern
because the region Wilmington doesn't change</p>

for bringing this forward because the way I see it it provides pretty
much a recipe for success including the three main ingredients. That is
it clearly defines responsibility, it promotes and provides us and the
people that we represent the accountability, and it provides us a
mechanum [sp?] so we can consistently and ongoing assist outcomes. So if
shifts or mods need to be applied, they can easily and readily be
applied. I think, like I said, the three main ingredients for success. I
support this. Let's move forward. [xx] for a motion, Mr. Chair
[speaker change]
Please hold Representative [xx]. Senator Brown, you're recognized to
revisit the question presented to you by Representative Catlin.
[speaker change]
I'm hoping someone from DENR is here that might can answer this
question. Representative Catlin had an issue about the, someone from
Carter County not being able to go to the Washington DENR office for
permitting. That doesn't change in this bill. They can continue to do
that and I just wanted to make sure that he understands that that's the
case.
[speaker change]
Mr. Robbins if you could, just identify yourself for the record.
[speaker change]
Neal Robbins with DENR. The senator is correct. Our regional offices
will be able to retain their same character and provide customer service
across the lines. There'll be no barriers for constituents who need to
use services.
[speaker change]
Follow up, please.
[speaker change]
Representative Catlin.
[speaker change]
Thank you. Well then, maybe I'm confused, but my first question was do
these regions become the DENR regions? And then the answer I got was
yes. Well, if that's the case, then some counties are going to change
which DENR region they get their permits from.
[speaker change]
Direct that to Mr. Robbins. Mr. Robbins.
[speaker change]
My understanding of the Prosperity Zones is that they are the zones for
coordination between DOT commerce and DENR. But that's not going to
affect the way our regional offices operate outside of the purposes of
this bill.
[speaker change]
Follow up. Can somebody just tell me that this does not change the DENR
permit regions.
[speaker change]
I would if it'd make you feel better, but-
[speaker change]
Senator Brown.
[speaker change]
Representative Catlin, that was never the intent of this bill. So, I
feel pretty confident, and I think DENR has answered that question. I
think the permitting process stays the same. What the Prosperity Zones
does is it creates a one stop shop facility where a representative from
DENR and a representative from commerce and a representative from
transportation can be together to work on bigger projects than most
cases. Someone wanting to relocate to North Carolina or maybe expand
their business and get answers on a quicker time frame than what they
can do today.
[speaker change]
Representative Stone.
[speaker change]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to thank the committee for putting this
bill together. I tell you I think it's definitely a move in the right
direction. And no doubt about we have the right secretary to put this
into work. I think I've talked in the past, of some of the concerns I
love the fact that we were going to be moving much faster than we have
in the past. When we look in some of the issues in the eastern part with
the unemployment rate and the fact that we need to look at unemployment
rate where to drive those business to to help out. I also have concerns
because some of those districts had some of the highest tax rates and
that's going to be tough. Back home in our local communities, economic
development is working hard with the infrastructure, but it's also
gotten involved in the game of cash incentives or tax refunds or
different sorts to attract businesses. And what we're essentially doing
is competing small town against small town and it's getting very
difficult. So, hopefully this will solve some of that so we're not
competing and making it difficult for those small towns that we can get
some business there. And I'm really looking forward to coming back next
year seeing how this has been implemented and the process as we move
forward. So, I thank you again for the bill.
[speaker change]
Representative Lucas.
[speaker change]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I support the content of the Prosperity Zones. I
think it's an idea that we need to really do our best to implement or
try because we know what we've been doing hadn't worked as well as had
hoped. As it relates to intra-zone dominance, for example in the
northeast region, that's just one example, you'll have counties such as
Wilson and Nash and Pitt that are going to be paired with counties in
the far north</p>

<p id="60:00">
Of this region like their. I don't know how we are going suppress the
dominance since we high unemployment in county's like Wilson and Nash.
Whats going to prevent them from really having an unfair advantage in
attracting business to ?? of some other county's in that region and I
imagine that it probably may exist in all of the zone but that probably
is really proliferated in that particular zone is anything to guard
against t hat dominance [SPEAKER CHANGES]Secretary ??[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again you are hitting right on that issues that raise the need for this
approach and achieved and identified that there are larger county's and
smaller county's even larger county's with higher unemployment as you
are experiencing. The intention of taking this approach in the planning
that turn over the media began this summer in this economic development
plan is to drive out our efforts to all 100 county's. One of the things
we observe in looking what we have done and we get results in small
geographic areas the rig county's i live in one of those do not get the
progress that we see in the core of economic development work and so in
part of our intention in doing and making this change is to better focus
 resources on that small poorer county's were we not be able to move a
needle at all. The planning work we begin this summer will include all
of those county's. Now i suggest that we will spent additional time and
effort in those places that have been in ?? unemployment and stuck for
??years because the fundamental work we need to do there is probably
very different than the work we need to do in different parts of the
zone. we need to spent enough time and enough energy and enough efforts
in research in what it is really begins to transform the economy. But it
is hard work for willing to commit to just the reason that have been
identified are smaller county's poor county's needs some focus efforts
to make them change. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Farmer- Butterfield
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you mister chair a couple of questions and a
comment. My question first is for the department I guess.How will the
department work with other partners in the community to ?? skills and
workers with just that seems to be critical area in transforming the
economy. [SPEAKER CHANGES]secretary ??[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks for the
question. There are several things happening right now even without this
reorganization in and reform. One is in August we would be introducing
through our department of work for solutions an new online system for
job matching. we don't have a good system available to focus the day.
You go to monster.com and all types of technologies are there but
specific north Carolina. So we are going to have a new ?? to available
to us on summer that would do a much better job of matching available
job in the state of North Carolina with workers who are unemployed so we
are behind the ?? so we are behind we should be in regard and in summer
we going to see a very significant change in this regard. We are also
going through a major reorganization in renewed delivery of services
through work for solutions. So looking in where we need to be located in
community provide resources for job re training working very very
closely with our community college system and the training support that
they provide from please trying to make transaction in work. SO their is
lot of work going their right now and your right that the important part
of solution here because we have a gap between available jobs and
available workers and we have got both in each category but they are not
connected very well. SO very focus is required there, [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Thank you ??[SPEAKER CHANGES] What about turnover time for full
implementation of the plan and the realization of jobs. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Secretary ??[SPEAKER CHANGES] The implementation of that system
will began on August and will be available of?? in promotion of that in
mid July and it will be working with like media ?? and the process of
loading the jobs in that system and getting the data on unemployed in
that system to be able to began to do the matching. So its in process
right now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further comment [SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator
Brown would like to speak on your question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]very good
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown[SPEAKER CHANGES]represent also a piece
?? on the community colleges or ?? of ?? I thought this was very
important because you exactly right ?? training going to be a big part
of this package as well and nothing ??</p>

Was very important
[Speaker Changes]
I'm impressed with the plain, that's my comment, and I also like to say
that, and looking at accountability for non-profits.  I worked with one
for many years, and I can tell you that in the state of North Carolina,
there is accountability.  Evidence based performance is critical.
Annual accounting, quarterly account, annual audits, annual monitoring,
is occurring in North Carolina, now in terms of commerce I cannot speak
to that.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Floyd
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you mr TS, I went around and made my comments a little bit,
because somebody had already spoken on it, and that is that the
department of commerce is the engine to move North Carolina forward.
This bill provided reflects the ability to do that. A good road map.  My
concern lies on line 35 to 42, when we look at the University of North
Carolina system, but we identified two and that's the University of
North Carolina and North Carolina state others that could be appointed
and we have also there with a twenty three member board.  I'm concerned
that some kind of way that never addressed the twenty five that can
aloud historical African American universities to be a part of it, but
when we identified these two schools in the system, and we have fourteen
others, it sort of raises a flag to me.
[Speaker Changes]
This is the existing language for the existing North Carolina board of
science and technology so what we are doing is adding community colleges
and k12 that board to help make sure we've got that diverse
representation, so I -
[Speaker Changes]
I understand.  I understand the existing language, and reading, it just
raises a flag.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Carney
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Chair.  First I want to thank the bill sponsors.  The
committee chair for letting us fully vet this in the committee, and for
the two bill sponsors bringing their two entities that started out
totally different bills bringing them together into the secretary for
her.  Her vision and wanting to move us forward as we continue to grow
North Carolina.  Having said that, some member said earlier that change
is difficult to embrace for a lot of people and I'm speaking for a lot
of the people that have contacted me that are involved and have been
involved in the past, with the development the regional economical
development systems that are throughout the state.
I want, if you will Mr. Chair, I would like to ask a couple questions
and then make a few comments.  On the issue that Representative Hamilton
brought up, with the appropriations made and the budget.  I think that
if we're going to support what the secretary's vision is, she's going to
need that money for the marketing and the branding for this new move
that we're going into for economic development.  I think we ought to be
up front and straight forward if there is a cost, and I'm hoping that
it's just going to be on the senate side, put in the budget, rather than
us saying to these regional partnerships that are out there &quot;we're
going to give you so much money, then statutorily, we're going to take
away 50 percent.&quot;  I think that should be up front stated rather
than us saying that in this bill I'm not sure what this is in there.  If
we're passing this bill that if it becomes law, the budget bill, that we
will then, take 50 percent out of whatever we give the partnerships for
the branding.  Is that, if you would just share with me the intent of
what you were doing here.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Brown
[Speaker Changes]
The dollars representative Carney, the dollars that were going to the
partnerships is the base that we're working off of.  The existing
dollars.  So as we move forward I think that is the base that we are
talking about working with as far as the amounts that will be decreased
going to the existing partnerships.  I know the secretary has worked
with them as well on some of these dollar amounts.  She may want to
touch on that, but it's my understanding that that existing base is the
dollar amount that we're talking about that were working</p>

?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Well I guess what I'm just saying let's
let the partnerships know up front that and put that into the amount
whatever is in the budget. The other section if you would just talk to
us a little bit about, we're saying we're going to repeal the regional
economic development commissions the partnerships and yet now we have a
section six- six that says two or more counties cities or counties and
cities can create their own regional planning and economic development
commission. Can you talk a little bit about that for me? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Brown [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney I feel
like that's going on anyway to be quite honest. I think in your area I
can't help but think Mecklenburg and Cabarrus and Gaston and maybe a
couple of other counties are continually working on economic development
and how they can collaborate on some of those efforts. We don't want to
hurt those partnerships that are already  in place. And I think that's
the piece that you're referring to. There's several counties that are
working together throughout the state and we want to continue to let
them work together on reasonable type projects that make sense for those
particular counties. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Thank you Mr. Chair, I'm sorry. I've shared this with the
secretary. I do have some concerns about and the concerns that
representative Lewis raised are all here with the non profit, that non
profit is going to be advising the big guys if you will. Commerce,
transportation and ?? and if we have the little groups coming in trying
to compete for that private money that's going to be out there. It's
almost like we're gonna have competition between the state for private
dollars and the local government for those local commissions that will
pop up. But overall I think we have a good plan moving forward on these
prosperity zones but I hope that we're going to keep our eyes and ears
open and there is an annual reporting back. As we move forward in the
new early stages I wish it could be a more frequent reporting back to
us. I do hope that we're going to get some clarification of these new ??
zones that we just heard of today. I think there could be a huge impact
on some current projects that are already out there in confusion and
maybe holding up a project as we define where those lines are. I hope
that can get cleared up. Thank you.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative
Goodman. Questions been answered? OK. Representative Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. For the bill sponsors on page
one here down at the bottom starting at line 25, actually line 23.
Department may not contract with a North Carolina non profit corporation
regarding any of the following. Are all of these things listed here one
through four just gonna keep going like they're going now? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Murray [SPEAKER CHANGES] Our intention is likely
not. They would be more focused than they are now. But I think these are
all obligations of public dollars and so that's why they're staying on
that side of the house. But I think with a better plan and a better
execution of a plan we can have better results with any JDigg or any 1NC
grants. But if the grants are going to exist we want them to be executed
in a way that has a greatest yield with the best oversight and that's
the intention of this partnership. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Followup [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Followup. Thank you. The very title of the bill here is an act
to permit the department to contract with A North Carolina non profit
corporation. And it seems to me like you're wording it so that you're
going to contract with somebody that's already in existence when in fact
we're creating the thing that we're going to contract with. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is that a question or a statement? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I thought so. So who would like that? Representative
Murry.[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is a true statement. We are creating an
entity and there are functions that that entity will carry out and there
are functions that that entity will not carry out. And if it involves
the obligation of public dollars it will not carry</p>

That function.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I follow-up one more time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Did y'all count up how many jobs we're creating here by all of these
boards and commissions we're settin' up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think you're gonna see more streamlining of these things, actually,
and so I think you'll see efficiencies realized by this reorganization.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Secretary Decker, did you want to speak to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, in actuality, the current economic development board will go away
as this comes on to their -- actually, fewer numbers in terms of that
board. There will be, however, more opportunities for volunteer
participation by business leadership from across the state. We will
retain the Travel and Tourism Board, for example, we will retain the
Film Commission, for example, but we will provide some other
opportunities, particularly at a zone level, for volunteer engagement by
business leadership, but existing business and new business, but not
paid positions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

other components of the University of North Carolina, one of which shall
be from a historically black college or university, all nominated by
the&quot; dot-dot-dot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Murry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate Representative Floyd trying to make this legislation better
and I fully support his amendment.

the Floyd amendment, please say aye, all opposed? The amendment is
adopted. Representative Shepard, if you could amend your motion.
