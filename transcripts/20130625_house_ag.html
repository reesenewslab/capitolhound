We'll start in a minute.  We're trying to make sure we got, the bill
sponsor is not here so we don't know what he's going to do. While we're
waiting for the House Ag today  we got Bill Bass, Sergeant at Arms,
Patrick Mason, Charles Godwin and BH Howell and for our pages we've got
William Baggett from Johnson, Daughtry is the sponsor, John Boswell from
Pitt, Brown is the sponsor, Madison Chadwick from Union, Arp is the
sponsor, Chase Cockran from Union, Tillis is sponsor and Arianna
Flaherty from Halifax, I probably muddled her name good. [long pause]
Alright.  The sponsor is on the way. We'll knock off a few points for
being late in case we don't like his bill. We have a PCS today so can I
have a motion?  George Cleveland moves that we add a PCS before us?  All
in favor say aye.  All opposed no.  Senator Newton, we're ready. Have
you got your breath yet?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do and I apologize to this Committee for the
confusion on my part alone for the delay in being here and I sincerely
apologize and appreciate you all hearing this. In all candor I have not
reviewed the PCS.  I think I might have missed that and I apologize.
Again it would be my fault. If it would be okay I'll ask staff to go
through it
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll do that. Staff.  Deborah's going to handle it
for you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Senator Newton. The PCS makes
several changes to the second edition of the bill. First of all,
language concerning rules on navigation.  The PCS before you actually
takes language back to that which was included in the first edition
which makes all navigational rules infractions except for the rule on
navigational lighting which would be a Class 3  misdemeanor. It also
removes a provision that would have changed the penalty applicable to
vessels slowing to no-wake speed for law enforcement.  This change was
made in the second edition and it's removed so that it no longer has a
penalty change. Also there is a new penalty that's included in Senate
Bill 636 concerning taking of elk and the PCS before you would remove
language about state-owned land.  Another change was made in the second
edition to require court costs for infractions and that language has
been  removed so that court costs  will not be applicable.  Most of
these provisions in the bill concerning violation of rules are now
infractions so there will not be any court costs associated.  Those are
the changes in the PCS.  I'm happy to run through the bill in its
entirety if that would be of interest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate, this was
brought to me by the Wildlife Commission and there's been a lot of
discussion on these changes in the Senate side and around the table.
I'm not aware of any opposition to it and most of these changes in the
PCS, or I should say all of these changes in the PCS were a result of
further conversation after it passed the Senate.  So I'll be happy to
try to answer any questions</p>

<p id="05:00">
&lt;h3&gt;kids if I can, but I hope it's self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions? Representative Waddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just got one brief question, just for
clarification. On page three item number 11 on the voter safety. You've
got the…provides proof that he or she is was born before January the
1st, 1988. Before it was 26 years old. Is that set in a prior time…I
know it was set in a prior time but is it not allowing people that are
26 years old anymore, because that will be a floating number.  Next year
it will be I'm making myself as clear as mud…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it, Representative Waddell.  I'm
not sure why we changed it that way. I think that's a very good
question. Honestly, I can't remember why…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Someone, ?? commission that could answer that for us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Mr. Chairman, I thank you. My name's Chris Dylan with the Wildlife
Resources Commission. When that provision for requiring voter safety was
first enacted that said anyone under the age of 26 would have to take
voter education, that number floats. So, if I was born in '78, it would
be '79, '80. And what we're trying to do is put a hard number that this
is the cutoff date for everyone else. Because our numbers have found
that actually the highest rates of accidents are people in their 40s. So
we're trying to get eventually everyone will have to take it in the
future but we're creating that hard date of '88 as the date where people
have to take it from then on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions? Representative Lucas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Question for the Senator ?? I don't know who might
be able to answer this but on page four, on line 37, and D1, the taking
of ?? and getting permission to possess on that animal, quite often one
might shoot a deer on permitted land, and, you know if you've deer
hunted before, you know that that deer doesn't always expire at this
point. He may go couple of miles. Onto posted property. And if they
lease, lessee, or the owner of the lessee is not available, what does
one do? Do you just leave it and let the animal lie there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Lucas. If I, I'm hoping that somebody from the
Wildlife Commission may be able to help clean this up if I answer it
wrong. But, from my memory of the Land-Air Protection Act that we did in
the last session I think this provision was consistent with that in
terms of the language. And I'm getting nods in the back as to yes, and
so as far as how you answer the question about what are they supposed to
do, as I recall form that in my own experiences I think that it pretty
much is just supposed to be, you're supposed to get permission to go get
that deer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, you may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So if one is not able to obtain information I guess the answer is then
you just wasted an animal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think Mr. Dylan may have a better answer than I'm giving right now. Or
at least add to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, again, Chris Dylan with the Wildlife Resource
Commission. Representative we're not changing the law on what the
offense is. That's already trespassing when you go on someone else's
property and that was cleared up in the Land Air Protection Act because
it's posted property. What we're doing is in the offense when you take
an animal on someone else's posted property it's an aggravating factor
so we're increasing the penalty. So we're not making it illegal, it's
already illegal, but our constituents have come to the commission and to
our officers in the field and just to let you know that's where most if
not all these changes come from was officers in the field coming up and
saying these are the other, charges that need to be in-
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

...increase or decrease in penalty. That came directly from the
constituents on, if somebodies on my posted land taking my deer, I want
to hit them a little harder.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chairman Dixon? Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is for Mr.
Dillon, also. Has the commission done an estimate of what amount of
money the additional increases in fines will generate and what for what
purposes those funds will be used?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, those fines do not come to us. Those go
to the local school system, so we would not see any increase in any
fines through this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What is the expected increase in revenue?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I think staff may have a physical note
on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do not believe there was a fiscal note prepared.
Typically when it involves misdemeanors as opposed to felonies. A felony
requires an incarceration, but misdemeanors do not. So to my knowledge,
there has not been a note prepared.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One last follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I suppose, then, that the, putting the additional
higher penalties is an effort to curtail these kinds of things from
happening?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. We wouldn't see any benefit from the
reduction or increase in fines, but we would hope that those, a
constituent would think before he would act out in the field.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Newton. I'm looking on page 2 and
lines 16 and 17, and it's talking about the $250 fine for boating while
under the influence. Is there another statute that deals with this or is
this the only penalty?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that this is the only penalty.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff have any other answer on that one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would just to comment, then. We recognize that driving
on the highways while intoxicated is a very serious offense, but the
waterways have become so crowded, that's also a serious offense and
we've all seen incidences where there have been severe boating accidents
and wrecks and people have been killed because of driving of a boat
drunk. And it just seems like that's a pretty light fine and I just
didn't know if, and it appears it's mostly new language. I didn't know
if it had come through your Senate committee and you all felt that was
an appropriate punishment for boating while under the influence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jennifer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually, Representative Starnes, it looks like it's
new language but if you look at lines 14 and 15, that provision, I
believe, was grouped in with others in a Class II misdemeanor. So now
you've got the changes specifying that the fine has to be not less than
$250, but I believe it was a Class II misdemeanor to begin with under
existing law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My question to the Senator is, is that punishment seem
appropriate for some of the more egregious natures of that crime?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative
Starnes, I think the best way to answer that is that I think that that
setting out as a Class II misdemeanor and setting out the fine to be a
minimum of $250 is really not that different from some of the other
offenses that we have for driving while impaired for first time
offenders with unaggravated situations. It is different, I can't recall
what it is off the top of my head, but certainly this, there could be
other charges that could come along of it with an incident that was more
serious and more damaging like you describe where somebody gets killed.
There...</p>

<p id="15:00">
There could be other charges in addition to this. So that would just be
the minimum fine and that it would be a class 2 misdemeanor if that you
know, you get pulled over at a check and they determine no accident is
what I'm getting at. So I mean I'm not opposed to in a different vehicle
if we think that needs to be strengthened I don't have any personal
opposition to working on that. But as Jennifer said this isn't really
changing what we already have.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Starnes you might make your ?? a little comfortable. This
has got to go to judiciary before it goes to the floor.
[Speaker Change]
I understand that but I also I'd note that with the fees it's gonna have
to end up in finance eventually.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Presnell.
[Speaker Change]
Yes thank you. On page 4 line 30 it talks about the elk. We've got a lot
of elk that come down out of the Smokey's and go into Haywood County and
they are eating the hay that is put up there for the people's for their
cattle. If they have a license can they kill that elk if that elk is on
their property?
[Speaker Change]
Would you like Chris to answer that?
[Speaker Change]
I do need to ask though while the commission is up the elk portion is
not something that I have a lot of familiarity with.
[Speaker Change]
Chris.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[Speaker Change]
The elk in North Carolina are a great thing and we are having some
problems in other areas. We've been working with the community up there
very intently with fencing and other ways to protect crops from loss.
But right now there is no mechanism to kill an elk legally in North
Carolina. Hopefully at some point in the future we will have a herd
that'll be huntable or that you can get a depredation permit for. But at
this point no you will not be able to shoot an elk that is taking any
property from you.
[Speaker Change]
Representative McNeill is next.
[Speaker Change]
Yes thank you. This question may be for staff. I know in the budget the
budget reduces a lot of the violations to infractions. Has anybody
looked to see if this conflicts with any of those that are in the
budget?
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Representative McNeill.
[Speaker Change]
If I may Mr. Chairman. I ask Jennifer to explain that because we have
taken a look at that.
[Speaker Change]
Representative we are aware of those provisions in the budget given the
budget is pending as well we will continue to monitor the two provisions
to make sure that once one is enacted it does not conflict with the
other.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Ramsey.
[Speaker Change]
I just wanted to add on the provision regarding the elk. I wanna thank
the bill sponsor in wildlife and other legislators for incorporating
those concerns. I think the primary concern was right now if you kill an
elk on federal lands there's one penalty. If you go off the federal
lands there’s a different penalty so we shouldn't treat folks
differently just depending on where that boundary is. And certainly I
think wildlife has done a excellent job working with landowners and
farmers to where there are concerns up there, and I think that process
will continue.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Representative Ramsey. Anyone else? Representative Cleveland.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'd like to go back to the problem that
Representative Lucas posed. Wildlife did not address it, they addressed
taking gear on the individual’s property. And I can very easily see
someone shooting a deer on legal property and then the deer winding up
on someone’s posted property. And I just you know, running around trying
to find the owner of the land to get permission to take the deer off the
land. I think is well not very sensible first of all. And secondly I
think there should be some method in which the hunter can retrieve the
deer without fear of being fined $200, or $500. Now if wildlife would
like to weigh in on that.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Chairman ??
[Speaker Change]
If I could.
[Speaker Change]
Yes.
[Speaker Change]
And then I think the colonel may be able to add something to it.
Representative Cleveland I appreciate the question and the concern that
you and Representative Lucas have raised.</p>

<p id="20:00">
and my memory is coming back to me more and more as I stand here and
answer questions about some of these things.  As I recall and I'm sure
?? will correct me if I state this wrong from the Landowners Protection
Act there's a mechanism to where the person who gets cited for that can
basically produce the permission after the fact in order to have a
charge dropped or eliminated.  I would tell you anecdotally and in my
experience most hunters that are hunting deer that would have the
experience of the deer being shot on land where they were entitled to be
and running on the land where it was posted most of those hunters are
going to know those landowners or know who they are or usually have some
relationship with them, hopefully a good one, and under most
circumstances that's not going to present a problem.  They've either got
their phone and can call them or they got permission already kind of
verbally ahead of time, look if the deer ever runs over there you can
get it, but the problem we're trying to address here is that you have a
lot of people who are taking deer on posted land and what they're saying
is oh it just ran over there and I went to go get it. And that's the
problem we're trying to address here because these are the complaints
that they're getting.  I'm certain if we have complaints along the line
of what you're concerned about then there's things that we can do in the
future but under the old legislation, that really shouldn't be an issue.
 If they've got legitimately the ability to go over there and get that
deer that shouldn't.  Furthermore, Wildlife has a lot of discretion
here. They typically know the landowners and a lot of times the people
that are a problem they already know they're a problem and had that
experience and they can sort that out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does Wildlife have anything to add to what the Senator
said?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? with Wildlife Commission.  Senator Newton
represented that very well.  We do have an affirmative defense for the
Landowner Protection Act.  In other words you can get the permission
after the fact and we will accept that.  What we encourage hunters to do
is to make those contacts before that actually occurs and what we have
found is there are just some people that just don't want people on their
property and so we're very reluctant to advocate that someone has the
ability to go on someone else's property without their permission. And
this particular bill is addressing deer that are unlawfully taken on
posted property.  It's not just a matter of a deer running on to posted
property. We're looking for people that are hunting out of season
primarily.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions?  If not I'm ready for a motion.
Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chair if I could ask a question of ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  Just for clarification, there are a few
places that I hunt that have no idea ?? property or surround it. From
what you were just saying it sounds like if I make a good faith effort
and couldn't find the property owner I could go and get the deer.  I
just better not get caught.  So I'm wondering about that. Because I tell
you, Ken ?? was a good friend of mine and he could tell you if I do it
I'm doing it legal, trying to at least. And I've had cases where I could
have shot a deer across the fence but it's somebody else's land and I
didn't do it. I'm not going to do that kind of stuff. But if I shoot it
on my side and it goes across the the fence I feel like I would be able
to go get it but I'm just wondering how much chance is there that I'm
trying to do the best I can I'm still going to get in trouble?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well just speaking very frankly there's a slight
likelihood you'll get in trouble. If you're on a piece of property back
in the woods, the chances of us encountering you is pretty slim.  Unless
there's been issues previous to that that we're aware of and that we're
actively trying to protect that piece of property.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion to at the
appropriate time to speak on behalf of the bill.  Before I do that</p>

<p id="25:00">
...as far as I know, the appropriate time right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I'll simply say this. You know we all live in
different parts of the State and big, big fan of protecting private
property rights, but I don't know if we can legislate a perfect solution
on this. But I will say this, when we set something enforce like this
has, to where if you are hunting near someone, hopefully it's a neighbor
or if you're there in the first place, you've got some local knowledge
to know who you need to talk to, that helps facilitate so we're not
being told by Raleigh what to do and people can respect each other and
work out the situation as the situation dictates.
As far as the merits of the bill, there's quite a few things that look
good. I mean, you know, if you don't have your decals on or one of them
flakes off on a Seadoo or a boat, you don't get a Class III misdemeanor.
You get an infraction, you get a small, you get a penalty. There's a lot
of common sense and practicality that appears to be in this and I guess
with it getting its subsequent referrals that some of the items that
seem worthy but can be further vetted could be vetted at that point. But
that being said, I move that we find Senate Bill 636 favorable with the
appropriate referrals on to, I think, Judiciary and then I think I heard
Finance, at the appropriate time. The PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a PCS, right. Motion should be that we give a
favorable report to the proposed committee substitute and unfavorable to
the original, but a referral to the Judiciary. You heard the motion. All
in favor say aye. All opposed no. The ayes have it and the motion is
carried and we're adjourned.
