Test. Senate J1, June 10th.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
folks get in the door and get calmed and situated, we'll get started.
Good morning everybody. Let me make a couple announcements before we get
started with the introductions of the pages and the sergeant at arms.
The Chair is called for all amendments on Senate Bill 648, previously to
be turned in this morning. We will extend that a few minutes to make
sure everybody's had a chance to do that. We want to make sure that
we've got everything before us so we can handle this is an orderly
manner. We are going to take some public comment this morning and so if
you have not gotten your name on a list to address the bill please speak
to the sergeant at arms. Depending on how many folks we have that want
to make comment we'll determine how much time we're able to allot to
each person. We do anticipate doing that for about thirty minutes so
we'll probably have public comment until about 9:40 and then we are
going to take up the bill in full force and address amendments and so
forth. So I hope all the committee members are aware of that and have
gotten your amendments in if you seek to have amendments and that the
public will be prepared to make public comment. I'm going to ask the
speakers, when they do make public comment, to come forward to the
microphone and so I will call out your name if you're on deck. I hope
everybody that's intending tos peak is listening carefully. I will call
out your name to be on deck and when you hear that if you would make
your way over here to this area in general so that we don't have to wait
for people to make their way to the mic because time is important. Okay,
so good morning everybody. Thank you for coming, again, to the
illustrious Judiciary 1 committee. We have a lot of work before us this
morning. Let's see if I can get this volume to not give me any feedback.
I hope that's a little better. Let me begin by introducing our pages.
can everybody hear me in the back of the room okay? Okay, alright. Thank
you guys, thank you Cody. So our pages that are with us today, if you
would please stand and give us a wave. Give us your beauty pageant wave.
That would make me appreciate it. First we have Eliza Darden Smith from
Wilson, courtesy of myself. Welcome Eliza, I hope you learn something
today. We have Amanda Spence. Amanda, where's Amanda?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She's back there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Back there. Thank you Amanda, we appreciate you being here today. She's
from Raleigh, courtesy of Senator Krawiec. It looks like I have, now
forgive me for the writing so if I mispronounce your name I apologize,
is it Maria Samoson? Did I say it right? Is it Maria? Marita, okay, from
Selma, courtesy of Senator Robinson. We have an Alex Straud[?] from
Aberdeen courtesy of Senator Tillman. Thank you, coach. We have Grant
Buchanon[?] from Wilson, courtesy of myself, thank you. Amelia Fox,
Greensboro, Senator Berger. Hanna Lunsford[?] from, it looks like
Leasburg, Senator Woodard, is that right? And Will Soul from Raleigh,
Senator Stein. Thank you all, I hope you learn something today and this
week and I encourage you all to ask your sponsoring Senator's questions
about the process this week and what all is going on so you can come
away with a great understanding of what we do to help here in the
General Assembly. And we sergeant at arms today but I don't see a list.
Do we have that somewhere? I see Bernie and a bunch of guys here. Ernie,
Matt, and Ken. Is that all? We need more of you to keep order here.
Thank you, gentlemen. If you have any questions please speak to one of
the Sergeant at Arms and we'll see what we can do to take care of it. So
this time we're going to take back up Senate Bill 648, which we had a
motion to take up that PCS in the last meeting and it is still before
us. I don't believe we require another motion to go back in to that bill</p>

<p id="05:00">
And before I take public comment, I just want to first ask the bill
sponsor if there’s anything at this moment that he’d like to add. It’s
been a while since you’ve spoken, Senator Jackson, and I’ll give you an
opportunity later on as well if you’re on, but we’ll go right into
public commentary and then dive back into the bill, and if at any time
you want to address any of the amendments and stuff that come forth,
just make it clear and I’ll certainly give you an opportunity to do
that. So at this time, we’re going to go into some public comment, and I
know that we have a new list. Thank you very much. And we’ll make that
decision real quick. Let’s go with four minutes. We’re going to ask
people to limit their comments to four minutes, hard and fast. We will
cut the mic off if necessary because we’ve got to keep this moving
along. I’ll work my way down the list here. First I’ve got John Del
Giorno. Is that right? And then we’ve got Scott… I can’t make it out. It
looks like Praywist or something like that. Scott Praywist? Is that…?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Prewitt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Prewitt. I’m sorry. Scott,
if you’d make your way up to be on deck, we’d appreciate that, and then
we’ll go from there. So first I have Del Giorno, and you will… if you’ll
please identify yourself, who you’re with, and the section of the bill
that you wish to address. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please come forward, sir. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman, members of the committee. My name’s John Del Giorno with
Brubaker &amp; Associates – they represent the pharmaceutical
manufacturers and researchers of America – to talk about the FDA defense
part of the bill. The elephant in the room is a big misconception about
what this defense actually does. It is not in any stretch immunity for
drug companies. As a matter of fact, if a product is recalled because
the manufacturer failed to live up to the standards that the FDA
prescribed at approval, defense fails. Furthermore, if the manufacturer
withholds or misrepresents information that it gets about the
performance of its drug or its safety profile while it’s marketed and
doesn’t tell the FDA, and that information would have lead to a recall
or even a label change, the defense fails. Now it’s important for
everyone to understand that the FDA and the medical community have long
recognized that there’s no such thing as an absolute safe drug, but the
agency balances the risk associated with the drug against the competing
risk associated with not having the drug available. That’s why these
drugs are available by prescription only and prescribed under a doctor’s
care. The adverse effects associated with a specific drug are usually
the result of a drug’s composition and are inseparable from the drug’s
beneficial effects. Instead of requiring the absolute proof that no
short term or long term risks exist, which would mean withholding
potentially lifesaving or life-enhancing medicines from the public, the
FDA conducts a risk-benefit analysis to determine what risk is
reasonable in light of its expected therapeutic benefits. This FDA
defense strikes a perfect balance, fairness to the manufacturers. If
there’s any kind of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the
manufacturers, the claimants have full access to all the remedies
available by law. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Thank you
very much. So we have Scott Prewitt? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Scott, if you would come forward and say who you are and who
you’re with and which part of the bill you want to address. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] My name is Scott Prewitt, and I’m just here representing my
daughter and to speak against section three of this particular bill. My
wife’s name is Cheryl. I also have a son named Will, and we’re from
Arden, North Carolina. In June of 2009, Britney, which is this is my
daughter, finished her freshman year of high school on Tuesday. The
following Saturday, she was preparing for a…</p>

On a trip. Cheryl and Brittany, letting Mandy, her new little dog out to
play in the yard just before we were to leave. Brittany then put her dog
in a crate and went out to the vehicle to put the dog in the vehicle,
and she suddenly took off running across the front yard, tripped and
fell, and when I reached her, I asked her how she was doing. She was
pretty much in a daze, didn't know how she got there, and she was
unaware of what had just happened. I got her up and inside the house,
and Brittany said she was having a hard time breathing. We called the
night clinic, and while on the phone with the nurse at the night clinic,
Brittany fell out of her chair, started throwing up, shaking,
unresponsive. We called 9-1-1 and the ambulance left the yard with our
15-year-old daughter, and she died on the way to the hospital. Brittany
was involved with church and school, she played on three softball teams,
and she played catcher and first base. Brittany loved holidays, and was
involved in many aspects of our family's life. She wanted to be a nurse,
but she'll never have that opportunity, because she died of a blood clot
that Saturday in her lungs, from the result of a prescription drug
approved by the FDA. The drug was normally prescribed for birth control,
but the company marketed it to girls for acne. Brittany had seen an
advertisement for the drug in magazines, and she took it with Cheryl to
the dermatologist, who then prescribed Yaz for her acne. The company was
aware of the increased risk of blood clots in the medication.
Advertising directly at young women self-conscious of acne is very
powerful. The advertising influenced her, and it said that it could do a
lot to make her better, for which it did not. It ended up taking her
life. This legislation would protect manufacturer's profits, whether the
manufacturer is located in another state, another country, or around the
world. It removes personal responsibility from the wrongdoer, and makes
the innocent bear the emotional and financial burden of loss. If this
bill passes, this situation could result in innocent victims from ??,
Carolina to keep them from holding manufacturers, like Bayer,
responsible. Do domestic and foreign drug companies deserve immunity
from claims by North Carolina people? I don't think so. We hope that no
one has to go through what we went through, but I can assure you, it's
very devastating, and laws should be fair, and this one is not. Please
vote against the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Prewitt, thank you very much. All right, if I could, I'm
sorry; I didn't call out the next person that was on deck. If I could
have, I think, Julia White with the AG's office wanted to address this
part of the bill, if I understood from my notes correctly. If she could
make her way forward, and then I have Janet Ward Black, and then I have
Wanda Queen. Okay. In that order. Okay. Miss White? Thank you. If you'll
state who you are, and who you're with, and what you want to speak
about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure. My name is Julia White, I work for the Attorney General's office,
I've expressed to members of the committee previously concerns about the
product liability provision that would</p>

Prevent, or have the potential to prevent collections both our medicated
fraud investigative unit and our consumer protection unit which makes
claims on behalf of consumers in North Carolina and also is able to uh
collect monies that may be due to department of corrections for example,
the state uses through inmate medical costs and even the state health
plan. I urge your consideration of protecting tax payers of north
Carolina on this provision, thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Thank you Miss White. So next we have Janet Ward
Black and you're going to speak on section 3?
[SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes thank you, I'm Janet Ward Black. I'm a lawyer from Greensboro. And
I'm here to speak against section 3. All we want is a fair fight. There
is six reasons in North Carolina that it's already not a fire fight for
somebody to be able to recover like the Pruits. One is the fact that we
have contributory neglegences in absolute defense, only one of 4 states
who do. We are also one of 5 states that do not have strict liability
for a defective product, that's number 2. Number 3 we have the shortest
or almost the shortest statute of repose in the nation. 31 States don't
even have a statute of repose. Number 4 we have required 12 person
unanimous verdicts in North Carolina. That means all 12 citizens have to
agree whether or not a company acted unreasonably and what the amount of
the damage is. We have in number 5 specific protections for drug
companies that say as long as they warn the doctor and even if the
doctor didn't tell you, the company cannot be held liable. And number 6
we have conservative jurors that take their job very seriously. If this
provision is passed this will make North Carolina the most anti consumer
state in the nation. It would shift product safety away from the people
with the most knowledge, the manufacturer and put it on bureaucrats. It
would just absolve the company from identifying information. It would
make bureaucrats responsible and give immunity to individuals and
corporations for making decisions rather than putting it on those who
know the most. It would then make North Carolina a place where you would
dump products that our neighboring states there would be accountability
in those states, but what kind of products am I talking about? Baby
formula, car seats, exploding pinto gas tanks, nuclear fuel rods, ??,
hip implants, fin fin, toys and even airplanes. This section number 3
isn't just about drugs. It's about all products. It doesn't effect
frivolous lawsuits. It effects all lawsuits. Let's take an example from
last week. Last week a German manufacture paid 650 million dollars to
resolve cases in the United States. Do we want to say when settlements
like that happen we don't want North Carolinian's to get recovery. that
we don't want medicare and Medicaid and insurers to be able to get their
money back? IF we don't have that the burden falls on the tax payer. It
falls on the insurer. It falls on medicare and Medicaid. And if it's an
on the job defective product it ends up putting the burden on the
employer because worker compensation will then pay the bills. IT takes
the burden off the responsible party and allows a shield to be put up as
a result of government approval in any way. It is not a fair fight. IT
was not a fair fight in North Carolina before this provision was
considered. I ask you, lets hold people accountable. Lets hold
corporations accountable. Personal responsibility is what we should be
looking for and not for decisions by bureaucrats being the way we ensure
the safety of the people of North Carolina. Thank you very much.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Miss Black. And then I have Wanda Queen. Ma'am If you would
step up and tell us your name and who you're with.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you, my name is Wanda Queen. I'm the retail president for Vantage
South Bank here in Rowley. I'm here speaking on behalf of Number 3. When
I was asked or when I was told about this build and asked if I would
share my story I was hesitant because it's a very personal story. It's
one i don't tell my friends. I haven't told a lot of my family members
and yet today because this issue is so important I'm going to tell a
room full of strangers. There is a commercial on television right now a
lot of you have seen from attorneys about trans vaginal mesh and what
does that mean? Well I'm the face of that. But also your wife, I'm your
mother, I'm your sister, or i'm your daughter. Now I'm going to tell you
a little bit about my stories briefly as I can. I grew up in a very
small town where my father told me you can do anything you wanted to as
long as you put your mind to it. So I put myself through school as best
I could, I raised two children by myself and I'm sitting where I am
today by the grace of god that I have the position</p>

<p id="20:00">
I have, in a community that I have. Five years ago my husband and I came
back from traveling because we like to travel a lot. And I had something
happen to me that I wasn’t aware of could happen and it’s called Pelvic
Organ Prolapse. It’s where a female may lose the insides of her body
without even recognizing that it’s happening to you. So I go to my
doctor who I feel very comfortable with. I’ve known her and have used
her for years and she shares with me what this is. She shares with me
how this can be fixed through a product that she’s encouraged to use by
the manufacturer. She shared with me what this product was, told me
would get me back on the road and ready to do my job and do the things
that I enjoy doing with my family. So I had this surgery and was ensured
that I’ll go back to work and I’ll be able to live my life. My life was;
had children, grandchildren, I ran, I exercised, I was out a lot. I had
this surgery made on a Thursday, November the 25th just before
Thanksgiving 2008. The next day I went home. It was an out-patient
surgery; I went home the next day. I thought I was dying; my insides
were being ripped out. So I called my doctor. Take some Oxycodone. My
husband, he was a great husband and he gave it to me every four hours as
prescribed or as needed. So he would wake me up and give it to me. That
kept me knocked out enough so that I could get through to a Monday so I
could see my doctor again. I was in agony. My doctor said, “Oh! Let’s
look.” Apparently some of this product was tearing through my insides.
So when my, in her office without an anesthesia she tried to cut this
loose. Let me imagine. Let me let you as females imagine what that might
be like. Needles tearing through your insides. So she sent me home with
Oxycodone. It didn’t help. I was back the next day. I was back the next
day. I’ve been back for very month or every week for the last five
years. I’ve now had thirteen surgeries trying to get this out of me. I
was fortunate enough that somehow I found somebody legally to help me
understand that this product had been initially approved by the FDA but
you know; as this was placed in my body there was a warning that came
out from the FDA that said perhaps we shouldn’t use this. There are a
lot of women that are having problems with this. Perhaps just because
this product was similar to another product that was used for something
else we don’t have to do additional testing. Perhaps we’ll just place it
in women without any testing. And so they placed it in me and I’m
looking at another surgery. I can care my little grandchildren, I do
what I can but I also know that my life is not going to be what it ever
will be again. And I’m looking forward to another surgery in a few
months. So please think about this and overwhelmed, under informed
governmental agency should not tell us what we can do. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Ms. Duyn. I have Bill Graham and if I could, I’m not sure if
there’s anybody else who has signed up to address Section three which is
the part that we’ve been addressing with public comments all along. If
time permits I have some folks that want to address Section two. We may
come to that later in the meeting but for now I’m not going to cover
that. So if I can have Bill Graham up. Bill, you do want to address
Section three, is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I don’t want to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Then we’ll, then we’ll scratch that. Okay. Alright, so this time
committee we’re going to take up this bill and discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thirty ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had signed up and I really want to address three. I also would like
two but I have something to say on three. My name is Kirk Warner. I
should be on that list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Warner, I have you down for Section two.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. I’d also like to be down for two.  I also want two ?? but I’d like
to address three ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Warner, if you’ll come forward we’ll give you three minutes to
address number, Section three. I believe you addressed this last time on
Section Two primarily I believe. Is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. So we’ll, we’ll let you address Section two since we still have
some time. Section three, excuse me. Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Again, my name is Kirk Warner. I’m with the Smith
Anderson Firm, also representing the North Carolina Association Defense
Attorneys. First of all I wanted to mention the very sad story  from the
??. That is sad but that would not be barred under the statute because
that’s ?? Labor used which is illegal and is not a defense under the
statute.</p>

<p id="25:00">
So that is a great story but there is still an opportunity for them. A
company has to do the research, test, do it clinically, go to the
government to get approval for drug use in this country. A government,
then looks at it, reviews, researches, evaluates and then approves a
drug for a specific use. Then it requires a specific language in its
labeling. The manufacturer cannot use anything other than that label.
How then can it be determined that a manufacturing company, a
pharmaceutical company can be negligent which means unreasonable in
putting drugs out to the public when the government has actually said -
this is what you’re required to do. You have proven, correctly what it
does and it can only be used for a specific use. So, as long as the
company has not sent back the government, it has and everything it’s
supposed to do before bylaw and how can that fall below the standard of
care required of a manufacturing pharmaceutical company. Right now it’s
only considered in North Carolina as a factor to be determined by a
jury. It should be a defense. Because that proves that you’ve acted
reasonably by going through the process and following the steps. So
therefore, we’re in support of 648 in section 3. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Warner. In light of the additional
come-ins, I’m gonna give one more comment to Miss Van Leningham who I
believe is an attorney for Miss Queen and if you could address section 3
and particularly the FDA process and so forth, we would appreciate that.
Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please state your name for the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, my name is Allison Van [Leningham]. I’m an
attorney at Greensboro and I’ve been representing women who have been
injured by transvaginal mesh and multi district litigation proceedings.
What that is, when there’re a lot of these cases of folks who have been
injured by a particular product, they gather them under one umbrella
with one particular judge. So last summer, I tried a case in the
southern district of West Virginia which is where this in deal is
proceeding. The first trial was a Georgia Woman named Donna [Sisson].
The second trial was to be a North Carolina woman, Von De Queen who
you’ve heard from and so I represented these women, I represented a
woman from Mississippi, I represented a woman from Minnesota, all of
these women’s cases were to be tried as the exemplar cases of this
particular product with this particular manufacturer. This manufacturer
had made Hernia Mesh for a lot of years. Hernia Mesh, of course, is pull
in the abdomen between the layer of muscle and fat and so they used that
product when they went to the FDA to get this product approved and what
they did, there was a process at the FDA called substantial equivalence.
It’s called the 510k process. So, instead of having to do any clinical
trials, instead of having to do any testing that involves what going to
happen when they put a product into a person, what they did was they
said – this mesh product that we’re getting ready to put in women
transvaginally is the exact same thing as hernia mesh. So, the FDA
allowed them to market this product. It’s not a product that’s only
abdomen between muscle and fat. It is a product that is placed in
through the vagina into the internal portions of the body. There are
arms on this product that are placed in through the sides by a gigantic
hook. It is a totally different location, it is a totally different
process, it is a totally different application and the first time
anybody knew what was gonna happen when they put it in women was when
they started selling it and implanting it surgically in women. The thing
that is insidious about this product is that it cannot be removed
because of the way it anchors in through the sides. It was never tested,
it was never clinically examined before it was placed into people. So,
the first trial that we had resulted in a 2 million dollar verdict on
behalf of this Georgia woman. There was a finding that this was a
defective product, there was a punitive damages finding against this
manufacturer. Under the bill, under section 3, Von De Queen, the North
Carolina plaintiff that was next for trial would not have been able to
file her suit in my opinion. She would have been dismissed. So, we’re
not only putting a process, this 510k process, out in a way that it
should not be a defense of these manufacturers; we’re putting North
Carolina plaintiffs, people who are injured and byproducts of North
Carolina at tremendous disadvantage.</p>

There is a law in other states. I’ve looked at the law for all these
different plaintiffs. And, this would make North Carolina absolutely the
most restrictive. I would ask you to vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Senator Hartsell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I ask a question of anyone one of these people?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Thank you Senator Hartsell that’s exactly where we were getting
ready to go. Senator Hartsell’s recognized to ask his question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question is for Mr. Warner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Warner if you could step into the horseshoe here where everybody can
hear you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question is did you see 60 minutes Sunday night a week ago?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I did not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Did any of the speakers see 60 minutes Sunday night a week ago? The
reason I phrase that is. There’s a segment on 60 minutes dealing with
FDA testing and the failure of the testing to take into account
differences in women over time. That’s what it was on. Just because the
way the tests are designed. That’s doesn’t necessarily say the tests
aren’t appropriate, it just says there may be some inconsistencies.
Because, most tests are done on men, for various sundry reasons but
don’t take into account the effect on women. At least, that’s what I
took from it. I’m just curious if anybody has any other facts that are
about these folks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Hartsell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If any of the speakers or anybody here, am I incorrect in my what I’m
perceiving in terms of this test?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re the only one in America who watched that program (laughter).
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Somehow, that’s true.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Martin, did you want to comment on Senator Hartsell’s question?
Please step forward. For any of the members of the public that are asked
a question, please step forward to the kind of middle horseshoe of the
tables where everybody can hear you and state your name again so that
our record is clear who you are and Ms. Black you’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m (??) Black. In regard to Mr Hartsell’s question. It is my
understanding that that is correct in history. A lot of times women were
eliminated from clinical trials because they had menstrual cycles and
they got pregnant. And, if there wasn’t the stability in that kind test
results. So, oftentimes women were eliminated from testing. I did not
see the show, but that’s what I understand from the history of the FDA.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Ms Black. Any other questions Senator Hartsell, at this
moment? Okay. Chair recognizes Senator Goolsby.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I had a question for the representative from the attorney
general’s office.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. White? Is that who you wanted to do the?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Thank you Mr. Chair. Ms. White. Regarding this law, the section
that we’re talking about right now. I understand that it’s the fear of
the attorney general’s office that if we pass this you will lose your
ability to basically get those large settlements that we get now when we
find that people have been harmed by products produced by pharmaceutical
firms?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If it would be alright, I would like defer to someone..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly. Come forward. State their name and who they’re with. Again,
so we can keep the record clear, please. Thank you Ms. White.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say just as a general proposition. We would certainly continue
to try to make the argument. The state still could still bring these
claims. The experience in Michigan with a similar provision, as far as I
know, the only one in the state so far has what has been going there.
I’ll let these gentleman introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, which one wants to go first?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll go first. Good morning. My name’s Stephen McCallister, assistant
attorney general with Mackey investigations (?).
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. I’m Kevin Unison, senior assistant deputy attorney general
and director of super (?) division.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which one of you would like to address Senator Goolsby’s question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll go first, and Stephen, he’ll chime in. I thank the Senator. It’s a
good question. Currently, there’s no doubt on our ability to recover for
the state. There’s nothing in the law that casts any doubt on that. I
think that if this bill were to pass at is written now, there’s be lots
of things lawyers would argue about on both sides. The main point is
that there would be lots of doubt passed on our authority under this
bill and there’s lots of arguments we would have to make. Ultimately, it
might have to be litigated with court making the decision. That would be
a big difference from what we have now where’s just no doubt currently
in the law on our ability to obtain these recoveries for…</p>

<p id="35:00">
And I echo the sentiments. I believe that this bill would compromise our
ability to recover in a lot of circumstances, including, but not limited
to, off-label marketing. And I would point to Michigan as an example of
the concern that we have. And I'll read to you from the Michigan Court
of Appeals opinion. They said, “Here, because plaintiffs' claims are
based on representations about the state of the inefficacy of Vioxx,
they're barred because the FDA approved Vioxx. And they are absolutely
barred under the Michigan Product Liability statute, which is very, very
similar to the one being considered here. So we are very concerned. And
it's not a hypothetical or a theoretical concern, it's based on
something that actually happened in another state, and we're concerned
that that's gonna happen here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could add one more thing...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ...Both of these divisions act in concert with other
states on multi-state investigations and recoveries, so this would have
the potential of recoveries being barred in North Carolina, that are
otherwise going on in other states.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Goolsby, do you have a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I didn't get to...How much money do the people of
North Carolina...how much did we get last year from these recoveries
from pharmaceutical firms, for the injuries done to North Carolinians
and what we've paid out in tax dollars? Do you know?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know that it's tens of millions of dollars. I can
speak to one particular case with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, involving
Risperdal and Invega. And there, the settlement reached was $39 million.
And the concern is, that if North Carolina has this law and other states
don't, we're not going to be able to participate in these settlements.
Other states are gonna receive these recoveries, and North Carolina's
gonna be left on the sidelines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Like Michigan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby? Okay. Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to follow up on this line of inquiry, if I
may, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There are some cases where it's off on the marketing,
and of course the council Senator ?? spoke about earlier, he said
off-label cases aren't covered, which would be litigated, and so you'd
have to fight that because it introduces a level of uncertainty. But
aren't there cases where it's not off-label, but it's instead apt to
warnings? You all sent us a memo which pointed to the Purdue Pharma
case, where they were selling it for the purpose that the FDA approved,
and the state still had grounds for litigation...a lawsuit that
generated millions of dollars to North Carolina consumers on Medicaid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's absolutely right, Senator Stein. Your first
point is correct in that the statement you made—that off-label cases
would be allowed to go forward under this bill—that's not specifically
in the bill. The bill refers to immunity if there's an approval that's
relevant to the harm caused. There are lots of arguments that could be
made about that. So again, that issue is an ?? that would have to be
litigated, so I think you're correct on that. And then, with respect to
the second point, it's also true that a lot of our cases don't involve
off-label marketing and involve situations where...you had a case where
the drug had been approved, but the drug had been contaminated in a
facility in Puerto Rico, and the company knew that and went ahead and
sold these contaminated drugs anyway. So it had been approved by the
FDA, but it was contaminated due to the poor conditions in the plant,
and they knew that and they marketed it anyways. And so it doesn't seem
like FDA initial approval of drugs should grant immunity to it, because
it was a contaminated drug. And there are other situations like that. I
think even the FDA, if you look at its website, recognizes the
limitations of its own approval process, and speaks of a cost-benefit
analysis it does. But it recognizes that knowledge about harm comes to
light after the approval process, and the federal lawmakers and the FDA
itself have not granted it any sort of immunity through the FDA process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Stein, any other questions? Okay,
Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do have one, Mr. Chairman. There was a
representation made that if you discovered the defect of a product, that
you could still be held liable. And I'm trying to figure out—I'm looking
at page 7, lines 44 through 47. And it says “intentionally, and in
violation of applicable regulations, withheld or misrepresented...”. Why
wouldn't a normal negligence standard apply there? And I'm addressing
this to the drafters, I guess, or whoever had this specifically put in.
An intentional standard is much higher than a negligent standard</p>

<p id="40:00">
For example, the question about Puerto Rico. If the company should have
known by doing normal procedures if this thing was
effective or had been corrupted that's one thing but if you got to show
they intentionally withheld the corrupted drug, it's
a totally different thing. So I was trying to square that with the
records and patient earlier about this did not affect
recalls, when recalls should occur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Blue. Senator Jackson do want to
answer that or if you like you can defer to someone
else if you prefer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, alright. Bill would you like to..
[SPEAKER CHANGES] With respect to the Chair, I do not know why it was
intentional rather than negligent. That's the standard
in this but I think that Senator Blue is correct in saying that that's a
much higher standard than that we've shown. It's
also intentional and in violation of that, well regulation. So two
things that make it a higher burden to come within this
particular exemption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jack...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rush Chairman, also Kurt might have some input on this
if you would like please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chair recognizes Kurt Warner, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES] State your name again please and who you're with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Kurt Warner, standards and compliance association
[??]. Senator Blue, the intentional is really about
knowingly but you have negligence without knowing it. The example
brought up by my collegue at the AD's office, that clearly
is not covered by this defense that's in the statute because it's been
adulterated or contaminated. That's in the process,
you can be sued for that. That's negligence but what you're specifically
talking about is intentional. That's to require
that it being a knowing misrepresentation as opposed to any other
standard. Negligence you can have without knowing it at
all. One thing that you have done the research and done it and you just
dont' know and you've represented everything
correctly then you later find out it's been misrepresented, that's
different then you don't have [??] but the intentional is
about knowing, that's the key. I would use those synonymous with
knowingly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What I'm worried about in this probation is recall
because if you got to show that somebody intentionally
did not advise the agency that there was some signals that this thing
may not be working right. Those signals, if one has
the safeguards in place, should appear using regular prudence and
reasonable standards but if you got to show an intentional
standard when it comes to, especially recalled products. If you did not
let the Food and Drug Administration or whoever the
licensing agency is, know that we're getting some signs of that this
thing might need to be checked a little more closely,
you created what seems to be an unreasonable because it says
maintaining. That's the word that I'm throwing out. That you're
maintainning their approval process and if you got to intentionally show
that you didn't show something or perceive
something as opposed to the negligence you allow, the environment to
allow this to clear. It's almost impossible requirement
it seems. If that made sense.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. Warner, more or less unless somebody
has a question for you we're passed...or a
comment...there may be somebody who wants to ask you a question if
you'll stand by. Any other questions Senator Blue? Okay
Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Chairman. Mr Warner, if you don't mind, let
me ask a couple of question. I'm not an intern and
I'm doing this for all sitting here who are not interns. If you just
like to have some straight facts about this wheel. I
don't see anywhere in here that it says anything about off label. To me
&quot;off label&quot; would be me taking that as a doctor and
using it in a way that it has not been approved and I would think you
would be liable for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's true.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Since you're doing that. Now I do understand that if
you're producing a particular drug and you've put it
through all the regulations you're supposed to, do the testing, that
when it comes out and you even put it in the general
population, there's going to be some people that have a reaction. I
don't care how many tests you put it through it's just
going to end up that way. I don't see anything in here that would say
that you're liable for that, which I...</p>

<p id="45:00">
understand because what other caution precautions could you have taken,
but what I'm hearing in this room, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that
we want you to be responsible as the drug company or manufacturer for
everything that could possibly ever happen. Even though there's no way
you could ever know. Is that what I'm hearing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's what the current state of affairs is, that the,
it's essentially a strict liabilities standard, except in North
Carolina, but it's essentially that under warranty that the drug
manufacturer can be sued for anything, off label, on label,
idiosyncratic reactions, is what you're referring to. They can be sued
right now. But this bill is to give them a defense against against, if
you've used it correctly, used it as the label intends, and used it as
the FDA has approved, then you will have a defense. If there were enough
idiosyncratic defenses, then that would raise another issue as to
whether or not it's appropriate anyway, and that's what vaccine courts
are set up for anyway, because that's the type of protection the
companies need in that type of arena. So yes. Now that duties just on
the approval. There's a continuing duty to monitor the field and provide
information to the FDA under the reporting regulations. And at that
point, there's another decision by the FDA, that's how they keep track
of whats going on in the field. They can make decisions and require
either broader labeling, or restrictive use, or require recall. So the
recall rules are actually different then the, then the actual approval
rules. So it's a different standard that's involved in the recall
process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could before I follow up, I'd like to make a
comment from the chair. Miss ?? you just basically annunciated to this
committee as if North Carolina has a strict liability standard, which we
do not. And, and, and I want to be clear about that with Senator Wade
and other members of the committee. North Carolina does not have a
strict liability standard. So, what what this bill would do would
basically immunize any of, any of the product manufacturers, whether it
be pharmaceutical or otherwise, and they don't even have to run the risk
of there being a lawsuit. It's not a question of the plaintiff proving
their case. In North Carolina right now they have to prove their case.
But what, what this bill would do would say that you can't even have a
case. And we heard Miss [XX] testimony earlier, about the trans-vaginal
mesh. And I would remind you and the committee that was an approved
product, that apparently wasn't tested for the purpose for which it was
used, and obviously had many significant consequences for Miss [XX] and
many others. And if I understand this bill and the presentation so far
from you and others; she would not be able to pursue anything in that
case at all. She would just be flat out barred. And, you know, were
talking about folks without means. Like Miss ?? she has a good job I
assume she has health insurance. But if we're dealing with the lower
income folks of this state, then the state's gonna pick up the tab for
all the medical expenses that come down the line through Medicaid. So
those are the types of things that this committee needs to take into
account. How this bill would help North Carolinian's, and presumptively
there's some sort of economic basis for this section. And I still have
not heard any testimony yet about how this is gonna create jobs for
North Carolina, or, or, or any any of the pros are, I don't, I don't
hear any of the pros,  and t that's just a comment from the chair. I
don't hear any pros about why we need this section other than we need to
eliminate lawsuits like Miss ??. And so if you care to comment on that
and then we'll turn it back over to Mrs. Wade, Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The pros are to enable research and advancement in
medicine. That's the pro. The cons, [XX] the other pro, the con is
without this guess what happens to the cost of medications for the state
of North Carolina, and for all it's citizens. All that liability cost
has to rolled into the cost of the product,  and your price of any type
of prescription drug has to accommodate that cost. So, as manufacturers
get sued the cost goes on and the cost gets relayed back to the citizens
and to the state; it's reimbursement policies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Of course every state would need to adopt this
standard for that to hold true. That, Senator Wade, and then we'll come
back to Senator Van Duyn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well that, that was as dumb as what I was gonna ask
you in the follow up was. If, if you were a manufacturer I would think
you would be hesitant if there weren't rules governing what you could be
sued for. To...</p>

develop new products because certainly there would be risk so would you
just explain in common terms that if I develop a certain drug, I go
through the FDA, I take years and money to get it approved, I get it
through everything, what is my liability when I come out? What can I be
sued for if I followed all of the procedures, I’ve done all of the
studies, and I’ve done everything I'm supposed to do by law?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right now, you’re still at the mercy of twelve people sitting on a jury,
evaluating whether you acted reasonably or not.  The position for this
statute, this defense to the lawsuit is that you are presumed to have
acted reasonably if you have gone through the correct process and been
approved by the government for the specific use for which it’s being
used. That’s what the defense is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One quick follow up –
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One quick follow up and then we’ve got - now we’ve got three senators
whose hands have gone up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well maybe I should be quiet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So what you’re telling me is that if something happens when I take a
medication, then I can sue you any time I want to. And it will be up to
a court of law to decide whether I have a case or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that basically the law now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right now, whether you have complied with the regulations from the FDA
warnings and things like that is only a factor to be determined. It is
not a defense – a complete defense. So you can still be liable for
whatever reason, but for twelve people in North Carolina, even though
you complied with everything.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And this bill makes it
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
… sorry, this bill makes it so that I’ve got to – If I’m suing you –
that I have to give you - prove a reason that you didn’t follow the
protocol that you did by law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Or have some other reason – it’s adultered, it’s contaminated, it’s off
label, whatever. And then of course you have the prescribing physicians
that prescribed it off label, and that’s another potential issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Medical malpractice. Senator Van Duyn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Warner, I have a question for you. I’m a homeowner, and I work
hard to keep my house and my yard in good repair, but if a gust of wind
comes up and knocks a tree over onto my neighbor’s yard, I’m responsible
for that. And so, I take out homeowner’s insurance to indemnify myself
against that risk. At the beginning of the meeting, we talked about how
any drug has a potential to harm people, and that process the FDA looks
at is a cost/benefit analysis. So if we accept the fact that there is
potential for all of these drugs to do harm, shouldn’t a cost of doing
business being indemnifying ourselves against – to protect those people
that will inevitably be harmed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One, that’s what your personal medical insurance is about, is part of
the balancing of risk, and the FDA also looks at that as part of a
balancing of risk. Like the tree that fell on your neighbor’s yard,
you’re not responsible unless you negligently maintained that tree. Like
if it’s ready to fall down, that’s the only time, and you should have
taken it down, that’s the only time you would ever be liable for that
tree falling on your neighbor’s fence. That aside, this is the process
of which prescription drugs in the United States follow and every
country in the world. They have to go through some process and
evaluation before they can be put into public use and it’s a very
rigorous process in most cases. So, once that’s approved, how can it be
negligent, unreasonable of a company that’s has gone through the
process, done the right things, and followed the rules, how can that be
negligence for which they’re culpable?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up? Ok, Senator Stein, and Senator Rucho, and Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And a question for Ms. Black.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Black if you would come forward please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we've been focusing on pharmaceuticals, and provisions and I find
myself in the ironic position relative to the cosponsor of having less
confidence in government’s ability to look out for people, but it not
only applies to pharmaceutical companies. I’m thinking of the Conavra??
case in Garner?? where people were killed and dozens of people injured.

[speaker]This family being able to recover through the negligent actions
of a corporation
[Jennifer Black]Well if provision three was passed then it would be this
circumstance.  If the President of the company could recover from the
property damaged from the explosion that occurs, but if his son was
killed in the same explosion, he would be barred.  That would be the
difference.  So tt depends on how you value.   If you want to value the
people more or you value the property more.  This is about stopping
people's lawsuits and not property law suits.
[New Speaker] So look explain how the property lawsuits would be  able
to go forward.  I mean, I think probably lawsuits should come to court.
I just don't think people should xxxx
[Jennifer Black] All the six things I identified earlier on those were
roadblocks for personal injury claims.  They are not roadblocks that
stopped the ability to recover from damaged property.
[Speaker] Thank you.
{Jennifer Black] Just one other example the recent GM recall. For
example Senator Sator there you have an incidence were Mifad did not
respond until ten years after GM knew there was a problem and so all
these people who died and all the people who were injured for those ten
years the company had better information than the government did.l  If
this law passes then for people after  the days of  the mifad approval
the recall  occurred  those people who were referred after that would be
able to recover but the people at the time the company knew until the
Misaw act of recall would not be able to recover.
[Chairman] Okay Senator Richard and then Senator Horton.
[Senator Richards] I appreciate it and everyone of us here is concerned
of making sure there is public safety and that unfortunately whenever a
product or service is delivered there is always a risk of accidental end
of life.  But I guess I have a fundamental concern in one of the issues
is because the fact that there seems to be a lot frivolous lawsuits
because there just happens to be people who are willing to take a case
to court and their attorneys are willing to crowd those courts whether
they are frivolous or not and there are many cases where because the
cost gets so high on the legal end potential lawsuits it's almost like
legal extortion against many businesses many in North Carolina.  Which I
look at and say that impacts the ability of North Carolina businesses to
compete with low cost services or manufactured goods.  I guess the
question that I have for the gentlemen whom excuse me I forgot his name.
 I apologize.
[Chairman] Oh are you talking about Mr. Warner?  Are you talking about
Mr. Warner.  Okay.
[Senator Richards] Does this actually allow for or reduction or
elimination of frivolous lawsuits so that North Carolina businesses will
have an opportunity to be innovative and provide a willingness to invest
 in and also like a capital get a hold of products that will make the
life of people of North Carolina and the country better?
[Mr. Warner] It will indirectly, but it won't prevent people from suing.
  Because it's a defense and not a community but a lawsuit can be
brought and then perhaps a discovery or whatever and then there will be
a motion to be dismissed based on or a motion based on some judgment
based on this defense.  However, the fact that this defense exists would
bring hesitation to those defenses and so the indirect effect to this is
yes.
[Chairman] Follow up
[Senator Richards] Follow up.  This still allow somewhat for some
frivolous lawsuits for whatever claim they claim have.  So it does get
xxx  any legal party can still bring it forward but at least there is a
chance of whether it is frivolous or not so that it could be stopped
short rather than being dragged on for 30 or 40 years and that actually
xxx.
[Mr. Warner] It would save millions to companies because they would have
an appropriate early exit rate.
[Chairman] okay I have Senator Horton next and then I'll come back to
Senator Wade.

Because if in fact you… in a personal injury context, they would be
subsumed because they are all based on the products liability portion of
it. The UCC portion of it, if it is in fact… the UCC only provides for
reimbursement of the product cost and things like that. The replacement
parts, things like that. It wouldn’t effect it in that sense, so in a
personal injury standpoint, it probably would be effective because it
would be a defense ?? and the other warranty are yet to prove a defect,
and that’s the same type of standard you have for the defense of the
products to start with, so if you have a defense to that claim, it would
also bar a warranty claim, unless for example you provided the wrong
numbers or an economic-type situation in which the product you provided
was damaged, and those still come into play. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator

Senator Wade and then Senator Brown. Senator Wade. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Warner, I’m sorry I’m wearing you out, but
if you could come up here one more time, I just want to piggyback on
what Senator Rucho had to say. My understanding is there’s nothing in
section 3 that prohibits anyone from suing a manufacturer for an injury.
Only thing is that you have to prove in a court of law that you’ve been
injured and they are liable. Is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct.
Correct. There’s nothing in there that bars the bringing of a lawsuit.
That would be true immunity, if they could defend “you can’t sue us”.
That’s not the case. This is a defense. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So you just
have to prove your case? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have to prove your case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown and then
Senator Barringer and then Senator Goolsby. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. I’ve got to say, I’m not an attorney either, so I’ve got
to work through this. It talks about manufacturing, it talks about the
seller, and I’m trying to get a distinction here because a manufacturer
may produce a product, and down the road, that product could have a
problem, but that manufacturer could be out of business, and as a
seller, you’ve sold this particular product, and all of a sudden this
lawsuit comes to a seller who has absolutely nothing to do with making
that particular product. Walk me through that. How could that seller be
liable, and how does this maybe change that when a seller wouldn’t know
about that issue? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you like staff to take a crack
at that to begin with, Senator Brown? [SPEAKER CHANGES] And everyone
else at this point. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s start with staff and then we
may have someone else address it if they choose to. Bill? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I apologize; I just need to hear the question one more time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He was asking how if… I’m going to try and summarize
it. If the manufacturer’s gone out of business, what – [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Or may still be in business. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Or may still be in
business, but the seller of the product, who wasn’t involved in the
manufacturing of the product but is the seller of the product, what kind
of liability if any do they have or would they have under this bill? Is
that…? Bill, if you’d like to… Do you want…? I’m seeing a couple hands
in the public. Senator Brown, I will address two people. Mr…. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Del Giorno. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Del Giorno first and then Ms.
Black, who I also see wanted to stand. We’ll try and keep this moving
along. Time’s running out. We’re going to need to move along with some
amendments, shortly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sellers are generally protected
from liability unless at the pharmacy – you’re talking about pharmacists
here and drug contexts – unless the pharmacist somehow adulterated the
product before he sold it, or he mis-prescribed it, gave the wrong
dosage.</p>

<p id="65:00">
Something along those lines. In other words, pharmacists ?? put together
some kind of action that caused the product to be defective for that to
be ?? is liable. So pharmacists are generally never held liable in these
product liability cases against them ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right,
let me just address it quickly and then Senator ?? if we can get that
addressed and follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just really quickly Senator
Brown. In our current 99 day provision to it says seller's opportunity
to inspect, so if the seller didn't change the product, you get it from
the manufacturer and you sell it and it's still in the same sealed
container, the seller can't be liable under our current law. So unless
the seller did something to change it and made it more dangerous, then
in fact a seller could be liable. But this instance is one of the rare
times that ?? like a drugstore is not going to be liable in the case ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to bring up a situation. I know
where a car or a vehicle with a defect ?? for an individual, sue the
manufacturer and the car dealer and the car dealer was found liable for
a defect of a car that they just sold, they didn't produce. Explain how
that could happen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not sure the car instance ??
but I'm sure that our college pharmaceutical program, or the Pharmacist
Association would agree that only in instances where there was
negligence on the part of the pharmacist or some kind of intentional act
to alter the drug some way or screw up the prescription somehow would
the pharmacist be liable. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair would just observe
that my understanding on what both the speakers have said there would
have had to have been some kind of finding or determination in the court
and by a jury that the seller had done something to the product, had
altered it, changed it in some way, not knowing the case, you know, if
there was, I don't know, changed the transmission, changed the tires. I
don't know, I'm just speculating, I wouldn't know. We need to keep
moving along because I know we're going to take up some minutes. It's
already 10:10, so Senator Barringer and then Senator Goolsby and then
we're going to take a very quick recess and look at the amendments we've
got and try to get through those. Senator Barringer. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question is for Miss Black again, I would like to have clarification
on, I think it's really a follow up to Senator Hartsell's question about
warranty. Am I correct in my understanding that the two warranties that
you were discussing were the warranty of merchantability, which meant
that the product is just and average quality and then also fitness for
particular purpose, which I think is a very important warranty to
explain regarding the transvaginal mesh because under our law as it
currently stands the manufacturers say that what they put out there is
fit for the particular purpose which was being marketed which was that.
Am I correct? Could you comment on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, so in a
typical action for products liability we have to prove that the
corporation acted unreasonably and that unreasonableness would include a
breach of an implied warranty or a breach of an expressed warranty, and
those we don't really talk about them in the big UCC claims so much, but
the product ?? So you are correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] OK. Senator Goolsby. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman
and I appreciate everybody coming to speak in here today and talking
with us. I've been here, this is the end of my second term and I'll be
going home to practice law when this is over. When I first got here, we
dealt with the difficult task of tort reform and medical malpractice
reform. Trial lawyer and plaintiff's lawyer, it was tough to make those
decisions but I felt like we made those decisions for the best, for the
best for North Carolinians overall. The thing that really scares me
about this, and I really won't, I just don't think it's coming out in
this meeting, is how radical a departure this section of the bill is
from anything that any other state has done. We keep hearing about
passing costs on to the system, but you have a lady in here who's a
banker who is going to bear that cost all on her own. We got people that
are in business to make money and they make products. I provide legal
services.</p>

<p id="70:00">
When I screw up I have legal insurance, malpractice insurance, that pays
the foot to the person I damaged. These folks are in here today asking
us to let them off scott free. Now, we talk about Senator Rucho was
worried about frivolous lawsuits. I’m in court, but I’m not here
everyday. We have alternate dispute resolution in this state. My courts
in New Hanniber county are shut down by about Wednesday most of the
civil courts, most weeks. We don’t have, we’re not a litigious state. As
Ms. Brax said, and I would agree. Our juries are tough. I try jury
trials and personal injury cases all the time. Nobody’s ever given any
of my clients a payday that was just unbelievable pennies from heaven.
It’s tough. I trust the people in North Carolina. I trust our judges. I
trust our legal system. What we are talking about doing here my friends
is literally giving a pass to huge corporations, just because some
federal bureaucracy is said you got to okay for now. They pass the costs
unto this lady, Baker, who just sucks it up herself. So, do we let the
people who are  in business for the harm they do, just off scott free?
If we do that, somebody pays the price. The person who pays the price is
the innocent consumer who just wanted the drug, the lawn mower, the car
whatever it is to work the way they were told it was going to work. I
tell you, if we do this, civil justice in North Carolina has taken a
step back to the dark ages. I just urge, caution and reflection. Nobody
does this in the United States and we do not need to do this to our
people. If it’s a frivolous lawsuit, it gets kicked out. This doesn’t
stop frivolous lawsuits, Senator. People can still file frivolous
lawsuits, but they get kicked. And, we have things in place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s long enough. Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I see Senator. I do have to pay. We all have to pay. If we don’t do that
sir, it passes on to the innocent consumers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not always.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not always.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
(gavel raps). Let me stop you for just second because of time. Senator
Apodaca, you will get before this meeting is over. If you want to
address this point, I will recognize you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But, sir. I’m concerned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand. I understand your concerns. We’re going to try to get
through this meeting orderly. I will certainly give you an opportunity
to respond to Senator Goolsby.. hang on just a second Senator Rucho.
Senator Goolsby, are you finished with your comments? I don’t want to
cut you off from doing that. I just wanted to get some order back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate it. I would just urge caution and that we don’t do anything
radical that no other state has done. The people of North Carolina
deserve a civil justice system that gives them a jury trial where 12
people get to decide what occurred, what happened based upon reasonable
negligence and additional circumstances.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, at this time, and I know there are some other hands from senators.
If my committee will bear with me. Then, we have at least ten or more
amendments that have been put forth and we’re going to work through. I’m
certain that many of your comments…that there will be an opportunity for
you to address those comments. So, we’re not going to take any more
comments from this committee at this moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair. Point of information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of information Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
According to Senator Goolsby’s testimony he shouldn’t have…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, I’m not going to go out at this moment. I will give you
an opportunity to address that and shortly. What we need to do is to
take a three minute recess to take a look at these amendments and start
taking up these amendments. You will have an opportunity, I’m certain
when those amendments come forth to address Senator Goolsby’s comments.
If you will please allow me to keep that kind of order because we are
already at a quarter after ten and we do need to move forward on this
bill. Okay? At this time we are going to take try to be a no more than
five minutes, actually a three minute recess and we’ll come back to
order if members will stay close by.  Passing out three amendments. The
first one we will take up is offered by Senator Barringer. In just a
moment I’ll recognize her to tell us what the amendment is. Then we have
an amendment from Senator Apodaca that we’ll take up. We’ll go in that
order. Then Senator Hartsell. Following Senator Hartsell’s amendment,
there may be other amendments, depending on how that amendment goes. I
think after that Senator Rucho is going to have an amendment. Yes.</p>

So at this time, I think all the members are back in place and hopefully
the public will come to order. Senator Barringer sends forth an
amendment. And at this time Senator Barringer is recognized to explain
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. This particular
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One or two? Which one? I didn’t know there
were two. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is the one that amends [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Number 2 or 4? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Number 4. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Number 4. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s make sure
we’ve got the right amendment before the members. Please tell Bill which
one you’re dealing with. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ATG-68 version 4, is that
correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Barringer, you’re recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. What this
amendment does is it conforms part 4 which is the preventive use of
patents, with the language that was passed by the House in the bill
which has now come over to the Senate. We want to make sure that the 2
bills are the same, so that we don’t have technical changes between the
2. I’ll be happy to address any questions that are here but that’s
basically what this does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Barringer.
Any comments on the committee on this conforming amendment? This
amendment that conforms. We have a motion for a favorable on the
amendment. Any further discussion? There being none, all in favor of the
amendment please say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
opposed? The ayes have it. The amendment is to be engrossed. Thank you.
Thank you Senator Barringer. Senator Apodaca has an amendment that
should have been given out. And you just had one, is that correct,
Senator Apodaca? The Chair recognizes Senator Apodaca to explain the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is the
identical language to your amendment you offered on the budget bill. We
just thought this was another vehicle that we needed to attach it to,
with a 3 judge panel, to hear constitutional issues. I can go into the
long drawn-out explanation but it is exactly what we passed in the
budget a few weeks ago. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Apodaca. So
I hope that all the members are already familiar with this provision as
we’ve already debated it on the floor. I see a motion for a favorable
report, unless there is a strong comment. Senator Stein, you are
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Does this include the provision
that says that if this 3 judge panel concludes that the people of North
Carolina will suffer irreparable harm if the law goes forward but
nevertheless the General Assembly says to the court that the law must go
forth? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca? Have to go back and read it?
[LAUGHTER] Hal Pell is recognized to explain. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The provision for the ?? if the ?? rules it is not an automatic
stay on that. There is on the ?? as a ?? challenge, where the state is a
party. There’s not a next day. But the 3 judge panel decision is not
included in that automatic stay provision. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Pell. Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What the legislature is saying to
the judiciary and to the people of North Carolina is that if, by the
way, when the Democrats were in power, they passed on Constitutional
laws. You all have been passing on Constitutional laws. It happens.
That’s the whole balance of power. That’s why we have a judiciary to
oversee us, to make sure we don’t disrespect the Constitution. And
sometimes when we pass on Constitutional law, if that law were to go
forward, it would create irreparable harm to the people. And that’s why
courts issue a stay. That is the standard of why you would issue a stay.
And what this says if it’s the same as what was in the budget is that
notwithstanding the fact that the people will experience irreparable
harm, if the courts want to issue a stay, no stay can be issued even by
a 3 judge panel, let alone the 1 judge, until the Supreme Court has
finally ruled. Which means the law goes forward, the image to the people
notwithstanding. That is terrible policy, and in fact I’m willing I
think the 3 judge panel will rule that this is unconstitutional when it
goes before them. And so I would like to offer up a perfecting amendment
that strikes that provision in this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
While we are preparing that, I’m going to recognize Hal Pell again.</p>

5 or 7 at the bottom, will I still be able to find 3? It combines that
in that session, if the trial court ?? there's a mandatory stay and
that's the provision that's in this bill. However it says on the next
page that the subsection. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you site the page and
line please, Hal. [SPEAKER CHANGES] On the next page of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Of the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? of the
amendment. This subsection does not apply to ?? County's prejudge panel,
in other words that part of the bill that says there shall be a stay on
a trial judge doesn't apply to the prejudge panel. That does not mean
that ?? that a prejudge panel like any other court or could file their
own motion to stay or seek a stay from the Supreme Court. So I'm not
sure that what is being said, that there's still not an option by that
prejudge panel to seek a stay of that or not, it's just that the
provision that says stay is not mandatory for a trial judge does not
apply to the prejudge panel. That would be the judgement. So that is the
same as is in the budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Hal. If I could,
how long will it take to have the. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes Senator Stein, if I understand correctly what Mr. Pavel's
saying, the part of the bill that you want to be taken out by amendment
isn't in there, so I'm not sure what part based on Mr. Pavel's
explanation would be the part that you want taken out. And that's, I
would ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein I'm going to ask you to take
the choice out of your ?? please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you would on,
consider. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Off ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Off, that's what I
was going to ask you if you'd consider. The other thing I was going to
say is we'll just place this, Senator Apodaca's amendment, and come back
to it, OK. All right. So you'll move it to the floor. All right, any
other discussion on this Amendment offered by Senator Apodaca. We have,
Senator Blue, we have a motion before us so Senator Blue. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just a quick comment, Mr. Chairman. Just because I was ??
seeing this in the budget, so am I ?? but I'm glad that you brought it
to the judiciary committee and I made that argument about the budget. If
we are to do our duty as the judiciary committed, we ought to take this
amendment and parse it and then look at it line by line and see what it
does to the existing law and then see why we want to change it. Just to
give it a quick 2 minute, 3 minute dip in this committee. I think that
there's a mockery of what judiciary committees are really created for,
to answer the questions, not only that Senator Stein is raising, but to
be sure when we bring it out that we're comfortable on what it does to
the entire judiciary, how it changes procedures and what some of the
other applications are. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Blue. Not
seeing any other hands on this amendment, we have a motion before us.
All those in favor of the amendment by Senator Apodaca, please indicate
by saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The ayes have it. The amendment
is engrossed. We have an amendment from Senator Hartsell that should
have been circulated and this goes more to the heart of the bill and
what we've been discussing, so at this time the Chair recognizes Senator
Hartsell to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairmen, members of the committee. The amendment eliminates sections 2
and 3 of the bill but in place it puts in the requirement for study of
those issues raised by that section of the bill as well as looking at
the overall issue of ??, strict liability, professional liability, one
several liability and otherwise. It will be done in 6 months so we can
come back and look at that very thoroughly next session. My concerns as
an associate and also with this issue of warranty, ?? an issue. It is
not to say that there is not merit in sections 2 and 3. There is merit
unfortunately in sections 2 and 3, but what we're doing by adopting
either or both of those sections is creating a real aberration in our
law. And I think there is merit in probably looking at that but as we
look closer it seemed to me that we need to kind of flatten this out. We
don't need to create again winners and losers associated with a
particular kind of product, a particular kind of situation or otherwise.
If we pointed out the law is fair, it needs to be addressed from both
sides, looking ahead quite appropriately. That's not to say that some of
these more important ??</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes,  he’s had a rut back here. I was going to do that before we break,
I promise. While we were waiting for Senator Jackson to look at the
ammendment, are there are other questions or comments from committee
members on this amendment? Okay. Senator Jackson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. First, I would just like to make a statement as
a business owner and a business person. This bill as it was written is a
great bill. As it was written, it was a great bill for a business owner.
Anyone who has to deal with the FDA or any other government agency,
there is more rules and regulations upon us than we can even begin to
fathom or imagine. In light in listening to my lawyer friends, and I do
consider you friends, I knew…Don’t mean I trust you, I just consider you
friends (laughter). Let’s make that point clear. I knew we would have to
tweak this language. At this time, I think Senator Fletcher’s amendment
goes a little farther than I would be willing to tweak, and I would ask
that you not support that amendment. There is one coming that I will ask
you to support. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Jackson. Are there other comments or questions from
the committee? Okay, there being none. Let’s go ahead and vote the
amendment then. We need to move on. All those in favor of Senator
Hartsell’s amendment indicate by saying “aye”.  All those opposed? In
the opinion of the chair, the aye’s have it. The amendment is engrossed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Provisions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now, we haven’t done that in this committee Senator Apodaca. I will make
an exception for you. Okay. The amendment has been engrossed. I know
Senator Rucho has an amendment. Are there other amendments that need to
be brought forth? Okay. If the sergeant in arms at this time would pass
out Senator Rucho’s amendment. (papers rustling, crowd noises).
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair? I would like to withdraw at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho is going to withdraw the amendment? Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are there other amendments that we need to take up? Okay, at this time
not seeing any further amendments, the chair will entertain a motion for
a favorable report as amended. Senator Hartsell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I like to make a motion to roll it into a new committee subsitute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rolled into a new committee substitute? The motion before us is a
favorable report as amended rolled into a new committee substitute? Any
other discussion? I know Senator Apodaca wanted to vote. We might pause
to make sure there is no comments or questions for the committee. As a
courtesy to Senator Apodaca, we’ll pause for just a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we should wait for a little while now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I agree with Senator. I want everybody to tell him that I tried to wait.
