Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Folks, this is the bill that we see every year,

Representative Jordan, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman's recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Members of the house, in looking at the
conference committee, it looks like the conference committee report
added back the one change that was made in the finance committee, which
was removing a project where one of our universities was purchasing a
racetrack.  And this will be a two day bill, so we'll have debate
tomorrow.  But, in researching that particular project, which I wasn't
particularly thrilled about, I know that, further discussion has been
made with the help of the Forsythe county representatives.  But it
brings up bigger problems in my mind that I want to look at, and maybe
debate tomorrow as well.  But the bill is building $500,000,000 more of
university buildings, and my understanding from fiscal research is right
now, the university system is two billion behind on its repairs and
renovations fund, and so it just doesn't seem quite right to me
something just doesn't sit right that we're building another half
billion in new buildings, and we can keep up with the ones that we've
got.  So, I will be voting no on the second reading of this, and I would
urge you to take a look at the issue for yourself.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lambert, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, this bill has been around here for several weeks
now.  It was vetted in finance committee as you've heard, the section
related to Winston State buying the stadium there from the city of
Winston Salem was taken out.  Last Monday, the site delegation met with
the racetrack management team, Winston State, and the city of Winston
Salem.  This certainly has been a very involved issue in our community,
and is one that we'd like to see accomplished and move forward.  What I
said to the racetrack folks last week was, if you cannot tell us this is
a good move, and you endorse this, we will not do this.  In fact, what
happened last Monday was the race promoters provided an additional eight
points, which we've incorporated into this amendment, or the conference
report, that Winston State in fact agree to.  Items like, not changing
the name of the stadium, so we have all three parties that are endorsing
this addition back in</p>

-was in the Senate version but not in the House version.  I do endorse
it, I do ask for you to approve 480 so we can move forward with this.  I
think the issues that Representative Jordan raises are good issues, but
they’re probably for discussion at another time.  Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stam, please state your purpose.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Would Representative Lambeth yield for a question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes sir.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I have the conference report on my computer here.  What are the
8 additional things that were added that were not there when the finance
committee cut it down?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to, to answer to
Representative Stam’s question, they were items that the race promoters
felt very strongly that need to be added in and agreed to in the
document.  Those items included not changing the name of the stadium.
Obviously that stadium has a long history in our community, it goes back
to 1938 and they have agreed not to change the name.  Not to use any of
the current parking or property that’s designated as part of the
stadium, to be used by Winston state to build dormitories or other
facilities.  In other words to protect the current areas that are
currently designated as part of the stadium.  The race promoters do not
charge for parking, a lot of events do charge for parking.  Winston
state has agreed not to require parking fees except when there’s a
racing event.  So those are the kinds of issues that were unclear and
not part of 	the original negotiations between the city and Winston
Salem State and the race promoters that we were able to incorporate into
the document that I think actually satisfy all parties involved.  Does
that help Representative Stamp? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that
explanation. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Howard, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Speaker, I’ll decline at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Ladies and
gentlemen, I think that everyone in here understands my position on the
universities continuing to grow at the expense of their students.
Raising fees so we can keep building our palaces.  But buying a
racetrack is really disturbing.  If there’s financial problems with the
racetrack and the city wanted to pawn it off, why didn’t they find
private individuals to buy it?  Because that’s what it appears like to
me.  The racetrack isn’t making money so the university can take it over
and do whatever they want to do with it.  And who’s on the hook for
making sure it’s maintained?	The universities.  And who gives the
universities money? We do. student’s tuitions or student fees, I’ve
mentioned this before, I’ve talked about it over the years: we’ve got to
stop driving up student fees so people in universities can keep building
buildings.  They don’t take care of what they have because they know,
sooner or later, we’re going to have to pay for the maintenance on their
buildings.  They know sooner or later when it gets bad enough and we get
enough bad press that we’ll float a bond issue of some sort or we’ll
provide money in another manner to take care of things they neglected
and they did not do.  We’ve got to stop going down this road every year.
 We’ve got to stop supporting something that’s illogical and not good,
not good for the students that attend our universities.  I’m a no vote,
I have been in the past, I will be in the future, and I hope you also
will be. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Conrad, please state your
purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  To speak to the conference report. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  The lady is recognized to debate the motion.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I did want to explain a little bit more about the facility that
Winston Salem State University wants to acquire.  It is used for stunt
car racing, but it’s also a football stadium.  Over the past many years,
they have been renting this facility from the city of Winston Salem to
have their football games.  And it also islocated in very close
proximity to the Winston state, Salem state university, so I did want to
explain that it’s not just a racetrack.  But the history of sock car
racing goes back for decades there and one of my main concerns was to
make sure that every single provision was looked at to insure for the
future of sock car racing. For example, if any modifications-</p>

...made to the stadium or to the field itself that it could in no way
impair the continued function of stock car racing, so I did want to
explain that it's also a football stadium. I do understand the concerns
of representative Cleveland and representative Jordan and I do think
going forward that we do need to carefully look at the expansion of the
university physical facilities, particularly since we do not have the
funds to keep up with renovations, but I do support this current bill
and I do appreciate the interim that we had from the removal and the
finance committee because there were some unresolved concerns that ?? on
speedway that were uncovered and we're happy to have this opportunity to
correct the situation before we included it back in the bill and I urge
you to vote for it, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hurley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Conrad a question, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Conrad, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I certainly do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Conrad, you mentioned that they had been leasing this
from the city of Winston-Salem, how much did they pay on this lease?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe it was approximately for each game about 3,500 dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So certainly less than the seven and plus million dollars to purchase.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was in the finance committee and I understood that they weren't paying
anything to the city of Winston-Salem for the lease.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it's sort of a convoluted system, it's not exactly a check cut
from the university system to the city of Winston-Salem. I believe the
funds and perhaps representative Lambeth can help me, were taken from
the parking, concessions, from money made during the game that covered
the cost of the rental and that's why there wasn't a sort of a paper
trail as such that former representative Fallwell could find from the
university system to the city of Winston-Salem, at least, that is what
I've been told.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I was just concerned about the payment, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hanes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? to activate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. Colleagues, ladies and gentleman, observe.
Chamber and Gallery, this bill is a UNC Capital Improvement Projects
bill. This is very important to the entire UNC system, that we move this
so that they can take care of the needs that these universities have on
their campuses, we've hired and put chancellors and facilities managers
and highly skilled people in place in these universities to make these
types of determinations and we have several schools that have done that.
The Winston-Salem state university has come up and I wanted to speak
just briefly on that. It has been described as a football stadium and as
a race track, but as I said in the finance committee and as I said to
some of you all individually, what this facility and the land around
this facility that is associated with this bill called Civitan Park,
what it is more than anything else is a learning laboratory for the
university. They have a NASCAR motorsports management program that is
the only one of its kind in the country. They utilize this facility and
they're fortunate and blessed to have this facility contiguous to the
campus that their students can get to on a daily basis and utilize as
the NASCAR motorsports program as it continues to grow and expand. The
University of North Caroline and Charlotte has an engineering
motorsports program that is growing by leaps and bounds every single
year and it's a jobs producing program that has students leaving that
program and making up to six figures a year. Those are the types of
programs and academics that we want to see in our universities.
Winston-Salem State University, a university that has come so far and
through so much over the years has been able to link in and tap in to a
rich motorsports history, not only in the state but in the city through
the Bowman Gray racing program. As representative Lambeth and
representative Conrad stated, the Forsyth county delegation has worked
tirelessly with the racing promoters and with the interested parties to
insure that that history is preserved and also to ensure that the future
of this fine academic program at this school is preserved.</p>

The Bowman-Gray Stadium happens to be a tremendous part of that future
and I would urge your support of this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would Representative Hanes yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hanes, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative. I waited till you had
finished with your comments because they're very important on this
issue. I have a couple of questions. The first I'd like to ask is how
many students are involved in this program? It sounds like a good
program. How many students are currently involved?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The program has 11 students involved. It's a newer
program. Eleven students.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Follow up question, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hanes, you mentioned Civitan Park. How
large is that and what is the former use of that property before it was
a park?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Civitan Park is approximately 92 acres. As I
understand it. And it was formerly a landfill that over the years had
been redeveloped, re-purposed, and is now, an environmental study, the
university has been through an environmental study one and two, to
ensure the safety of Civitan Park being used as an athletics field where
you will not be building dormitories and the like. So it's used as an
athletic, the practice field.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Earle, please state your purpose.
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hanes yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hanes, does the gentleman yield? The
gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hanes, as you may recall in Finance
Committee, I spoke in support of the Jordan amendment to remove this
project from Winston-Salem State and I certainly applaud the efforts
that you all in the delegation have made to address what I think were
some real problems, at least how initially it was done. But I would ask
this question. What assurances do you feel that we can have as the
trustees of the State that there's not going to be any future liability
given the fact that there is apparently some contamination on this
property, both in terms of its past use and I guess potentially with
ongoing use, that there wouldn't be liability that the State is going to
have to pick up above and beyond what is envisioned through the fees,
through the university?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I think the way I would answer that
question is that the university has experts and professionals, and has
worked with experts and professionals, to go through the proper
procedures to ensure that the field is safe for its use and that is as
athletic support fields. Furthermore, I don't think there's any question
that there are insurance mechanisms out there in place. That I'm certain
that the university is aware of, that they've investigated, and that
they can take advantage of if it proves to be necessary for them to do
that.
What I think is the most important piece, however, Representative Moore,
is that we should not do anything in this body to prevent any university
from moving forward with a space or facility that clearly is a use to
the school, is there close to the school, and is being used for academic
purposes to promote the expansion and improvement of their academic
programs. I think that's really what the focus ought to be. The
university has gotten the approvals that they need from a safety
standpoint and I think we ought to trust the professionals at the
university, as we are doing with the University of North Carolina and
Appalachian State and some of the other universities.
I think we ought to trust the professionals at Winston-Salem State
University that they've done their due diligence and I think they
absolutely have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I briefly speak on the conference report?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members. I'm really agonizing over what
to do on this vote. And I'll just share with the members why. I was
before ever being in the General Assembly, I was a member of the Board
of Governors at UNC and had an opportunity for us to review projects
like this. And I do want to say that I do think there are significant
improvements in what the Forsythe delegation has done in coming up with
this. I know, for example, Representative Hanes, Representative Conrad,
Representative Lambeth have worked with the city council, worked with
some of the folks at the race track to try to address some concerns.

The practical problem here is – and I'll be honest with the members, I'm
leaning at voting No on the conference report – the practical problem
is, if the conference report is going to go down, I'm not sure if it
goes down today, if that's going to kill the whole thing because of the
number of days on the Bill that these things require. So that's the
problem, that there are a lot of projects that have unanimous support,
but there's this one project that at least has some concerns. So I don't
know which button I'll press in a minute, but I just wanted to express I
do have some concerns about this.

be concerned about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill Brawley, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
SPEAKER CHANGES] I recognize Representative Moore's agony, this is not a
clear right or wrong, this one's real close. The racetrack did cause me
concerns. The thing that leans me more towards it, yes, realistically,
is the brownfields. Winston-Salem State is landlocked. If they're going
to expand, what that means is, they're going to buy neighborhoods nearby
and bulldoze the houses. That's going to be considerably more expensive.
Brownfields have been used by Mecklinburg County Parks for athletic
fields for quite a long time. It is a tough call, it is a close call,
but at some point we have to allow people to make some choices. 7
million for 92 acres of brownfield is expensive. But if we go after 92
acres of homes, relocating people, buying the houses, condemnation,
that's going to be so much worse. They're in a tough situation, they're
trying to make a tough decision. It's not bad enough for me to put the
entire bill in danger, to block this one. If the local delegation wants
it, ??  by preponderance, I'm inclined to vote for it. It's not a great,
tearing thing and I think people can vote against this with clear
conscience. But it's that they've got a bad situation, they're trying to
come up with the best answer they can, I'm intended, I'm kind of
inclined to let them go with what they've got. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McElratt, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. The motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We will be hearing our Environmental Amends Bill, and
on page 31 of House Bill 74, there is a section in there that says that
no public entity will be able to purchase a property with known
contamination unless it is approved by the Governor and Council
(Counsel?) of State. So this will have a little bit of a protection for
them there. It also says that no state General Fund money can be used to
clean up that brownfield. So there is protection, if you vote for House
Bill 74, coming up soon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr Speaker. We just wanted to speak in
support of the conference –
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. You know, we do a lot of things
here that require us to, I think, address the diversity of many of our
campuses. The problems, the issues that they have, differ. We've over
the last couple of days made some decisions to help other universities,
other campuses throughout North Carolina. This one deserves that
consideration as well. I certainly hope that you would look at that. You
know we have to help people where they need the help. This is a good
bill and I hope that you would support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It seems like to me we have, as I hear it, some
heartburn over Bowman Gray Stadium, which is one of the iconic
facilities in a sport that grew up in this state, which is stock car
racing. The one thing I would ask the Body to consider is, we vote on a
lot of bills that have a lot of stuff in them. Heck, we voted on a
budget bill yesterday, we'll vote it again today. I think every, all
hundred and twenty members, can agree there's something in that budget
bill that we don't like 100 percent. This bill is no different. There's
one thing in this bill that I think causes some heartburn. But it's
worthwhile, and it's something we need to get done, and I would
respectfully ask that you all vote in favor of the bill, and not against
it just because of the Bowman Gray issue. The value of the bill
outweighs any concern [RECORDING ENDS]</p>

Representative Terry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I had planned not to say anything about this. I
am--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I debate the motion. And I simply want to say this. That I've heard
the debate and I understand the tenets of all the concerns. And I
recognize why they have been raised. But I simply want to stand here and
say to you today that the Winston-Salem State University partnership
arrangement with Bowman Gray motorsports racing and the city of
Winston-Salem represents a tremendous opportunity for a win-win
situation for us in the Triad Region. And the reality about that is that
it will become, it already has proven itself, to have the potential as
an economic engine, as well as an incubator for academic success and
achievement. In something which the state of North Carolina has touted
itself about with pride, and that's motorsports racing. We aren't there
yet. Someone asked the question regarding how many students are
enrolled. There are 11 students enrolled. But how does anything begin?
It begins small, and it has the potential to grow large, if in fact you
invest in people who have the vision to move forward. North Carolina
needs this kind of vision, particularly to rebound with the economy that
we have that continues to sag. I would ask this body to please search
your souls and determine whether or not you are willing to invest in an
opportunity for the Triad Region to be able to bloom and blossom and
help restart the economy that is so wanting in the state of North
Carolina. I urge you to support this measure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lambeth, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a second time--the motion
a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are two pieces I'd like to add to this debate and discussion. One
is that this property has been on the master plan for the Winston State
campus for some time. It has been approved and vetted by the UNC Board
of Governors. The second piece of it is that the city of Winston-Salem
has agreed, in the agreements to sell the property, that they will
protect Winston-Salem State and the state with the brownfields. So there
will be no liability. It will be shifted over to the state. That's an
unknown liability because the city of Winston-Salem, through their
agreements with Winston-Salem State and the sale would take on that
responsibility. And that is part of this transaction as well.

Taxpayers Failure To File A Return. [SPEAKER CHANGES] General Assembly
of North Carolina enacts.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill Brawley
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'm running this bill for
Senator Rucho. This addresses failure to file penalties and not failure
to pay. Because of the way laws relate to taxes it addresses both income
tax and sales tax. It is primarily to solve a problem with sales tax.
This is where someone does not file a return and then later files a
return late. If a small taxpayer files a return late and is due a refund
they will not be penalized. But people who owe taxes on individual
returns will be penalized a fee of $100. This deviates from what the
Federal Government does and does cause a concern for the accounting
profession. For corporations the failure to file penalties are actually
in keeping with what the Federal Government is on failure to pay. Five
percent of the amount of the tax for each month up to a maximum of $25.
This is done less to get at businesses that are failing to file their
returns after having paid their taxes, but to address an issue with
sales tax receipts. Companies are collecting sales tax, are sending it
to the Department of Revenue, but are not filing the paperwork with it,
so the state cannot allocate the state revenue and the local portions to
cities and counties and it's in limbo. The intent here is to encourage
people to go ahead and file the paperwork along with paying the tax so
the money can be allocated and I'd ask your support for the bill.

Representative Brawley we worked on this in finance yesterday and I'm
just wondering if there's still a technical problem that I just noticed.
Would look at line 17? And I understand the purpose of the bill.
Individual income taxes paid by a partnership or an S-corporation. I
thought partnerships and S-corporations were flow throughs and I didn't
know that they paid any individual income taxes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
thank you for the question. That would be the income taxes paid on
income from a sub-S or a partnership return. Because that would have
been filed that information would be.</p>

available that would also tend to be very large taxpayers.  These are
the instances where businesses are taxed as individuals so this is not a
typical W2 income where you’ve had income withheld but rather this is
where you are a manufacturing company, say a large real estate firm and
you’re a partnership in LLC or Sub S corporation and have chosen to be
taxed as an individual rather than a corporation so this is going to be
a business entity not somebody working for wages. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A
follow up question [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Gentleman yields [SPEAKER

exclusion for income tax paid by S corporation but again the partnership
or the S corporation doesn’t pay the tax and so what about an individual
who mostly gets wages but maybe gets a little bit from a LLC or a S
corporation do they fall under A or B?  I don’t know the answer.

And you got to remember that Wake County school system 10% of all
students in North Carolina that are in the public schools are in Wake
County. 10% of every school child is in Wake County. So the implications
of that can be broad if you're worried about that. Now if you are more
supportive of this type policy, if you vote to concur, you can not get
your county added. It is just solely for Wake County. If this type
program is truly is going to be a model that we might look at in the
future, we have a massive urban system that we're looking at trying it.
Why don't we put a small rule system to see if it would work for them
too? By voting to concur for this you can not do that because it will
not go to conference. We can not have our hand in this at all as a
House. So I want you to think about those factors when you place this
vote. And I would urge you to not concur so we can truly look at this
issue like it needs to be looked at, possibly do an experimental model.
If you have vested interest from another county to where you might have
that option in the future. But if you vote to concur, you will not get
that. So I urge that you vote no on Representative Stam's motion.
Speaker Changes: Mr. Speaker?
Speaker Changes: For what purpose do the gentleman from Catawba,
Representative Setzer rise?
Speaker Changes: As a chair on the Finance Committee, do we have a
fiscal note on this bill? If we don't, I'd like to request one.
Speaker Changes: House biddees we need to determine if one is going to
be necessary.

Members, it's the opinion of the Chair that there was, seems clear to
the Chair there's no impact on the state budget, therefore, a fiscal
note would not be required. For what purpose the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Malone rise?
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr., Mr. Speaker.
Speaker Changes: Does the gentleman wish to debate the bill?
Speaker Changes: I do want to debate the bill.
Speaker Changes: The gentleman is recognized.
Speaker Changes: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to speak to you from a
position of being in the facility's chair at the Wake County school
system. I know how everything works over there so I'm going to give you
a quick little run down on things. There are three basic overviews of
why you should vote for this. First is structural. Second is fiscal and
third is political. Under structural, we all know the counties have a
taxing authority. They're the ones that put the bonds on the referendum,
agree to how much the bond is going to be, and then schedule it out.
Number 3, Wake County, because we are talking about Wake County and only
Wake County. They have a great real estate department, unlike some of
the things I've heard from some school board members. They're not going
to build and outhouse for somebody. It's going to be a great facility.
I've seen great facilities all across the state, built for a whole lot
less. And we can certainly do that here, which by the way we don't
really want to or at least, they don't want to. Now, they also hold all
the liabilities. Speaker Stem spoke to this. They should have the
assets. It would only make sense. We don't give the school board, the
school system's taxing authority and we know why we don't want to do
that. And that's why the counties should have the assets. Number 2,
fiscal. Going back to being on the school board and being on the
facility's Chair. I've seen schools built for a lot more than they need
to be built. I worked to lower the price, often times working with
Democrats to find a way to get the prices lower. We went from building a
$75 million dollar school to building a $62 million dollar school. Some
of the things that I did and others did was to bring people in to
discuss various different architectural techniques that we could utilize
to do that. Things were environmental, like Geo Thermals, Lead Friendly
schools, and whatnot. Oftentimes when doing this, I'd find that my
efforts were being blown up or whatever, but...</p>

-staff and that kind of resistance does not bode well for the taxpayer.
We got a bond coming up, 800 million dollar bond.  If they want that to
pass, they need the people of Wake County to be supportive of it.  And
they won’t be unless they see some kind of action on us and this is one
way to bring back trust in the county.  That’s the fiscal.  Number
three, the political: it’s been used for all kinds of various different
reasons, where we put schools and things like that.  I’m not going to
get into it, but I don’t want to see the day when we’re going back to
hour and a half long bus rides, sending the kids from one school to
another, while certain areas of the county are protected, insulated, and
resource friendly and others are not. The other side talks about these
kinds of things, they talk about equity and resource friendly activity.
And I don’t see a lot of that often times on the school system, in the
school board.  So for all those three reasons, I’m asking you to vote
for this.  It’s a good thing, it’s the appropriate thing, and I commend
the bill and ask for you to vote for it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the lady from Wake, Representative Holley rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor
to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a heavy heart, because this
is the bill that, when it came up in committee all of the sudden you
know uh it, it appeared it’d been hijacked and it appeared with Wake
County and a number of counties on it, it was a statewide bill.  Wake
County was voted off in committee, the bill was dead.  But somehow I’m
learning here, the General Assembly, that nothing’s dead because you can
bring it to life on a whim, if you want to bring it to life.  The
process hasn’t been fair and when we look in to the, into it, Wake
County public schools has built more schools, has been the most rapidly
growing school system in the county, no in the state. They built more
schools, they know how to build more schools.  I’ve heard things about
businessmen on the board.  What businessmen do you know has built a
school?  Wake County has staffing in place.  The school board has
staffing in place that does this and this is what they do.  This belongs
to the school board.  Remember, as he said, 10% is Wake County.  It is
very easy to add another county.  It’s very easy for it to change. So
those of you who think, well this is only Wake County now it doesn’t
affect me, it affects us all  As Wake County goes, so does the rest of
the state go.  Maybe not this week, but believe me, it will go this way.
 I vote against this bill and I ask you not to support it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Wake, Representative Gill
rise?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the motion.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
lady has the floor to debate the motion.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
very much.  You know, I’m going to speak as someone who spent a little
over ten years on the Wake County school board.  First as someone who
stayed on the school board maybe a year or someone who’s never served on
the school board.  The first thing I want to talk about is the bond
rating.  Certainly, Wake County has a AAA bond rating.  You know when
this issue first came up and I was on the board, the first thing we did
as board members, we call in all 3 of the bonding agencies and we asked
them, if we continue the practice that we currently are doing, will this
affect the AAA rating and they said no, not in one, not one bit.  Then
we decided that maybe we ought to look at it, because I hear about
having revenues and assets and liabilities on the same books. So we
called in the local government commissioner to talk to us about whether
our process was correct and if they had a problem with it and we have
documentation in the school building that told us there was nothing
wrong with the process and they approved it.  So let’s get all of that
straight, we went through that to begin with.  So I wanted to make sure
that you all understand, the school board is not just a group of
individuals who do think-</p>

[Speaker Change]
Haphazardly. We do have a conscious. We do understand. And we think
about how this is going to impact, not only the students, but the
individuals who voted for us as school board members. Now let me talk
more about the siting and the construction of a building. You know the
school must maintain the educational process for our children. Providing
a high quality education for our children is the school boards primary
responsibility. School buildings are about education. There is a direct
link between student achievement or behavior and the physical building
condition. You know student spend more than sixteen thousand hours in a
building over their career. Teachers and principals spend even more time
in the buildings. They deserve the necessary space that will encourage
growth, creativity, and intellect. The school building is essential to
the education process. You know, during the time that our state decided
to provide a free education it's children, the general assembly had the
foresight at that time, to give the school board the authority to build
schools and the county commissioner the authority to tax. Many of them
understood that the owner of the property needs the latitude to carry
out it's responsibilities. They knew that if, if they gave the
responsibility to the commissioners, they would want to have a say so in
the educational process. They would want, you know as a owner of
property. You know this. You would want to know something about the size
and the type of building that is going to be built on your property.
Right? Well do you know how that would interfere with the educational
process? The school system is responsible for the design of the program,
the curriculum, and what the building looks like. So can you imagine the
school system, or the school board trying to tell the county
commissioners about the program, the curriculum, and the design? And
they understand that fully? No they would being looking at how can we
cheaply do this and maybe it does not deserve the scrutiny the school
board is giving it. The next question you would ask is, where will the
building be located? You know, that's a student assignment problem. And
it deals with student capacity. You know, sometime, and I heard one of
the former board members of Wake County say, you know, we build schools
where, out in remote locations...
[Speaker Change]
Excuse me Speaker?
[Speaker Change]
We build schools at all these other places.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Speaker? I can't hear this Bill...
[Speaker Change]
Does the lady, the lady from Chathum Representative McManus, is the lady
asking for a decorum? The Chair was about to do that.
[Speaker Change]
Yes sir.
[Speaker Change]
Would ask members, I know that there's a lot of folks who may not be
particularly interested in this Bill but would ask those members to
please take conversations outside and give the Speaker the respect she
deserves? Thank you. The lady from Wake continues to have the floor.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you. And when you, and when you talk about attendance and who will
occupy the building, again, that deals with student assignment and
student capacity. Managing the construction of school gives the board of
education the best opportunity to respond to our school system and to
provide a high quality educational environment for our students. They're
closest to the classroom and in the best, the best position to
understand the complex requirements.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask a question.
[Speaker Change]
For what purpose does the gentlemen from Wake, Representative Malone
rise?
[Speaker Change]
To ask a question.
[Speaker Change]
Does the lady from, does the lady from Wake yield for a question from
the gentlemen from Wake?
[Speaker Change]
No I will not yield.
[Speaker Change]
She does not yield.
[Speaker Change]
Until I finish my...
[Speaker Change]
The lady from Wake continues to have the floor to debate the motion.
[Speaker Change]
The school board is closest to the classroom and are in the best
position to understand the complex requirements for a successful school
system. The school board is accountable to the parents and voters. You
know, the sponsor of this Bill claim his motivation is it doesn't pay
tax. The sponsors Bill claim that the county commissioners have business
experts. You know, there's no constitutional requirement that a person
who runs for school board or county commissioner have business...</p>

Experience. You know, most of our school policy designs our guidelines
for construction to ensure an effective learning environment. I doubt
that the county commissioners have highly qualified or, or I doubt any
of our county commissioners are highly qualified and are expert
professionals who know the nuts and bolts of building schools, and of
construction. There are many important issues facing our school and
community. We have and we will continue to work together to create the
best school system in the nation. If you truly believe that this is not
in the best interest, if you truly believe that this is in the best
interest of our school and community, then why did this bill change from
a state-wide bill just to include Wake County? For those counties that
were in the bill, and those who want to be in the bill, remember the old
saying, as Wake County goes, so does the other 130, 113 LAs. All it
takes is for the General Assembly to remove section 14 and 15, and it
becomes a state-wide bill. You can stop this from happening today. This
is just pure politics, a blatant power grab by the Wake County
Republican legislative delegation and county commissioners, and it’s a
bad policy. Please vote with me. Vote red, not to concur. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Dollar, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the conference
report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The conference report, thank you Mr. Speaker,
members of the House. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me, the motion to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion to concur, thank you. I would appreciate
your concurrence in this Senate Committee Substitute to House Bill 726.
This is a local bill. It was Wake County. It’s just Wake County, it’s
not a pilot, it’s not trying to be a pilot or not trying to be a pilot,
it’s Wake County. This is something that we’ve talked about for years.
We have an extremely capable construction acquisition and land
acquisition and the like. Departments within Wake County government,
this will save us save us money at the local level. The school board can
focus on education issues in the classroom, which is what they need to
be focused on. And the county which funds the construction can focus on
the construction, and focus on the physical plan which is a much more
logical division of labor anyway. This will work very well for us, the
county is the one with the AAA bond rating anyway. School board doesn’t
have that. They can’t have that. It’s a local bill. Now I would say one
thing to my friend, Representative Elmore. I think he was a little bit
concerned about his name being on the bill. But he may not be aware, or
others may not be aware, you can remove your name from a bill as the
proud sponsor at any time. All you have to do is do that in writing.
This is not necessarily unusual. I had it actually happen to me several
years ago. I sent a bill over, I can’t even remember what it was. And it
came back as like a supplemental appropriations bill. So it was a
Democrat appropriations bill, right? So I was puzzling with myself, you
know, could I take my name off? Leave it on? But since it did pass, and
got enacted into law, I thought I’d just take credit for it, let it go.
It worked out fine. No repercussions from it. No consequences from that.
So I’d just simply say, you’ve heard the different arguments but this is
a local bill. We want it here in Wake County, and would very much
appreciate your support. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose
does the gentleman from Wake County, Representative Martin rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
from Wake has the floor to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you very much, Mr. Speaker. We learn something new every day. I

having to campaign where a bill with my name on it that I had no idea
what was in it would be used against me. So I tell you, if you ever</p>

<p id="075:00">
On statewide and you come to Wake County, I’ll write you a note saying
you had nothing to do with this bill. I’ve heard from two of my former
school board members with different opinions on this and I’ve heard some
good points from both sides of the issue. I never served on the school
board. I barely made it out of the public school system so I’m not
qualified to talk too much to talk about that at all. But I do go to
both of them for advice on these issues. I do know though a little bit
about politics. And I also know a little bit about being a parent and in
the end what we have here is two children, our county commission and our
school board. I only have one child myself but I had a sister growing up
and we fought like cats and dogs. There were times when we had been at
it for years and years and years, and just were not going to resolve the
issue, and it was time for my parents to step in and separate my sister
and I. But there were other times where my parents very wisely saw that
my sister and I needed to work together to continue to try to resolve
the disputes, that that was part of being an adult and what we learned
to do. I submit to you ladies and gentleman that right now that’s the
situation in Wake County. There are folks behaving like children from
both parties on our county commission, there are folks behaving like
children from both parties on our school board. But they’re good people
on both sides. They’re very smart people and they’re very
well-intentioned people, in both bodies and from both parties. I have
confidence in all of them, that they will be able to resolve this, to do
the job they were elected by my people in Wake County to do. I’d ask the
people of this body to continue to give those folks a little more time
to grow up, and vote no on this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does
the lady from Wake, Representative Avilla arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate
the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen, I will ask you to vote for this motion for one reason and one
reason only. If you will notice, it’s to elect by resolution to do this,
and that resolution requires a public hearing. And if you don’t think
the school board and the county commission in Wake County understand
what they’re putting themselves out for when they ask for a public
hearing, you have not been reading the paper lately. The citizens of the
county will have the opportunity to let these children on both sides
know where they stand. And how they would like their money spent, how
they would like their schools built where their children are going.
Please vote to, in favor of the motion. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentleman from Stanley, Representative Burr rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman may state his motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. First let me say I think there’s been an opportunity to hear
from both sides on this. To hear from a majority of the Wake County
delegation. At this time I would move to previous question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The member from Stanley has moved to previous question. The
question before the House is the motion and the gentleman from Stanley
to the previous question, as to Senate Committee Substitute for House
Bill 26. So many as favor the motion for the previous question will vote
aye. Those opposed will vote no. Give members a few minutes to get in.
Again for those coming in, this is a vote on the previous question. So
many as favor the motion will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. [PAUSE] The clerk will lock the machine and
record the vote. 63 having voted in the affirmative and 48 in the
negative, the previous question is adopted. Pursuant to the local rules,
the minority leader and the majority leader are both given three minutes
for a statement. The gentleman from Durham, Representative Hall is
recognized for that purpose unless the gentleman has someone else he
would like to designate or unless he wants to waive. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Rather than waive, I would designate
Representative Darren Jackson from Wake County to use the three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jackson has the floor for the three
minutes for the minority party. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Leader. I appreciate the opportunity since other
members didn’t feel that was necessary. Process in this bill sucks. We
stood here a couple weeks ago, I think maybe last Thursday, we were
going to vote this bill down, and Representative Moore stood there and
said let’s not do this to the senior appropriations chair from the
Senate. Let’s just show him the courtesy. Let’s just send it back to
Rules. And guess what. Here it is again.</p>

There's only one board in Wake county that has the experience in
building schools and that's the School Board. You're going to give ten
percent, a billion dollars, and you're going to give it over to an
entity that has no experience building schools. But they do have
experience building court houses, and I'm in that courthouse. And if you
haven't had the chance I'd encourage you to go down to that courthouse.
Republican judge called it a few weeks ago, he called it the Taj Mahal
of courthouses. It's got marble engraved in it. It's got wooden paneled
courtrooms like we're all familiar from the Federal courthouse. It's got
fifty flat screen TV's in it. Anyone want to guess how many flat screen
TV's my son's school has? Anybody? ?? If this is a bad idea to give a
billion dollars, to give ten percent over to the Wake County County
Commissioners that have no experience, if you want to try this, try it
on a small scale but you shouldn't get involved in this local matter.
I'd ask you to vote against it.

I've ever heard Edgar Starnes make.The question before the House is the
motion to concur to the Senate Committee substitute for House bill 726.
?? favor the motion will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The Clerk

Thank yo, Mr. Speaker. With further consideration I have decided that my
objection to 321 was not sufficient throughout the whole bill so I'd
like to change my vote to yes.

believe the parties are ready on Senate bill 317 is that correct,

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This amendment is purely technical. If you look
at your dashboard it corrects a typo on page four, line one and on page
four line twenty five it moves the effective date for the filing period
to before the primary elections in 2014 and thus related to the
provisions regarding Stanley County. It's purely technical, staff caught
these mistakes and I would appreciate your support.

<p id="085:00">
committee substitute before ?? substantially different from the Senate
bill that first came over.  As you'll see, this relates to redistricting
the Guilford County board of education.  Also, it deals with election
changes in Stanley County, and, for that, I would recommend
Representative Justin Burr to yield for questions, but I will speak to
the provisions related to Guilford county.  You may recall that, two
years ago, we redistricted the Guilford County board of commissioners,
and, prior to that, the districts of the Guilford County board of
commissioners and the districts for the Guilford County board of
education matched each other.  They were aligned, there were eleven
members, and each body with nine districts and two at large, and it made
government more efficient for the two bodies to match.  It made it
easier for the representatives on the board of commissioners and the
representatives on the board of education to communicate with each
other.  It also made it easier for the citizens to communicate with
their elected officials at the county level, and so the original version
of this bill kept the board of education of Guilford County at eleven,
and there were redistricting changes.  However, what we did here in the
House is we simply aligned the board of education districts with the
board of commissioner districts, and there are some very slight changes
in the district maps in order to keep certain members from being
double-bunked, and so that is one change that you'll see in the PCS.
The second is that the Senate version would reduce the board of
education terms from four years to two years.  We would keep them at
four years and stagger them to match the commissioner districts.  The
third provision is related to partisan elections.  The Senate version
would have converted the board of education directly to partisan; this
would put it to referendum, and I'd appreciate your support and be glad
to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Guilford, Representative Harrison,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House.
Representative Faircloth and Hardister deserve a lot of credit for
making a very bad Senate bill much less bad, but it's still bad.  I
don't want to repeat all the arguments that were made when we discussed
the conversion of the Wake County school board and Lee County school
board about the unnecessarily meddling of this body and to matters best
left to local government, because Representative Hardister mentioned two
years ago we redistricted the Guilford County commission board for
partisan advantage.  We are in a very blue county, and now it's a GOP
controlled county commissioner, so now we're going to redistrict our
school board so that it will probably similarly be composed in that
partisan fashion, and I have heard only from citizens who are opposed to
this.  The school board is opposed to it, just as they were in the Wake
and Lee County debates.  I think the meddling in these local affairs
that are best left to local governments, particularly for partisan
advantage, is shameful, and beneath the dignity of this chamber, and I
urge you to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Guilford, Representative Adams,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I'd like to ask the gentleman some questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which member are you asking to yield-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hardister.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hardister, does the gentleman yield to the lady from
Guilford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, representative.  Let me ask you, and I know you've done some
work on this bill, and we had some discussion about conversations that
were supposed to have occurred with the school board.  First of all, who
asked for the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are citizens of Guilford County who have asked for this, who have
asked for the school board to be lined up again to match the board of
commissioners.  It's something I think we need to do.  I believe it
would make government more efficient for those two bodies to match.  As
I've said before, I think it would make it easier for citizens to
communicate with their elected officials that way.  If you're a citizen
in Guilford County, the person who represents you on the school board
and the person who represents you in the board of education cover the
same area, so I think it's easier for communications, but, again to your
question, there are citizens who have brought this to my attention, and
I think it's the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Have you had discussions with the school board about the requests that
citizens made to you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am.</p>

The Guilford County School Board stands opposed to this bill, however
It’s important to know that the school board as you know, Representative
you were on the elections committee and you may recall that a
representative from the school board was there and said they maintained
their opposition to this bill, however they much preferred the House
version. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
gentleman yield to an additional question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You said I was the one
where? [SPEAKER CHANGES] In the elections committee, the House
elections. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh okay, I’m sorry I didn’t understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One last question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady has the floor to ask one final question if the
gentleman yields. He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, you said
that making these adjustments makes the process more efficient. How
exactly will it make it more efficient? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma’am.
Again, if the boards match each other, the districts and again this
would reduce the board of education from 11 members to 9, with 1 at
large, in 8 districts. And they would be aligned to match the
commissioner districts. Say you’re a County Commissioner. And say you
represent District 7 for example. There would be a corresponding
District 7 on the board of education that covers the same area. That way
the same constituents and the same schools are in the same area, the
area that you represent as a Count Commissioner. And then the
corresponding member of the board of education would cover the same
area. So I think it would make it easier for the elected officials to
communicate, and it would make it easier for the citizens to communicate
with their elected officials. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady from Guilford has the
floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, I had the privilege of serving on the school
board. The Guilford County School Board was then the Greensville City
School Board. I served on the Greensville City Council. I’m serving here
in this body. Never have my districts matched to that degree and
citizens have not had a problem with it. I just really don’t think that
that’s an issue that we need to be concerned about. I mean if you look
at your voter registration card, you’re in one district for school
board, one district for county commissioners, one district for the
legislature, etc. Citizens don’t understand that anyway. They simply
want to know who represents them and when they have concerns about the
particular issues, they contact those members. Just as they have
contacted me about this bill, I have had no one to call in support of
it, and I think it’s very disrespectful for us in this body to be
meddling in Guilford County business again, trying to change the school
board elections. And then to make them partisan. All you have to do is
be in this body to know the kinds of problems and issues that can come
up when we get too partisan about things. And we should not be getting
partisan as it relates to our children. Our school board is working fine
with the numbers of members that they have, and the fact that the school
board is non-partisan. It should remain that way. I’ve had a
conversation with members of the school board who say that they’ve not
had a lot of discussions about this. As a matter of fact, when you look
at all these numbers in this bill, it’s hard to really know what these
district lines mean. It’s going to be even more difficult for citizens,
even on a ballot, to determine what the impact is going to be. Because I
expect that the vote’s going to only be do you want to have partisan
elections and it’ll be a yes or a no, so they really won’t understand
that. But I just really believe that we are stepping in waters that we
don’t need to be treading in. Guilford County is working fine. The
school board has opposed this bill. And they sent every member of our
delegation and other members of this body a letter to that effect as
well. It is not a good bill. It is not needed. There’s not a problem in
Guilford County as it relates to our school board. The school board was
not consulted. They didn’t request it, and we should not pass this bill.
It is not a good bill for Guilford. Guilford County does not want it,
and I would</p>

Please, I would ask you to please consider that the local citizens of

here to file a bill to do that. That is absolutely annoying to me. It is
unfair, it is unnecessary, we should not support this bill. Vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford,
Representative Faircloth, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill, Mr Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen of the house, I know it's
difficult for you to realize this, given the discussion, but politics is
alive in Guilford County. This bill comes over from the Senate,. Those
of us on this side of the building decided that we would like to take a
closer look at it and talk to folks back home and see if it could be
perfected a little bit. As you've heard from Representative Hardister,
we chose to do that. We made our Democratic friends from the delegation
aware of what our ideas were. Obviously there's disagreement, and that's
fine, that's the way the system is supposed to work. We believe that,
and we had many requests from Guilford County, from folks who felt like
there should be some changes in the way that the school board was
structured. And that can be well understood, that if you go and ask the
school board -- who's going to be affected by this – they probably
wouldn't be in favor of it. And they are not in favor of it. They let us
know that. However, they did tell us they favored what we did here in
the House. If there has to be another choice, they favored our choice.
Now I would point out that one thing that I personally insisted upon,
and my colleagues here on this side agreed with me, is that this should
be a referendum to decide on the partisan question, so that – because
the Senate wanted it to be simply made partisan. I did insist on that,
that's a part of this particular bill as it exists now – this amendment
– and there is a choice to be made by the citizens in Guilford County
and the ones we heard from asked us to come down here and make this
change. I'm sure the folks on the other side of the aisle heard the same
thing. I would ask you to vote for the bill, we think it's good for
Guilford County. We hate that we have to bother you with it, but that's
the way the system works. I ask for your approval, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford,
Representative Brandon, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a very interesting dichotomy that we have
here, that we are talking about a bill, and everybody's talking about
the people. And we did it half right, but we didn't do it completely
right – and that's the reason why you should vote no on this bill. Now
on one hand, we talk about how important it is that we have a
referendum. And we should have a referendum, people should speak about
how they do their elections. And I applaud my colleagues on the other
side for making a referendum for a part of the bill. But there is not a
referendum where the law clearly states, and it clearly instructs us, if
you're going to change lines, if you're going to do redistricting, you
should at least hear from the people. At least. Nobody's even heard
about it. We didn't do a public forum about it, nobody knows. So all
this talk about “I talked to the people,” nobody's talked to anybody.
Nobody's talked to anybody. The people have not had a chance to decide
whether they want a referendum on this particular issue in terms of
whether the lines should go from, whether the people should go from nine
to 12, what the lines should look like. We have not had one bit of
discussion about that with any constituent, not with one citizen, not
with one public forum, nothing. That is the fact. And that is not the
way that we should ever do business. I have always made a pledge, and
said that I would support anything that has a referendum. And I get
yelled at on both sides, but as long as the people can vote, then I'm
okay with that because the people can make up their minds. But they have
brought a bill for here today, although it be better it's still bad
because we're still talking to us. We're not the people. Oh, did you
talk to the county commissioners, did you talk to the school board
members – that's not the people. The people are the people. [RECORDING

I get annoyed when I hear all of these talks about who we talk to and
who did we talk to, and they’re all just elected officials, and we go
behind the room and we make back-room Bills over something that clearly
should go before the people.
Any time that you’re going to change the elections, the maps, the
redistricting, that should go before the people at the least, at the
very least through some type of public forum where they would have
input.
As far as I can tell, all we did was the Republicans in the county went
into the backroom and decided, “How can we make this horrible Bill a
less horrible Bill?” But not one constituent was consulted and that
insults me and that insults this body. So, please vote, “No.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative
Hardister rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please see if my good friend Representative Brandon would yield to a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon, does the gentleman yield? He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, you’re certainly not asserting that I did not
communicate with any citizens on this, are you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am asserting…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am asserting that not in any public official way. That you did not.
Just because someone calls you on your telephone, does not make that a
reference of going to the people. When you talk to the people you do
that in a public forum where people are invited and they know exactly
what they’re coming to talk about, and I would assert that that did not
happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative, you do know that we debated this in the House
Elections Committee and the public was certainly welcome to attend that
meeting?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The unfortunate part of that is that I was not aware of that so I know
that my constituents weren’t and so the whole thing is that if you are
doing this in Guilford County, there’s no reason for you to have a
public hearing in Raleigh.
This is the reason why we have these things in Greensboro, so, if
Senator Wade, yourself and the rest of the Republican delegation really
was serious about having a public discussion all of you had the
opportunity to have a public forum in the town where it was held at and
make it convenient where people to be able to know what was going on.
I would venture to say that 90 percent of the public won’t know about
this until tomorrow when the paper prints it and that’s when they’ll
figure it out and that’s when you’ll get a different call than you had
the other day when somebody called from your district.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair notices that apparently today is Wake County-Guilford County
day. For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative
Blust rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I just want to take a
little heat off of my colleague Representative Hardister who’s worked
this Bill. But we did, and Representative Faircloth was there.
Representative Faircloth, Representative Hardister and I had a meeting
with several citizens way back in February about this matter. We thought
we had a process going.
I don’t want to be critical but there was a Bill filed on the Senate
side that we really weren’t aware was coming so this has been somewhat
of a reaction to that. We have made changes to that Bill, we think for
the better…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose Representative Brandon, does the gentleman from
Guilford rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask my good friend from Guilford a question, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust does the gentleman yield to the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He  yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, did you have a public forum about this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me finish answering. I would say that you’ve met with citizens
several times in your district that did not amount to a public forum. I
yield for follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wish to ask an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My only additional question is this. Did anybody…?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me. The gentleman yields. He yields. The gentleman may now state
his question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you know of any public forums? It’s not incumbent upon me. I didn’t
write the Bill, or bring it up, or support it. So, my question to you,
“Does anybody that supported the Bill, did anybody have a public forum
about it?”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. I think the people who were at the meeting were a little bit
predisposed against that because there’s still, 20-something years
later, some built-up resentment about how the current setup was foisted
upon Guilford County without input back then and we’re still reacting to
this 11-member school district that without public input then was
arranged along with a merger of three different school districts.
So those wounds do take a long time to heal. But regardless of that, who
did what to who, when, this is simply bringing the current school board
in line with the commissioners. It preserves the four-year terms and
leaves the question of whether they should be partisan to the public…</p>

Stanley county portion just to explain that before the vote this is a,
this portion of the legislation contained in the senate bill has
previously passed the house in a, it was similar to this it passed
unanimously I have a feeling that that won't be the case today this is
simply changing the makeup of the Stanley county school board and
Stanley commission it is slightly different than what was passed
originally because we've continued to take input from the community
since we've gone along and have it now to where we feel very good about
it so we certainly ask for member support if possible, thank you.

Future is somewhat obscure but very important. And the bill's actually
better than we thought it was.
[Speaker Change]
This is from Cindy Averett and also confirmed by Ryan Mento of the
Treasures office. The way section A works, is any individual tax payer
is covered by section A even if they have income from a partnership or a
subchapter as corporation. The income tax paid by partnership or
subchapter S corporation is from something called a composite return,
where a escort or a partnership will file a tax return on behalf of
shareholders that live outside of North Carolina and have no other North
Carolina income. And that business entity will file on behalf of those
shareholders. If those shareholders have other North Carolina income
they are required to file an individual return in North Carolina and
they will come under section A. So we have a situation where section B
only applies to organized business entities such as partnerships, and
corporation. And so it also means that no individual tax payer is gonna
be hit with a failure to file penalty of greater than $100. And I would
ask for your support for the bill.
[Speaker Change]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Luebke
rise?
[Speaker Change]
To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Let me just say that, that I agree with the
comments of Representative Brawley on the bill, I do wanna draw
attention to the fact that the $100 fee could be on someone who owed as
little as $5.00, in that sense the bill is, is a bit harsh, and for the
small taxpayer. Now I will say that Representative Stam ran an amendment
in committee that at least improved it in this respect. The way the bill
is originally written if you had a $25.00 refund you were still charge
the $100.00 fee, thereby owing $75.00, even though you had a refund
coming. We fixed that by saying that, that would not happen if you had
the refund, you would not have to pay the $100.00. So while there are
elements of I think the $100.00 fee can be really punitive for a small
taxpayer. I do think the bill is OK and will support it. Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Ashe, Representative Jordan
rise?
[Speaker Change]
Inquiry to the bill sponsor.
[Speaker Change]
Does the gentleman from Mecklenburg yield?
[Speaker Change]
I yield.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman from Ashe, he yields.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Representative Brawley and looking at section B, which is a
penalty that is assessed based on quote the amount of the tax. And the
definition at the end of B saying the amount of the tax means the tax
imposed before credits and tax payments. Is my understanding correct
that a company that may have paid in more tax then is due will still
have a penalty if they have failed to actually file a report, even
though they may have sent in to much money?
[Speaker Change]
If they have failed to file a report and have failed to request and
extension, yes.
[Speaker Change]
Further discussion, further debate? If not the question before the House
is the passage of Senate bill 523 on its second reading. This committee
has favored the passage of the bill will vote aye, those opposed will
vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine
and record the vote. 111 having voted in the affirmative, and 5 in the
negative. House committee substitute for Senate bill 523 passes on its
second reading and will without objection, strike that. The bill as a
role call bill will remain on the count. For what purpose does the
gentleman from Guilford Representative Brandon rise? Does the gentleman
wish to be recorded as having voted aye?
[Speaker Change]
Aye.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman will be recorded as voting aye. Brandon, yes sir. Senate
bill 236 the clerk will read.

[Speaker Changes] House committee substitute for senate bill 236, a bill
to be entitled an act to allow sperry court judge of the state to
perform marriage ceremonies. General Assembly of North Carolina enact.
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
Representative Michaux rise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Ladies and gentleman, we have another sperry court
judge who wants to perform a ceremony of orality. Former member Toby
Fitch’s, who is now a sperry court judge, niece has asked him to
officiate at her marriage, and this bill gives him the authority to do
that. Just that simple. We have done it for other folks before, so just
be gracious, particularly to a sperry court judge.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To ask Representative Michaux a question.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Michaux, does the gentleman yield?
[Speaker Changes] Yes ma’am, Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Changes] More than just your judge, doesn’t this give every
judge in the state the authority to do it?
[Speaker Changes] You know, I don’t know. It does?
[Speaker Changes] It does.
[Speaker Changes] You think it does? Well thats good, because if it
does, we don’t have to do it anymore.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman has recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you. In a sense this is an inconsequential bill.
I wish well for the happy couple. But ever since I got in the assembly
back in 2003, I voted against these and explained why. I’m not gonna
give you the fifteen minute speech I did in 2003, where I went back to a
case from 1788 to explain why its a violation of separation of powers.
But I will say that we haven’t had these for the last few years. They’re
embarrassing. Why we do this special thing, it debases the office of
sperry court judge. Why is a magistrate not okay for this happy couple,
if they don’t want a minister. Its just, the precedence of this is, if
you want a Class A wedding, you’re going to get a special bill for a
supreme court justice to do your wedding. Class B wedding is a court of
appeals judge, and we’re gonna have, its crazy. And the judges aren’t
gonna like it, because when you start doing district court judges, what
are they gonna have to do all weekend? They’re going to have to go to
wedding rehearsals on Friday night and spend Saturday at the wedding. I
mean, the judges don’t want this.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To speak a second time.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman has recognized to debate the bill a
second time.
[Speaker Changes] I really need to answer Representative Steven’s
question. It’s only for two days, Representative Stevens. The act
becomes effective November 1, so its sitting judge, and magistrates can
do it, but this is just a situation folks, and we do things for people
every day. And while nobody wants it permanently, this is just a two day
situation. And I would suggest that you give him the opportunity to
officiate at the ceremony of his niece.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Starnes please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman has recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentleman of the
house, there was never a finer man that I ever served with than Toby
Fitch, and if I can do him this one small favor, then I would be glad to
do it, and I would encourage everybody to extend him this courtesy.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To briefly debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman has recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, members, Mr. Speaker, this is something
that we do a lot. And of course, Representative Stam always speaks
against it and always votes against it, and I think maybe even quoted
the Magna Carta about it one time, I’m not sure. This is not a big deal
in the big scheme of things, but its a big deal to this family. And this
is a request made by Judge Fitch from Wilson county to be able to do
this wedding for his niece, and we’ve done it before.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Stam please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] A question for Representative Moore.
[Speaker Changes] Glad to yield.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Changes] How many years has it been since we have done this?
Four or five?
[Speaker Changes] Maybe one or two, I really don’t know. I think we may
have done one last session. But, a lot of water under the bridge the
last couple of years, Representative Stam.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Pittman, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill.</p>

Important to spurring North Carolina's economy and it seems while the
New York Times may not agree the Wall Street Journal seems to agree. One
curiosity from yesterday, some of the comments from some of my
colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle seem to frame a moral
equivalence between eugenics and the loss of revenue for a particular
program or the limitation that someone might have on some contract,
employment contract. I just find that bizarre. I find it a little bit
distasteful. I really find it very, very strange. And I don't know,
maybe some folks on that side of the aisle that wanna sort of revise
their, their version of moral equivalence, I'll let them be the judge of
that. But let me come back to the heart and soul of this budget. This is
a very solid budget for the state of North Carolina. As I said, we have
addressed the largest driver in our budget over the last several years,
Medicaid. We have addressed the need for tax reform, making space for
that in our budget. We fully fund school growth, university growth,
community college growth. That's all fully funded in this budget. We
have funds for group homes, that's been a major issue that people have
been interested in addressing. We fund mental health fully. We fund
economic development initiatives that are so critical and important to
this state. We fully fund our state health plan, we fund retirement
plan. We go a long way to better funding. Our savings reserve, our
repairs and renovations. We even provide some money as Representative
Holloway worked on very diligently. ?? harmless funds, ?? seven and a
half million dollars in ?? harmless funds for a number of very
vulnerable communities all across this state who need that.
Representative Jackson you should at least appreciate this since ?? is
top of the list. We provide funding for historic areas, the symphony,
the art museum, veterans programs. We meet the needs of this great state
of ours. And I do believe that this budget does achieve the state's goal
as I set out yesterday in my comments, of a well educated, healthy, and
safe citizenry. With the opportunity to work in a rewarding career and
the freedom to enjoy the natural, cultural and historic treasures of our
great state. This conference report, again it heeds the call of our
citizens that they have made toward us. That we have worked for the last
three years. And that's to have a budget that is realistic, that is
reasonable, and that is responsible. And I commend this budget to the
body. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McManus please state your
purpose? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady will
turn on her light. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] When you say that we fully fund the needs of education, I don't
understand that at all. I think we are not funding the needs of
education. I think we are not taking care of our teachers. We're not
taking care of training teachers, of keeping teachers. I have gotten so
many emails and I'm assuming many of you have too, from teachers, in
last 48 hours. Teachers who don't understand, year after year, we are
not respecting their profession. Not respecting the hard work they do.
And its not just the pay. It's at so many levels that we are not
respecting the profession of education. I came here believing that this
is the most important thing, we, as a civilized society do is to educate
the next generation. To teach them how to be responsible citizens and
productive citizens. We're gonna lose our best and brightest teachers,
not just for not paying them, but for not respecting them.</p>

for not, not respecting what they work so hard to do in this state. I
hear from teachers all the time. One of the ones I just heard from
wasn't even about her pay or her job. It was about how to teach civic
responsibility to her students, to her 4th grade class because she had
not grown up being politically active and in writing to me once before,
it was her first step towards being  politically active. And she wanted
her students to grow up having that experience that she didn’t grow up
with. And I think about how many teachers are out there trying to figure
out how to do this better. The Masters - getting a Masters in any other
profession is a respected thing to do. It’s considered part of making
yourself better at your job. My son in law who’s in banking, getting a
Masters will help him move up the ladder quicker. But for teachers we
say it doesn’t matter. It isn’t important. It doesn’t matter that you’re
trying to be better at what you do. And I have had teachers come to me
after our school system funded their Masters program to say “I’m a good
teacher but now I’m a better teacher because I’ve really looked at my
methods and what I do and I’ve gotten better at this and I really
appreciate the school system appreciating what we do. Well now we’re not
appreciating them and we’re not acknowledging them. I think the Teaching
Fellows Program in North Carolina was a wonderful program that was
nationally respected because of what we were doing to keep young people
teaching in our state. And we’re dropping it. We’re not going to fund it
anymore. We’re saying it’s not important. I’m not saying that Teach for
America is not a good program because we get some of the best and the
brightest in that program. And they come in and they teach for 2 years
and they leave. So for 2 years they do a good thing. My daughter who was
a teaching fellow and is a great teacher said the Teach for America kids
were better than she thought they would be. But then they leave. And one
of her close friend’s who is a Teach for America teacher is leaving this
year to go on to law school, I believe, but some type of graduate school
and she was a really good teacher for 2 years. We didn’t keep her. And
as long as we’re not paying them we can’t even dream of keeping them
because we’re not paying them enough to stay teaching in our school
systems. There are a lot of things in this budget that I don’t agree
with but the education part is the part that literally has torn up my
stomach for the last few days, that has kept me from sleeping for the
last few nights, just trying to think what I can do or say to reach
people who aren’t even looking at me about something that’s so
important. I guess if I didn’t want to hear what you were saying, I
wouldn’t look at you either. But this is important. This is something
we’re all going to regret unless we’re just wanting to point at public
schools and say “See we said they were saying they were failing, now
they failed” because they’re going to if we treat them this way. I would
ask that we not concur with this budget Please, unless we can do
something for education. Thank you. [Speaker changes] Representative
Adams, please state your purpose. [Speaker changes] Speak on the ?? of
what? [Speaker changes] The latest ?? [Speaker changes] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Members of the house I stand to speak in opposition to this ??
report. Much of what I would’ve said about it has already been shared by
my colleagues, but I heard a moment ago that this budget meets the needs
of all of the people. I don’t agree with that. It might meet the need of
some, but not all the people. Certainly not all the people ,who  I
represent and who have contacted me. But like most of the individuals
that have reached out to me, I do agree that there are a number of
hurtful things in this report that will negatively impact our people
whether they need services in hospitals or schools or universities or
whether they need services of nonprofit organizations. It will hurt
those organizations and it will hurt the people who are receiving
services from those</p>

<p id="135:00">
Adams: I’ve always believed that around here we make a lot of laws that
affect populations of people without having sufficient information about
what the outcomes on those people will actually be. I’m concerned that
by cutting the dollars that we are from public schools, that it will
result in a loss of teachers and assistants as well. And instead of
providing resources to the public schools as we should be, we’re
diverting many of those dollars for private school vouchers.
But I’m also concerned that not only will the cuts to education cause us
to lose teachers and assistants, I’ve got to tell you that my daughter
is an excellent teacher in Guilford County schools and has taught there
and even in Wake County and some other places for the past 17 years. But
she was so disillusioned, like many of her colleagues, that she is
looking for something else to do. We’re going to lose a lot of good
professionals because they believe now that we don’t really respect what
they do. If you work hard, if you try to improve yourself and earn
additional degrees and credentials, they’re not going to be recognized
and will serve no benefit for you.
I can’t imagine… and I heard yesterday, we talked about effective,
quality teachers. I don’t believe that the action we are taking in this
budget will get us quality teachers and will keep them in the classroom.
The other thing that I’m concerned about as it relates to our teachers
is our violation of their due process. We’re eliminating their tenure,
so teachers will not have their due process rights, when we have state
employees – and teachers are state employees – but other state employees
will continue to have theirs. So without this due process, then teachers
who would normally advocate for students, for themselves, are going to
feel threatened and they’ll be reluctant to do that.
As a matter of fact, I had a letter from a teacher who says that
protecting tenure allows me, a 30-year teacher, a veteran, to advocate
for students without worrying that someone in an administrative position
will fire me for disagreeing with him or her. Tenure allows me to engage
in debate about what’s best for our school without worrying that
disagreeing with administration will put my job in jeopardy.
I have hundreds of emails today, and I’ve gotten them throughout this
process, from teachers who are concerned about that as well. But also,
as we face high unemployment and a troubled economy, this budget will
also result in a loss of jobs. I heard a moment ago, we talked about
support for nonprofit organizations. Yes, we have provided for some, but
we have created a tremendous problem, especially for minority
organizations and organizations that are run by and support women, in
this overall process, as we have eliminated many of our minority
organizations totally from this budget, organizations that have provided
service and gained tremendous reputations for 20 and 30 years. We have
disregarded those folks as well.
Of concern to me along the way has also been the negative impact that
this budget totally will have on women and families. For example, most
of the teachers we have in our system are women. Most of the people who
are unemployed right now are women. Most of the people, many of those
who run these nonprofit organizations, especially minority
organizations, are women as well.
I will say that I am pleased that this budget does provide support for
eugenics. We probably should have done it long ago. I’m happy to see
Representative Womble here today, but I’m sure he understands this
process of politics here. I don’t know if he’s had a chance to look at
this budget. There are a lot of hurtful things there and I’m sure that
he’s going to understand why I am going to vote no on this budget today.
And I would ask that you would do the same. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Stam:	Mr. Speaker.
Speaker:	Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
Stam:	Would Representative Adams yield for a question?
Speaker:	Representative Adams, do you yield?
Adams:	Yes sir, I will.
Speaker:	She yields.
Stam:	Representative Adams, you talked about the diversion of resources
from what you call vouchers. Since the fiscal memo shows it’s a $1.7
million savings, would you propose if we did that in that first year…</p>

<p id="140:00">
Do you propose that we do away without these scholarships and maybe have
fewer teacher assistants and fewer teachers or fewer books?  Where would
you make up that $1.7 million in savings that you want to do away with?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not sure I understand your question Representative
Stam??  It probably sounds like a little trick.  You can talk to me
about that later. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wonder if Representative Adams would yield for a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, Representative Stam asked you if
you would try to find the $1.5 million that the fiscal note said for
year one.  I wonder if you were aware or not, I'm sure that you were,
that for every succeeding year after that it is a multimillion dollar
loss to the State, with those losses increasing each and every time and
that's not even counting hte additional losses that will happen to local
schools and local school districts that are not accounted for in a
fiscal note that's fairly limited. Would that be correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You are absolutely correct.  I'm sure Representative
Stamm knows that as well.  Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would Representative Glazier yield for questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Be delighted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier are you not aware that in the
subsequent years the savings to local LEA's exceed the cost to the
State?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, Representative Stam, and I'll tell you why.  The
fiscal note, and I read it entirely, the multi-versions of the fiscal
note, show a continuing and extended losses to the State going anywhere
from $2.2 million  as I recall all the way up to $6 to $7 million
depending on the year out. There are some projected savings in the local
units but the problem of course is an inability to really accurately at
all project the savings to the local unit and all of the deficits that
are not taken into account in the fiscal note that will happen in the
local units because it's all based on #1, how many students enroll, #2,
what you do with the percentages, #3, what schools they come from and
what happens there since they don't come and aren't going to go in neat
packages of 20.  But I could go on but those are at least my first few
points.  Thank you Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Stam would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, do you yield?  He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, from your detailed research could
you explain  what the actual experience in Florida was with this
program?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In Florida I think last year I think Brian has the
exact figure, their equivalent to our fiscal research division showed
$58 million in savings in one year to the State of Florida.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To briefly debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the
House, I can't really match the eloquence of my colleagues on the
education portion of this budget, its funding and elimination of
policies and important programs and the changes in tenure and those
aspects of the budget that are particularly troubling to those of us on
this side of the aisle so I won't repeat that.  I wanted to focus on an
area of the budget that hasn't really gotten much attention and that's
in ???.  Representative Adams did mention the elimination of many of
those important economic development programs, particularly those that
affect minorities. But I just wanted to note that it seems that
provisions for Senate bill 10 were slipped into the budget that wipe out
the membership of the Environmental Management Commission and remove the
conflict of interest language and make changes to the Coastal Resources
Commission, the Coastal Resources Advisory Commission, which are
particularly problematic. That while there may be some efficiencies
achieved by the proposed merger between the Division of Water Quality
and the Division of Water Resources they have fairly different missions
and it doesn't seem that there's going to be much, that the staff needs
are going to be less, because the merger although there is a $2 million
cut in the budget to those and this represents about a 15% cut to those
divisions.  ??? has been cut back 35% over the past several years and
that deals with a very important water quality pollutant in our state.
The number one which is sedimentation and runoff and that's going to be
a real problem. And that's in a time when we were in a recession and not
having to review as many construction sites.  As I understand it we're
down to 40 staff for 8,000 sites across the state. So that's a problem.
And I did want to ask a question if I could of one of the bill's
sponsors.  There's a provision</p>

<p id="145:00">
And the bill – sorry, I'm not – and I'll just ask Representative Dollar
or one of his colleagues, it's the Jordan Lake Water Quality Improvement
demonstration project. This seems to be so specifically designed as to
be for a particular company, which is exempt from the normal state
contracting and bidding, and transfers 1.3 million for this technology,
I assume to help clean up Jordan Lake. Could somebody speak to that? I
don't know, Representative Dollar, or somebody on the NER, because of
the NER provision. Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, please state your purpose. Did
the lady ask in the form of a question and Representative Dollar, do you
yield to the question? He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to ask you about this specific
provision. Is it designed for one specific company?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't know. What I understand is that it's designed
to deal with clean-up issues in Lake Jordan that folks have talked about
for a number of years. I assume if one of the other members has more
specific information on that, I would certainly direct the question to
them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. It just seems to be drafted in a way that
is one specific company, and I'm not sure that that's not considered
private involvement, which may not be constitutional. But I think they
are not... Representative West? Do you have any insight, maybe, on that
provision? Okay. Well, okay, so. Anyway, I think that there are some
pretty big hits that are being taken by our conservation funding, which
are really important for water quality protection and for our quality of
life, and as was pointed out a couple of weeks ago, we've slipped to
30th in the nation in quality of life. Not something we should aspire
to, so there are many reasons to vote against this budget, and I urge
you to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Charles Graham, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr Speaker, to speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr Speaker and members. I know a lot has
been said in the last few hours about this budget and the impact it's
having on our public education system in the state, and I  felt that, as
an educator -- not a politician, educator – I need to stand and speak on
behalf of our teachers and our children and our principals and our
administrators. And I did want to make a few points, I don't want to be
repetitive in terms of what has been said. But I sit here this morning
in this body responding to emails from teachers from my district, and
many from your districts, and giving some advice. I hope, and also
giving hope to our teachers that another day will come, and it'll be a
better day.  I believe that we're going to see, especially along the
border of North Carolina – the southern border, the northern border, and
the western borders – teachers leaving this state. I believe that. That
is a repetitive message that I'm getting from teachers. Enough is
enough. They've been ignored long enough. I will tell you that teachers
understood when we were in tough economic times. They understood that
they would not be getting financial support from the state. They
understood that. They were well with that. But as they see today that
this body's giving away millions to the top 1 percent in our state,
we're balancing our budget on their backs and the backs of our children.
It's hard for them to understand, at this point in our history, why are
we being treated this way? Giving away millions in vouchers, and yes I'm
going to call a spade a spade, it is a voucher. Teachers don't
understand. Teachers are fearful. Morale is low in our public school
situation, our public school settings. We do have a shortage of teachers
in this state, you know. We do have [RECORDING ENDS]</p>

<p id="150:00">
A shortage of teachers, well-qualified teachers, science and math. And
we're saying that teachers are not important, with regards to this
appropriation. Our public school system is not important, with regards
to this budget. That's shameful. We all, in this body, are products of a
public school system. We all are here because we had teachers pushing
us, supporting us, encouraging us. They developed our personalities.
They instilled values in us. In addition to that, they had other duties.
Bus duty, cafeteria duty, PTAs, football games, basketball games, night
duty, giving time away from their families. Actually, I know teachers
who spend their own personal money buying supplies to make their
classroom situation a better learning environment for their children. A
better teaching situation, because they want to be good teachers. They
are nation-builders. We're here because of these teachers. And we say to
them, you're not important in this budget. You're not valued. And I'm
standing here on behalf of all the teachers in this state. Those who
have not responded to any of the emails, those who have called me, those
who are saying “Please support us.” I'm doing that on their behalf. I'm
here on their behalf. This is what motivated me to be here. And we have
educators in this body. We have people who've sacrificed. We've had
teachers who have come and gone and have devoted their life to a
profession that they believed in, a cause they believed in. And we're
here today, saying to these teachers, you are not important as we
deliberate this budget today. I don't care what you say, you can't
convince me or the other teachers across this state that they're
important today. On top of that, you are saying to our teachers, well
let's put $10 million into private education, and let's let those
teachers out there teach to a different standard. Let's let those
teachers not be required to have a teaching certificate. Let's not have
a level playing surface. This is what this tells me: it tells me that
we've got two systems, when the Constitution says we should support one.
Now if you can look yourself in the face and walk out of here today,
push that button that you're going to push today, and live with it, God
help you. We should not be doing what we're going to do today, on the
backs of our number one institution. That's our educational system, our
public education system. We should not do this today. But if you're
going to vote your conscience, and you do that, then I'm going to tell
you something. Teachers are bright. They're smart. They're intelligent.
They're hard-working, they are driven. They are motivated. Don't you
forget that. Don't you ever forget that. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

of time on one small portion of the bill, the education area, and while
I've enjoyed that work, ?? my views I guess in the end are very close to
Representative Holloway's, that he expressed on the floor yesterday.
There's some hard decisions that were made here. We tried to get to the
best position we did. I wish there was more money to do a range of
things that need to be done, and I'm looking forward to a longer process
over a period of years to get to where we need to be. Over the last 48
hours, though, I've spent some time [RECORDING ENDS]</p>

Going through the rest of the budget the pieces of which I have looked
at. I was intending to stand up and ask representative Dollar the same
questions that Representative Harrison has asked. But I will leave at
this. The Provision that Representative Harrison raised is on pages 226,
227 in the bill related to the Lake Jordan Nutrition mitigation
demonstration project. It’ a special provision in the budget. And It
appears to give about [??] state funds. And it’s gone up in a way it’s
really interesting if you look at the bill and the you go on the web
site of a entity called Solar Bead, you will see its look like the thing
has been gone up in a way to provide the contract to the vendor. Its n
interesting mixture of both what’s public in the web site and what
apparently isn’t public. But I do think that what this bill does in this
piece is it provides state funds to one vendor, it exempts from state
contract rules for this lake Jordan Project. And the bill to do that is
on the calendar for today or for tomorrow. So these things need to be
looked together. Having found this one, I wonder I don’t frankly have
the time to find out other things like this.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker
[Speaker Changes] Representative McElraft Please state your purpose
[Speaker Changes] I would like a question to Rep McGrady
[Speaker Changes] Rep McGrady, do you do?
[Speaker Changes] I do
[Speaker Changes] Rep McGrady can you point out where it mentions the
word Solar Bead
[Speaker Changes] It doesn’t. That would be patently unconstitutional to
put that in there. What you would do Rep McElraft is broaden a way that
almost no other vendor can meet the specifications in the bill and that
really appears what this is and again this is not my area of expertise.
[Speaker Changes] Follow up
[Speaker Changes] Would it be Ok if I answer what I think is what we
were told and may be that can kind of clarify for Rep Harrison and also
Rep McGrady. I will be happy to do that.
[Speaker Changes] Speaker. I would certainly yield for her to answer the
question I sough of posed. That would be helpful.
[Speaker Changes] Rep McElraft You yield to Rep McGrady’s question.
[Speaker Changes] I do
[Speaker Changes] She yields
[Speaker Changes]Thank you  I am sorry about this business way I didn’t
know any other way. We put this in the budget if the lake Jordan 515
passes. Dean has asked for a study to look at alternative ways to clean
up Lake Jordan  	at the site and so yes there are solar Bead technology
out there and I am not sure if it’s one company that  it’s patented
from. But it was my understanding that they were going to do a study of
different technologies and I don’t think there is a mention of solar
bead anywhere in this budget. We left that to the experts. The deaner
people. The people who know the environment, they know the technology
water resources are great time reader who run the department suggested
this technology or something similar in order to see something similar
in order to see if there is way that we can cost effectively clean up
Lake Jordan without asking our counties to spend so much money on the
upstream. If we can kind of clean this side itself. So that’s what it’s
all about. It’s only if this bill 515 passes. Then that  part of the
clean water that’s what clean water trust fund is all about is to see if
this  thing could be a technology that can actually help our state.
That’s why it’s in the budget.
[Speaker Changes] I thank the lady for the explanation. My Point though,
I am sure the intention is good here and the hope is that the technology
could work. But I would suggest to you that there is no evidence that
the technology could work on a scale.</p>

That is being put forward here. And I would suggest to you further while
there is no specific reference to no one company, go online yourself and
compare the language here with what the product is and you're going to
find out that what we've basically got, I believe, is a sole source
contract. And of course, my concern is not just with respect to the
waste of a million three here but what other sole source contracts might
there be in this bill?
And, I served on the Clean Water Management Trust Fund and no I don't
think that's an appropriate use of the funds here. And as many of my
colleagues know, I have real concerns about how we have now brought the
Clean Water Management Trust Fund into the department basically. And
back when many of us were in the minority, the Clean Water Management
Trust Fund did a pretty good job of funding projects even in the
minority districts at that time. They had an independent board and they
weren't dependent upon going to the Governor and getting political say.
They did what was right and some of my colleagues on this side of the
aisle have told me that there wasn't that sort of interference.
And I'm really concerned about the structural problems here. My final
concern I guess, again, and Representative Harrison stole my thunder a
little bit is that we refused to go along with Senate Bill 10 and now,
lo and behold, where is part of it? Of course it's the part that relates
to those darn environmental people. And when you look at the way that
the people that are being knocked off, and these are people, there's a
very clear effort here being made with respect to how this, the ERC
specifically, but others are being handled.
And so, if I were a Wake County legislator, and I'm not thank God, I
would be very uncomfortable with this provision here and the feeling
that we are going to clean up Lake Jordan with unproven technology and I
voted on it. It won't probably matter this year but somewhere down the
road I think this is not a real good project. In summary, I struggle
with the budget. I know this is a compromise and I've been through the
process before. There are many very good things to recommend to you in
the budget but like Representative Holloway yesterday, I felt like I
needed to not just go along and not point out there are some very
disturbing things in this budget too.

Thank you Mister Speaker. Members, education is our most important and
our most effective anti-poverty program. It is also our most effective
and our most important pro-business, pro-growth, pro-jobs program. The
cuts in this budget and in previous years to education undermine our
future, undermines the future of the poor children in this state,
undermines our ability to provide good jobs for those people. I don't
often talk about my roots but I am a child of a farming family from
Arkansas.
In the Depression there, after the Depression came the Dust Bowl. There
wasn't any food. There wasn't any food.My farming father became a
migrant worker and traveled across the country by rail and finally got
to California where there was food all year. My family moved to
California and I have often thanked my parents for putting us children
into a fine education system because we all blossomed. I was a little
reluctant to move to North Carolina when we became part of the UNC
family. But when I got here and I</p>

<p id="165:00">
Through this story of the University of North Carolina and the visionary
founders of this state who were determined to provide a fine education
for their children. It made, it was easy for me to adopt this as my home
state.  We have been blessed with visionary education leaders throughout
our history in the depression of the general assembly raise taxes to
support our local schools so our poor children, and this state is still
a poor state, so they can continue to be in school. Governor Stanford
and I disagree with this but he raised the food tax to support
education. He was a visionary leader. He made hard decisions in favor of
education. We’ve had a smart start in Governor Hunt and this wasn’t done
by Democrats alone, these were not democratic decisions. They were done
by partisan, they were done by both Republicans and Democrats to
support, to support the children of this State. So the future of our
State will depend on education and we, we should not be cutting
education like we are in this budget. We should find a way to fund our
first priorities. We have made bad decisions these past two years by
taking so much of our revenue stream out of our, our budget that we
couldn’t fund this most important program. So now we do have the brain
drain that UNC has started, for example. University of North Carolina is
one of our most important economic drivers in the State. It is ranked
tenth in the world as the best research university that’s based on its
ability to track federal grant money. We are now beginning to lose those
faculty members of the, of the must retain faculty members that UNC are
research grant ?? at UNC. This year we’re losing twice of those people
that we try to retain as we lost last year. With those grants go there,
their grant, with those professors go the grant money, with the
professors go the graduate students that are doing the research. With
the loss of the grants and the research go are innovative new jobs in
North Carolina. Many of those people stay in North Carolina. These
decisions are really not just; they’re really not just ill advised,
they’re really decisions that undermine our future. I want to just
mention one other, one other specific program, the cancer hospital.
Several years ago Republicans and Democrats like funded a fifty million
dollar research grant at the, at the UNC cancer hospital. That UNC
cancer hospital has become a lead in cancer research over the past five
or six years doing major clinical trials, new innovations, treatments
for the poor people of this State, for the people who can’t afford or
don’t have insurance. This year we’re cutting that fund by seven million
dollars and sending it to another institution. Historically this body,
the general assembly has honoured those special funds that have been set
aside for those kinds of purposes. If you want to fund, create a new
fund at another institution, you found new money to do it. You didn’t
cut a successful organization, successful program to give that money
away to somebody else. That’s undermining our future and undermining our
great institutions. I hope you’ll join me in voting ‘no’ on this
conference report. There’s still money to fix up some of these things
and I think we should be doing that. We should be setting aside about
creating a budget that will be a pro-growth, pro-business, anti-poverty
budget. Thank you.

Thank you Mr Speaker. Members of the House, I begin my comments by
asking a question and giving what I think is the appropriate answer. The
question is, “Why do we like poetry? My answer is that the poet finds a
way to leave out the unnecessary words. I still endeavor in my comments
to, at here to that definition. It is obvious that the campaign ?? for
the 2014 elections have firmly been drawn on the debate.</p>

<p id="170:00">
And this is about this budget and this is the campaign headlines
Republicans have decimated k-12 education. It has been my observation
that oftentimes facts are strangers in this body. It is sad to me that
in the public debates that we have, and budget time, we often are
willing to use our wonderful, dedicated teachers and our precious
children, as ping pong balls to bounce from one side of the budgetary
table to the other. That is saying, to me, &quot;let me enter at least
one fact that I have personal experience with into the debate
today.&quot; In my county of Duplin, in my first budget experience after
a couple of years ago, in May of 2011, the headline appeared in the
paper &quot;local school system notifies 210 of position cuts for the
2011-2012 school year&quot;
Ladies and gentlemen of the house, I witnessed first hand the
devastating effect that that had on the teachers of Duplin county. It
was totally  unnecessary, but yet, because of the ?? requirements, it
scared the pudding out of so many people. Guess how many of those people
were cut: none. None, zero, none of them. They ended up with more
employees in the school system than they ever had before. The political
redirect to be believed is going to have to follow this line of logic:
that the republican majority, in one budget cycle because this one
hasn't taken any effect yet, therefore it's had no physical effect yet
because it's not in place. But yet in one budget cycle of two years, the
republican majority has decimated public education. I just don't believe
anybody's going to believe that. 1 out of 140 years. In conclusion, a
wise man once said &quot;a lie has speed, but truth has endurance.&quot;
Thus it is, truth having endurance, this budget will positively stand
the test of time. I urge you to support this budget. Thank you

Again, my issue to follow on is what are we doing for jobs in North
Carolina? Representative ?? said this budget is really all about
Medicaid. That North Carolina couldn't do more for Medicaid. I'm just
pointing one of the big areas of concerns I have in this budget in my
district is my community hospitals. I would put the question slightly
different. Medicaid is a 40 year program. Great experience in North
Carolina. 14 billion dollars of our state budget. It's 14 million dollar
program only about a third of it is in our budget because 2/3 of it is a
federal match in round numbers. This budget is affect my local hospitals
by adding assessments to them. By payment reductions to them. By
withholding payments for them over time with stipulations. By denying
the Medicaid expansion, we lose over 400 jobs in my local hospitals. In
Haywood, jackson and ?? counties.</p>

<p id="175:00">
in the last budget when we cut, this legislature cut, this previous
legislature cut a billion dollars out of Medicaid we lost 240-some jobs
in my three rural hospitals. We are struggling. We are losing
physicians. We're losing jobs, good jobs, and when your community's
hospitals begin to wane and you do not have quality healthcare in your
community it is difficult to recruit industry and business and quality
residents to your community. Quality education, quality healthcare is
absolutely essential for us in Western North Carolina to recruit the
kind of jobs and industries and businesses we need to create jobs. So
we're losing jobs in these very sectors, education and healthcare, and
these very sectors drive our recruitment of private sector jobs. So I
have big problems with that, but what I would, I would slightly change
the [??] on Medicaid. If we expanded Medicaid, if we would reconsider
that at some point, we would meet the test.  Because I don't think we're
meeting the test of being realistic, reasonable, and responsible when it
comes to jobs. When it comes, and these aren't Democrat jobs I want to
tell you. These jobs are bipartisan. It's just as much a Republican job
or an Independent's job as it is a Democrat's job. This is jobs for
everybody. This is jobs for my people. Jobs for your people. Each and
every member in this body has a similar dilemma that I have in my
district. In the rural sections you're just like me. But realistic, how
are we going to help low-wage workers get healthcare? Just because we
don't expand Medicaid they don't get well. They don't have the
resources. So there is no way they can get high quality healthcare if we
don't use our partnership in Medicaid to help them. So realistically
they don't have an option. There's 1,500 in my district that do not have
healthcare. They don't have primary healthcare, they don't have
preventative healthcare, they don't have mental health services and they
are in dire need of all. Reasonable, reasonable, is it reasonable in an
economy that's trying to recover from a recession, which we are in North
Carolina, again I point out we're the fifth highest in unemployment, we
need jobs. We need to recover in North Carolina. Is it reasonable to
deny 2.5 billion dollars of our citizens federal tax dollars that they
have paid to the Untied States government, and we're denying those
dollars to come back to North Carolina. Is that a reasonable thing to
do? Because if we brought those dollars back we would have those 400
jobs in my district. We would have 23-25,000 more jobs in North Carolina
this year. This needs to be reconsidered. Responsible, responsible. If
we would reconsider that I would get those 400 jobs. My 1,500 citizens
in my district that makes less than $8.00 an hour could have healthcare
for the first time in their lives. Healthcare is essential. The number
one and number two reason that children drop out of school are
healthcare related. The number one is somebody gets pregnant. Well
family planning, comprehensive healthcare for child and mother and
family would help that. The number two reason children drop out of
school is healthcare related. Somebody in their family has untreated
mental health conditions. Their family is in uproar, the child is at
risk and they're at four and five times the risk of dropping out.
Healthcare matters at every sector of our communities, jobs, people,</p>

The North Carolina Institute of Medicine estimates that there will be
twenty to thirty citizens that will die, dead, and in each of yours, you
will have twenty or thirty constituent’s, that will die for lack of
health care, that is already paid for, that we are denying to come to

five thousand primary healthcare jobs, providing healthcare for 600
thousand people.

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Would Representative Queen yield for two questions?

Representative Queen do you yield for the questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I will when I am finished with my comments
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman does not yield at this time
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’m trying to make the point.  Is this responsible? Is
this responsible? Because If we would do this.  If we would reconsider
this, and we create these jobs, providing this healthcare, no additional
costs, we actually are losing $158 million of new revenue that comes
from these twenty-five thousand jobs, and that’s from our own research.
Folks here in the general assembly.  You all get the spreadsheets, same
ones I get.  $158 million we don’t have in this budget, in addition to
these twenty-five jobs. Now these are primary jobs, now we all know if
we bring back to North Carolina, $2.5 billion we don’t have in North
Carolina, create twenty-five thousand jobs, we have a multiplier effect.
 This is new stuff.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Point of order
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ladies recognized
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker, I’ve been incredibly patient, and we’ve
ranted on about Medicaid and the lack of expansion, which is not in this
budget.  It was a separate bill and I would ask that you direct the
conversation accordingly.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Your point is well taken, and Representative Queen I
would ask that you stick to the budget conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’m trying to stick to the main point, which is we are
not using Medicaid and the options of Medicaid to create the jobs to
provide the stimulus to bring North Carolina back from recovery.  We’ve
talked plenty about tax reform, which was the other big point, and our
side has tried to make the point, that if you just give the vast
majority 80% of the cuts to the top few percent 2, 3,4% it’s in that
range, 5% would certainly cover it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Additional point of order, we’re not on tax reform
either
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Point is taken Representative Queen
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’m really using my guide, from representative dollars
points, that this budget is all about Medicaid and tax reform and I
agree, but I do think we are going the wrong way.  It’s not realistic,
it’s not responsible and it’s not reasonable and I ask you to vote no
against this conference report.

questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Certainly Representative Stam

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Do you have grandchildren or great grandchildren?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do, no I don’t.  I just dream about them
[SPEAKER CHANGE] 2nd question
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up, Representative Queen do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I certainly do
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Queen whether they are grandchildren or
great nephews or great great whatevers, have you consulted them about
the morality of asking them to pay the debt to the Chinese for all the
borrowed money for the money you want us to spend in North Carolina to
solve our problems today?  Have you asked the young people that
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Let’s see, how can I say that?  We have paid our $2.5
billion to Washington, and are we just going to leave it there for
California or Texas or Florida?</p>

We’re going to bring it back to North Carolina.  And I am of the mind

the scenario you laid out there my friend.  Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and Gentleman, I have
not yet spoken yet on this conference report, and it’s the area I would
like to address, I’m concerned about the entire conference report, but
the area I am most concerned with is education, because I have spent the
Lions share of my life in education, specifically as it relates to
teachers and teaching conditions.  I heard my good friend Representative
Dixon say, there will be no loss of teachers, and I think he’s probably
right in that respect.  We have to have a warm body in every classroom,
we have to by law, but I am concerned about the possibility of
certification of some of these teachers.  They may be warm bodies, but
not certified in the field of expertise we want them to teach.  Now,
North Carolina does not provide enough teachers, we don’t have enough
teaching institutions to provide enough teachers for the loss of those
teachers we have through attrition and through retirement, we’ve known
that for a number of years, and for a long time we have been the
benefactors of states who have trained their teachers, such as
Pennsylvania, Ohio and several other states, we have been able to
recruit good quality teachers out of those states.  But I’m afraid we
have broken the cookie jar.  We now have no incentive for those folk to
come to North Carolina to teach when we are going to be 48th or 49th in
teacher pay? They just as soon go to Mississippi and go down to the gulf
coast and enjoy themselves.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Iler, state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative Lucas a question
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lucas do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Be happy to as soon as I finish
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He does not yield at this time
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Teacher pay will not be raised in this conference
report.  So that those teachers that are now here, will have to assess
whether they want to stay.  Many have stayed due to teaching conditions.
 Well, they are going to lose that, with losing teacher tenure.  We will
have many many teachers who will say, well gosh, if I can’t be granted
that protection of tenure, I may as well just go into Tennessee, in fact
I’ve had a ?? I’m leaving to go to Tennessee.  I’ll make more money, and
I might get my tenure back. Or they may go to Virginia or to South
Carolina.  Go across the border to work.  Because we’ll have no tenure,
no guarantee of job security.  We are also increasing class size; so
think about it if you were a teacher.  Why would you want to stay here,
lose your protection of tenure and increase your responsibility with
more students for the same pay? If you could do better.  They can do
better, and we can do better.  So we are losing our teachers, we’re not
preparing enough teachers we’re not able to recruit teachers from out of
state as we have traditionally been able to do, so we’re going to be in
a quandary, so you say, well maybe we will just increase higher
education, no we’re not doing that either.</p>

we're cutting the resources for higher education. So we'll probably have
less teachers, fewer teachers going into teaching. And goodness
gracious, teaching students. Education is the bedrock of any modern
society. Even a ancient society. You want an educated public. You get
your educated public by good, quality teachers. But we're saying no.
Then even if they went back to school, we're saying well, that advanced
degree is not very lucrative, we do not put a lot of emphasis on that so
you don't have to do that. We're not encouraging them to do that, so why
remain in North Carolina as a teacher? It hurts. We've had several, I
mean several executive administrations who've really placed a premium on
education. And I can cite you Governor Holshouser, who really put a
premium on education. I can cite you Governor Hunt, who is known around
this country and still is known for what he did for K-12 education in
North Carolina. I'm afraid that we won't have that bragging right any
longer. So I urge you to please take a look at  what we're doing here.
We can do better, and yes, I'll be happy to yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Iler, he yields to your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Rep. Lucas. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Rep. Lucas, I was reading a while back and was looking at a chart for
the national educational association. And I've been hearing numbers,
about 46, 48, and that sort of thing. I looked at the charts from the
national education association, the NEA, and the contribution of the
state to teacher salaries, and we're number 11 in the nation. Not number
1, not number 48, number 11. And not local, not federal, but state
funds, we were number 11 in the country. So that's a little different
than number 48, wouldn't you agree?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If, I would thank you for the question. If all things were equal in
other states, I would concur. But you have to recognize that in North
Carolina, it's in a very unique posture. We grant statewide salaries to
all of our teachers. You have many other, we have dependent school
systems. You have many other school systems around the country who have
independent school systems, and we have even school systems who can levy
their own taxes and they can skew, depending one way or the other. But
our state has been recognized as one of the states to be desired to have
statewide teacher salaries. And yes, we have gone down, down down.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield for a follow up question? Rep. Lucas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative.
So would you also agree with me that perhaps discussing the state budget
is very important, but it should also be discussing with your county if
teachers are leaving, with your county, or my county, or any other
counties to possibly chip in and make the total package better than what
it might be at this time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would agree if teachers had the resources of wealth to do that. But
I'm sure that you would recognize that many of our poor counties cannot
keep up, let alone catch up or supersede the standard, because they
can't provide supplements. They just don't have the resources. They're
just too poor. So in that instance, we're happy to have a statewide
system. But that statewide salary cannot continue to go downward. I hope
that helps you with your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker?

Rep. Pierce, please state your

look at the budget like I should, but is there anything in the general

certified teachers, and that they were fully certified and qualified,
and they were looking for good surrounding conditions to work, and
that's why they came to North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I don't know if that's the case.  I know if I was born
and raised in Pennsylvania or Ohio, when I was through with school, I'd
be getting out of there and coming down here too.  North Carolina has a
lot to offer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  This former Pennsylvania resident would
like to ask Representative McGrady a question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative McGrady, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Representative McGrady, and I made my
comments on the budget yesterday, and this is truly not a comment, it is
a question.  I didn't catch, but I'm curious a lot about why it's in the
budget.  It's page F-11 of the budget, and it's the tuition increases
for non-resident undergraduate students, and if everybody will look,
it's really curious to me.  But, every institution has significant
tuition rate increased for undergraduates except 2, UNC Charlotte and NC
State, which have none.  And so all the institutions are 12.3, and some
are 6, and I'm just curious.  I think I can understand one, but I would
love to know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think I'm going to have to throw a line for help on
this one.  That was the subject of a conference, Representative Glazier,
that I wasn't a part of.  So if perhaps Representative Holloway could
respond to that, or one of the big chairs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to redirect my question to
Representative Holloway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Holloway, do you yield for
Representative Glazier's question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I yield, and if Representative Glazier could repeat his
question for me, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, on page F-11 where we have major tuition increases
for non-resident undergrads, ever institution's either increasing their
tuition by 12.3%, or 6%, except 2 that have 0, NC State and UNC
Charlotte and my question is why?</p>

Representative Glazier, you know, I don't know that I can give you a
good answer for that, and I don't know that I have an answer. I really
don't, I don't have an answer for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Well, just to speak for a moment, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Glazier, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I wasn't certainly going to be speaking again today, but we are jacking
up the tuition at HBCU's. We a jacking it up at Chapel Hill, and at all
of our other institutions. And I certainly understand, or think I
understand, that there could be some limitations on ones that have very
high rates. We talked about that in Committee, but a bunch that were
jacking up are in the same category. And here we have simply in
conference, not by the House's decision. ?? not done it on these. I'm
getting some indication that maybe Representative Horn can answer, and I
would refer a question to Representative Horn, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Horn, do you yield to Representative Glazier's question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I do. I yield and I'll try to answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, sir. You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
My recollection, I asked some of those questions myself. My recollection
is that the reason those two institutions were not included in that out
of state tuition increase is because their constituent institution
comparisons, they were much more in line with those out of state
tuitions that are constituent institutions verses the other institutions
that are going to endure a tuition increase. So is that clear or do you
need more explanation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
May I follow up, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Horn, do you yield to a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I'll do my best. Yes, sir. I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I think I understand that what you're saying is that the sister
institutions that they are aligned with tiers. Their out of state
tuition was more in line, and if we increased it at all, it would take
it out of line. Is that the...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Horn, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Because I believe, Chapel Hill for example, State, I suspect UNC
Charlotte, among others are in that same tiered category, and had very
similar, as I recall, out of state tuitions going in. Why would we send
up Chapel Hill's 12.3 percent, but UNC Charlotte none?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Glazier, I attempted to answer your question the first
place to the best of my recollection. I ?? kicking the can to someone
else. I would not have spoken had I not been able to at least attempt to
offer to answer your first question. To answer your follow up questions,
in the detail in which you ask them, I'm not trying to dodge it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I appreciate you very much. Mr. Speaker, I'll just finish my comment and
then we'll...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Glazier, if you'll please yield.
Representative Bryan, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Might I offer some possible help to Representative Horn on this
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Glazier has the floor right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I will be glad to yield to Representative Bryan and see if he can answer
the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Bryan, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Glazier, I don't know that I have
a great answer. I did at one point in the process ask for a comparison
of out of state tuitions and relative costs. I will say just as a
relative comment that I know that UNC Chapel Hill for example on out of
state tuition we were still funding more from the state than they were
actually bringing in, whereas I think both State and UNC Charlotte,
their actual cost to the state were less than the out of state charges.
I'm not sure how helpful that is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I appreciate it. One last comment, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.
It is, precisely the question I raised is the kind of problems that crop
up in conferences. And here, given the education budget is an issue, I
certainly understand the differentiation of 12.3 and 6. But to say that
two institutions that are in very similar lots with others don't have
any increase, and without, sort of having an explanation is difficult,
and I think folks probably ought to follow up on that. Although we're
going to all get the question at our institutions that had their
tuitions substantially raised, and equivalent institutions, and
institutions like A&amp;T that have an engineering program just like
State and Charlotte do, This one's going to be</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Cunningham please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the motion Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I received numerous emails from lots of people out of
my district and I'll read one. A teacher's plea against North Carolina's
propose budget.
Dear Representative Cunningham, I am writing to let you know how ?? the
propose cuts to education are to a current public school teacher.
Although I have not taught for many years, I have enough experience in
my five years of teaching to see not any support of North Carolina's
public education dwindle the repeated budget cuts but also a huge dive
in teacher morale. As those in my profession feel continually wronged on
despite the work we do despite the children of North Carolina. What is
even worse for these teachers who do not receive the support is having
to watch the effects on each and every one of their students. Please
vote no against this propose budget and by doing so vote yes for every
educator and child in our state. Sincerely, Ms Noble.
I rise as I said early on I am a product of public school system. By the
time I graduated high school I had attended twenty schools because I
moved around quite a bit. That was my hideaway the public school system.
I was very much encouraged, very much believed in, and told I could be
what I wanted to be and much so I listened and I took it all in and
there's a lot of kids out there today that are looking to hear that same
thing from inspired teachers, inspired educators that have the passion
to teach. It's a lot of little kids that go to school hungry everyday.
They are less likely to learn if their stomachs are empty. But there's
still some educators and some teachers that fill in the gap. We're
devaluing our educators. We don't realize all that they bring. It's not
a pencil, it's not just a blackboard, and it's not just the instruction
for the day. It really is so much more that they bring that we are
currently not recognizing. They bring sometimes stability that children
don't get on their own homes when they leave school that day. Sometimes
they bring just a hug that that child may not get at home and in other
places and sometimes get safety and it's security that those educators
provide for that eight hours or six hours whatever it is that day. That
keeps that child coming back that next day. One thing in that budget
that really bothers me is that we have taken away the incentives for the
masters. As a professional nurse if I go back and get my Bachelor's my
pay go up ten to fifteen thousand dollars. If I go back and get my
Masters it goes up twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year. Now we want
to tell our educators we don't want o give you anything but we'll give
you five hundred dollars a year incentive to be in the top twenty-five.
That's not a lot when you're looking at the cost of living increase that
goes away we haven't been getting that in a long time. Now we're looking
that the economy in the state that it is. The majority of educators are
female in the state of North Carolina. Eighty percent only approximately
seven to ten percent are minorities. So we see what we're dealing with.
It's a lot.</p>

...a lot of parents that teach our kids leave school and go to a second
job. It's a lot of parents that teach our kids leave our schools and go
apply for Medicaid. You may not want to believe it but it's true.
We want to create a North Carolina for the future. We got to look beyond
just one dollar and look at the return. Our return normally is about $17
to that $1. It's $15 to $17 if we invest early. And if we increase
classroom sizes we're lost. Because our kids won't be innovators for the
next coming decade. Our children going be left behind where we claim we
didn't want to leave them, it's behind. And the kids behind them will be
left behind if we keep doing the same thing over and over. Until we
display a different behavior, we're not going to get anything different.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I sat here for a long time and didn't want to say
anything, just wanted to let it go. But I'm telling you, I'm a product
of public education, as are my six brothers and sisters. I've got a
father who worked hard to make ends meet and didn't expect to have any
handouts. So you're not alone in this boat.
You think we have no compassion for teachers? I've got a child who just
graduated from college and got a job. She's got a lot of friends who are
looking for jobs so if you know teachers ready to give other positions,
let me know. I know a bunch of college educated kids who are ready to
jump into that field and start going.
We can argue and fuss about increasing class size, but let me tell you,
how many of us were brought up in a classroom with 35 kids and no
teacher's assistants? I guarantee just about every body in this room
was. And I think we're a fairly educated group.
What we have done is not decimate education. What we have done is put
North Carolina on the right path. I encourage you to support this
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker Tillis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the
House, there's been a lot of discussion and I know there's a lot of
passion around this budget and the tough choices we have to make. I
heard the word shameful used. I've heard a lot of words that really, I
think, are disrespectful, not only to the members of this House but
disrespectful to the people whose futures are hanging in the balance.
This budget funds education at a higher level than its been funded
before. It's a reduction in the rate of growth. But we also need to take
a look at other things that we've done. Let me talk about the
inconvenient truth of members who are in this General Assembly in 2009
who voted for their budget. They voted for a tax, or they voted for a
tax that was effectively a teacher pay decrease. And not only did they
decrease the pay of the teachers, but they decreased the pay of some of
the poorest people in this State through the so-called temporary sales
tax. At the same time, you were cutting at levels equal to or greater
than what we're talking about.
So let's be intellectually honest with ourselves. We had people talking
about public school who some of their children and grandchildren go to
private schools. We've had people talk about Medicaid ??, let's talk
about Medicaid for a minute. Let's talk about why we're in the fiscal
state that we're in now. Where was the shameful comments made about a
department of HHS that the duly elected Democratic auditor said hundreds
of millions of dollars had been wasted on an information technology
system? Where was the comments about shame when that same auditor came
back and talked about almost a billion dollars of waste and
mismanagement? That money that could have been used to pay all of our
State employees more, certainly our teachers more. Where were the
comments then?
Many of you are still in this room. I heard you speak passionately
today. Where was the shame and where was the disgust with the waste of
money in this State government when you were in charge? We have a very
difficult situation to deal with here. And we're doing a very good job.
We need to thank our teachers and stop this rhetoric to make them fear.
Does anybody really think that I came down here and ran to this
legislature so I could harm teachers? Does anybody really think that I
came down to this legislature so we couldn't take care of the people who
are helpless that need the State's help? That's absurd. And it's
insulting to think that people would believe that the motivation of
anybody in this Chamber, whether you're a Republican or Democrat, would
be that. This is about a different means to the same ends.</p>

What I do know is the prior means didn't work. Hundreds of millions of
dollars billions of dollars documented, wasted. At the expense of people
who need support. Hundreds of millions of dollars wasted at the expense
of teacher pay raises . let's get serious about his and let's let people
assume responsibility for the mess we are cleaning up. We have a good
budget here we have a budget that none of us are completely satisfied
with. We had a budget where we were to compromise with the senate to get
this done, but at the end of the day this is a responsible budget. This
is a budget that continues; and by the way our tax plan that effectively
gave those teachers a pay cut in 2009 got a pay increase. When they go
file their taxes in april of next year they actually benefit from the
decisions that they have made that money is going back into the pockets
of the hardworking people across the socioeconomic spectrum. This
nonsense of saying the it is a tax break for the rich  is disingenuous
at best and dishonest at worst. We'se done a good job with tax reform we
have done a good job with budget we have made the difficult decisions we
have had to make and we need to move on. And if we want to continue to
have the argument of the disservice to the teachers then we have to go
back and revisit decision the have been made in this body that have been
made in this legislature since I have been a member in 2007. And I can
tell you that's not a pretty picture. we are putting this state on the
right track we are making difficult decisions but we are working to get
to the place where we can get every single state employee additional
money, every single teacher additional money. More classroom resources,
but first what we have to do is drain the swamp of bad decisions that
have been made in that direction for decades I hope you will support the
budget  SPEAKER CHANGES Representative Hall please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGES Speak on the conference report SPEAKER CHANGES The
Speaker has the floor. SPEAKER CHANGES Thank you Mr. Chairman and of
course I am speaking to the people of North Carolina obviously and as we
all would want to speak to the people of North Carolina. We all
campaigned on coming down here to do the right thing for the North
Carolina. And we all run campaigns and you know sometimes they say that
campaigning is continuous that you are always in the middle of the
campaign but something you can't escape is not what your motivation is
and what your intent is but at some point you become responsible for
what you do. You can't keep saying I am in charge but I am working on
someone elses problems. If you are in charge it's your problem. If you
are in charge it is your victory. I heard the speaker say it over a year
ago before a session started. The speaker said it is now our
responsibility. Now he said that before we came into session this year.
And so to continue to say I am looking in the rear view mirror bu I am
driving I am going forward. That won't still solve out problems going
forward. So I hope that you again you are going to have to carry this
budget out most of you are on the budget oversight committees will
receive the reports and make the decisions and help guide how it is
implemented but hopefully you will come off of the continuous campaign
and go ahead and assume responsibility for this budget you are going to
put in place. Yes I'll oppose it and as I said before. I know it is not
really the house budget I know it is not really What we sent over and I
am disappointed that it is not at least that, Especially for the people
of North Carolina. the whole question of motivation versus result. It is
nice to have good intentions but we have to live with the results of
this budget. And the result is that North Carolina is severely damaged
and I hope that you will keep that in mind, as you decide how do you
move North Carolina forward. Again I would ask again that you vote
against this conference report. This budget is not the best we could
have done for North Carolina. I chalenge you to do better and again I
ask that you vote against this conference report SPEAKER CHANGES The

Further because what did happen in the Senate, they had a separate drug
testing bill and as we looked at that drug testing bill and our
judiciary committee we realized you can’t unilaterally test everyone you
have to have some reasonable suspicion. So in as much as they were

related to that but is developed by the Social Services Commission and
part of that includes the physical appearance of the person as they’re
with you. So those are the things under subsection G that are reasonable
suspicion. So it is clearly defined.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And the only people that are required for a drug test
is the people who are going under this work first program not just
unilaterally everybody that’s getting assistance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First to see if Representative Stevens would yield for
a question
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens does the lady yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I will
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker and Representative.
I’m trying to look at the text and I understand where you’ve put in the
provision that nothing in this section requires fingerprints to be taken
of every applicant for recipient of a program for public assistance
which I think is good. My question is, to clarify, as I still read the
document based on rules and regulations, if you’re requiring that there
be a criminal record check in section 1 in order to determine whether
someone’s the fleeing felon or the other status which essentially means
you’re requiring a record check on everyone because you don’t know
unless you have a specific reason to know this person. You generally
don’t know till you do the record check. The record check as I
understand it, depending on what record check you’re seeking, some would
not require you to have fingerprints at all other record checks would.
Does this bill still leave it now in a sense optional depending on what
record check is being sought that everyone could be fingerprinted? You
sort of have the option of the DSS or the state, how are we leaving it
because it seems to me still very much in doubt except that that is
discretionary now as opposed to mandatory but it could easily be made
mandatory.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Glazier. This was the request
of some of the specific departments of Social Services who would like
this option so that they could look, particularly if you’re in a border
county whether you’ve got someone that’s fleeing from Virginia,
Tennessee, South Carolina, the option to be able to request those
fingerprints. Most departments of Social Services don’t want it, did not
plan to use it, several people raised the very issue you did is why is
it even in there. But it’s because we are so close on some borders to be
able to check people who perhaps are fleeing felons and I can defer to
Representative Arp but I think he had that specific question in his
county of wanting to perhaps have access to the fingerprints. There is
money built into the budget to interface with the state system so they
can do a state record check at no cost.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I think on the basis of that answer
before I speak on the bill I probably want to follow up with a question
to Representative Arp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Arp does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and thank you Representative. I
think I understand based on what Representative Stevens said that some
counties may need and want to require fingerprinting of their applicants
in order to then run specific record checks. Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The department, the Social Service Commission will
develop rules and protocols to guide the counties in that respect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow up Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you Representative. So it
is possible based on the way this bill is set up and the rules that the
commission develops that counties either all or some could in fact be
requiring fingerprints of applicants. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me</p>

By reading what the federal rules, in anticipation, suggest. And you may
have read this as well. Have you read- [Speaker Changes}Probably, only
enough to be dangerous. [Speaker Changes] What is does is, the federal
rules say that we are proposing the primary responsibility for verifying
a fleeing felon arrest stat with the state agency and not the household.
So there is a verification duty incumbent upon the state and this is
what the federal rules suggest that says there are three basic ways a
state agency may become aware a households potential fleeing felon or
parole status. It says through a statement by the household, such is a
checking off of a block on an applicant is what we have, through data
match with the FBI’s database, NCIC, or another database of outstanding
arrest warrants. Well that database check is a fingerprint database
check. And so it anticipates that. And in the third thing, it says
through a law enforcement officer who specifically asks about a certain
person. The agency may become aware of that through the law enforcement
request. In our bill, in order to limit the costs into counties, what we
said is to the extent of available state resources, they’re required to
check that. That state database is what we control. It does not require
them to go beyond that. However what we have to understand is that not
all outstanding arrest warrants reside in our state databases. For
instance and a very instance that happened in our county, we had someone
from New York who was a convicted felon came down to North Carolina to
our county to seek aid.Those types are not necessarily caught is our
state warrant system. So the fingerprint check provides an additional
tool anticipated by the federal law to ascertain the status of this
because we are prohibited from giving out aid, regardless of whether
they are a fleeing felon from Tennessee or North Carolina. [Speaker
Changes] Thank you. Speaker of the bill ?? The gentlemen recognized to
debate the bill. Representative Floyd, please state your purpose. [
Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker inquired  a chair [Speaker Changes] ?? this
inquiry? [Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker, its 5 and you indicate we will
come back and complete the agenda. Can this be carried over to 5,
representative ?? the court. [Speaker Changes] I didn’t say a little
after 5, and we’re going to see if we can dispose of this cause I’m
afraid if we don’t we will revisit every comment that will be made two
hours from now. So if we can dispose of this it will be the preference
of the chair. [Speaker Changes] The gentlemen may state his inquiry
[Speaker Changes] Is the cue correct? [Speaker Changes]The cue is two
people wishing to speak on the bill. One has the floor at this time.
Representative Glazier, will recognize the debate of the bill or the
conference report. [Speaker Changes] Thank you. Mr. President.  I voted
for the original bill because I do believe that the narrow problem
attempting to be solved was the issue to comply with federal law of
looking at fleeing felons and people who are probation or parole
violators. Well we of course expanded in the conference report, not
based on what was done but what was based on; done in the senate to the
drug testing provisions. And my first objection to the bill, and I think
there was some really good work done on eliminating what were very, I
think questionable initial drug testing provisions. But we use a phrase
in here and I remember Representative ?? saying a month ago in a very
different context that words matter and in the law that we’re creating
they really do. And so we say in here the standard of which we are going
to test is reasonable suspicion. Well the problem with that for me is,
that isn’t why we read the law. The skinner opinion on drug testing says
reasonable articulable suspicion based on, normally based on probable
cause and a warrant. Now there is for those in the law a canyon of
difference between reasonable suspicion and probable cause would be
sufficient for a warrant. Those are not the same terms. They do not have
the same 4th amendment connotation. And I think there is a real
difference. Probable cause means probable cause to believe that this
person in front of</p>

<p id="240:00">
if it's an offender probable cause has committed the crime, enough that
I can get an indictment, and move that person to trial.  Reasonable
suspicion may be I'm unsure, they're casing a joint and I'm just not
sure, so the whole notion comes from we can make temporary detentions of
them for investigative purpose, but we have no basis to arrest them, or
move against them as probable cause would give us.  And so, it may seem
like it's a quivel over words, but I think it's a very big quivel,
because I think probable cause is the standard that meets the 4th
Amendment requirement here, and reasonable suspicion in and of itself
does not.  And for that reason on the drug testing, I will be voting no
because I think we are creating a unconstitutional standard that will be
struck down on that basis.  My reason for voting no though gets to the
finger prints.  Once again, I don't disagree that there's multiple ways
to finding someone who's a fleeing felon, or probation or parole
violator.  One way is clearly to know or have information that's been
given to you by a law enforcement officer.  Another is because someone
may actually check it off, and indicate, and that's great.  And other
ways may be investigations by the department, or it may be knowledge
within the department from this person previously having applied and
been found to be.  But when we say that one of the basis, just because
it's allowable in a federal reg. somewhere, someway, is that North
Carolina is now going to move to the potential in this bill, that we
would order through regulation or otherwise, on a county by county
basis, the finger printing of all applicants in order to catch the 1% or
less that are doing this, I suspect, but to catch that we're going to
finger print all applicants for these benefits, we move into a very
different era.  The only crime these people have mostly committed is
being poor, and they're seeking benefits, and some are doing it
illegally, and I agree.  The vast majority are not.  And we have never,
to my knowledge in this state, ever used the finger print process
outside the criminal justice process to finger print innocent people
across the board because we suspect a couple of them may be problematic.
 We have I think, when we pass this bill with that in place, move to an
entirely new era where the scourge of poverty takes on even a new
meaning.  It is hard enough, I think, with the stigma of losing your
job, and having to apply for government benefits, and standing in the
line, and knowing you can't provide for your family, but to then having
to go through the humiliation of having yourself finger printed like
your a common criminal, not that you've done anything wrong, but that
you're just applying for benefits because we think a small percentage we
need to catch, is going after a problem that needs a scalpel with a
sledge hammer.   Or as I said the other day, in this case, taking a
bazooka to a fist fight.  And, it is wrong for our citizens.  There are
so many people in this state suffering from the scourge of poverty that
we add to the humiliation in doing this.  I understand exactly what
Representative Arp is trying to get at, and I don't disagree, that's why
I voted for you bill initially, but this bill, as it's come back is now
going to create a burden on so many innocent people that there has got
to be a better way to do this, and save their dignity, and save, what I
believe, is the basic essential view of the state ought to do, which is
to alleviate human suffering where ever possible, and we will be
inflicting it with this.  Because I think that the costs out way the
benefits, I cannot vote for this bill.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To see if Representative Glazier would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Certainly, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Glazier, as an innocent citizen that I'm
sure you are, have you on occasion had to be finger printed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]In my life I have never had to be finger printed.  I
agreed to it one time, well I take that back.  I think the bar exam may
have been the only time that we had to do it.  But, let me respond to
this in a second way Representative Stevens, I did that, but I made the
choice, right?  The choice to enter that profession, and the choice
knowing that that was part of the application process to do it.  I
didn't have to become a lawyer</p>

People didn’t make a choice to be poor and they didn’t make a choice
that they needed the benefits; they have to do it to survive. There is a
difference between a lawyer who is about to become a practicing lawyer,
in some cases an unemployed one, doing it when they graduate law school
as part of their career path and someone walking in who has lost their
job, may be losing their children, and has certainly lost their dignity,
to have to say you are going to be fingerprinted, all of you. That’s
just very different.
