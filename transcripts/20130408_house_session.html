Speaker1: The House will come to order members please take your seats.
This is the right place to retire from the chamber. Members and visitors
in the gallery observe silence and please switch off your phones and
personal electronic devices. Now it’s time to close the doors. The
prayer will be offered by Representative Kelly Alexander. Members and
visitors in the gallery please stand and please remain standing for the
pledge of allegiance.
Speaker changes: I would like to preface the prayer this evening by a
brief passage from Abraham Lincoln’s first inaugural.”  We are not the
enemies, we must not be enemies, oppression may have strained it must
not break our bond of affection; that every heart beats to, be bowed as
I lift up. “This xx war era prayer continues to resonate today. “Mine
eyes have seen the glory of the coming of God. He is tramping out the
vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored. We have to lose the
faithful lightning of xx of his sword. Truth is marching on; I have seen
Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling hands , they have built Him
an altar in the evening  dos and dance.  I can read His righteous sense
that the dim  and flaring lamps, His day is marching on. He has sounded
forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat. He is sifting up the
hearts of men before His judgment seat. Oh! Be swift my son, to hold the
hands, and  be jubilant my feet ,our God is marching on. In the beauty
of the lilies Christ was born across the sea. The glory in His bosom
that transfigures you and me, as He died to make men holy, let us die to
make men free, while God is marching on.” Amen.[Pledge: ???]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill please sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is a bill that I have actually been working
on over the course of a couple years and we are back here with what we
believe is an improved product and one that merits your success in
voting for it. I want to acknowledge Representative Farmer-Butterfield
and this year Representative Martin in joining in helping us on this
bill and I’ll briefly just characterize a couple things that are in the
bill. One of the things that this does is assures the children in the
state who have a deaf or hard of hearing problem that a document that
has been developed for the purpose of trying to be sure all of their
special needs are met is actually used by the IEP teams when the
evaluation and the assessments are being done. That’s called a
communication plan worksheet and this bill very simply requires its use
and in connection with that assures that each individual student’s
particular means of communication will be taken into account and the
assessment and evaluation will be reviewed at least annually. Another
thing that it does in dealing with deaf and hard of hearing students
it’s especially important that highly qualified individuals are
available to assist in these assessments and meeting their particular
needs. And it takes into consideration as well and this is in subsection
3 of section 1 that we’re looking at both their academic and their
social skills. One of the great difficulties that some deaf and hard of
hearing students have is in developing, as you would expect their
communication and literacy skills. And those are very often best
developed or more highly developed in a social context. And so rather
than them being perhaps excluded or barely included in extracurricular
activities the concept is that in planning for the communications needs
of these students that those social skills and needs will be taken into
account as well as the academic. A final point that I’ll mention from
section 1 of the bill is that parents ought to be told that they have as
one option, and it’s simply one of several options, a residential school
placement. And if they choose to pursue that that a representative from
the residential schools will be given the opportunity to participate in
the IEP consideration for the student in helping to determining what the
proper placement is. Final thing I’ll say on the bill which I think is
important as well is that this will create a database in which the
Department of Health and Human Services which collects data on deaf and
hard of hearing students especially from birth until they enter into the
school system will be shared with the department of Public Instruction
so that we can have a better picture of how these student’s needs are
developing and being met and that ultimately our goal is to determine
how they are doing in becoming literate and acquiring the communications
skills that need to be successful adults. I was pleased that we appear
to have a unanimous support in the House Education Committee and I asked
the body to endorse that tonight by giving your support as well. Thank
you Mr. Speaker.

..providing that the State Board of Education may set standards for
educational children with disabilities that are higher those required by
IDEA and that's the Federal Individuals With Disabilities Act I-D-E-A.
This, in my opinion is a good deal in that its primary purpose is on
improving educational outcomes for children who have hearing impairments
or are deaf. And the bill outlines specifically as Representative
Blackwell has stated it tells specific strategies that the State Board
of Education has to use to ensure that the children's outcomes are
improved. The database that he talked about brought up some discussion
in the education committee in terms of security. So, committee workers
on this deal immediately found out that there is a family educational
rights and privacy act further which protects the confidentiality and
security of the database collection, so their information would be
protected and be private. Finally, we find that from 2005 to 2006 and
then 2010 to 2011, surveys of early intervention programs for children
who are deaf or hard of hearing indicated a great increase over the
years and children with hearing impairments and deaf are in all 100
counties right now except 4, so I think that's important to know. All
the stakeholders are supporting the bill and I ask for your support,
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Martin, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The latest right now is to debate the bill, the House
will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will say as a Freshman
legislature there's a lot of problems that we're facing that seem
overwhelming and there's not a good solution and I'm happy to say that
in this area, the problem is a little bit different in that we have
great resources in our residential schools. The people there have such
passion, such skill, and they're just not available to everyone right
now and the reason that they're not available is because of the
interpretation of the least restrictive environment. As you see in the
bill's summary that the least restrictive environment has been
interpreted that they should be in the public school system unless
they're failing. But for someone who is deaf of hard of hearing and
really just the truly deaf which is about 5% of that population of deaf
or hard of hearing, it's less restrictive for them to be in an
environment where they can communicate with other children and have
adult role models and they don't just have one interpreter who can help
them communicate maybe with a teacher, maybe with one student and maybe
they don't even get to talk to their parents when they get home. So this
just provides, empowers parents to make that choice for their student;
what is the least restrictive environment and the best education for
them. And another good thing it does is it gets our residential schools
which serve every county in the state out of ?? and as a support for all
of the deaf and hard of hearing willing to be that expert and to come in
and support the public schools in any way that they can. So I think that
it's an excellent bill, it's difficult, the data thing that they're deaf
doesn't identify how deaf they are if they're truly just hard of hearing
or if they're signing. So it's a real challenge and this will help with
literacy and communication. I commend the bill to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell, you may have covered this in

both, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If they are deaf and hard of hearing, it would apply
to all of them wherever they are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And it also, the goal is to make sure that the
students gain skills in reading as well as communicating either in
spoken language or in sign language. Is that the purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the answer is correct if I understood your
question. I'm not sure if the word reading is used in there but the
communication and literacy skills would certainly encompass that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And one follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You know, maybe this is almost more a comment. My
experience is that the parents of these children are very involved with
their education. And so, I don't see the family members mentioned in
here at all in any way that they would be members of the individual
education plan team.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you asking if the family members would be members
of the IEP Plan Committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think they are included in that. I'm not sure if
they're official members of the plan but the concept is that they</p>

would have a participation in that planning. I think the parent doesn't
have the ultimate choice of what is the proper location. I think IEP
plan folks in the local school would have the final decision. But the
idea is the parent would be fully informed and have an opportunity to
argue their case with those who are making the decision.

The general assembly of north carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jackson is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, this bill comes to us from indigent defense
services. It would simply amend the law to paying to docketing a
judgement against a person who is financially able to pay a portion of
his assigned counsel's fee. The bill would also require a court
appointed attorney to make a reasonable effort to provide a social
security number. Currently once they are appointed and go through the
court process they then submit a fee affidavit. If they don't have a
social security number, they can't get paid even though may not have any
way to contact the defendant after that ?? ?? .

Mr. Speaker.  Thank you for that question Representative Lewis.  I've
been asked all day long about my pants.  I didn't go to court today.
I'll let everybody know that. All the attorneys will be glad to hear
that.  But the most relevant comment that I got today was from a
representative who will remain unnamed today.  He told me that they were
very appropriate since I was going to the circus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, by prior notice the Chair indicated
that we would be adjourning by 7:45.  There are two bills left on the
calendar.  The Chair does not anticipate any lengthy debate.  We will
allow these bills to move if we can dispose of them over the next couple
of minutes.  House Bill 396 the clerk will read?  Chair needs to dispose
of this bill first.  Further discussion, further debate.  If not, the
question before the House is the passage of House Bill 388 on its third
reading.  All in favor say aye.  All opposed say no.  The ayes have it.
House Bill 388 has passed its third reading and will be sent to the
Senate.  This will be the final Bill on the calendar today.  House Bill
396, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? for House Bill 396.  The bill's been titled to act, to enact a
private well water education.  An Act at the request of the Department
of Environment and Natural Resources.  Gentleman Senator North Carolina
enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Katz, you have been recognized to activate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  This is a bill that will save lives.  It is a
dinger agency request bill from Secretary Scilvara.  It was very
thoughtful and I researched it very well.  And I think it is something
that we should all support.  It's an educational act to help citizens
understand water quality issues with their private drinking wells.
There are no mandatory requirements in this and there are no state
costs.  Unfortunately some of our citizens have contaminated drinking
wells and presently the Health Department testing does not necessarily
identify that problem.  This bill requires the state commission of
public health to prepare a program for local health departments to
educate well owners.  Specifically, it will make them aware of the
limitation of the testing that they do.  It will make them aware of
available options for other testing.  And it will make them aware of the
minimum safe drinking water standards in North Carolina.  I personally
know of children and families that have died in North Carolina from
drinking contaminated water.  This bill, this program well owners can
now make informed decisions to test their wells to make sure their
families are drinking clean and safe water.  This is a very thoughtful
bill and I appreciate Secretary Scilvara bringing it forward.  I urge
your support.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I feel
compelled to tell you today that I spent the entire weekend in a state
of anxiety. A week or two ago I read that the North Koreans, when they
want to do some provocative like fire missiles at the United States,
they try to do it on days of historic importance, anniversaries,
historical events. Well, apparently, Kim Jung Un, I think I pronounced
that right,  didn’t know that Saturday was Michael Wray’s birthday. We
escaped that, so I just want to wish him a happy birthday so let’s all
congratulate him.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I do want to bring everyone’s attention to the
fact that this is Holocaust Remembrance Day. A lot a years ago, the evil
empire, the real evil empire was overtaken and millions of people were
freed from one of the most horrible instance in all of human history. I
think, I’m just asking you, just give that some thought. I’ve had the, I
don’t want to call it pleasure, but let us say opportunity to visit
several of these death camps. One of which I visited less than 20 years
after the war. A sobering experience to put it mildly. But I do draw
your attention to this particular day. To this great suffering for this
terrible inhumanity to man. Unbelievable, unfathomable. It’s most
interesting that as we recall this victory over a most evil empire that
we also acknowledge the passing of one of the giants of the 20th century
who, herself, stood up to an evil empire, Lady Margaret Thatcher passed
away about 10:00 this morning London time after an extended illness and
several strokes. I had the great honor to once meet this incredible
woman and I commend her as well to your thoughts. I would like to close
with one of her quotes. You want something said, tell a man. You want
something done, tell a woman.

An exhibit card that favorable has the Anne Frank exhibit from the
holocaust museum in our town for the next 25 days. Add we have a number
of other memorials and programs going on to surround that. But I guess I
want to point out ?? there were 6 million Jews who died in the holocaust
but there were 12 million people who died. 6 million others were gypsy's
and Catholics, they were gay, or they were mentally inferred or mentally
retarded or thought to be. And because they were not like the people who
were executing them, they were executed. And so, I not only wanna
remember those, but I hope we also remember the 24 thousand people
around the world who have been designated as the righteous who were
people who were not of the Jewish faith who saved tens of thousands of
Jews from people exterminated. And those include a number of people in
the united states and from countries all through Europe. And so even
while the most horrible evil was trying to exterminate a people, and a
series of people, there were incredibly wonderful people who risk their
lives and in many cases lost their lives to help each other. And i guess
the saying that I would hope. A lot of time we say where was god when
all that was happening, but the real question is where was man? And in
the end I think, we hope none of us will ever be tormented, We hope none
of us will ever be the tormentor. But most important thing is never to
be indifferent thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pitman please
