the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests,
please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Letâ€™s pray. Thank you Lord for bringing us here today from even across
the state. As we close out this summer, we thank you for being an
abundant God. Even though we regard things in scarcity, you still
provide crops, you provide rain, and all the good things of life so that
we can move forward. Help us to see your abundance more clearly and live
the rest of this day in the recognition of that fullness of life. We
pray in the name of the one that was full of life, Jesus Christ. Amen.
